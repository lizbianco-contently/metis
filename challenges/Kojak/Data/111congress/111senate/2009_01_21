Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, yesterday--a historic day--we swore in a \nnew President who has the vigor and the vision to restore America's \nplace in the world. I think we would all agree that yesterday he made \nvery inspiring and bold statements about America and how we will invite \nthe world to join us in the efforts to restore our values, in a sense, \nto the center stage of that debate, but also to join in a renewed \neffort to find peace and end conflict. I thought his words, \nparticularly to the Muslim world, were very important. We hope, \nobviously, to be able to move on those initiatives as rapidly as \npossible. Already, the new administration is taking crucial, long-\nawaited steps to embark on a new era of moral leadership and global \noutreach.\n  It is an understatement to say these are challenging times. We are \nfighting two wars and the threat of terrorism, as we all know, is as \nstrong as ever. As the President said, we labor under gathering clouds \nand raging storms of the severest economic crisis of our lifetime. At \nsuch a moment, it is essential that we provide the President with the \ntools and the resources he needs to effect change. That starts by \nmaking sure he has the national security team he has chosen in place as \nsoon as possible. Even this afternoon, the President will follow \nthrough on promises he has made to sit down on day one with his \nnational security team, particularly with the military leadership, in \norder to talk about Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the wars we are \ninvolved in. That team includes Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State.\n  I think everyone can agree that at her confirmation hearing, \nSecretary-designate Hillary Clinton demonstrated an impressive grasp of \nthe numerous complex foreign policy issues we face and she demonstrated \nwhy she is going to make such an effective Secretary of State. She has \nthe stature to project America's leadership globally and to help build \nalliances at home and abroad. That is going to be vital to our success \nin the years ahead.\n\n  Now, I understand the concerns that were raised about fundraising \nactivities of the Clinton Foundation. Let me start by saying that \nSecretary-designate Clinton and former President Clinton have \nvoluntarily entered into an ethics review and disclosure process with \nrespect to donations to former President Clinton's foundation that goes \nwell beyond any requirements under the law or any applicable ethics \nregulations. This is an unprecedented situation none of us can contest, \nnor would we. There is no existing blueprint on which to draw here. \nSecretary-designate Clinton and former President Clinton have gone to \nconsiderable lengths to create a new review process tailored to these \nparticular circumstances.\n  Senator Lugar, myself, and others on the Foreign Relations Committee \nexpressed our own concerns about aspects of this new arrangement. We \nwent through a thorough review of the relevant agreements that Senator \nClinton and former President Clinton have entered into. We submitted \nnumerous questions for the record, and they were very direct and blunt \nquestions. We examined this issue extensively in the lead-up to Senator \nClinton's nomination hearing, and then again at the hearing itself. \nSenator Lugar at quite some length expressed why he saw some issues \nhere and expressed some concerns, but at the same time could not have \nbeen more clear about his support--enthusiastic support--for Senator \nClinton assuming these responsibilities. The conclusion we reached was \nwhatever the concerns some in this body may have--and we don't contest \nthe legitimacy of believing that, as Senator Lugar said, perhaps going \nfurther would have cleared some of the questions that still exist--but \nthat doesn't mean that on the other side there is an automatic--that \nthere is a problem. So in essence, none of these questions call into \nquestion at all Senator Clinton's fitness, readiness, and \nappropriateness in serving as Secretary of State. Senator Lugar, in his \nvery clearly stated view with respect to this issue, offered a series \nof well-thought-out additional proposals, and he made clear that \nnotwithstanding those proposals--which in his heart and in his mind he \nfelt would have simply made this much clearer--he nevertheless was \nclear about his intention, without those being put in place, that he \nfelt it was important that Senator Clinton be confirmed. It is \nnoteworthy that after a very lengthy discussion about review and \ndisclosure and after the full consideration by the committee itself, \nthe Foreign Relations Committee passed her nomination out and brought \nit here to the floor by a vote of 16 to 1.\n  Now, as we think about this issue, for anybody who is not yet decided \nabout what they may or may not do, context is very important. The \nClinton Foundation does extraordinary, worthwhile, lifesaving work in \nareas such as HIV/AIDS, global climate change, and economic development \nin some of the most impoverished corners of this planet. It is \nimportant to remember that the Clintons do not in any way personally \nbenefit financially from the actions of the foundation. So there is \nnone of the sort of traditional notion of financial conflict of \ninterest. It doesn't exist because there is no personal financial \ninterest by either of them. Moreover, according to Secretary-designate \nClinton, all donations to the Clinton Foundation, including donations \nto the Clinton Global Initiative, will be disclosed publicly. So \nnothing relevant to the measurement of a potential conflict is being \nwithheld from the public. Transparency is critically important here, \nobviously, because it allows the American people, the media, and those \nof us here in Congress with an oversight responsibility to be able to \njudge for ourselves that no conflicts, real or apparent, exist.\n  Senator Clinton was also very clear personally at the hearing and in \nher answers to the questions for the record in saying that she fully \nunderstands her obligation and her interest in avoiding any kind of \nunwelcome distraction. I take her at her word. I hope the rest of our \ncolleagues will do so also.\n  I understand that Senator Lugar and some others have requested that \nlarge donations from foreign entities ought to be disclosed more \nfrequently than the once-a-year requirement outlined in the agreement. \nI happen to agree that that would have been preferable, but the bottom \nline is that the desired deterrent effect still exists, and the bottom \nline is the public will still know, albeit in a different time frame, \nbut it will know what the situation is. Furthermore, all contributions \nby foreign governments will be subject to a review process by the State \nDepartment's ethics officials. This review will occur prior to the \nreceipt of any such contribution, and Senator Clinton has made it clear \nthat the process has been designed to avoid even the appearance of a \nconflict of interest. As all of us know, the appearance of a conflict \nunder the law is always as critical as the reality of a conflict. It \nstands at the same level of scrutiny and, therefore, I think her \nstatement is a very important one.\n  It is important to note that the pledges for future contributions by \nforeign governments will also be subject to this same review process. \nThat was an issue of particular interest to me and some other members \nof the committee, and I appreciate the willingness of Secretary-\ndesignate Clinton and the foundation to address the issues during the \ndiscussions we had over the memorandum of understanding leading up to \nthe hearing. Again, I and others preferred that those pledges might \nhave also been subject to disclosure requirements. Still, we take \ncomfort in the fact that they are going to be subject to the ethics \nreview process and subject also, frankly, to the stated interest \nSenator Clinton expressed before the committee of avoiding any kind of \nconflict or perception issue, and I am confident she is going to bend \nover backward to try to make sure that happens.\n\n  So, in the end, I fully respect the questions that have been raised. \nI acknowledge that some members of the committee felt that perhaps the \nfinal product could have expressed more, but the final product is not \ncontained entirely within the framework of the four corners of the \nagreement. It is contained in the framework of the hearings and it is \ncontained also in the expressions made publicly by Senator\n\n[[Page S675]]\n\nClinton about what she intends to do as a matter of personal oversight \nin this effort to live up to the standards that have been expressed.\n  So I am confident that significant and sufficient checks and balances \nexist and that we should proceed forward and overwhelmingly--I hope \nunanimously but certainly overwhelmingly--confirm Senator Clinton. She \nneeds to assume these responsibilities and begin serving the country as \nour Secretary of State. And while the Senate ponders the ethical \nimplications of Senator Clinton's charitable work and President \nClinton's charitable work, we need to remember that the world is moving \nat a fast pace. There isn't time to delay American engagement in \nongoing crises. Gaza is waiting, the Middle East is waiting, Pakistan, \nAfghanistan, and a host of other issues, and our Secretary of State \nneeds to be in place and empowered to engage in discussions that have \nbeen waiting all these months and weeks now, where President Obama has \nmade so clear that we only have one President at a time. Well, now we \nhave that President and that President needs and deserves his security \nteam.\n  So I hope my colleagues will join me in appreciating the larger \nimportance of this moment, put aside those concerns with an \nappropriate, obvious sort of further expression of them but move \nforward to allow President Obama and his Secretary of State to confront \nthe multiple crises and challenges that are going to be the measure of \nour achievement as a country and as a Senate and Congress over the \ncourse of the next few years.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I find I \nagree with virtually all of them, so I wish to make clear at the outset \nthat this is an opportunity for us, over the next few hours, to talk \nabout what ought to be our goal and that is to confirm a new Secretary \nof State who will be able to do the Nation's work and be able to avoid \nany perceived conflict of interest as a result of the fundraising by \nher husband's foundation.\n  I appreciate particularly the good-faith acknowledgement of the \nconcerns of the Senator from Massachusetts. They were also expressed by \nSenator Lugar. I think the concerns were acknowledged by both the \nClinton Foundation and by Senator Clinton herself in entering into a \nmemorandum of understanding with the transition team of the now \nPresident Obama administration.\n  I know we all realize this, but it is important to say again that \nyesterday was a historic day, with the inauguration of the 44th \nPresident of the United States. Among the many things President Obama \nsaid, and that I agree with, I was particularly glad to hear him say we \nshould do our business in the light of day because only then can we \nrestore the vital trust between the people and their Government. I am \nsomeone who has long believed that our Government is too opaque to most \nof the people we work for, and as an advocate of open government, I \nagree with him 1,000 percent. I pledge to him and to my colleagues \nacross the aisle that if there are things we can do, such as working \ntogether, as Senator Leahy and I have on Freedom of Information Act \nreform, to improve the openness and transparency of our Government, we \nought to be all about that. As we know, the foundation of our \nlegitimacy comes from the consent of the governed--the people of this \ncountry. If they do not know what their Government is doing or if \ncertain things are hidden from their view, they cannot consent, and \nthey operate in a less-than-legitimate way.\n  I wish President Obama and his administration well. His success will \nmean America's success. But if we are going to restore trust between \nthe American people and their Government, we need to be careful that \nthe reality matches the rhetoric. My concern is not whether our \ncolleague, Senator Clinton, is qualified to be Secretary of State--she \nis, and I intend to vote for her confirmation--but I believe it is very \nimportant to flesh out some of the concerns that have been raised, \nlegitimately, by Senator Kerry, Senator Lugar, and others that I think \nbear some public discussion and some debate in the Senate.\n  I argued to Senator Clinton yesterday--or I didn't argue to her, but \nI explained my position to her; that I thought greater transparency \nwould make it better for her as she enters this new job as Secretary of \nState because any cloud or question that remains because of the lack of \ntransparency or lack of disclosure I think hurts her and hurts the \nObama administration at a time when we want to see it succeed. Of \ncourse, the concern is that, as she explained to me, any rule we have \nshould not just apply to her and the former President, and I told her \nthat is fine with me; that we would be glad to work together to try to \ncome up with something that would make this kind of disclosure across \nthe board.\n  I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts, having a former \nPresident of the United States running a foundation such as this and to \nhave his spouse as Secretary of State is an unusual and perhaps \nunprecedented event, giving rise to these unusual and unprecedented \nconcerns. But many taxpayers make frequent disclosures to the \nGovernment on a monthly or quarterly basis. I don't see why the Clinton \nFoundation could not do so on a more frequent basis, as suggested by \nSenator Lugar, the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee. I \ndon't see any particular hardship for her--or, excuse me, for the \nfoundation--to do something that taxpayers are required to do \nregularly--file monthly or quarterly reports. And, of course, all of us \nwho run for office are familiar with the fact we have to file campaign \nfinance reports so the public can know who is contributing to our \ncampaigns and be attuned to any concerns that may arise.\n  I wish to be clear that my concerns are not with the charitable \nactivities of the Clinton Foundation, which I and others admire. But we \nshould not let our respect for Senator Clinton or our admiration for \nthe many good works of the Clinton Foundation blind us to the danger of \nperceived conflicts of interest caused by the solicitation of hundreds \nof millions of dollars from foreign and some domestic sources. The \nperception and reality must be that the office of the Secretary of \nState, as viewed around the world, is beyond reproach.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article from the New York Times, dated December 19, 2008, \nimmediately following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. The title of that article is: ``In Clinton List, a Veil \nIs Lifted on Foundation.''\n  As many of our colleagues know, when this memorandum of understanding \nwas entered into, for the first time the Clinton Foundation revealed \nthe source of its some $500 million worth of contributions over the \nlast 10 years. Many of them were unremarkable, but some of them were \ntroubling, raising the very issue we are discussing today--\ncontributions from foreign nations, for example, from the Kingdom of \nSaudi Arabia directly to the foundation. Clearly, Senator Clinton, as \nSecretary of State, as our chief diplomat, is going to be dealing with \nthe country and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of the Clinton Foundation's select foreign sources of \ncontributions following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, that list includes the State of Kuwait, \nthe State of Qatar, and various foreign individuals.\n  In the article I mentioned a moment ago from the New York Times, \nthere is just one example of the perception of conflict of interest \nthat I think ought to give all of us concern. Last year, in the last \nCongress, we voted to support a civilian nuclear technology arrangement \nwith the country of India, and I voted for it. But one of the problems, \nfor example, is that one of the individuals who was lobbying for that \nwas a politician in India who gave between $1\n\n[[Page S676]]\n\nmillion and $5 million to the foundation. That individual was actually \nlobbying Congress to pass that very same bill at the same time he is \nmaking a significant contribution to the foundation.\n\n  Now, I am not suggesting anything untoward or improper about that, \nbut I am pointing out the very real example of a perception of conflict \nof interest, which is something that I think we all would hope to \navoid.\n  There is also a list of other contributors, domestic contributors, \nincluding some of the financial services industry on Wall Street, which \nhas been the beneficiary of various Government bailouts during the \ncourse of the last few months during the economic crisis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthat list at the end of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, Senator Lugar, who is admired by all of us \nfor his knowledge and experience on the Foreign Relations Committee, \nexplained the likelihood of a conflict of interest. He said that the \nClinton Foundation exists as a temptation to any foreign entity or \ngovernment that believes it can curry favor through a donation, and \nobviously that creates a potential perception problem with any action \ntaken by the Secretary of State in relation to foreign givers of their \ncountry. I share Senator Lugar's concerns, as I have explained here. I \nconcur with his commonsense solution that during Senator Clinton's \ntenure as Secretary of State, the foundation should actually refuse all \ncontributions from foreign sources. That would take care of that \nparticular problem outright.\n  Senator Kerry, as he said in those hearings and reiterated today, \npointed out that Senator Lugar wasn't speaking from a partisan \nperspective, he was speaking for the committee. In other words, this is \nnot a partisan matter. This is a matter of serious concern regarding \npublic policy. It is a matter of record that, as I said, the transition \nteam, Senator Clinton, and the foundation agreed to a memorandum of \nunderstanding. Of course, this does not require disclosure of past \ncontributions with any sort of real detail, which would be helpful to \nthe observer. It does require annual disclosure, and I think that was a \nvery positive step in the right direction. But simply stated, the \nfundraising restrictions of disclosure statements I don't think go far \nenough. It is in the Nation's interest for the Clinton Foundation to \nrefuse foreign-sourced donations while Senator Clinton serves as \nSecretary of State.\n  If the foundation refuses to do so--and I realize Senator Clinton has \nlimited control, if any, over what the foundation does--I think there \nshould be other options available that would reduce the likelihood of \nreal or perceived conflicts of interest. Senator Lugar himself has \nrecommended several disclosure requirements. For example, he suggested \nthat gifts of $50,000 or more to the Clinton Foundation from any \nforeign source, including individuals, should be submitted to the \nagreed-upon State Department ethics review process.\n  I would alert my colleagues to the fact that the agreement between \nthe Obama team and the foundation only commits the foundation to submit \nfor State Department review those gifts from foreign governments and \ngovernment-controlled entities. As Senator Lugar aptly pointed out, in \nmany foreign countries the tie between the government and private \ncitizens is blurred. Individuals with close connections to the \ngovernment or governing families often act as surrogates for those \ngovernments. Consequently, contributions from foreign governments or \nforeign-controlled companies are not the only foreign contributions \nthat could raise serious conflicts of interest.\n  I would go further and require that every pledge or donation be made \npublicly available online within a short time--perhaps a week. If we \ndid it on a monthly basis, that would be far better than what the MOU \ncurrently provides.\n  The foundation's agreement to make disclosures once a year is simply \nnot enough in order to achieve that kind of transparency President \nObama talked about yesterday that will help give the American people \nmore confidence in their Government. That is not doing business in the \nlight of day in a way that restores that vital trust, to do it only \nannually, after the fact. This is only one example of some of the \nimprovements that could be made.\n  In short, I remain concerned that Senator--soon to be Secretary of \nState--Clinton's diplomatic work will be encumbered by the global \nactivities of the Clinton Foundation under these circumstances--not \ntheir good and charitable work, which I certainly support, but the \ncontributions they raise from these various sources that are not \ntransparent, not subject to prompt disclosure. Obviously, I think it is \nimportant that the Senate discuss and debate this in the context of her \nnomination, not wait until the inevitable conflict or crisis arises.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a New York Times editorial, a Washington Post editorial, and a \nLos Angeles Times editorial, which identify some of these same \nconcerns, at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. In short, I was encouraged by my conversation with \nSenator Clinton yesterday in the Rotunda following the inaugural \nceremonies where she said she would be open to a requirement that \nreally was an across-the-board disclosure requirement that was not just \ntargeted at her and the Clinton Foundation. I think there is a \nmeaningful basis upon which to further discuss this, negotiate it, and \nit would be my intention, working with other colleagues here, to \nproduce legislation, as we flesh that out, which might accomplish that \nin the days ahead.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 19, 2008]\n\n            In Clinton List, a Veil Is Lifted on Foundation\n\n                  (By Peter Baker and Charlie Savage)\n\n       Washington.--Former President Bill Clinton has collected \n     tens of millions of dollars for his foundation over the last \n     10 years from governments in the Middle Fast, tycoons from \n     Canada, India, Nigeria and Ukraine, and other international \n     figures with interests in American foreign policy.\n       Lifting a longstanding cloak of secrecy, Mr. Clinton on \n     Thursday released a complete list of more than 200,000 donors \n     to his foundation as part of an agreement to douse concerns \n     about potential conflicts if Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton \n     is confirmed as secretary of state in the Obama \n     administration.\n       The donor list offers a glimpse into the high-powered, big-\n     dollar world in which Mr. Clinton has traveled since leaving \n     the White House as he jetted around the globe making money \n     for himself and raising vast sums for his ambitious \n     philanthropic programs fighting disease, poverty and climate \n     change. Some of the world's richest people and most famous \n     celebrities handed over large checks to finance his \n     presidential library and charitable activities.\n       With his wife now poised to take over as America's top \n     diplomat, Mr. Clinton's fund-raising is coming under new \n     scrutiny for relationships that could pose potential \n     conflict-of-interest issues for Mrs. Clinton in her job. Some \n     of her husband's biggest backers have much at stake in the \n     policies that President-elect Barack Obama's incoming \n     administration adopts toward their regions or business \n     ventures.\n       Saudi Arabia alone gave to the foundation $10 million to \n     $25 million, as did government aid agencies in Australia and \n     the Dominican Republic. Brunei, Kuwait, Norway, Oman, Qatar \n     and Taiwan each gave more than $1 million. So did the ruling \n     family of Abu Dhabi and the Dubai Foundation, both based in \n     the United Arab Emirates, and the Friends of Saudi Arabia, \n     founded by a Saudi prince.\n       Also among the largest donors were a businessman who was \n     close to the onetime military ruler of Nigeria, a Ukrainian \n     tycoon who was son-in-law of that former Soviet republic's \n     authoritarian president and a Canadian mining executive who \n     took Mr. Clinton to Kazakhstan while trying to win lucrative \n     uranium contracts.\n       In addition, the foundation accepted sizable contributions \n     from several prominent figures from India, like a billionaire \n     steel magnate and a politician who lobbied Mrs. Clinton this \n     year on behalf of a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement \n     between India and the United States, a deal that has rankled \n     Pakistan, a key foreign policy focus of the incoming \n     administration.\n       Such contributions could provoke suspicion at home and \n     abroad among those wondering about any effect on \n     administration policy.\n       Matthew Levitt, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute \n     for Near East Policy, said donations from ``countries where \n     we have particularly sensitive issues and relations'' would \n     invariably raise concerns about\n\n[[Page S677]]\n\n     whether Mrs. Clinton had conflicts of interest.\n       ``The real question,'' Mr. Levitt said, ``is to what extent \n     you can really separate the activities and influence of any \n     husband and wife, and certainly a husband and wife team that \n     is such a powerhouse.''\n       Mr. Clinton's office said in a statement that the \n     disclosure itself should ensure that there would be ``not \n     even the appearance of a conflict of interest.''\n       Stephanie Cutter, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said the \n     president-elect had chosen Mrs. Clinton for his cabinet \n     because ``no one could better represent the United States.''\n       ``Past donations to the Clinton foundation,'' Ms. Cutter \n     said, ``have no connection to Senator Clinton's prospective \n     tenure as secretary of state.''\n       Repuclians have addressed the issue cautiously, suggesting \n     that they would examine it but not necessarily hold up Mrs. \n     Clinton's confirmation as a result. Senator Richard G. Lugar \n     of Indiana, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations \n     Committee, which will consider her nomination, was in Russia \n     on Thursday and unavailable for comment, according to Mr. \n     Lugar's office.\n       But in an interview on Nov. 30 on ``This Week'' on ABC, Mr. \n     Lugar said Mr. Clinton's activities would raise legitimate \n     questions, adding, ``I don't know how, given all of our \n     ethics standards now, anyone quite measures up to this who \n     has such cosmic ties.''\n       Still, he indicated that he would vote for Mrs. Clinton and \n     praised Mr. Obama's team for doing ``a good job in trying to \n     pin down the most important elements'' in its agreement with \n     Mr. Clinton.\n       To avoid potential conflicts, the Obama team, represented \n     by its transition co-chairwoman, Valerie Jarrett, signed a \n     memorandum of understanding on Dec. 12 with the William J. \n     Clinton Foundation, represented by its chief executive, Bruce \n     R. Lindsey. The five-page memorandum, provided to reporters \n     on Thursday, required Mr. Clinton to disclose his past donors \n     by the end of the year and any future contributors once a \n     year.\n       The memorandum also requires that if Mrs. Clinton is \n     confirmed, the Clinton Global Initiative, an offshoot of the \n     foundation, will be incorporated separately, will no longer \n     hold events outside the United States and will refuse any \n     further contributions from foreign governments. Other \n     initiatives operating under the auspices of the foundation \n     would follow new rules and consult with State Department \n     ethics officials in certain circumstances.\n       Federal law does not require former presidents to reveal \n     foundation donors, and Mr. Clinton had until now declined to \n     do so, arguing that many who gave expected confidentiality. \n     Other former presidents have taken money from overseas \n     sources, including President George Bush, whose son has sat \n     in the Oval Office for the last years. The elder Mr. Bush has \n     accepted millions of dollars from Saudi, Kuwaiti and other \n     foreign sources for his own library.\n       Mr. Clinton's foundation has raised $500 million since \n     1997, growing into a global operation with 1,100 paid staff \n     members and volunteers in 40 countries. It said it had \n     provided medicine to 1.4 million people living with H.I.V./\n     AIDS, helped dozens of cities reduce heat-trapping gases and \n     worked to spread economic opportunity.\n       Mr. Clinton's advocates said that the disclosure on \n     Thursday showed he had nothing to hide and that most of his \n     largest contributors were already known.\n       Yet while unprecedented, the disclosure was also limited.\n       The list posted on the foundation's Web site--\n     www.clintonfoundation.org--did not provide the nationality or \n     occupation of the donors, the dates they contributed or the \n     precise amounts of their gifts, instead breaking down \n     contributors by dollar ranges. Nor did the list include \n     pledges for future donations. As a result, it is impossible \n     to know from the list which donations were made while Mr. \n     Clinton was still president or while Mrs. Clinton was running \n     for president.\n       Many benefactors are well-known Americans, like Stephen L. \n     Bing; Alfonso Fanjul; Bill Gates; Tom Golisano, a billionaire \n     who ran for New York governor; Rupert Murdoch; and Barbra \n     Streisand. Bloomberg L.P., the financial media empire founded \n     by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, contributed, as \n     did Freddie Mac, the mortgage company now partly blamed for \n     the housing market collapse.\n       Another potentially sensitive donation came from Blackwater \n     Training Center, part of the private security firm hired to \n     protect American diplomats in Iraq. Five of its guards have \n     been indicted for their roles in a 2007 shooting that left 17 \n     Iraqi civilians dead.\n       The potential for appearances of conflict was illustrated \n     by Amar Singh, a politician in India who gave $1 million to \n     $5 million. Mr. Singh visited the United States in September \n     to lobby for a deal allowing India to obtain civilian nuclear \n     technology even though it never signed the Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty. He met with Mrs. Clinton, who he said assured him \n     that Democrats would not block the deal. Congress approved it \n     weeks later.\n       Other donors have connections with India, a potential \n     flashpoint because of tensions with Pakistan. Among them was \n     Lakshmi Mittal, a steel magnate and, according to Forbes \n     magazine, the fourth-richest person in the world. Mr. Mittal, \n     who donated $1 million to $5 million, was involved in a \n     scandal in 2002 in London, where he lives. After Mr. Mittal \n     made a large donation to the Labor Party, Prime Minister Tony \n     Blair helped him persuade Romania to sell him its state steel \n     company.\n       Another donor was Gilbert Chagoury, a businessman close to \n     Gen. Sani Abacha of Nigeria, widely criticized for a brutal \n     and corrupt rule.\n       Mr. Chagoury tried during the 1990s to win favor for Mr. \n     Abacha from the Clinton administration, contributing $460,000 \n     to a voter registration group to which Democratic officials \n     steered him, according to news accounts. He won meetings with \n     National Security Council officials, including Susan E. Rice, \n     who is now Mr. Obama's choice to be ambassador to the United \n     Nations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n               CLINTON FOUNDATION--SELECT FOREIGN SOURCES\n\n       $10M-25M: Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n       $5M-10M: Government of Norway.\n       $1M-5M: Sheikh Mohammed H.

It should address the awkward intersection \n     between Mrs. Clinton's new post and the charitable and \n     business activities of her husband, former President Bill \n     Clinton.\n       Last month, Mr. Clinton disclosed the names of more than \n     200,000 donors to his foundation. It was a positive step \n     toward the transparency that Mr. Obama insisted on before \n     selecting Mrs. Clinton. But it also reinforced concerns about \n     potential conflicts of interest ahead.\n       The roster of donors to Mr. Clinton's presidential library \n     and global foundation enterprises include million-dollar-plus \n     contributions from governments in the Middle East, tycoons \n     from India, Nigeria, Ukraine and Canada, and international \n     figures with interests in the policies Mrs. Clinton will be \n     helping to write and carry out.\n       The five-page accord signed by representatives of Mr. \n     Clinton and Mr. Obama could use tightening. For example, the \n     wording calls for disclosure of ``new contributors'' to \n     Clinton Foundation programs. It does not necessarily require \n     disclosing the size of their gifts or the dates they were \n     made. Disclosure of Mr. Clinton's charitable fund-raising and \n     relevant private fees should be done monthly, or at least \n     quarterly, not just once a year.\n       The overarching principle should be prompt disclosure of \n     the amount and source of all payments to any Clinton charity \n     or to Mr. Clinton personally by any person or entity with a \n     political or economic interest, real\n\n[[Page S678]]\n\n     or perceived, in State Department decisions. Ideally, the \n     White House counsel's office would be assigned a larger role \n     than envisioned in screening Mr. Clinton's speaking and \n     consulting deals before any check is received.\n       Mr. Clinton has agreed to reduce his fund-raising and \n     administrative role in the Clinton Global Initiative. The \n     international project will no longer accept contributions \n     from foreign governments or hold big events outside the \n     United States once Mrs. Clinton is installed. These are \n     prudent moves. The committee must decide if they are \n     sufficient, given Mr. Clinton's continuing ties.\n       During her confirmation hearing, Mrs. Clinton must make it \n     emphatically clear that past and future supporters of her \n     husband or his work will not get favored treatment by the \n     State Department. Avoiding the appearance of favoritism will \n     be as important as the fact.\n       We believe that Mrs. Clinton has the potential to be a \n     superb secretary of state. We also value Mr. Clinton's work \n     since leaving the White House to help advance the fight \n     against AIDS, malaria, malnutrition and other global ills. He \n     has agreed to greater transparency and more restrictions than \n     any former president, going beyond what law requires. That \n     does not alter the committee's duty to scour the plans for \n     workability and loopholes.\n       Everyone should recognize that there is no perfect solution \n     for Mrs. Clinton's particular spousal dilemma. And, \n     realistically, no set of rules, however well-meaning or \n     tightly drafted, can substitute for the exercise of sound \n     judgment and proper restraint. But they can help.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 9, 2009]\n\n    Quid Pro Clinton?--Potential Conflicts of Interest Could Haunt \n                         President-Elect Obama\n\n       In a letter to the editor Tuesday, Bruce Lindsey, chairman \n     and chief executive of the William J. Clinton Foundation, \n     took us to task for an editorial last month suggesting that \n     former president Bill Clinton suspend fundraising for his \n     foundation upon the confirmation and during the tenure of his \n     wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY)), as secretary of \n     state. Mr. Lindsey called our suggestion ``shortsighted and \n     dangerous.'' But not to see the appearance of a conflict of \n     interest is shortsighted and potentially dangerous for one \n     person who has enough to worry about: President-elect Barack \n     Obama.\n       The good works of Mr. Clinton or his foundation are not in \n     question. His work to lessen or eliminate the suffering \n     brought about by HIV/AIDS and to address the challenges \n     presented by climate change is impressive. So is his ability \n     to raise vast sums for his foundation to tackle these issues. \n     The money comes from sources in the United States and abroad. \n     What has always been worrisome is that such prodigious \n     fundraising could set up the potential of someone looking to \n     curry favor with Ms. Clinton by making a sizable donation to \n     Mr. Clinton's organization. Even the appearance of a conflict \n     could call into question the motives of both Clintons and the \n     donor.\n       A prime example emerged this week as a result of Mr. \n     Clinton disclosing his contributors as part of an agreement \n     with Mr. Obama that smoothed Ms. Clinton's nomination. The \n     New York Times reported Sunday that upstate New York \n     developer Robert J. Congel gave $100,000 to Mr. Clinton's \n     foundation in November 2004, one month after enactment of a \n     law, first supported by Ms. Clinton in 2000, that gave Mr. \n     Congel access to tax-exempt ``green bonds'' to build the \n     Destiny USA shopping complex in Syracuse. Nine months later \n     Ms. Clinton secured $5 million in funding for road \n     construction at the complex. We hasten to point out that Ms. \n     Clinton was joined by other members of the New York \n     delegation in urging passage of both bills, including the \n     state's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer (D).\n       While Mr. Clinton's fundraising has been an appearance of a \n     conflict waiting to happen with his wife a senator, it will \n     only get worse and more troublesome once Ms. Clinton is \n     confirmed as secretary of state. Per the agreement with Mr. \n     Obama, a list of who is bankrolling the foundation will be \n     released once a year. Only new donations from foreign \n     governments will be examined by government ethics officials. \n     And there is no prior review of donations from foreign \n     companies or individuals or those in the United States with \n     interests overseas. Mr. Clinton's continued globetrotting \n     while collecting checks along the way could embarrass the \n     administration on multiple, sensitive and dangerous fronts.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Jan. 14, 2009]\n\n     The Clinton Connections--The Former President Should Keep His \n    Foundation at Arm's Length While His Wife Holds a Cabinet Post.\n\n       Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose confirmation as secretary of \n     State is a foregone conclusion after a three-hour love-fest \n     of a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on \n     Tuesday, will probably do a fine job in the post--as long as \n     her husband can keep his wallet zipped.\n       Former President Clinton's charitable foundation has the \n     potential to haunt both his wife and the Obama \n     administration, and not just because it has a history of \n     accepting donations from tyrants and corrupt businessmen. \n     Foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia, Australia, the \n     Dominican Republic and Kuwait, have given millions to the \n     Clinton Foundation, which might complicate Hillary Clinton's \n     dealings with those countries--and could lead to a \n     perception, justified or not, that one way to influence U.S. \n     policy is to slip a few bucks to the secretary of States \n     husband's charity. Given the importance of perception in \n     international relations, that's no small concern.\n       Bill Clinton has a troubling history of doing favors for \n     his political donors, and although his charity's work is \n     beyond reproach--it has contributed millions to fighting AIDS \n     and climate change around the world--the foundation's \n     connection to enterprises that personally enrich both \n     Clintons is murky. Many of its donors also have paid hundreds \n     of thousands of dollars in speaking fees to the former \n     president. Then there are highly questionable donations, such \n     as the $500,000 he was paid by a Japanese American business \n     for a speech he never gave, and that he later donated to the \n     foundation, as reported in Tuesday's Times by Andrew Zajac.\n       The Obama administration struck a deal with the foundation \n     aimed at improving transparency and avoiding conflicts, but \n     it doesn't go far enough. Though the names of future donors \n     will be released, it will be on an annual basis, and foreign \n     govemments will be subject to review by federal ethics \n     officers only if they're new donors.\n       The best way out of this mess would be for Bill Clinton to \n     divorce himself from all of his foundation's fundraising \n     activities for as long as Hillary Clinton is secretary of \n     State; he can consider it partial atonement to his long-\n     suffering wife. If he won't, the foundation should at least \n     reveal its donors in real time, as the contributions are \n     received, and should follow a suggestion made Tuesday by Sen. \n     Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) and forswear new foreign \n     contributions. That won't end potential conflicts from U.S.-\n     based donors with international interests, but it's a start.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I see there are other colleagues here who wish to speak. \nI yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida and then, after that, if I may yield to the Senator from \nArizona and the Senator from Maine for comments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, there is an example of another \none of our Senators in this body who is now assuming a very high and \nimportant position in the Government. The President and the Vice \nPresident have sprung forth from this Chamber. How honored we are, it \nhaving just been announced that Senator Salazar has resigned since he \nhas been confirmed as Secretary of the Interior.\n  The issue before us is Senator Clinton. The Senator from Texas has \nlaid out his concerns and has said he finds the arrangement unusual. I \nappreciate his remarks. He has noted the good works of the Clinton \nFoundation. This Senator would think this arrangement is unusually \ngood--for reasons. What has the Clinton Foundation done? It is not as \nif the spouse of a high-level new Secretary of State is in a foundation \nor a corporation of some nefarious kind of activity. Indeed, this is \nthe kind of activity, as noted by the Senator from Texas, that is \nextraordinarily good.\n  For example, the Clinton Foundation has helped millions of people \naround the world. Mr. President, 1.4 million people living with HIV/\nAIDS now have access to lifesaving drugs. Because of this foundation's \nefforts and the former President's efforts to lower the cost of those \nantiretroviral drugs, 71 countries have access to these lifesaving \nmedicines, which represents more than 92 percent of the people living \non this planet with HIV.\n  I will give another example: 425,000 Rwandans are served by four \nhealth facilities that have been strengthened by the Clinton \nFoundation.\n  Because of these efforts, they have increased countries' human \nresource capacity to deliver care and treatment to their people, and it \nhas helped prevent the transmission of disease from mothers to their \nchildren.\n  Take for example the Clinton Climate Initiative. It is working with \n40 of the world's largest cities, both in the United States and around \nthe globe, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat global \nwarming--something in which the next speaker, the Senator from Arizona, \nhas been so intimately involved. These Clinton programs are\n\n[[Page S679]]\n\nfostering sustainable development in Africa and Latin America.\n  As Americans, we can clearly applaud the efforts of the former \nPresident and his exceptional humanitarian work he has accomplished \nover the years that he has been a private citizen and that he has \nworked on through the Clinton Foundation.\n  We were reminded yesterday, with the inaugural celebration and the \ninaugural activities, of the importance of getting the national \nsecurity team in place and getting it in place fast. The President laid \nout the imminent crises he is having to face. We need a Secretary of \nState in place. Senator Clinton's integrity and her record of service \nare clear. We should not delay any longer, and we ought to confirm her \nquickly to be our next Secretary of State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, before I yield to the Senator from Arizona, \nMr. Lugar, who would normally be here as the ranking member, the \ndistinguished ranking member, who is one of our most respected voices \non foreign policy, is not feeling well, so he is not here right now. \nBut he has asked me to personally make sure his comments are printed in \nthe Record in full. I wish to share just 30 seconds here. He says:\n\n       In my judgment she is an extremely well qualified nominee \n     who is deserving of confirmation. Her presence at the helm of \n     the State Department could open unique opportunities for U.S. \n     diplomacy and could bolster efforts to improve foreign \n     attitudes toward the United States.\n\n  He goes on to talk about her relationship with world leaders at the \ntime and her understanding of U.S. foreign policy.\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the nomination \nof Senator Hillary Clinton to be Secretary of State. In my judgment she \nis an extremely well qualified nominee who is deserving of \nconfirmation. Her presence at the helm of the State Department could \nopen unique opportunities for U.S. diplomacy and could bolster efforts \nto improve foreign attitudes toward the United States. She has \nlongstanding relationships with many world leaders that could be put to \ngreat use in the service of our country. Her time in the Senate has \ngiven her a deep understanding of how U.S. foreign policy can be \nenriched by establishing a closer relationship between the executive \nand legislative branches. She is fully prepared to engage the world on \na myriad of issues that urgently require attention.\n  Given Senator Clinton's remarkable qualifications, President Obama's \nstrong confidence in her, and pressing global issues, which I do not \nneed to enumerate, I favored having our friend confirmed yesterday by \nunanimous consent. Relevant points of concern about conflicts of \ninterest arising from the fundraising of the Clinton Foundation were \nmade during her confirmation hearing. In my judgment, only Senator \nClinton and President Clinton, themselves, have the ability to avoid \nthese problems. At the hearing, I strongly urged Senator Clinton to \nensure that no conflict of interest problems arise. She stated that she \nwould do so, and I am confident that she understands the importance of \nthis commitment.\n  Nevertheless, I recognize that some colleagues who do not serve on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee shared similar concerns about the \npotential for conflicts of interest. They wanted an opportunity to \ndiscuss these concerns, and the Senate gives them that right. The \nForeign Relations Committee and the Senate have oversight \nresponsibility over anything that might add or detract from U.S. \nforeign policy. The Obama Transition and Senator Clinton implicitly \nrecognized this Senate responsibility when they forwarded their \nmemorandum of understanding addressing Clinton Foundation activities to \nthe Foreign Relations Committee for its review.\n  I understand that the Clinton's are proud of the Clinton Foundation, \nand I applaud the work it has done. I also understand that the \nfoundation is devoted to many ongoing projects and beneficiaries. \nPresident Clinton has given a great deal of time and energy to this \nenterprise, and he and other leaders of the foundation are reluctant to \naccept changes or restrictions that they perceive as potentially \ninhibiting its momentum.\n  But this understandable concern for the work of the foundation does \nnot trump the vital business of U.S. foreign policy that will be \ndirected by Senator Clinton. The work of the Clinton Foundation is a \nunique complication for Senator Clinton's service that will have to be \nmanaged with great care and transparency.\n  The point I attempted to make during the hearing and in other \ncommunications leading up to the hearing was that the Clinton \nFoundation exists as a temptation for any foreign entity or government \nthat believes it could curry favor through a donation. As such, it sets \nup potential perception problems with any action taken by the Secretary \nof State in relation to foreign givers or their countries. There need \nbe no wrongdoing on the part of anyone to generate controversy or \nmisperceptions. Every new foreign donation that is accepted by the \nfoundation comes with the risk that it will be connected in the global \nmedia to a proximate State Department policy or decision. Foreign \nperceptions are incredibly important to U.S. foreign policy, and \nmistaken impressions or suspicions can deeply affect the actions of \nforeign governments toward the United States. Moreover, we do not want \nour own Government's deliberations distracted by avoidable \ncontroversies played out in the media. The bottom line is that even \nwell intentioned foreign donations carry risks for U.S. foreign policy.\n  At the hearing, I recommended that the only certain way to eliminate \nthis risk would be for the Clinton Foundation to forswear new foreign \ncontributions and rely on its large base of U.S. donors during Senator \nClinton's time as Secretary of State.\n  Alternatively, I suggested that the Clinton Foundation could enhance \npublic confidence and minimize risks of conflict of interest with a few \nadditional transparency commitments, none of which would threaten the \noperations of the Clinton Foundation. Inconveniences for the foundation \nor a reduction in some types of donations that have been accepted in \nthe past are small prices to pay when balanced against the serious \nbusiness of U.S. foreign policy that affects the security of every \nAmerican. If there is the slightest doubt about the appearance that a \ndonation might create, the foundation should not take it. If there are \nissues about how a donation should be disclosed, the issues should be \nresolved by disclosing the donation sooner and with as much specificity \nas possible.\n  In particular, I suggested three additional commitments that the \nClinton Foundation could make in the interest of transparency. First, \nall donations of $50,000 or more in a given year from any source should \nbe disclosed immediately upon receipt, rather than waiting up to 12 \nmonths to list them in the annual disclosure. Second, pledges from \nforeign entities to donate more than $50,000 in the future should be \ndisclosed both at the time the pledge is made and when the donation \neventually occurs. Third, gifts of $50,000 or more from any foreign \nsource, including individuals, should be submitted to the State \nDepartment ethics official for the same ethics review that will be \napplied to donations from foreign governments. This is especially \nimportant because the lines between foreign governments and foreign \nindividuals are often blurred. For example, conflicts of interest could \narise from a donation from a Gazprom executive or a member of the Saudi \nRoyal family as easily as from the governments of Russia and Saudi \nArabia.\n  Since the inception of the Clinton Foundation in 1997, 499 donors \nhave given $50,000 or more, an average of less than one per week. So \nthe administrative burden of these additional transparency commitments \nwould be minimal. But adopting them would yield substantial \ntransparency benefits with regard to the donations that are most likely \nto raise issues.\n  In answers to questions for the record, Senator Clinton offered no \nreasons why these additional disclosure items would not be beneficial. \nInstead, answers stated that the MOU went beyond what other spouses of \ncabinet officials have done to limit their Foundations and that there \nis no law or ethics regulations requiring further steps. These \nstatements are true, but beside the point.\n\n[[Page S680]]\n\n  First, the issues surrounding the fundraising of the Clinton \nFoundation and its impact on Senator Clinton's service as Secretary of \nState are not primarily legal. The imperative here is protecting U.S. \nforeign policy, not satisfying a legal or ethical requirement. If a \ntransparency measure would help guard against donations that could \njeopardize Senator Clinton's participation in some matters, prejudice \nforeign opinion against U.S. policies, or generate public \ncontroversies, it should be embraced. Each proposal should be judged on \nits own merits, rather than rejecting suggestions on the basis that \nenough has been done. Is it, or is it not a good idea to subject all \nforeign donations greater than $50,000 to the State Department ethics \nreview process, for example.\n  Second, following precedents established by other foundations is \nunsatisfying given that this case far exceeds previous cases in \nmagnitude and risk. Senator Clinton will be the Secretary of State--the \ntop foreign policy official of the United States after the President. \nPresident Clinton is one of the most recognizable personages and \nprolific fundraisers in the world. As an ex-President, he is regarded \nas having personal influence with members of our Government and other \ngovernments. Moreover, we have already seen in the December disclosure \nof past donors that the Clinton Foundation has received tens of \nmillions of dollars from foreign governments, government-controlled \nentities, foreign businesses and others who may have interests affected \nby State Department policy. Other cases lack this extraordinary \nconfluence of a Secretary of State with responsibility for foreign \npolicy, a globally recognized ex-President spouse who has raised money \nin every corner of the world, and a foundation that has implemented an \naggressive foreign fundraising strategy.\n  Furthermore, we should be clear that the MOU is a negotiated, \npolitical agreement that involved both the Obama Transition and the \nClinton Foundation exerting leverage and making compromises. There is \nnothing wrong with this. But we should not confuse it with a document \nproduced by ethics experts seeking to construct the most effective \narrangement for avoiding conflicts of interest. These negotiations \nproduced a useful, good-faith agreement, but not one beyond \nimprovement. It represents a beginning, not an end. Its success will \nrequire that all parties make the integrity of U.S. foreign policy \ntheir first principle of implementation.\n  I am hopeful that Senator Clinton and the Clinton Foundation will \ntake time to reexamine their position on these items. If they do, I \nbelieve they will see that they could reap substantial transparency and \npublic confidence benefits by going beyond what the MOU requires them \nto do. More importantly, all involved should recognize that protecting \nthe foreign policy of the United States from conflict of interest \nappearances far outweighs the relatively minimal impact additional \ntransparency measures might have on the operations of the Clinton \nFoundation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the distinguished \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I will speak briefly. I \nknow the Senator from Maine would like to say a few words.\n  I really believe we should move forward with the nomination of our \nformer colleague--I guess our still present colleague--Senator Hillary \nClinton, to take up the urgent and important duties she holds, which \nare to meet some very serious challenges. We should not delay. I do not \nhave to remind you, Mr. President, or anyone else in this body that we \nare in two wars. There is a very fragile cease-fire in the Gaza now \nbetween the Israelis and Hamas. The situation in North Korea seems to \nhave deteriorated again with the paradoxical and unpredictable behavior \nof the North Korean dictator and Government. I think we need to \nimmediately, or as soon as possible this morning, by voice vote, move \nforward with the nomination and confirmation of the Senator from New \nYork to be the next Secretary of State.\n  I remind all my colleagues, we had an election and we also had a \nremarkable and historic time yesterday as this Nation has come together \nin a way it has not for some time. I, like all good politicians, pay \nattention to the President's approval ratings. They are very high. But \nmore important, I think the message the American people are sending us \nnow is they want us to work together and get to work. I think we ought \nto let Senator Clinton--who is obviously qualified and obviously will \nserve--get to work immediately.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the completion of the remarks any of \nmy colleagues might have, we vitiate the vote at 4:30 and proceed by \nvoice vote to a confirmation of Senator Hillary Clinton to be the next \nSecretary of State for the United States of America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am in a \nvery strange position here of wanting to protect the prerogatives of \nthe minority, which is an important part of how we work here but at the \nsame time completely supporting the Senator from Arizona.\n  I will balance this out for a moment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield? While the unanimous consent \nrequest is being considered, perhaps my other colleagues could speak?\n  Mr. KERRY. If we could ask for forbearance for the unanimous consent, \nperhaps it would be more appropriate if Senator Cornyn or someone from \nthe other side of the aisle were willing to lodge that objection \nbecause I am personally very uncomfortable doing so.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me say to my colleague, I just had a conversation \nwith Senator Cornyn. He does not object to that.\n  Mr. KERRY. I was going to ask for the same thing at the end of the \ncomments, but I wanted to first see if he was prepared to clear it. Mr. \nPresident, could I ask if the Senator will withhold his unanimous \nconsent request for a moment and if the Senator from Maine could be \npermitted to speak? We will see if we can jump through this hoop.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconfirmation of Senator Hillary Clinton to be our next Secretary of \nState. Last Thursday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \noverwhelmingly approved Senator Clinton to become our Nation's top \ndiplomat. I rise today to echo the committee's approval and to urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of her confirmation.\n  Senator Clinton's many years of public service make her an \noutstanding nominee for Secretary of State. In her confirmation \nhearing, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Lugar, spoke of Senator Clinton as ``the epitome of a big \nleaguer,'' who has remarkable qualifications for the post of Secretary \nof State. The committee chairman, Senator Kerry, shared his faith in \nher qualifications and abilities, having seen her ``diplomatic acumen \nup close.'' He also said that Senator Clinton did an outstanding job in \nher testimony before the committee, as those of us who observed the \nhearings can affirm.\n  Senator Clinton is the ``first'' First Lady of the United States \nelected to public office. As First Lady, she traveled the world for 8 \nyears, visiting more than 80 countries. In doing so, she took an active \nrole in helping to carry out our Nation's foreign policy and was an \nadvocate for our Nation. She not only met with foreign leaders at the \nhighest levels of government, but she made it a hallmark of her trips \nto visit villages, clinics, and other remote areas, learning firsthand \nthe importance of a foreign policy founded at the most basic levels of \nhumanity.\n  During my service in the Senate, I have had the opportunity to work \nvery closely with Senator Clinton on a number of issues, particularly \nsince we both serve as fellow members of the Armed Services Committee. \nWe have worked together tirelessly to improve the detection, \nassessment, and treatment of traumatic brain injury among wounded \nservicemembers.\n  We also cochaired the Alzheimer's Task Force and have worked together \nto increase funding for research into this devastating disease.\n  Senator Clinton and I have had the opportunity to travel with Senator\n\n[[Page S681]]\n\nMcCain to Iraq and Afghanistan. I witnessed her world knowledge and \nauthoritative approach to foreign policy. I have seen her tireless work \nethic and intelligence up close, as well as her ability to engage with \ncolleagues across the aisle to get the job done and to meet the needs \nof the American people.\n  I will always remember one meeting in particular that we had together \nin Afghanistan. Senator Clinton and I broke off from the group to go \nmeet with a group of Afghan women from all walks of life. I was so \nimpressed with Senator Clinton's engagement with these women, with her \ngenuine interest and the details of their lives, whether it was their \naccess to health care or the education for their children. She was very \nengaged in the conversations despite the fact that we had traveled all \nnight and were extremely tired.\n  Her caring, her compassion came across in her conversations with \nthese women. I know these qualities--her caring, her compassion, her \ncommitment, her extraordinary preparation and intelligence--will serve \nher well and will serve our country well as Secretary of State.\n  Today our Nation faces many pressing challenges abroad. The \nchallenges are many, not only in Afghanistan and Iraq but security in \nthe Middle East and the safety of the people of Israel, and the \ndangerous situation in Pakistan. I am encouraged by Senator Clinton's \ncommitment to a foreign policy and a national security strategy that is \nbuilt on bipartisan consensus and executed with nonpartisan commitment \nand confidence. She has promised a foreign policy based on principles \nand pragmatism, not rigid ideology; facts and evidence, not emotion or \nprejudice.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of her \nconfirmation, and I echo the suggestion of Senator McCain that we get \non with this as she is an extraordinary nominee and deserves our \nsupport.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Maine for their important comments, with which I agree. I \nunderstand the Senate is under a prior order to actually recess.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we allow one more speaker, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, at which time the Senate would recess for the \ncaucus lunches and return, I believe, at 2:15.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Do you think it is possible, if we can get it cleared, to \nperhaps have this unanimous consent vote before breaking for lunch?\n  Mr. KERRY. I think it is possible if the Senator can persuade three \nmembers of his caucus that they do not need to speak on this issue. If \nthat can happen in the next 5 minutes, I believe it is possible for us \nto move forward.\n  I think the Senator's cloakroom has those names and, obviously, to \nprotect their right to be able to speak, we need to check with them. \nBut that is the only thing standing between our ability to confirm the \nnomination before the recess.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will follow up with another question for my colleague; \nthat is, if we are unable to do it in the next few minutes, perhaps we \ncould, for sure, during the lunch break, be ready to go at the \nconclusion of the lunch break.\n  Mr. KERRY. I think that would be terrific. Again, if all three \nSenators would raise this issue at the caucus, at their caucus \nluncheon, we ought to be able to come back and expedite the \nconfirmation. We are prepared to vote now. We were prepared to vote \nyesterday. I might add, Senator Lugar was encouraging our moving by \nunanimous consent yesterday. So we are a day overdue, and we are ready \nto proceed.\n  With that, I would yield such time as the Senator from South Carolina \nmight consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the request is \nagreed to.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the committee chairman. I want to \nrecognize the work the committee did. I thought the hearings were very \nimportant for the country. They were well done. They were timely held. \nAny concerns about conflicts of interest, there will be a process in \nthe future, if that happens to be a concern, to go through the \ncommittee. I have a lot of confidence in the committee to provide \noversight.\n  But having said that, I have a lot of confidence in Senator Clinton \nto be a good Secretary of State. We have a new President. We had a \ntough campaign. The campaign is over, but the wars are not. The \nchallenges facing the country are enormous, domestically and \ninternationally.\n  I think this new President deserves to have his team in place. I \ncould not think of a better choice for Secretary of State, and he has \nmany to choose from. So he has made his choice; the committee has \nacted. I do hope the Senate can act expeditiously after lunch. Everyone \ndeserves to have their say. I respect the chairman preserving the \nability of Senators to have their say.\n  I intend to vote for Senator Clinton. I have had the pleasure of \nserving with her, traveling throughout the world. I know she \nunderstands the world; people understand her. There is no place in the \nworld that she cannot go that people do not have, I think, a very \nfavorable impression of her. She will help execute a foreign policy \nthat is going to be difficult. I want it to be bipartisan where it can.\n  If we can get this done today, it will be good for the country. She \nwill do an outstanding job. I have a lot of confidence in the committee \nto make sure that any potential conflict of interests are fairly dealt \nwith.\n  With that, I hope this afternoon we can do it by voice vote. But \nlet's get it done. This country needs a Secretary of State right now, \nthis minute, engaging the world because we have young men and women \nthroughout the world in harm's way, and they need an advocate on the \nworld stage.\n  There is no better advocate I can think of than Senator Hillary \nClinton. She can do an outstanding job. I appreciate the chairman \nallowing me to speak on her behalf, and I enthusiastically will support \nher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/21/senate-section/article/S681-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMUNICATION FROM SENATOR KEN SALAZAR\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It is my understanding the Senator from South Carolina \nwishes to speak.\n  We have had some discussion with a few of our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. I understand there are two or three folks who want \nto speak, at which point I am prepared to move forward immediately to a \nvote on this nomination. That is our current plan, unless somebody else \nhad a reason they wanted to speak.\n\n[[Page S682]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. I believe there \nare a few Republicans who wish to make comments, and I believe everyone \nis agreeable to move directly to the vote.\n  Senator Clinton is uniquely and highly qualified for the job of \nSecretary of State. She has been very open and forthright in her \nanswers to questions at the committee hearings and to my questions \nasked in private conversations and in the dozens of questions I \nsubmitted to her for written response. I believe she honestly wants \nwhat is best for the Nation. I will do my best to support her in that \nendeavor.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I voted to \nsend her nomination to the full Senate because I believe she has earned \nthe right to an up-or-down vote. Senator Clinton will be confirmed \ntoday. There is not much doubt about that. She will be sworn in and, \nwhen she is, she will have my prayers for her success. At the committee \nlevel, I said she not only had the potential to be a good Secretary of \nState but a great Secretary of State. But her success will be \ndetermined by more than just her considerable intellect and experience. \nIt will also be determined by the policies she pursues. This is one \narea that concerns me.\n  Based on her testimony, her answers to questions and her public \nstatements, I believe she will take our foreign policy in a direction \nthat erodes our national independence and surrenders sovereignty to \ninternational powers. I am deeply concerned that she will take aim at \ndecades-old policies intended to protect the sanctity of life. These \npolicies ensure that our foreign assistance dollars do not fund \nabortion and are not used to lobby foreign nations to repeal laws that \nprotect unborn children. The United States is certainly an economic, \npolitical, and military superpower. But we have also strived to be \nmore, to be a moral superpower. Our unwavering adherence to principles \nof freedom and human dignity are what truly set us apart. These pro-\nlife regulations contribute to that moral leadership.\n  Some will argue that we should expect these policies from Senator \nClinton, given that President Obama has very strong views supporting \nunrestricted abortion. I understand that. To some degree, I believe he \nshould be allowed to surround himself with individuals who share his \nviews, even when they are misguided. Within reason, I may even support \na nominee who has certain views I disagree with. I do not plan to slow \nup this nomination, but I find it difficult to support a nominee who I \nknow will pursue policies so contrary to American sovereignty and the \ndignity of the human person. I will continue to try to persuade \nSecretary of State Clinton and President Obama to modify their \npositions. That obviously will not happen before the vote today.\n  One matter I had hoped would be resolved before the vote today is the \nClinton Foundation and its initiatives. I urged Senator Clinton at the \nhearing, as others did, to do whatever she could to eliminate any doubt \nabout the foundation's fundraising and a potential conflict of interest \nwith foreign nations. I believe this problem can be very easily fixed, \nif the foundation agrees to refuse all foreign donations and fully \ndiscloses all contributions on line immediately, as long as Senator \nClinton is Secretary of State. To date, Senator Clinton has not agreed.\n  Let's be clear. Senator Clinton does not have to provide this \ndisclosure to be confirmed. She already has the votes. As far as I \nknow, the law does not require this disclosure. In fairness, the \nfoundation plans to provide disclosure far beyond what is required \nlegally, but we are in new waters today, the first time the spouse of a \nformer President is stepping into such an important role. In a world \nwhere bribes, kickbacks, and pay-to-play are too often the normal way \nof doing business, the United States must stand apart. As President \nObama said yesterday, those of us who manage the public's dollar will \nbe held to account. We must do our business in the light of day, \nbecause only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and \ntheir government. That is why I believe additional steps should be \ntaken to eliminate this potential conflict. This will help Senator \nClinton be a Secretary of State who is above reproach. It is essential \nthat our Secretary be seen as treating nations fairly, and I have every \nbelief that Senator Clinton can be a fair Secretary of State. But it is \nnot enough that we treat other nations fairly. They must know that they \nare being treated fairly. If there is suspicion that certain nations or \ninternational players are gaining advantage by virtue of contributions \nto the Clinton Foundation or its initiatives, that will compromise our \nnew Secretary's effectiveness. This is why I believe only full and \nimmediate public disclosure and refusal of all foreign donations is the \nonly solution.\n  The memorandum of understanding signed by the foundation leaves a lot \nof discretion to Senator Clinton. During her confirmation hearings, \nSenator Lugar presented a request for more acceptable disclosures, and \nSenator Kerry, as chairman, supported these recommendations. \nUnfortunately, Senator Clinton has not agreed to follow even these \nmodest recommendations. For these reasons, I will be voting against the \nnomination today. But I will do so with nothing but sincere hope and \ngoodwill toward our new Secretary of State and prayer for her success, \nas she takes the helm of the State Department.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments and \nfor the concerns he has expressed which I think I have addressed \nearlier in my opening comments and which Senator Lugar also has \naddressed.\n  It is my understanding that there was one other Senator who wished to \nspeak.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the understanding, as before, \nthat time will be charged against both sides equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Senator Vitter wanted to speak. I know he \nwas scheduled for later, but it would be great if he was able to get \ndown here. We have no other Members on our side who want to speak, so \nwe could proceed to an immediate vote and hopefully do it by consent \nwhich would expedite matters here and make it simpler for colleagues. I \nhope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will cooperate with \nus.\n  In the meantime, I yield such time as the Senator from New York may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kerry for his leadership \non this issue. We look forward to continued leadership on many \ndifferent issues from Senator Kerry.\n  I rise in favor of Hillary Clinton's nomination to be Secretary of \nState. It has been said: Hillary Clinton is the ideal candidate, \nparticularly during these troubled times, for Secretary of State. I \nthank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the cooperation we \nare getting so that we can move this resolution quickly. These are \ndifficult times. Yesterday our country entered a new era in its \nrelationship with the rest of the world. President Obama laid out a \ndaunting task to return the United States to its historic role as a \nmoral leader of the international community and Hillary Clinton is \nexactly the right person for the job. She has studied the issues of \nforeign policy over the years. She has outstanding relationships with \nthe leaders of the world. She also has that internal gyroscope that \nwill lead her to balance the very legitimate security needs of the \nUnited States along with the need to be a moral leader. That is not \neasy to do. But Hillary Clinton has shown her ability to synthesize \ndifferent parts of a difficult problem in a way that produces real \nresults.\n  The country and the world need a new U.S. foreign policy, one \nchampioned by a strong and consultative leader. Hillary Clinton is \nexactly the\n\n[[Page S683]]\n\nright person for the job. Her abilities as a prudent and effective \npolicymaker have been proven in the dual crucibles of national scrutiny \nand international pressure. And through all of this time, she has \ndemonstrated a steadiness of character, a soundness of judgment and \nstrength that will make her an exceptional leader.\n  We can't wait too long. I would have hoped that we could have \nunanimously supported this nomination and moved it yesterday. But \ncolleagues have the right to delay only for a short period of time. I \nam glad that delay is about to end. As a country, as a world, we need \nHillary Rodham Clinton as Secretary of State, given her intelligence, \nher strength, her compass, and her ability to get things done.\n  I urge my colleagues to move quickly. I don't want to delay this \nfurther. I remind them of her vast international experience, \nnegotiating aid packages in Asia, pushing democratic reforms in the \nSoviet Bloc, promoting peace plans in Northern Ireland and Serbia. But \nHillary Clinton will combine a fresh look at our foreign policy with \nlots of experience and the know-how to get it done.\n  I can tell my colleagues from serving with Hillary for 8 years as \nSenator--and I will regret that our partnership as Senator is ending--\nthere is no one better to do this job. We should move the nomination \nquickly. We should then all get behind Senator Clinton and President \nObama, and there will be a great foreign policy team.\n  In all of her many roles as a public servant, Hillary has always \nshown the insight to see to the heart of a problem, the courage to \ntackle it, and the talent to solve it.\n  In her years as First Lady, Senator Clinton was one of the country's \nmost important and best-loved ambassadors.\n  She traveled to over 80 countries, meeting with heads of state from \nthe Czech Republic to Nepal.\n  She served as a representative to the United Nations, addressing \nforums around the world.\n  She has negotiated aid packages in Asia, pushed democratic reforms in \nthe former Soviet Bloc, and promoted peace plans in Northern Ireland \nand Serbia.\n  But Hillary didn't just meet with world leaders. She has met with the \nprivate citizens around the world whose lives are shaped by \ninternational decisions.\n  She has met survivors of the Rwandan genocide, with advocates for \nsocial justice and women's rights in Pakistan, with the families of \nchildren kidnapped in Uganda.\n  And after serving her country 8 years as First Lady, when most people \nretire, Hillary stepped up and has served as a vital and powerful \nadvocate on behalf of the people of New York.\n  Going from the White House to White Plains, Hillary has continued to \nshow just as much acumen in her dealings with national and global \nleaders, as she shows empathy and interest in the needs of private \nindividuals around New York.\n  From her time 30 years ago with the Children's Defense Fund, to her \ncommitment while in the White House to improving women's rights at home \nand abroad, to her indefatigable efforts in the Senate to fight poverty \nand disease in the developing world, Hillary has dedicated her career \nto improving the lives of the country's and the world's least fortunate \npeople.\n  I cannot think of anyone who, as Secretary of State, could do as much \nas good for the people of the world, or as much to restore the world's \nfaith in our leadership.\n  Senator Clinton has important work waiting for her in Foggy Bottom, \nand the country and the world cannot afford to wait for her leadership \nany longer.\n  I am sad to see Hillary leave the Senate, but I am confident that she \nwill be a brilliant Secretary of State.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of Senator \nHillary Rodham Clinton to be Secretary of State. I would like to make a \nfew brief points why I think her nomination is important and why I \nthink she will do an outstanding job in this very important position. I \nwant to begin, though, by saying something about President Clinton's \ncharitable efforts and what they have meant to our State and to our \nregion and what I think they have meant to the world at large.\n  We have seen in our own lifetime many Presidents come and go from the \nOval Office. Many of them leave and you do not hear much from them. \nSome of them spend their time in very worthy causes. But, to my mind, \nno past President has taken on such an ambitious agenda as President \nBill Clinton to help ease the suffering and pain in this world. He \ncould have spent his time doing many things, but he has challenged \nhimself and his contacts around the world--businessmen, \nphilanthropists, women engaged in social organizational work around the \nworld--to make this a better community. He has done it masterfully and \nwith the strength and networking capabilities that perhaps only a \nPresident of this Nation has.\n  In the State of Louisiana, which I represent, we have seen firsthand \nthe benefit of that work, as he has raised private dollars, foundation \ndollars to come to the aid of Katrina and Rita survivors: $130 million \nin funding to the gulf coast region, which was devastated by not two \nstorms but actually four counting Ike and Gustav; and not just for \nLouisiana and Mississippi but for the State of Texas, where John Cornyn \nhails from, which has been particularly helped by the efforts not just \nof the Clinton Foundation but the Clinton-Bush foundation or the Bush-\nClinton foundation that raised $130 million for tremendously helpful \ncauses.\n  Just a few notes: Mr. President, $30 million was awarded to 38 higher \neducation institutions to keep those doors open, when homes were \ndestroyed, jobs were lost, and families were scattered to States all \nover America; $40 million went to nonprofit groups working on \nreconstruction efforts; $25 million was awarded to rebuild over 1,000 \nhouses; and $35 million was given to general nonprofits.\n  As of January 16, 2009, another one of President Clinton's funds--the \nBush-Clinton Gulf Coast Fund--has raised over $2 million for additional \nhelp to towns and neighborhoods.\n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Ike--the fourth of the storms that have \nstruck our coast in these 3 years--the Clinton Climate Initiative \nhelped to catalyze a cooperative effort between the public and private \nsector to transport 4.5 million gross cubic yards of green waste to 9 \nsites in order for it to be composted as opposed to dumped into \nlandfills.\n  The Clinton Foundation, via the Clinton Global Initiative, has \nreceived commitments valued at over $103 million to work on climate \nprotection initiatives and health technology initiatives in the State \nof Texas, as well as to enhance the quality of life of Texas-Mexico \nborder residents.\n  As a Senator who represents the storm survivors of Louisiana, I am \nincredibly grateful for President Clinton's hard work for our \ncommunities.\n  Not only has Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton herself been one of the \nfirst Senators on the ground to the gulf coast, sharing her expertise, \nher knowledge, and her passion for recovery, but President Clinton \nhimself.\n  Mr. President, I know I have only been given 3 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent for an additional 1 minute because I would like to \nadd, I say to Senator Kerry, if I could, that I hear so many people \nfrom the other side coming down and expressing their philosophy that \nthey are just appalled that Democrats sometimes rely on Government to \ndo it all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Well, here is an example of a former President who is \nnot relying on Government to do it all, who realizes the combined \ntreasuries of all the governments in the world cannot stop, perhaps, \nthe AIDS crisis or lift women out of poverty or educate\n\n[[Page S684]]\n\ngirls who have not been educated in centuries. So he has taken it upon \nhimself to raise private dollars and foundations. Yet the same group \nwho complains that Government cannot do it all--when somebody tries to \nleverage the strength of the private sector, they have to clobber him \nanyway. I think part of it is not so much the words they say, but \nperhaps this gives them an ability to do some fundraising they may have \nto do for the coming elections, which is really very disturbing based \non the passionate comments of President Obama yesterday about how he \nwould like to get past this partisan era we have been in.\n  Just a word about Senator Clinton herself. Not only on the \ninternational front is she an expert, and our President needs a very \nsmooth transition on the international front given the two wars we are \nfacing, the crisis in the Mideast, and the economic crisis at home, but \nI want to spend my last minute saying how personally proud I am of the \nwork she has done in this country and abroad helping women and \nchildren, particularly orphans, particularly children who find \nthemselves, because of war or famine or disease or other terrible \ncauses, separated from their families and in this country left for \nyears in limbo in foster care or in a foster care system that is broken \nand is still yet to be fixed. Senator Clinton herself has been a \nchampion for these children, both foster care children and orphans \naround the world. I think as the Secretary of State, although she is \ngoing to be busy with many great issues of the world, her heart is big \nenough to find a space and to keep a space for orphans and other \nchildren. As far as I am concerned, they may be an afterthought to many \nbig policy leaders today, but I would like to paraphrase a quote that \nsays: Children may be an afterthought today, but they are 100 percent \nof our future, and paying a little attention to them will help this \nworld keep a steady course.\n  As First Lady, Senator Clinton led numerous efforts to increase \nawareness about and support for youth aging out of foster care, and to \nincrease the number of children who are adopted out of foster care. She \npartnered with the late John Chaffee and Jay Rockefeller to develop and \npass the Adoption and Safe Families Act in 1997. This law is credited \nfor fundamentally shifting the U.S. foster care system away from the \narchaic notions that trapped children in foster care for years to \nchild-focused policies that resulted in children finding safe, loving, \nand permanent homes. After the passage of that legislation, foster \nadoptions increased 64 percent nationwide--from 31,030 the year the law \npassed to 51,000 last year.\n  As a Senator she has continued to push for legislation that benefits \nchildren in foster care. Under her leadership, the 110th Congress took \nup and passed legislation that provides Federal support for family \nmembers who take on the responsibility of caring for children who would \notherwise continue to live in foster care. She worked tirelessly to \nenhance efforts to incentivize States to continue their success in \nfinding families for older children, children with special needs, and \nlarge sibling groups.\n  I have no doubt that she will carry these passions with her to her \nnew assignment as Secretary of State and that the orphans of the world \nwill be better for it.\n  President Obama took the oath of office with the U.S. fighting two \nwars, a simmering crisis in the Middle East and the need for a seamless \ntransition to address the threats and challenges to the United States.\n  He needs his national security team confirmed and ready to work \nimmediately.\n  The outgoing Bush administration understood the importance of a \nsmooth national security transition and worked closely with the Obama \nadministration towards that goal. Republicans in the Senate should do \nno less.\n  Yesterday, President Obama spoke eloquently about--and the American \npeople responded so vigorously to--the need to set aside partisan \nposturing in these challenging times and come together to advance our \ncollective interests. It is a shame that the President's call is being \nignored at this critical time.\n  Any delay for partisan political purposes denies the President of the \nteam that he needs to preserve and protect our national security.\n  I look forward to Senator Clinton becoming our new Secretary of \nState.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from Politico \ndated January 15, 2009, about President Clinton's charity work helping \nSenator Vitter's home State--our State of Louisiana that we represent--\nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Politico, Jan. 15, 2009]\n\n               Bill's Charity Work Helped Vitter's State\n\n                           (By Glenn Thrush)\n\n       There's a small, but biting irony in David Vitter's solo \n     ``no'' vote against Hillary, which was based on conflicts-of-\n     interest concerns about Bill Clinton's foundation.\n       It just so happens that the ex-president's charitable \n     efforts have been more focused on Vitter's home state of \n     Louisiana than just about any other place in America, with \n     $130.6 million in funding flowing to the Gulf region through \n     the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund, according to records.\n       A partial breakdown: About $30 million was awarded to 38 \n     higher education institutions; $40 million went to non-\n     profits working on reconstruction in Alabama, Louisiana and \n     Mississippi; $25 million was awarded to 1,151 houses of \n     worship and organizations assisting the faith community; and \n     $35.6 million was given to 42 other non-profits for various \n     services.\n       Some noteworthy BCKF Louisiana grants: $550,000 to the \n     storm-damaged Delgado Community College in New Orleans and \n     $1.89 million to Xavier University, also in NOLA.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts \nfor giving me the opportunity to speak in this series of speakers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her \npersonal and important observations. I know they will be much \nappreciated by her colleague and our friend, Senator Clinton.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, could I ask, how much time is there still \ndivided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 39 minutes, the Republicans \nhave 64 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is such a pleasure to be here, and I \nwant to say to my chairman, Senator Kerry, how much I wish him the best \nin his new position.\n  I am a very proud member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I \nwant to talk a little bit about Hillary Clinton and her qualifications \nto be Secretary of State and, more than that, our need to see her \nconfirmed as swiftly as possible this afternoon.\n  Many of my constituents are visiting for the great inaugural \ncelebration we witnessed yesterday. They played a role in it. Many of \nthem have talked to me and asked: Well, why hasn't Hillary Clinton been \nconfirmed already? Why has there been any delay? She is obviously so \nwell qualified.\n  I answered: Well, several of my colleagues on the other side had some \nissues with disclosure of Clinton Foundation donations. And I believe \nwe will deal with that.\n  I think it is important to point out that President Clinton has \nagreed to disclose so much regarding his foundation. Other Presidents \ndo not disclose anything. I think if there is any problem, we will have \ntransparency and we will know.\n\n  What my constituents are saying to me is this: Look, we need a strong \nand respected Secretary of State who is knowledgeable on day one. They \nbasically say there are two reasons for that, and I agree with them. \nThe first reason is, there are so many hot spots in the world and so \nmany complicated issues out there for the next Secretary\n\n[[Page S685]]\n\nof State. Hillary Clinton--having run for President, having been a \nUnited States Senator, having served on the Armed Services Committee--\nis supremely ready for these challenges. Whether it is winding down the \nwar in Iraq, which our President says he will do responsibly and soon; \nwhether it is making sure we don't lose Afghanistan to the Taliban and \nset that nation back; whether it is the terrible crisis between Israel \nand the Palestinians; whether it is turmoil in Africa, genocide in \nDarfur, the war on terror in general, or the need to win over the \nhearts and minds of people around the globe, all of these things are \nout there for our new President, President Obama, to address. He needs \nsomeone to help him shoulder that burden. He is going to count on \nHillary Clinton to do that. He is going to count on Senator Kerry in \nhis new position, all of us on the committee and all of us in the \nSenate, as well as House leaders to do that.\n  Hillary Clinton understands all of these hot spots. She also \nunderstands the fact that there is one President and she will work with \nhim and for him and for the American people. After all, she was in the \nWhite House and she knows the President sets foreign policy. She \nunderstands that. So she is supremely ready.\n  The other reason my friends from California have stated is this: We \nneed someone with that prestige, with that recognition, with that \ncharisma because we have so many problems at home to which our \nPresident has to attend. And Hillary Clinton has that sense of, \nfrankly, star quality, the ability to gain attention and respect. \nPresident Obama couldn't do the work himself. If he had to fly all over \nthe world, he couldn't take the time he needs to fight this deepening \nrecession.\n  President Obama is inheriting massive problems. These problems didn't \nhappen in a day; they happened over the last 8 years. It is going to \ntake time to get out of some of the mess. President Bush had a surplus; \nhe has put us deeply in debt. Pay as you go is gone. Our new President \nhas to deal with that.\n  President Bush made no progress on health care. Our new President has \nto deal with it. On the environment, we have gone backwards. I know the \nchairman understands this. He serves on the committee on which I am \nprivileged to serve as well, the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So where are we? We have this string of problems, and our \nnew President has to focus on getting people back to work, on making \nsure that Social Security and Medicare are strong, that our kids are \neducated, and that global warming is addressed in the right way. That \nis just the partial list. We also want to make sure our small \nbusinesses thrive. President Obama is inheriting that list of problems: \ndebt, deficit, unemployment, the worst economy since the Great \nDepression. He needs someone such as Hillary Clinton to help shoulder \nthe burden on foreign policy.\n  So I hope we get a tremendous vote for Hillary Clinton. She deserves \nit. I wish to thank my chairman again for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. I \nappreciate it very much.\n  It is my understanding the Senator from Tennessee wishes to speak, \nbut he wishes to speak in morning business. On the other hand, we don't \nwant to delay the march of the clock. So I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time used by the Senator from Tennessee be charged to the other \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak as in morning business, \nand I thank the chairman for allowing me to do so. If someone comes in \nto speak on the subject matter, I will defer.\n  As is the Senator from California, I am very concerned about our \neconomy. I know there is going to be a stimulus package forthcoming. I \nam very concerned about that. I am afraid what we are doing right now \nas a country is addressing the recession--a severe recession--in the \nstandard way people like to respond to recessions. I think we are \npotentially doing that without addressing the real issue, which is the \ncredit markets in our country.\n  I know over the last 6 months we have wrestled with ways of dealing \nwith the credit markets in our country. I wish to tell my colleagues it \nis my belief the boards of banks throughout our country are in \nboardrooms today and are in conversations throughout the country \ntalking about the fact that their banks are actually insolvent. They \nknow they are insolvent, but because of the way gap financing accrues \nto banks who make whole loans, they are able to actually meter those \nlosses out over quarters into the future, knowing that today they are \ninsolvent.\n  What we have done through TARP funding is put money through capital \ninjection into these banks. In their intelligent self-interests they \nhave hoarded that money because they know they have losses coming in \nthe future that would cause their banks to be insolvent if they \nrecognized those losses today.\n  What concerns me is our country is quickly getting to the point where \nour resources are limited more than they have ever been, where we are \nborrowing huge amounts of money--and certainly we have been doing that \nfor some time--and we are getting to a point in time where there is not \na lot of power left for us to solve problems. So what I hope will \nhappen over this next 30 days as we wrestle with this issue--which is \nserious and which is affecting people throughout this country; which is \nharming households and people who are just trying to work for a \nliving--is that we will solve the root cause of this problem, which is \nour credit problem.\n  It is my belief we have trillions of dollars that are going to be \nlost in the credit market. Much of that is being driven by housing. \nThese two issues have to be dealt with together. I fear we are going to \nlook at a spending package that candidly isn't going to make its way \ninto the economy until long after many predict this may be over. In the \ninterim, what we are going to do is create a zombie banking system \nwhere, in essence, banks are just there metering out losses but not \ndoing the productive things that need to occur.\n  It is my belief we have a number of banks in this country--large \nbanks, banks that we know and respect--that need to be seized, that \nright now need to get down to a base level where normal investors would \nbe willing to invest in these banks. The longer we put this off, the \nlonger we are going to be away from actually solving the root cause of \nthis problem.\n  This President is inheriting these problems. I in no way assess these \nproblems to him. Many Presidents--most Presidents--deal with issues \nthey had no idea they were going to deal with. I know this President is \nlooking at a spending package. Candidly, there may be some need for \ncapital investment in infrastructure. However, if we do not deal with \nthe root issue--and that is the fact that much of our banking system is \ninsolvent and recognize that as adults--and cause the assets to be \nwritten down to their real level as we do with derivatives, but we do \nnot do that on whole loans--we give banks a break, if you will. We let \nthem meter those out. If we do not deal with that, everything we do \nhere to deal with our economy, in my opinion, will be for naught. It \nwill be a total waste.\n\n  What concerns me is we are quickly getting to the point again where \nwe are going to have fewer and fewer resources available to deal with \nthat. The United Kingdom just recently realized that the policies they \nwere putting in place were causing their currency to devalue rapidly.\n  I realize we are not there yet today as a country. I hope what we \nwill do as a body--and as a country--is tell the American people we \nrealize many of our financial institutions are insolvent. We realize \nthe problem could be trillions of dollars, and until that issue is \ndealt with in a serious and real way, anything else we do for the \neconomy is for naught.\n  It takes a functioning financial system for every small business--for \nevery barbershop, beauty salon, for every large business--for all of us \nto get our payroll checks processed; it takes that\n\n[[Page S686]]\n\nfor this economy to function. In order for our financial markets to \nstabilize, we have to deal with the issue of housing, which we have not \nyet done. It is my hope this body will take up this serious business.\n  I have to say, in deference to the chairman who has been on the floor \ntalking about our new Secretary of State, I listened to his comments \ntoday in the Finance Committee and I thought his comments were dead on. \nI know he referred to some editorials that were written over the \nweekend that said exactly the kinds of things we are talking about \nright now. I talk to investors on Wall Street who are involved in these \ninstitutions in major ways. They know they are insolvent. They know we \nare just pushing this down the road.\n  I think we owe this to these young people up front whose last day is \ntomorrow. We owe this to Americans across this country who depend upon \nus to do mature and adult-like things. We owe this to the country, to \nface up to the realities of these major losses, these major \ninsolvencies, its effect on the economy for years to come, and do \nsomething about that first before we deal with things that will \npossibly stimulate the economy if, in fact, we actually had a \nfunctioning financial system. We all know of small businesses all \nacross this country that are being denied loans. We know of businesses \nthat are actually doing the right things, but banks are calling letters \nof credit and other things because they want the money in so they can \nagain meter out the losses.\n  So I thank my colleague for allowing me to speak as in morning \nbusiness. I know we have important business at hand. I look forward to \nsupporting Secretary of State-designate Clinton later today. I thank my \ncolleague for his courtesy, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the next administration will be faced \nwith the difficult task of building a smarter U.S. foreign policy that \nrestores America's image abroad and security at home. Senator Hillary \nClinton's distinguished record and testimony before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee demonstrate that she is the right person to lead \nthis effort. Her experience, intelligence and thoughtfulness make her \nan excellent choice to be our most senior diplomat and to lead a \nstronger and more effective State Department.\n  I do share some of the concerns that have been expressed about the \npotential for a conflict of interest between her work as our incoming \nSecretary of State and the Clinton Foundation. I hope that Senator \nClinton will make every effort to avoid even the appearance of such a \nconflict of interest, if confirmed.\n  Senator Clinton brings many strengths to this position, and I am \npleased to support her nomination. It has been a pleasure working with \nSenator Clinton as a Senate colleague, and I look forward to working \nclosely with her in a new capacity.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the nomination of \nour colleague, the junior Senator from New York, Mrs. Hillary Rodham \nClinton, as our next Secretary of State.\n  It is a position to which I am confident she will be confirmed \nshortly--and in which I know she will serve extraordinarily well.\n  Before I speak about the qualifications that Senator Clinton brings \nto this most important position at such a crucial juncture in our \nhistory, I want say a few words about the spirit of openness and \ncooperation that she demonstrated throughout the confirmation process.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for more than a \nquarter century--having closely reviewed her nomination--Senator \nClinton and her husband have taken unprecedented steps and gone above \nand beyond what we have asked of them. That she has speaks not only to \nSenator Clinton's personal integrity, but to her commitment to the \noffice of Secretary of State.\n  Senator Clinton will serve during a period crucial to restoring \nAmerica's moral authority--making clear to the world our virtue, our \nnoble intentions and--as we were reminded by our new President, Barack \nObama, yesterday--all that we still represent to so many around the \nglobe.\n  As we all know, Senator Clinton has a history of redefining roles and \ninspiring people around the world. Certainly, she did when she first \nrose to the national stage as First Lady, taking on issues previously \nunfamiliar to that position, often in new ways--children's issues, \nhealthcare, women's rights.\n  To those who had known her, none of that was surprising. Indeed, long \nbefore she became First Lady or Senator, she had been a tenacious legal \nadvocate for children and families, fostering hope in a wide cross-\nsection of the American people. Little wonder, then, that she gained \nthat following of passionate supporters that we saw on the campaign \ntrail last year.\n  For the last 8 years, Senator Clinton has represented the State of \nNew York and has given her constituents a daring and tenacious advocate \nin Washington, putting a special focus on improving her State's \neconomy--specifically that of upstate New York which is not only hit \nharder by recessions but often remains a bystander during times of \neconomic expansion.\n  That she so naturally became this kind of advocate speaks volumes \nabout her affinity for the less fortunate--her beliefs about the nature \nof public service and the kind of priorities she will bring as \nSecretary of State.\n  I have said that it also is a testament to President Obama that he \nnominated his one-time rival to such a critical post. But perhaps it \nsays more about the nominee herself--about her commitment to bringing \nchange to this country.\n  I have been privileged to serve alongside Senator Clinton. In \nassuming the position of Secretary of State, Senator Clinton assumes a \nresponsibility--that of being our representative to friends and enemies \nalike. Her judgment and temperament will be critical to restoring \ninternational relationships which have been so badly tarnished in \nrecent years.\n  So, let me join my colleagues in saying thank you to the junior \nSenator from New York. I know her tenacity and talent will serve our \ncountry extraordinarily well in the coming years, as it has throughout \nher lifetime. I urge my colleagues to confirm her and I wish her the \nbest of luck.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Hillary Rodham Clinton to serve as Secretary of State.\n  Hillary Clinton is a tireless and fearless public servant.\n  She is a woman of strength and compassion with a powerful voice.\n  And I look very much forward to confirming her as our next Secretary \nof State.\n  I have known Hillary for 16 years--since the time when she was First \nLady.\n  I was delighted to see Hillary Clinton sworn into our small but ever-\ngrowing cadre of female Senators in January 2001, and I have greatly \nadmired her work here in the Senate.\n  Senator Clinton has rolled up her sleeves and worked forcefully to \nrepresent the people of New York during the past 8 years.\n  She worked side-by-side with her Empire State colleagues to shepherd \nNew Yorkers through the challenges of recovering from the tragedies of \nthe attacks of September 11.\n  She has been an active and diligent member of the Senate Armed Forces \nCommittee, doing her homework and asking the tough questions.\n  In 2004, she was asked by the Department of Defense to join the \nTransformation Advisory Group to the Joint Forces Command--the only \nSenator to serve in that capacity.\n  I know that Senator Hillary Clinton will leave behind a large void \nwhen she leaves the Halls of this Chamber.\n  But her next role--as Secretary of State--presents tremendous \nchallenges and opportunities.\n  The new Obama administration will usher in a new era of American \nforeign policy, and help rebuild our image around the world.\n  Hillary Clinton understands the value, and very great need for, a \nforeign policy that is guided by smart, robust diplomacy--rather than \nbelligerent threats.\n  She has already visited more than 80 countries, and has formed \nimportant relationships with a number of world leaders.\n  I am confident that she will ably continue to represent the values \nand interests of our great country in the capitals of the world as \nSecretary of State.\n\n[[Page S687]]\n\n  There is no doubt that the foreign policy challenges we face as a \nnation and global community are great: the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and the great need to transition our forces; a resurgent \nIran; the long-simmering Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which boiled \nover in recent weeks with tragic consequences; threats of nuclear \nproliferation and terrorism; ongoing instability in Southeast Asia; the \nneed to confront climate change; the terrible atrocities in Darfur and \nthe Congo; millions of global citizens who face a grim reality of \nhunger, thirst, poverty, and sickness; and the need to improve the \nplight of women around the world.\n  As Hillary remarked during a press conference when her nomination was \nformally announced on December 1, 2008:\n\n       America cannot solve these crises without the world, and \n     the world cannot solve them without America.\n\n  I am confident that Hillary Clinton will rise to the occasion--and \nwork hand-in-hand with President Obama and his national security team \nto help address these tremendous challenges.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for \nthe confirmation of my highly esteemed colleague and good friend, \nSenator Hillary Rodham Clinton, as the next Secretary of State.\n  When Senator Clinton arrived in the U.S. Senate in 2001, she had very \nlarge shoes to fill--those of the late and admired Senator from New \nYork, Daniel Patrick Moynihan--but filled them she did and with \ntremendous distinction and accolades from both sides of the aisle. And \nover time, our colleague was rightly lauded and recognized for her \nunwavering work ethic, her expansive and detailed command of the \nissues, and her care for her constituents. And in 2007, Senator Clinton \nbegan what would become a historic, Presidential campaign that was an \ninspiration to many and especially women. The fact is, throughout her \nremarkable trajectory of public service, Hillary Clinton has \nencountered immense challenges with intelligence, resilience, and \nresolve--traits that will stand our colleague in great stead as our \nNation's 67th Secretary of State.\n  Indeed, the international environment facing our next chief diplomat \nis daunting. The world today is rife with crises that, if inadequately \naddressed, could lead to geopolitical instability and human suffering \nthat spans both the globe and generations. Continuing nuclear programs \nin North Korea and Iran threaten the very existence of some of our \nclosest allies and undermine decades of nonproliferation efforts. A \nmaelstrom of conflicts as bloody as it is complex stretches across the \nheart of Africa, compounding heartbreaking poverty with unspeakable \nacts of violence. And inaction on global climate change has stymied a \nlong-overdue coordinated international response, imperiling every \ncoastline, crop and country on the planet.\n  Tackling these desperate problems will be a difficult, and, at times, \nthankless job. But if there is a Senator within this body who is equal \nto that task, it is certainly Senator Clinton. In her work on the \nSenate Committee on Armed Services, she has demonstrated an exhaustive \nunderstanding of the global security environment confronting the United \nStates and its allies. As a fellow founding member of the Senate \nWomen's Caucus on Burma and in her tireless support for legislation \nurging intensive diplomatic efforts to halt the genocide in Darfur, \nSenator Clinton has demonstrated not merely a deep-seated humanity, but \na visceral and personal commitment to speak for the oppressed and fight \nfor the defenseless.\n  On a personal note, today's vote is indeed a bittersweet moment--when \nwe will offer our consent to President of the United States--also a \nformer colleague, to tap another extraordinary Member to help guide our \ncountry and the free world at a perilous time. Senator Clinton's \ncounsel and exceptional commitment to public service will be sorely \nmissed in this august Chamber. Yet we take heart and no small measure \nof pride in knowing that her indefatigable intellect is being called \ninto service beyond these walls to the benefit of not just an \nadministration, or one country, but an entire community of nations \nseeking peace and prosperity for their citizens.\n  And so, as we look ahead to the future success of our good friend, I \nwish her Godspeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I recognize the Senator from Mississippi \nfor 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \nSenator Hillary Clinton to be Secretary of State. Her service as the \nSenator from New York for the past 8 years has been proof of her \nimpressive ability to effectively and thoughtfully contribute to the \ngovernance of our Nation. I have enjoyed working with her in the \nSenate, and I look forward to continuing that relationship in her role \nas Secretary of State.\n  Our Nation is confronted with serious global challenges, and it is \nimperative that we work to develop comprehensive strategies and expand \nour diplomatic efforts in search of peace. President Obama has a \ntremendous task before him. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nstabilizing the Middle East, securing nuclear material from terrorists \nare all critical to our own national security. Senator Clinton's \nexperience as First Lady of the United States, her record in the \nSenate, and her commitment to the people of this Nation have \ndemonstrated her capabilities to lead our Nation's foreign policy and \ndiplomatic agenda.\n  I urge the Senate to approve her nomination. I thank the Senator, and \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, who \nhas been here a long time and is a good judge of these issues and of \ncharacter, and we appreciate his comments very much.\n  Mr. President, we are awaiting Senator Specter, who I understand \nwants to speak. So I ask unanimous consent that the time--since there \nis more of it now on the other side, without speakers--the time of the \nquorum call now be charged to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nassistant majority leader, the Senator from Illinois, and I ask \nunanimous consent that following his comments the subsequent quorum \ncall be charged to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, and I appreciate this opportunity to say a \nfew words about the nomination of Hillary Clinton to be Secretary of \nState to our new President, Barack Obama.\n  It has been my good fortune to serve with Senator Clinton for many \nyears in the Senate, to have known her when she was our First Lady, and \nto have worked with her on many issues. There is no question of her \ncompetence, no question of her skill. As someone who supported our \ncurrent President in the last Presidential campaign and witnessed the \nspirited contest between Senator Clinton and then-Senator Obama, there \nis obviously no lack of determination or commitment when it comes to \nSenator Clinton and the task that she assumes. So when President Obama \nmade the decision to ask her to serve as Secretary of State, I felt it \nwas a decision which would bring to this country a leader who could \nmake a real difference.\n  I can recall a telephone conversation where I spoke to her and \nreminded her that there were many things she had said as First Lady and \nSenator which she would be able to follow through on as Secretary of \nState. She was one of the first I heard articulate a premise which I \nhave come to accept as basic\n\n[[Page S688]]\n\ngospel when it comes to analyzing global issues. Senator Clinton said, \nafter returning from a trip overseas, she felt you could measure the \nlikelihood that a country would be able to meet the challenges it faced \neconomically and socially based on one question, and the question was \nvery straightforward: How do you treat your women? I have found, as I \nhave traveled around the world, that standard is valid. If women are \ntreated like chattel or slaves, if they have no voice in the government \nand little voice in the family or the village, most of the time the men \nwill make a mess of it, and that has been the case. I told her she had \na chance, as Secretary of State, to not only deal with global issues of \npeace around the world but also to deal with those issues at the local \nlevel that make a dramatic difference in the lives of poor people.\n  I also know of her passion for so many other issues that are timely. \nWhen I spoke to her on the floor last week, as she cast her last vote \nas a Senator, I wished her well because I felt she would be confirmed \nas our next Secretary of State, and she said it is unfortunate that we \ncome to this moment in history when there are so many things unresolved \nin the world, but she looked forward to those moments where she would \nbe able to meet with the President of the United States and the Vice \nPresident, who has his own resume when it comes to global issues.\n  A Member on the Republican side has asked for us to consider this \nnomination today and to have a little debate and perhaps a vote. I \ndon't know if it will come to a vote, but other nominations went \nthrough without controversy and without debate yesterday. These are now \nmen and women going to work immediately for the new administration--no \ntime wasted--so they can tackle the real timely issues that face \nAmerica. One of the issues raised earlier on the Republican side was \nformer President Bill Clinton's foundation. It was an effort, after he \nleft the Presidency, to gather the resources to make a difference \naround the world in a variety of different challenges, not the least of \nwhich was the global AIDS epidemic.\n  It is true former President Clinton has been very adept at raising \nthe funds to help the poorest people in the world, and I think that is \na good thing. But questions were raised: Would that present a conflict \nif his wife, Senator Hillary Clinton, became Secretary of State? At \nthat point, the former President made full disclosure of all \ncontributions and contributors and made it clear that he would go out \nof his way to avoid conflicts and continue this disclosure and \ntransparency.\n  I can recall in Senator Kerry's committee Senator Lugar of Indiana \nasked questions about this to try to make sure there would be clarity \nand transparency. And that is good. We don't want any embarrassment \ncoming to either former President Clinton or Senator Clinton when she \nis Secretary of State and certainly not to the Obama administration. \nThat kind of disclosure is the way to reach that goal.\n  So I will be voting for her nomination today with the belief that \nHillary Clinton will bring that skill set and those values to this most \nimportant job for the future of our country. She understands the safety \nand security of America begins, of course, with a strong military but, \nas President Obama has said, to try to avoid using that military so we \ndon't engage in unnecessary wars and wars that have no end; to use the \nskills of diplomacy to solve the world's problems. I can't think of a \nbetter person to carry that message and that responsibility than \nSenator Hillary Clinton, and I am hopeful this afternoon this Senate \nwill rise quickly to support her nomination, send her down to Foggy \nBottom, where the Department of State is located, so she can begin her \nnew role in representing the United States around the world.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on the nomination of Senator Hillary Clinton to be Secretary of \nState. I believe Senator Clinton brings extraordinary talent and an \nextraordinary record to this very important position. Her educational \nand professional background are sterling. I have a little parochial \npride at the fact that she is a graduate of the Yale Law School and has \ncarried forward that school's tradition for public service.\n  I got to know Mrs. Clinton first when she was First Lady. Shortly \nafter I had brain surgery, in 1993, I bumped into her at the carriage \nentrance, coming into the Senate Chamber, and we talked a little bit \nabout my medical experience. She invited me to visit with her in the \nWhite House, which I did--as I recollect, on the second floor of the \nWest Wing. I told her of the personal experience I had and also my \nideas from serving on the subcommittee of Labor, Health, Human Services \nand Education for the 13 years that I had been in the Senate.\n  As First Lady, Mrs. Clinton was an activist. The record speaks for \nitself on all that she undertook. Then, to maintain candidacy for the \nSenate in New York was very courageous, gutsy, reminiscent of Robert \nKennedy leaving the Attorney General's job, going to a State not his \nhome State to seek election to this body.\n  In the Senate she has had an extraordinary record. She was very \naccomplished here. I had the good fortune to cosponsor a number of \nmatters with her and to work on other matters with her. We most \nnotably, perhaps, cosponsored the legislation of our Public Service \nAcademy; that is, to have an academy such as West Point or Annapolis or \nthe Air Force Academy, where young people interested in public service \nwould go for training in those arts.\n  Then we all know of the phenomenal race she carried on for the \nPresidency of the United States, coming as close as she did in the \nhistoric year we just saw, 2008, with the election of an African \nAmerican and the ascendancy of a woman into the finals of the \nPresidential contest.\n  When she was talked about for Secretary of State, I thought it was a \n10-strike. I did something that was a first for me, that I had never \ndone before. When I read in the newspaper that she was equivocating as \nto whether to take the job, I called her with some unsolicited advice. \nI cannot recall having done that before. If somebody asks for advice, \nOK, but I called her and urged her to take the job. I urged her to do \nso because I thought she was an extraordinary fit for it.\n  I think of all of the positions available at the moment--there are \nsome very important positions. I have been delayed coming to the floor \nwhere we were having an executive session of the Judiciary Committee on \nthe nomination of Attorney General-designate Holder, a very important \nposition. But no position, aside from the Presidency, is more important \nthan Secretary of State. Perhaps the Attorney General is close, with \nthe heavy responsibilities for national security in the fight against \nterrorism, the balance with civil liberties, and the very important \nquestions facing the economy with so many fraud cases looming with \npeople misrepresenting balance sheets. But Secretary of State poses the \nbig issues.\n  I have traveled extensively in my term in the Senate in connection \nwith my duties on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of Appropriations \nand the chairmanship of the Intelligence Committee, which I held in the \n104th Congress. I believe there are tremendous opportunities today for \nan activist U.S. policy on the hot spots around the world.\n  I have visited Syria on many occasions, have gotten to know President \nBashar al Asad and more extensively his father before he died in the \nyear 2000, President Hafez Asad. I believe that Syria is the key to \npeace in the Middle East. There have been very extensive negotiations \nthere. The parties, Israel and Syria, came very close in 1995 when \nRabin was Prime Minister, on negotiations brokered by then-President \nClinton, and again in the year 2000, when Ehud Barak was Prime \nMinister--very close. Turkey, for the last 18 months to 2 years, has \nbeen brokering for a long while behind the scenes, negotiations.\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\n  What Syria is looking for is the return of the Golan Heights and only \nIsrael can decide whether it is in Israel's security interests to give \nup the Golan. But it is a very different world today from what it was \nin 1967 on the strategic interests and strategic value of the Golan \nHeights. If a deal can be struck, I think there is great advantage for \nIsrael and for the region. I think that would induce Syria to stop aid \nto Hamas or funneling aid from Iran to Hamas; stopping them from aiding \nHezbollah; stopping Syria from any activities to destabilize Lebanon. \nSo an activist policy is a matter of the first magnitude.\n  With respect to Iran, there again I think dialog has some hope. Can \nit solve the problem? I don't know. But I do know the problems with \nIran cannot be solved without dialog.\n  I asked questions of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and \nSecretary of Defense Robert Gates before the Appropriations Committee \non the undertaking of dialog and negotiations. I asked Secretary Rice \nhow it was realistic to ask Iran to stop enriching uranium as a \nprecondition of talks when the object of the talks was to get them to \nstop enriching uranium. How do you do that? It seems to me a major \nfailure of U.S. foreign policy for decades has been a lack of civility \nand dignity and respect that we damn Yankees--we ugly Americans--don't \naccord other people, as a matter of basic dignity and respect.\n  I have had an opportunity to talk to the last three Iranian \nAmbassadors to the United Nations. They are very rational people to \nwhom you can talk.\n  Ahmadinejad? A real problem, when he talks about wiping Israel off \nthe face of the Earth. But he is not going to be President of Iran \nforever. I think there are forces besides President Ahmadinejad who \nhave different views in Iran.\n  If you take a look at Muammar Qaddafi, there you have an example of \nsomeone who is arguably the world's worst terrorist in history--except, \nperhaps, for bin Laden and what al-Qaida has done. But Qaddafi and \nLibya blew up Pan Am 103, bombed the Berlin discotheque, killed \nAmericans--and through negotiations, Qaddafi stopped developing a \nnuclear weapon, made reparations to the victims in Pan Am 103 and those \nwho were victims in the bombing of the Berlin discotheque.\n  I had an opportunity to visit Muammar Qaddafi, about 30 months ago, \nwith Congressman Tom Lantos. When you went to see Qaddafi, you would go \nto the desert. He lives in a tent and he meets you in plastic chairs. \nBut you can talk to him and the talking has paid results.\n  With that success, I think it is an indicator, a precedent for \ntalking to anybody. Nothing may come of it, but the dialog is an \nindispensable first step. We know with the difficulties in North \nKorea--and there have been plenty--an agreement was made in the early \n1990s. They breached that in 1993. We are back on track there.\n  But I think it takes bilateral talks. It takes representatives of the \nUnited States to stand up and be willing to talk to other people on an \nequal footing, with courtesy, with civility, and with dignity.\n  In August of 2005, I had a chance to meet President Hugo Chavez of \nVenezuela. The relationship between the United States and Venezuela has \nbeen very rocky for what President Chavez has undertaken. At that time \nthe United States Ambassador was trying to meet with the Venezuelan \nSecretary of the Interior over the drug issue, where there were common \ninterests between the United States and Venezuela. I believe it is \naccurate to say that as a result of the conversations which I had with \nChavez, the Ambassador and the Minister of the Interior met.\n  It was kind of a rocky day because at the same time I had the meeting \nwith President Chavez, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld was in Peru, and \nhe commented in a condemnatory way about Chavez. Gratuitous insults do \nnot advance the pace or the cause of dialog. So I would say, even with \nPresident Chavez, we ought to make the effort.\n  President Obama had some comments about President Chavez on a Sunday \nnews show last week, which have started some mild fireworks. Chavez, \naccording to the press, retaliated that he had not thrown the first \nstone. It is my hope, even with Chavez, that we can engage in direct, \ncivil, courteous dialog to see if there are some areas where we can \nfind common cause.\n  I know, though, the occasions I have had to talk to Fidel Castro that \nthere were issues on sea lanes and other air lanes where the United \nStates could have cooperated on the interdiction of drugs. I have \nintroduced legislation which passed the Senate on two occasions and was \nstymied in the House of Representatives. But I mentioned this as \nillustrative of where I think we can go with an activist, engaged \nSecretary of State. It is my projection that Senator Clinton, soon to \nbe Secretary of State Clinton, will undertake those matters.\n  There is one additional comment I have to make, and that is on the \npotential conflict of interest between contributions which were made to \nformer President Clinton's Foundation and the activities of Secretary \nof State Clinton, if, as, and when she is confirmed. I think Senator \nLugar was exactly on target in the comments he made in the Foreign \nRelations Committee about what ought to be undertaken.\n  There has already been a memorandum of agreement that has been \nentered into on the subject of some substantial import. There is a \nmemorandum of understanding which related to this issue which was \nsigned on December 16 of last year, right after Senator Clinton was in \nthe running for this position.\n  It would be my hope that Secretary of State Clinton would rethink \nsome of the additional requests which Senator Lugar made. I do not \nthink they are disqualifiers, but I do believe it is a matter of \nconcern if, for example, some foreign government makes a contribution \nto the Clinton Foundation, then there are interests which that foreign \ngovernment has, I think we would understand and trust Secretary of \nState Hillary Clinton that, in the eyes of many, especially those in \nthe Arab world, they may be suspicious of what would appear to them to \nbe a potential conflict of interest.\n  But I trust Hillary Clinton's good judgment, and I think she will \nwork through the issues and the memorandum of understanding which was \nexecuted on December 16 of last year, and the additions she has made go \na long way, and it would be my hope that she would rethink what Senator \nLugar has suggested. She is a very ethical person and a wise person. I \nthink she can undertake to handle this issue satisfactorily.\n  So for these reasons I am pleased to speak on her behalf, and I think \nthe temper of this body is to give her an overwhelming vote of \nconfidence so she can carry out the very important responsibilities of \nSecretary of State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. I \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator and \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee from Massachusetts. It is \ninteresting, this is the first day after the inauguration of President \nBarack Obama--my ninth inauguration, by far the most impressive--and I \nhave the great pleasure to speak in support of the confirmation of my \nfriend and colleague, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to be our next Secretary \nof State.\n  Secretary-designee Clinton's stature, intellect, her experience make \nher uniquely qualified to take on this role, a role which comes at a \ncritical time in our history.\n  As chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the State \nDepartment and our foreign assistance programs, I look forward to \nworking closely with her and President Obama as they embark on the \ncritical task of restoring America's leadership and image abroad.\n  I appreciate the conversations I have had with both of them in this \nregard. Some 8 years ago, President Bush inherited a balanced Federal \nbudget. We were actually paying down the national debt. We had the \nbiggest surplus in history. The U.S. economy was strong, and the \ncountry was at peace.\n  Now, 8 years later, his successor, President Obama, has inherited \nfrom him the largest deficit in our Nation's\n\n[[Page S690]]\n\nhistory, an economic crisis and unemployment rate unlike any this \ncountry has experienced since the Great Depression, a budget deficit \ngreater than any nation on Earth has ever had, Osama bin Laden has yet \nto be captured, more than 180,000 U.S. troops are fighting wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, the Middle East peace process is in shambles, the \ncountry is more dependent than ever on foreign oil, and the country's \ninternational reputation has been badly damaged as a result of policies \nthat were contemptuous of the values of which this Nation was founded. \nThat is the good news for the new President and the Secretary of State-\ndesignee.\n  I do not envy President Obama for the multitude of misguided policies \nand problems he has inherited, but all the more reason he needs the \nbest men and women to work with him. Secretary of State-designee \nClinton is going to serve him and the country well as they take on \nthese challenges.\n  During the election, I remember saying to President Obama that we \nneeded him to reintroduce America to the rest of the world. I have, in \nconversations with Senator Clinton, told her, what better person to go \naround the world than Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State to \nreintroduce America and the great core values of this Nation. What \nbetter person to do it than Hillary Clinton?\n  In her confirmation before the Foreign Relations Committee last week, \nshe discussed the need to use ``smart power,'' including ``the full \nrange of tools at our disposal.''\n  I am glad to see her support for foreign assistance reform. We need \nthat, and we have learned over the past several years we cannot take \nfor granted the unwavering allegiance of any country in the world. We \nhave to work at keeping those relationships. It is not amateur hour, \nand I appreciate Secretary-designee Clinton's recognition of the value \nand experience of dedicated international affairs public servants and \nher plans to support and enhance that capacity.\n  She is going to become immersed in the immensely difficult problems \nthat were ignored or badly mishandled by the outgoing administration: \nthe Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Sudan, Mexico, Somalia \nand central Africa. All these pose particularly vexing challenges which \nshe has to confront immediately, and the sooner she is there, the \nbetter.\n  I will mention a couple of other items. The Federal law prohibiting \nU.S. assistance to units of foreign security forces that violate human \nrights was first enacted a dozen years ago. The State Department is \nstill struggling with implementing it, particularly with regard to the \nmonitoring of military equipment provided to foreign governments.\n  This law, known as the Leahy amendment, has been applied unevenly \ndepending on the country, and I urge Secretary-designee Clinton to \nreview the Leahy amendment to ensure its vigorous and consistent \nimplementation.\n  Ten years ago this March, the Convention on the Prohibition of the \nUse, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and \non Their Destruction came into force. Today, there are 156 countries \nthat have signed this treaty. The most powerful Nation on Earth, the \nUnited States, has not.\n  The U.S. military has not used the types of antipersonnel landmines \nprohibited by the treaty since 1991, and it has no plans to do so. I \nwould urge her to go back to that.\n  Mr. President, like President Obama, Secretary-designee Clinton \nrecognizes the need for strong United States leadership in an \nincreasingly complex, dangerous, and interdependent world. She \nunderstands that most global and regional problems cannot be solved by \nthe U.S. alone, that we need to act boldly and change the status quo \nwhen it no longer serves our interests or reflects our values, \nstrengthen and expand our alliances, help the poorest countries develop \neffective and accountable institutions, and pursue policies that \nenhance our image abroad.\n  Today, as we leave the troubled policies of the past 8 years behind \nus, the American people should feel fortunate, as I do, that Hillary \nRodham Clinton will be our new Secretary of State.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. I will be \njoining with him proudly to vote for the confirmation of Hillary Rodham \nClinton to be our next Secretary of State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \nclear summary of the task ahead, and those challenges are enormous. \nIndeed, as we all know, I particularly thank him as an old friend. And \nas the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee, we work in close \npartnership, and I am grateful that his values are where they are \nbecause it empowers us to put the muscle, the money, support, and the \nimplementation of the policies that committee struggles to formulate. \nSo we really appreciate the relationship. I thank him for his comments \nvery much.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides? We are about to \npropound a unanimous consent request. I think we are going to be able \nto have a vote around 4 o'clock, hopefully. I want to allow for the \nmajority leader to get back to make a couple of comments himself. But I \nwould like to get a sense of the time that remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 19 \nminutes, the Republicans control 27 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Obviously, we intend to yield back on both sides. I thank \nthe Chair. I know the distinguished Senator from Maryland has been \nwaiting patiently. He would like to add a few thoughts. I yield him 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me thank our distinguished chairman \nfor yielding me this time.\n  My colleagues have talked frequently about how our colleague, Senator \nClinton, is the right person at the right time to be the Secretary of \nState. We have talked a great deal about her experience. As First Lady \nof this Nation, she traveled frequently around the world. She knows \nfirsthand the problems that America confronts internationally. With \nexperience as the Senator for New York, serving on the Armed Services \nCommittee, she understands the critical role the State Department plays \nin our national security. With her service on the Helsinki Commission, \nshe knows firsthand the importance that the Department of State can \nplay in human rights issues around the world. For all of those reasons, \nshe is truly the right person to represent our Nation as Secretary of \nState. She is an iconic figure for American values and for hope for \npeople around the world.\n  I wanted to comment about how President and Mrs. Clinton have \nprovided disclosure. It is unprecedented the amount of the financial \ninformation they have opened to the public.\n  I particularly want to thank our former President, Bill Clinton, for \nhis humanitarian work. We all know that Government cannot do it alone. \nYet he has been able to deal with the international humanitarian needs \nthrough the use of foundations and getting other people involved. But I \nparticularly want to thank the former President and the foundation for \nwhich he is responsible for the unprecedented disclosures that they are \nmaking. We will know all the contributors. They have agreed that before \nnew contributions are made it will be cleared through the Government \nethics bureau to make sure there is not even the appearance of a \nconflict. So they are doing good things for our country. The foundation \nis doing good things for humanitarian needs. We know that.\n  The Clintons have taken extraordinary steps to do the right thing for \nthis country in the disclosure and the work they do. It is now time for \nus to do the right thing and confirm Hillary Clinton as the next \nSecretary of State for our Nation.\n  I thank the Chair for yielding me the time. I would yield back the \nremainder of my time to the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow.) The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, for the sake of colleagues I reiterate, \nin about 15 minutes, after the majority leader has returned and had a \nchance to speak on this nomination, we will proceed to a vote.\n  It is my understanding--I was going to ask for unanimous consent--\nthere is\n\n[[Page S691]]\n\na request by someone on the other side to have a rollcall vote. So \nthere will be a rollcall vote at that time.\n  We are going to be making that request in a few minutes. Let me speak \nfor the couple of minutes we have left to share a couple of quick \nthoughts, if I may.\n  This is the beginning of the 25th year that I have had the privilege \nof serving on the Foreign Relations Committee. I have seen the ups and \ndowns, the waves of opportunities and lost opportunities that we have \nlived through in the course of that time, the heady years of the 1980s, \nwhen arms control was the centerpiece of our focus and analysis, and we \nwere in the middle of the Cold War. The committee contributed \nsignificantly to the dialog at that time about MX missile deployments \nand nuclear warheads, tactical, conventional weapons, how to count. \nFundamentally, that was altered through the significant daring of \nPresident Reagan to meet with President Gorbachev in Reykjavik and \nnegotiate a pretty remarkable reduction in nuclear warheads at that \ntime. It was against the conventional wisdom, and it is proof of the \nopportunities we face today, many of which run against the conventional \nwisdom.\n  I am convinced President Obama and Secretary-to-be Clinton--with the \ninput and cooperation of the Congress and our committee--stand on the \nthreshold of a new moment of those kinds of opportunities. If Richard \nNixon had not dared to send his then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger \nto China to meet with Mao Tse Tung and, indeed, even to cross the \nbarrier to go to Red China, as we knew it, against the wishes of many \nof the people in his own party and the wing of his party which found it \nheresy, we would not have opened China and begun a process of that \nrelationship. There is an opportunity at this moment for an even \ngreater relationship with China. I don't think we have begun to forge \nthe kind of cooperative effort that is available to us, if we will \nengage on a much more regular and intensive basis and look for the \nplaces of commonality and agreement of interest.\n  There are many, frankly. Most people who analyze and think about \nChina come to the conclusion that there is a greater opportunity for a \ncooperative, respectful partnership than there ought to be any kind of \nfears of hegemony or other kinds of expansive desires on China's part. \nMost people interpret the current modernization of China's military as \nbeing a fairly normative modernization process within the scale of \nthings and not something that should be translated by the United States \nor others into a new arms race. I am convinced there is a great deal \nmore to be achieved with China, provided we are disciplined and \nthoughtful about the setting of priorities and that we have a clear set \nof priorities.\n  One thing is clear. In the management of our relationships with China \nor with Russia or some other countries, we can't do everything all at \nthe same time. That is a bit of the way our diplomacy has been managed \nover these past years. For instance, even with Russia, if we are more \nthoughtful about the missile shield and more thoughtful about NATO \nexpansion and if we engage in a greater dialog about the mutuality of \ninterest in those regions, we can avoid significant misinterpretations \nand counterreactions that come as a consequence of not talking and not \nunderstanding the motives, intentions of another country.\n  Even as a child, when I was the son of a foreign service officer, I \nalways heard people talking around me about how Americans are very good \nat seeing the rest of the world through their own lens but not \nparticularly adept at looking at another country's aspirations, fears, \nthreats, hopes through their eyes. The more we can foster a foreign \nservice that is historically, culturally, linguistically, and otherwise \nimmersed in the full culture of a particular country, the better we \nare, frankly, going to do in terms of determining our own foreign \npolicy future and decisions. President Obama and Hillary Clinton \nclearly understand the imperative of changing how we have made some of \nthose decisions.\n  When I became a member of the Arms Control Observer Group in the \nSenate, something now defunct but something we might wish to think \nabout enhancing in the context of proliferation issues, one of the \nthings that always struck me was the degree to which from the time we \nused the bomb at Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the only nation that, \nincidentally, has ever exploded an atomic weapon against another \npeople, from that moment forward, almost every weapon transition, with \nthe exception of two--it was either the long-range bomber and/or the \nsilent submarine--almost every weapon advancement in the course of the \nentire Cold War, we were first in the development of the new, more \ntechnologically advanced weapon, whatever it was. Almost without \nexception, our principal opponents at the time, the Soviet Union, came \nas quick as they could afterward and met that challenge. So we always \nratcheted up, up until the point that we were at something like 30,000 \nwarheads. Today we are somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000-plus \nwarheads.\n  It is my firm belief that in this next year, we have an opportunity \nto negotiate an agreement with Russia, where we actually ratchet down \nto about 1,000 warheads, which would be the lowest we have had in the \ncourse of that period of time, since the beginning, and still be safe; \nin fact, be safer. Because if you have the kinds of controls with \nverification, inspection that get you to that level, then you begin to \nsend a message to the rest of the world that you are serious about \nnonproliferation, and you begin to send a message that says to the \nworld: The United States is taking the lead, and we will live by the \nstandards we try to foist on other people. Most importantly, we make \nthe world safer because we reduce the capacity for fissile material to \nfall into the wrong hands.\n  I will continue to press this thousand-warhead concept. My hope is it \nwill become a centerpiece of the START talks and where we proceed. It \nis interesting because, even as we have these now 5,000-plus or so \nwarheads--and that, incidentally, depends on accounting rules because \nwe don't count the same weapons all the time--the fact is that China, \naccording to public estimates, nothing classified but public estimates, \nhas about 23 warheads. They may ratchet that up because of our lack of \nhaving moved from where we are and other reasons. The fact is, they \nhave been pretty content to feel secure with 23. Most rational people, \nthinking about the use of warheads, understand the implications of \nusing only a few.\n  One of the things I learned at nuclear, chemical and biological \nwarfare school, when I served in the Navy, was the full implication of \njust one or two or three weapons. So when you think in terms of \nthousands and so forth, in today's world, where the principal conflict \nis religious extremism and terrorism associated with it, you have to \nput a huge question mark over the theories that continue to spend the \namounts of money that we do and create the kinds of insecurity that we \ndo as a consequence.\n  This is a moment of rather remarkable opportunity. I recently was in \nPakistan and Afghanistan, India. India and Pakistan are still engaged \nin literally old-fashioned, mostly Cold War, old, bad-habit \nconfrontation. In fact, both sides know the concept of war would be \nabsurd, when the real threat to both of them comes internally from \npeople who are disgruntled and disenfranchised and otherwise seduced \ninto believing that by adopting one religious ideology or another or \nnone, that they are somehow advantaging themselves. This is an \nopportunity to forge a new relationship across the world, as the \nPresident did yesterday. I thought one of the most important phrases he \nuttered in his speech was his outreach, his holding his hand out to the \nMuslim world to ask people to come together. One of the things that \nmost struck me in these last years is the degree to which religious, \nfanatical, violent extremists have actually been able to isolate the \nUnited States within that world rather than us being able, together \nwith modern Islam, to isolate them.\n  That is one of the things President Obama and this administration \noffers us, an opportunity to have a completely different kind of \ninterfaith, global dialog that begins to empower modern Islam to take \nback the legitimacy of their religion. It is my hope and prayer that \nwill be a centerpiece of this administration's foreign policy.\n  There is much to do. Obviously, Somalia and East Congo, the trouble \nof\n\n[[Page S692]]\n\nDarfur that remains, populations in Egypt and Saudi Arabia and \nelsewhere that grow at an astonishing rate so that perhaps 60 percent \nof Saudi Arabia and Egypt are under the age of 21, 50 percent under the \nage of 18, it is a stunning growth of young people who need a future. \nIf that future is reduced to madrasas and to the distortion of the \nopportunities of life, we all pay a price. Our children in the future \nwill pay a price. So these choices that President Obama and Secretary \nClinton will face, together with the Congress, are significant.\n  Then, of course, there is one issue many people don't always think of \nas a national security/foreign policy issue. That is global climate \nchange. I have attended almost every major conference since the Rio \nconference of 1992. I remember going down there with then-Senator Al \nGore, and Senator Gore and I and a few others had held the first \nhearings on global climate change in 1988. I have watched the \nprogression of all these years as all the warnings of 1988 have come \ntrue and more. Now our scientists are revising their latest \npredictions. Only a year ago, 2 years ago, they were saying we could \nsustain 550 parts per million of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \nNow they have revised that, not just down to 450, but they are \nbeginning to talk about 350 parts per million as being the acceptable \nlevel.\n  The latest science, regrettably, shows that Mother Earth is giving us \nfeedback at a rate that is coming at us faster and in a greater degree \nthan any of those scientific reports offered. The result is that \nchallenge grows greater, not smaller. I regret to say we are emitting \ngreenhouse gases at a rate that is four times faster than it was in the \n1990s. We are not doing the job. No other country is either entirely, \nbut we are the worst because we, regrettably, are 25 percent of the \nworld's global greenhouse gas emissions. Almost every country I have \ntalked to in the last years, as we discuss how we are going to deal \nwith this, looks back at us and says: We are waiting for your \nleadership.\n  I have communicated this to President Obama. He has indicated he \nintends to be serious about it. But the latest modeling shows that if \nyou take every single current proposal of every country in the world \nthat has a proposal--and that is not many--and you extend the curve out \nin the modeling to take all the input of today from the science and \nmeasure it against those current plans, we fall woefully short of what \nwe need to do in order to meet this challenge. We will see an increase \nof somewhere between 600 and 900 parts per million which is \ninsupportable with respect to life as we know it. We will see a degree \nof temperature increase of somewhere from 3.5 to 6 degrees centigrade. \nWe have seen exactly what that means in terms of the migration of \nforests, the destruction of ocean currents, the increase of violent \nstorms, the destruction of property, the movement of whole populations \nwho will live with new drought, new water problems, and other issues.\n  So, Madam President, I think we are running out of time. I am sort of \nstalling here waiting for the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is what I figured.\n  Well, on that inauspicious note, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed now until he comes. Then I will put in a quorum \ncall in a few moments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. To finish that thought, the ice sheets in the Arctic are \nmelting. We anticipate now, according to the science, we are going to \nhave an ice-free arctic in the summer in about 10 years. The problem \nwith that is that as more ice disappears, more water is evident, is \navailable, and the water, unlike the ice sheet, which acts as a \nreflecter for the Sun's rays, acts to absorb the Sun's rays. So the \nmore the ice melts, the warmer the ocean becomes and the faster it \nbegins to continue the rest of the melting.\n  The result is, we begin to change the entire ecosystem in ways that \nscientists cannot predict completely, but it has a profound impact on \nthe ecosystem. Moreover, it adds to the melting of the Greenland ice \nsheet. The Greenland ice sheet, unlike the arctic ice sheet, which \nfloats, and, therefore, does not change the displacement--the Greenland \nice sheet is on rock.\n  Right now, you can go up there. The Senator from California went up \nthere last summer with a group. You can stare down a hole 100 feet \ndeep, and you can see a torrent of a river running down off that ice \ninto the ocean. Scientists are worried that the water layer underneath \nthe ice actually creates a potential that a huge block of ice may slide \noff and fall into the ocean.\n  The rest of it continues to melt. The implication of the Greenland \nice sheet melting is that is where you get your 16 to 23 feet of sea \nlevel rise.\n  Now, all I can tell you is, all of these impacts are irreversible--\nirreversible--so we are staring at an abyss of irreversibility. The \nbest choice for people in positions of high responsibility like us and \npublic people who make these choices is the whole precautionary \nprinciple. If we are told we can avoid it by doing X, Y, and Z, and the \nimplications of not avoiding it are disaster, we have a responsibility \nto try to avoid it.\n  Now, we have to do this. It means a fundamental, profound change in \nour economy. That means shifting our energy grid, moving toward solar \nand renewables. People sort of scratch their heads and say: Well, is \nthat kind of dreamy, goo-goo, crazy thinking? The answer is no. I had a \nventure capitalist in my office last week who wants to build a 600-\nmegawatt solar powerplant in the Southwest of our country and they \ncannot get the financing right now.\n  So this economic crisis is, in fact, an economic opportunity that \nalso has profound national security implications because to the degree \nwe lead in our responsibilities to go to Copenhagen--where we have an \ninternational meeting next December, where we have an opportunity to \nfix the Kyoto treaty with a new agreement, which will have a huge \nimpact on people all across the planet--that is one of the major \nchallenges before the Obama administration.\n  I know the President is very committed to trying to move forward on \nthis issue. But he and Secretary of State Clinton are going to have a \nhuge challenge to persuade countries to do difficult things, to \npersuade Americans to change some of our habits and do difficult \nthings.\n  I am told by experts that you could produce six times the electricity \nneeds of the entire United States of America--six times--from either \nconcentrated solar photovoltaics or solar thermal in Utah, Colorado, \nCalifornia, New Mexico, and Arizona, and I think that is the heart of \nit. Those approximately six States or so could wind up providing us \nwith the base from which we could provide that. I am confident the \ntechnology will move forward.\n  So I wholeheartedly support, as I have said in the committee, and as \nI have said earlier in my opening comments, the nominee. I believe \nSenator Clinton is in a position to provide a historical shift in \nAmerican foreign policy where we reach out to the world with the best \nof our values and the best of our thinking and the best of our hopes \nand intentions. I think this can be a moment where we renew America's \nproud role as a global leader, where we touch the hearts and minds of \npeople all across the planet, and where we have an opportunity to say \nto future generations, we met our responsibility.\n  Having said that, the distinguished majority leader is here and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate the leadership of the chair \nof our Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Kerry. In the short time he \nhas assumed the responsibilities of that most important committee, he \nhas done a remarkably good job, and the best is yet to come. He \nmentioned here briefly some of the things he wants to do dealing with \nthe scourge we find ourselves in with global warming, and it is going \nto be remarkable, the work he does.\n  Madam President, we are moving forward on the vote on the nomination \nof Senator Hillary Clinton to be Secretary of State.\n  Senator Clinton is uniquely capable and profoundly prepared to lead \nour\n\n[[Page S693]]\n\nState Department at a time of unprecedented global challenges, and at a \ntime when quick confirmation of President Obama's national security \nteam is critical to protect us here at home.\n  We face two wars abroad, a complex and unpredictable crisis in the \nMiddle East, the nuclear ambitions of a volatile Iranian regime, \ntogether with the complexities of dealing with North Korea.\n  Senator Clinton has earned the admiration and respect of the global \ncommunity with her understanding that our international power must be \nboth strong and smart, that the true measure of our influence is not \njust the size and strength of our military, but also how we use other \ntools, including diplomacy and foreign assistance, to make the world \nsafer and more free.\n  Senator Clinton's exemplary qualifications and wise world view were \ndemonstrated in her confirmation hearings, where she showed a \ntremendous breadth and depth of knowledge on the major foreign policy \nissues we face in the world today.\n  We all remember Hillary Clinton's arrival in the Senate a few short \nyears ago--8 years ago. Some wondered--and some out loud--whether a \nformer First Lady who had become a favored target of the rightwing \ncould forge the relationships necessary to be an effective Senator for \nthe people of New York State. She answered that loud, and she answered \nit very clear.\n  Some questioned whether a person of such national and international \nacclaim would put in the time to get to know the inner workings of the \nSenate and the nitty-gritty of the legislative process. She answered \nthat big time.\n  It took no time for Senator Clinton to make believers from those \ndoubters. She became an instant favorite of Democrats and Republicans \nalike, a forceful advocate for both smart foreign policies and domestic \npolicies, and a remarkably effective student of bipartisanship.\n  In her time as First Lady of our country, serving as an American \nemissary to the world, and then in the Senate as a member of the Armed \nServices Committee, Hillary Clinton built the diplomatic skills and \nbreadth of knowledge one needs to be our next Secretary of State. She \nhas the full package.\n  All but one member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to \napprove this outstanding nominee. Democrats and Republicans alike stand \nin support of our friend and colleague, Senator Clinton.\n  I want spread on the Record my appreciation for John McCain coming to \nthe floor and saying: Let's approve her now. He tried to do that \nearlier today.\n  I ask all my colleagues to join me in sending the world a clear \nmessage that we stand behind President Obama and our new Secretary of \nState as they proceed together to the task of rebuilding our foreign \npolicy to be stronger, smarter, and more able to effectively lead the \nworld with moral strength once again.\n  Madam President, first, we yield back all time on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow vote on confirmation of the nomination of Senator Clinton to be \nSecretary of State, with the remaining provisions of the previous \nunanimous consent agreement in effect.\n  I would also say this: For all the new Senators and those who may \nhave forgotten, we are starting this vote a little earlier, so we will \nbe lenient here and not tie down the 15-minute rule. But in the future, \nwe are going to start this Congress as we ended the last one. We are \ngoing to have 15-minute votes. There will be a 5-minute time period for \npeople who are late getting here. But at the end of 20 minutes, the \nvotes are going to be closed. This will be hard on Democrats and hard \non Republicans, but it is a lot harder on everybody waiting around here \nfor these people to come to vote. So some people are going to miss some \nvotes, and I am sorry about that, but it is better for the body if we \nhave votes that end when they are supposed to.\n  As soon as this matter is completed relating to the confirmation of \nHillary Clinton, we are going to go back to Ledbetter. We would hope \nthat the Kay Bailey Hutchison amendment in the form of a substitute, \nwhich has been offered, can be debated today and that we can vote on \nthat this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Hillary Rodham Clinton, of New York, to be Secretary of State?\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I would ask that there not be responses from \nthe gallery. Thank you.\n  The clerk will continue with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton) \nand the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 94, nays 2, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 6 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--94\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--2\n\n     DeMint\n     Vitter\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Clinton\n     Kennedy\n       \n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I crafted the Ledbetter matter that is \nnow before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending business.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, am I correct that I was seeking \nrecognition when the Republicans suggested the absence of a quorum, and \nI was still seeking recognition--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator was standing to seek recognition, \nalthough the quorum call was placed without objection.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Again, I object to somebody asking for a quorum call to be \nplaced, Madam President. Perhaps I don't understand the rules after 34 \nyears here, but I was the first one seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I would like to ask the Senator from \nVermont, without relinquishing my right to the floor, if there is \nsomething he would like to do that would be short, and then we could go \nback to the business of the Ledbetter bill. I am happy to try to \naccommodate him.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as I said when a similar question was \npropounded by the distinguished Senator from Texas, I wish to speak on \nthe Ledbetter bill.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, would the Senator from Texas yield without \nlosing her right to the floor?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. There is a lot of time. We are going to be in session as \nlong as people want to talk. The issue before the Senate now is an \namendment offered by the Senator from Texas. Senator Mikulski, who is \nmanaging this bill, has been trying to get a time as to how long the \ndebate will take on this tonight. The distinguished Republican leader \nasked that we try to figure out what amendments are going to be laid \ndown tonight, and we will try to set up a series of votes, if \nnecessary, in the morning. So no one should feel they are being cut \noff. There is plenty of time. We are not going anyplace tonight. We are \non the Ledbetter legislation. I would hope we could work our way toward \na vision of completing this legislation sometime early tomorrow. I \nappreciate the Senator from Texas moving forward with this.\n  I know the strong feelings of the Senator from Vermont about this \nLedbetter legislation. It is a legal issue, and he is chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. But I hope everyone will be calm and relax. There \nis plenty of time for everyone to say whatever they want tonight.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent--and, of course, \nthe Senator from Texas can object and has every right to object--I ask \nunanimous consent that I be allowed to continue for all of 7 minutes, \nall on the Ledbetter bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, reserving the right to object, let \nme ask the Senator from Ohio, whom I promised 12 minutes, whether he \nwould be able to wait 7 minutes for Senator Leahy, after which I would \nturn the floor over to him before I discuss my own amendment?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I am more than happy to do that as long as I have a \nguarantee that after 7 minutes, I have a chance to offer my voice about \nthe amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, let me ask whether I could propose \nthis: I move that the Senator from Vermont be allowed 7 minutes on \nwhatever subject he chooses, after which the Senator from Ohio would \nhave 12 minutes, after which I would have the floor to speak on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/21/senate-section/article/S694-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S694-S712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2009--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 181) to amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act \n     of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, \n     and to modify the operation of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n     to clarify that a discriminatory compensation decision or \n     other practice that is unlawful under such Acts occurs each \n     time compensation is paid pursuant to the discriminatory \n     compensation decision or other practice, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Hutchison amendment No. 25, in the nature of a substitute.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas, and I \nespecially thank my dear friend from Ohio, whom we are going to miss \naround here.\n  Madam President, I held a hearing at which Miss Lilly Ledbetter \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It was one of the most \nmoving hearings we have had. The fact that a very activist, very \nRepublican Supreme Court had basically written new law to deny her \nrights was shocking to everybody before that committee.\n  I believe we have to pass the bipartisan Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \nso employers are not rewarded for deceiving workers about their illegal \nconduct and maybe signal to the Supreme Court to stop legislating, and \nstop being an activist Court, but to uphold the law as we write it.\n  One of the Justice Department's roles in our Federal system of \ngovernment is to protect the civil rights of all Americans, including \nthose that protect them against discrimination.\n  The Bush administration's erosion of longstanding interpretation of \nour antidiscrimination laws has created a new obstacle for victims of \npay discrimination to receive justice. That was a mistake when it was \nadvanced by the Bush-Gonzales et al. Justice Department. It was a \nmistake when five Justices on the Supreme Court adopted the Justice \nDepartment's erroneous interpretation of congressional intent. It \nculminated in an erroneous opinion written by Justice Alito.\n  I understand the Members on the other side of the aisle introduced \npartisan amendments to the legislation. They have that right. But it is \nmy belief that the amendments should be opposed for one simple reason: \nthey are going to allow illegal pay discrimination to continue.\n  We are going to hear that this might encourage workers who are being \npaid less as a result of discrimination to delay filing for equal pay. \nThat argument defies logic. Anyone who heard Ms. Ledbetter's testimony \nbefore either the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee knows that she, like other \nvictims of pay discrimination, had no incentive to delay filing suit. \nBut employers, based on the erroneous interpretation by the Supreme \nCourt, the activist interpretation by the Supreme Court, now have a \ngreat incentive to delay revealing their discriminatory conduct: \nblanket immunity.\n  The reality is, many employers do not allow their employees to learn \nhow their compensation compares to their coworkers'. They can hide it \nand hide it and hide it until these women finally retire, pray that \nthey never find out how they were discriminated against, and then say \nwhen they are found out: Oh, my goodness gracious, you should have \nfiled suit earlier. The fact that we had it all locked up and you \ncouldn't possibly have known you were being discriminated against is \nyour fault. These victims have the burden of proving the discrimination \noccurred and that evidentiary task is only made more difficult as time \ngoes on.\n  It seems it is always the woman employee's fault. That is wrong. \nWorkers like Ms. Ledbetter and her family are the ones hurt by the \nongoing diminished paychecks, not their employers.\n  The bipartisan Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 does not disturb the \nprotections built into existing law for employers, such as limiting \nbackpay in most cases to 2 years. It does not eliminate the existing \nstatute of limitations. Instead, it reinstates the interpretation of \nwhen the 180-day time limit begins to run, an interpretation that was \nrun over roughshod by the Bush administration at its urging by their \nappointees on the Supreme Court. The bill corrects this injustice to \nallow workers who are continuing to be short-changed to challenge that \non-going discrimination when the employer conceals its initial \ndiscriminatory pay decision.\n  Opponents of the bipartisan Ledbetter Fair Pay Act may raise other \nexcuses. They will no doubt\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\nclaim that somehow trial lawyers will benefit, but the reality is the \nSupreme Court in the Ledbetter decision could actually lead to more \nlitigation because people will feel they have to file premature claims \nso that time does not run out.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that this legislation \n``would not establish a new cause of action for claims of pay \ndiscrimination'' and ``would not significantly affect the number of \nfilings with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission'' or with the \nFederal courts.\n  Congress passed title VII of the Civil Rights Act to protect \nemployees against discrimination with respect to compensation because \nof an individual's race, color, religion, sex or national origin but \nthe Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision goes against both the spirit and \nclear intent of our antidiscrimination laws.\n  It also sends the message to employers that wage discrimination \ncannot be punished as long as it is kept under wraps.\n  At a time when one-third of private sector employers have rules \nprohibiting employees from discussing their pay with each other, the \nCourt's decision ignores a reality of the workplace--pay discrimination \nis often intentionally concealed.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is the only bill that gives workers \nthe time to consider how they have been treated and the time to work \nout solutions with their employers. Our bipartisan bill fulfills \nCongress's goal of creating incentives for employers voluntarily to \ncorrect any disparities in pay that they find. Most importantly, our \nbipartisan bill ensures that employers do not benefit from continued \ndiscrimination.\n  I will not support amendments that weaken this bipartisan bill. I \nsupport the ability of all employees to receive equal pay for equal \nwork.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is the only bill that gives workers \nthe time to consider how they have been treated and the time to work \nout a solution with their employers. Our bipartisan bill fulfills \nCongress' goal of creating incentives for employers voluntarily to \ncorrect any disparities in pay they find. I am not going to support \namendments that weaken this bipartisan bill. I support the ability of \nall employees to receive equal pay for equal work. It comports \ncompletely with what we learned in the Judiciary Committee.\n  I applaud the Senator from Maryland. I applaud her cosponsors. I am \nproud to be one of them.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Before the Senator from Ohio speaks as agreed upon, I \nthank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his compelling \nremarks and steadfast support for women generally and certainly for his \nlongstanding advocacy that women should be paid equal pay for equal or \ncomparable work. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from Ohio \nis recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nHutchison substitute amendment.\n  Before I discuss the merits of the Hutchison amendment, I wish to \nthank Senator Mikulski for her commitment to debate this legislation in \na constructive manner. As Senator Mikulski said, we can disagree, \nwithout being disagreeable.\n  I thank the Democratic leader, the Senator from Nevada and the \nminority leader, the Senator from Kentucky, for agreeing that we will \nmake our best efforts to return to the tradition here in the Senate of \ndebating bills and allowing amendments to be offered, and returning \nthings to the point where I think it will enhance the reputation of \nthis great body in terms of the body that is looking in on us. I hope \nthis is the beginning of a new era here. I think the more we can work \ntogether, the better they are going to feel about the future of our \ncountry.\n  I would also like to thank my colleague, Senator Hutchison, who I \nknow is extremely busy in her role as ranking member of the Commerce \nCommittee. Her efforts to draft a solution are commendable. Senator \nHutchison is in a strong position to speak on issues arising from both \nher substitute amendment and Senator Mikulski's underlying legislation. \nAs Senator Hutchison said in her opening remarks, as a young lawyer \ncoming out of law school, she experienced the nefarious consequences of \ngender discrimination. In addition, I think her experience as a small \nbusiness owner and the general counsel of a bank provides Senator \nHutchison with the unique perspective to understand the problems with \nSenator Mikulski's legislation.\n  There is one thing on which we all agree: Gender and other forms of \ndiscrimination are wrong, illegal, and they should not be tolerated. \nThis debate should not be about whether one party condones illegal \ndiscrimination; rather, this debate must focus on how to strike the \nright balance to address the situation in which a person is subject to \nan individual act of discrimination but through no fault of their own \nhas no way to know about it.\n  As I mentioned during my retirement announcement last week, one of \nthe reasons I decided to retire in 2 years was the desire to spend more \ntime with my family. I am the proud father of a daughter, Betsy, who \ngraduated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. When she was growing up, I \nsaid: Honey, the sky is the limit for whatever you want to do.\n  In addition to my daughter Betsy, I have seven grandchildren, and six \nof them are girls. I have said the same thing to them: The sky is the \nlimit. My oldest granddaughter, Mary Faith, is 12 years old. One of \nthese days, she is going to be out in that business world. I want \nBetsy, Mary Faith, and all my grandchildren, to have the opportunity to \nreach their full potential based on their God-given talents, and not be \nconstrained by outdated prejudices.\n  Based on the debate so far, I believe there is a good deal of \nagreement between Members who support Senator Hutchison and Members who \nsupport Senator Mikulski's legislation. For example, we agree that \ndiscrimination based on gender is illegal and wrong. We also agree that \nthe dynamics of the modern workplace may make instances of such \ndiscrimination difficult to detect if the discrimination is reflected \nin pay decisions.\n  Unlike when someone is denied a job, a promotion, or is terminated, \npaycheck discrimination may not be obvious. The source of our \ndisagreement is how to find a solution to address this specific issue.\n  Before I address the specifics of why I support Senator Hutchison's \namendment over Senator Mikulski's legislation, I believe there are some \nmisconceptions about the Supreme Court's Ledbetter v. Goodyear \ndecision. Advocates of the Ledbetter legislation have continued to \nstate that passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act will restore the \nlaw to what it was before the Supreme Court's decision. This is \nmisleading. In its Ledbetter decision, the Supreme Court clarified a \nfaulty interpretation of its early decision in Bazemore v. Friday. The \nSupreme Court did not change the underlying statute of limitations in \ntitle VII.\n  I think it is helpful to understand what the Court did in \ndistinguishing these two cases. The Court's Bazemore decision held that \nif an employer's pay structure is facially discriminatory, that is, the \npay structure sets different compensation on criteria like race or \ngender, then the paycheck is the last act of illegal conduct from which \nthe 180-day filing period begins. The Court, rightfully in my opinion, \ndistinguished this from the situation in Ms. Ledbetter's lawsuit.\n  With Ms. Ledbetter's lawsuit there was not a discriminatory pay \nstructure in place, but rather allegations of specific acts of \ndiscrimination. The Court found those discrete acts occurred outside \nthe 180-day filing period. I think that is an important distinction \nMembers should understand.\n  Still, as some of my colleagues pointed out during this debate, \nspecific and discrete acts of wage-based discrimination may be very \ndifficult to detect within the 180-day filing period provided under \ntitle VII. This could lead to situations in which an employer escapes \nliability simply because the person did not know that a discriminatory \nact took place.\n  In such a situation, the 180-day filing rule appears to reward bad \nbehavior and harm the person facing the illegal discrimination. I agree \nwith Senator Mikulski that under this situation a strict 180-day filing \nrule is unfair.\n  As one of my colleagues supporting the Ledbetter legislation pointed \nout,\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\nthe Supreme Court, in TRW v. Adelaide and in an opinion authored by \nJustice Ginsburg, interpreted a statute of limitations arising under \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act as starting ``from the date on which the \nliability arises.'' Understanding this could unduly penalize victims of \nidentity theft, Congress enacted a fix as part of the Fair and Accurate \nCredit Transaction Act of 2003. This fix extended the relevant statute \nof limitations based on the ``discovery by the plaintiff'' of the \nimpermissible conduct.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the approach the Ledbetter legislation \ntakes. Rather, it would adopt a rule allowing for the filing of \nlawsuits 180 days after the last paycheck issued by the employer that \nwas affected by a discriminatory act, even if it was a single act that \noccurred many years ago. Thus, the Ledbetter legislation could allow \nfor the filing of lawsuits long after someone knew they were subject to \na discriminatory act, effectively eliminating the statue of limitations \nfrom title VII in many cases.\n  As the Supreme Court noted in its Ledbetter decision, statutes of \nlimitations serve an important policy of repose in our justice system. \nUnder American legal principles, it has long been public policy that a \nperson should not be called into court to defend claims that are based \non conduct long past.\n  As many of my colleagues who have practiced law know, it can be very \ndifficult to mount a defense in cases in which the underlying conduct \noccurred long ago because witnesses are difficult to locate, memories \nfade, and records are not maintained. In Ms. Ledbetter's case, the \nsupervisor accused of the misconduct died by the time of the trial. Yet \nunder the approach taken by the Ledbetter legislation, defendants could \npotentially find themselves facing lawsuits that are years, if not \ndecades, old.\n  Because she recognizes that paycheck discrimination may not be \nobvious in the modern workplace and that a bad actor should not benefit \nfrom hiding such discrimination, Senator Hutchison crafted a sensible \ncompromise. Under the Hutchison amendment, a person could bring a claim \nunder title VII within 180 days after obtaining knowledge or \ninformation that the person is the victim of discriminatory conduct. In \nother words, you don't start the 180-day statute of limitations until \nthe person knows or has reasonable suspicion that she is subject to a \ndiscriminatory wage. But once you know you have been discriminated \nagainst, then it is your obligation to bring that to the attention of \nthe EEOC and start the process to obtain relief.\n  By allowing a person to bring a claim from 180 days after the \ndiscriminatory conduct is discovered, Senator Hutchison's amendment \nstops bad actors from benefiting, and addresses many of the concerns \nmany of my colleagues raised.\n  Unfortunately, the Ledbetter legislation would swing the pendulum \ncompletely in the opposite direction and create an open-ended legal \nliability that could expose businesses, the very entities we need to \nhelp us lift our economy out of this recession, to expensive new legal \nliabilities.\n  While this may not be good for insurance companies who write policies \nand trial lawyers who bring lawsuits, I do not believe the legislation \nis sound public policy.\n  Finally, I want to address a related issue before I yield the floor. \nBesides disagreeing on the solution to the issues created by the \nLedbetter decision, Senator Mikulski's legislation did not go through \nthe HELP Committee during this Congress.\n  While I understand the HELP Committee held one hearing on the \nLedbetter bill during the 110th, this hearing occurred before Senator \nHutchison introduced her legislation, which is now before us as the \npending amendment. As a result, the Senate is left without the wisdom \nof having testimony and information comparing the different approaches.\n  While I understand sometimes it is necessary to bypass committees, \nthe Senate has started to bypass the committee process too frequently. \nSo often, as a result of that committee process, compromises can be \nworked out so once the bill is out of committee in many instances you \ncan get a UC and get that legislation passed, or at least people have \nhad a chance to talk about it in terms of some compromise.\n  So I am glad to be involved in this debate, but I believe the Senate \nand our Nation would be better served if the Senate got back into the \nhabit of taking up legislation after it has gone through the relevant \ncommittee. In fact, I believe if these two legislative proposals had \nbeen discussed in the HELP Committee, the committee might have crafted \na compromise bill that had the support of most, if not all, of my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the remarks of \nthe Senator from Ohio who has much the same feeling about this I do. He \nwants to protect the employee who has known discrimination but also \nknowing that a business or small business needs to know what the \nliability might be and, hopefully, correct it if the notification is \ngiven in a timely way.\n  So I would look forward to talking about my amendment. At this time, \nI ask unanimous consent that my amendment be set aside in order for \nSenator Specter to be able to offer amendments, after which then \nSenator Mikulski will have the floor. Then when we get back to my \namendment, I would like to debate my amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. We wish to follow \nthe recommendations of our mutual leadership, which was to debate the \nHutchison substitute tonight but to get as many amendments laid down \ntonight as we can. The Senator from Pennsylvania has two amendments he \nwants to offer. So I agree with the plan of laying aside the Hutchison \nsubstitute, having the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, offer \nhis amendment, and at such time we will return to our robust debate on \nthe Hutchison substitute and, hopefully, we can get a regular order \ngoing back and forth.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think that is a good plan. I \nappreciate the accommodation of the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 26\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a rule of construction)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 26.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 26.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a rule of construction)\n\n       Strike the heading for section 6 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 6. CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act or any amendment made by this Act shall \n     be construed to prohibit a party from asserting a defense \n     based on waiver of a right, or on an estoppel or laches \n     doctrine.\n\n     SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree with the underlying approach that \nwomen ought to receive equal pay for comparable work. I voted for \ncloture on the Ledbetter bill in the last Congress. I had been a \ncosponsor of the bill. I had not cosponsored the legislation this year \nbecause of my interest in making two changes I think would improve the \nlegislation and would reduce the opposition.\n  I begin by congratulating Senator Mikulski and Senator Enzi for the \nvery important work they have done. I congratulate Senator Hutchison on \nthe amendment she has offered, the substitute. I intend to support her \namendment.\n  The time when the statute of limitations begins to run is when the \nemployee knew or should have known. I think that is fair. I think it is \nreasonable to say to an individual where you are being discriminated \nagainst, and you know about it, or you should, in reasonable diligence, \nknow about this. This is a standard used in the law in many areas: \nactual knowledge or constructive knowledge, where somebody should have \nknown. That is fair to say, at that point a person is on notice, they \nought to begin their lawsuit. It is fair for the statute of limitations \nto begin running at that time to give the defendant a fair opportunity \nto know about it.\n  The amendment I have offered is hand in glove with the concept of\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\n``should have known,'' that is, or actual knowledge, actual or \nconstructive, to provide that the defendant will have the defense based \non waiver or estoppel or laches. Waiver means you take an affirmative \nact and say: I do not want to assert my rights. That is a waiver. \nEstoppel means you are estopped from bringing the defense because of \nsome conduct on your part which precludes you from bringing the action, \nor estopped. You are estopped from bringing the claim. And laches means \ntoo much time has passed, that you are barred by time. These are \nequitable doctrines which have more flexibility as opposed to a \nspecific date. The essence of these defenses of waiver, laches, and \nestoppel was articulated in the dissenting opinion of Justice Ginsburg. \nShe disagreed in the 5 to 4 decision which precluded women from \nclaiming equal pay. She said that women ought to be able to claim equal \npay and employers have a fair right to defend if they can assert these \ndefenses.\n  So this is what Justice Ginsburg said: Allowing employees to \nchallenge discrimination ``that extends over long periods of time,'' \ninto the charge-filing period, does not leave employers defenseless \nagainst unreasonable or prejudicial delay. Employers disadvantaged by \nsuch delay may raise various defenses. Doctrines such as ``waiver, \nestoppel, and equitable tolling'' ``allow us to honor Title VII's \nremedial purpose without negating the particular purpose of the filing \nrequirement, to give prompt notice to the employer.''\n  So what Justice Ginsburg lays out are the defenses which the \nemployers would have in any event, but in putting it into the statute, \nit makes it conclusive. I think it is good so that you do not have an \nargument as to whether employers have these defenses. It allows the \nplaintiff to bring the claim, and allows a reasonable defense by the \nemployer.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Hutchison \namendment and my amendment be set aside so that I may lay down a second \nand final amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 27\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now call up amendment No. 27.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 27.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To limit the application of the bill to discriminatory \n                        compensation decisions)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LIMITING APPLICATION TO DISCRIMINATORY COMPENSATION \n                   DECISIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--In section 2(1) of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair \n     Pay Act of 2009, strike ``or other practices''.\n       (b) Civil Rights Act of 1964.--In section 706(e) of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 (as amended by section 3), strike \n     subparagraph (A) of paragraph (3) and insert the following:\n       ``(A) For purposes of this section, an unlawful employment \n     practice occurs, with respect to discrimination in \n     compensation in violation of this title, when a \n     discriminatory compensation decision is adopted, when an \n     individual becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation \n     decision, or when an individual is affected by application of \n     a discriminatory compensation decision, including each time \n     wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid, resulting in \n     whole or in part from such a decision.''.\n       (c) Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.--In \n     section 7(d) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (as amended by section 4), strike paragraph (3) and \n     insert the following:\n       ``(3) For purposes of this section, an unlawful practice \n     occurs, with respect to discrimination in compensation in \n     violation of this Act, when a discriminatory compensation \n     decision is adopted, when a person becomes subject to a \n     discriminatory compensation decision, or when a person is \n     affected by application of a discriminatory compensation \n     decision, including each time wages, benefits, or other \n     compensation is paid, resulting in whole or in part from such \n     a decision.''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the essence of this amendment is to \nstrike the term ``or other practices.'' The core issue here is pay, and \nthat is what I think we ought to deal with.\n  There are objections to this bill on the grounds that it is a lawyers \nbonanza and will allow a lot of litigation. Well, I do not think that \nis a sound argument, but I think there is merit in specifying that this \nlegislation is aimed at pay, and if you talk about other practices it \nis going to produce a lot of litigation because there is no definition \nof what the ``other practices'' means.\n  For example, other practices might be promotion, might be hiring, \nmight be firing, might be training, might be territorial assignment, \nmight be transfer, might be tenure, might be demotion, place of \nbusiness reassignment, might be discipline. All of these are \npossibilities when you talk about ``other practices.'' I do not purport \nto be making an exhaustive list. Those are only some of them, the \npossibilities on what might be included in other practices. When \ntalking about pay, you know what you are talking about. Now, if it is \nthe objective of the drafters of the bill to cover promotion or to \ncover hiring or to cover firing, fine; let's say so. If there is an \nintent to cover any of these other specific items, let's consider that. \nLet's make an evaluation as to whether that is a practice which \nrequires remedial legislation. But in order to have ``other \npractices,'' I think we have the potential of reaching a quagmire and \nhave a lot of litigation about what the intent was of Congress, a lot \nof questions as to what we intend to do.\n  Now, of course, in listing all of these items, if this amendment is \ndefeated, I know lawyers will be citing this argument to say, well, if \nthe amendment offered by Arlen Specter was defeated, it must mean that \nall of those other practices are included, and then some, which is not \nmy intent. But I do believe it would be a crisper bill, and we would \nknow exactly what we are talking about.\n  Again, I say if anybody wants to include other practices, so be it.\n  Mr. President, I was advised that the senior Senator from Illinois \nwas going to be here at 5:15. I want the Record to show that I finished \nmy comments 1 minute early so as to allow the manager to maintain her \ncommitment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me thank the Senator from the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania for his gracious acknowledgment of my opportunity to speak \non this legislation. I look forward to working with him. I hope we can \nget this passed.\n  Let me tell you what the issue is. Fundamentally, it is just basic. \nIn the case of Lilly Ledbetter, here is what it is coming down to: \nShould women be paid the same for work as men? That is it. That is the \nbasic question.\n  Lilly Ledbetter was a lady who worked at the Goodyear Tire plant in \nGadsden, AL. You do not expect to find a lot of women working in a \nplant like that, do you? She went on to the managerial part of the \nplant, which meant she was on her way up in the managerial ranks. She \nworked there for years, 19 years, and at the end of the 19 years when \nshe was near retirement, somebody said: Lilly, did you realize all of \nthese years you were working there that men who had the same job you \ndid were being paid more than you?\n  She said: That is not right. That can't be true.\n  She checked it out, and it was true. All those years she had the same \njob classification, the same job responsibilities, and she was paid \nless.\n  She said: It is not fair. I think I ought to receive compensation \nbecause the company basically discriminated against me just because I \nam a woman. She takes her case and files it. In most cases, it is a \npretty simple situation. What was the job; what did it pay. Did you pay \nwomen less than you paid men? These are basic fact questions. Then it \nmade it all the way across the street to the U.S. Supreme Court. Then \nnine Justices sat down to take a look at the Ledbetter case. The Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, and Sam Alito, a recent \nappointee by the Bush administration to the Supreme Court said: We are \nsorry, Ms. Ledbetter. You cannot recover for this discrimination.\n  She said: Why?\n  They said: Well, you should have discovered this and reported it the \nfirst time you got a discriminatory paycheck. The first time you were \npaid\n\n[[Page S698]]\n\nless than a man who had the same job, you had 180 days from that point. \nWhen that different paycheck was given, you had to file your claim.\n  Of course, common sense and life experience would tell you that most \npeople at work don't know what their fellow employee is being paid. \nLilly Ledbetter didn't know. She didn't know for 19 years that the men \nworking right next to her were being paid more than she. But the \nSupreme Court said: Sorry, Lilly Ledbetter. Darn shame, but you should \nhave filed this claim years ago. The fact that you are still being paid \na discriminatory wage doesn't work because you had 180 days from the \nfirst time they sent a different paycheck to a man than a woman to file \nyour claim, and you didn't do it. You are out of court. Thanks for \ndropping by. End of case.\n  I look back at these Supreme Court Justices' answers when they \nappeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee. I particularly remember \nChief Justice Roberts because he was the most impressive witness I had \never seen. He sat there for days and answered every question without a \nnote in front of him. He is a brilliant man. He made a point of saying: \nI feel like a Supreme Court Justice is an umpire. I'll call balls and \nstrikes there. I am not supposed to make up new rules for the ball \ngame. I'll watch the pitches coming in, and I'll call balls and \nstrikes.\n  This is a foul ball. This decision by that Supreme Court ignores the \nreality of the workplace today. I asked Senator Mikulski, who is \nleading our effort, what is the basic discrimination between men and \nwomen in pay today? She said it is about 78 cents for the woman and a \ndollar for the man. As a father of daughters and sons, I think my \ndaughters should be treated as fairly as my son. If they do the same \nwork, they ought to get the same pay. What Senator Mikulski says in her \nbasic bill, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, is we are not going to \nallow the Supreme Court decision to stand. It makes no sense. If the \ncompany is continuing to discriminate against you in its paycheck, that \nis good enough. You ought to be able to go to court, not the fact that \nthe discrimination started 10 years ago, 12 years ago, and you didn't \nknow about it.\n  Basically, in the law, we have this matter called the statute of \nlimitations. It says you get a day in court but only for a window of \ntime for most things. If you don't go to court in that window, you \ndon't get to go. You are finished. But we make an exception in most \ncases for what is known as fraud and concealment. If the person guilty \nof the wrongdoing has concealed what they are doing and you don't know \nit, you can't say the time is running. It doesn't run in that \ncircumstance because there is concealment. In this case, there is \nclearly a situation where you don't know what your fellow employee is \nbeing paid.\n  Senator Hutchison of Texas comes with an amendment. I am sure it is a \nwell-intentioned amendment, and I am sure she is not going to defend \npay discrimination. I am sure she doesn't stand for that; none of us \ndo. But she adds a provision, and I wish to make sure I have the \nlanguage right because it is important we take it into consideration. \nShe says her amendment would only permit a victim to bring a \ndiscrimination claim if she ``did not have, and should not have been \nexpected to have, enough information to support a reasonable suspicion \nof such discrimination.'' On its face it sounds: What is wrong with \nthat? What is wrong with that is now Lilly Ledbetter and people such as \nshe have a new burden of proof. They have to prove to the court they \nhad no reason to suspect their employer was discriminating against \nthem. It becomes subjective. It becomes difficult. It adds another \nhurdle. Why would we assert this hurdle? If anything happened yesterday \nin Washington, DC, it was an announcement of change in this town and in \nthis Nation. With the election of Barack Obama as President, many of us \nbelieve we are going to start standing up for folks who haven't had a \nfighting chance for a long time. People who are being discriminated \nagainst in the workplace, folks such as Lilly Ledbetter, who spent a \nlifetime getting less pay than the man right next to her, are going to \nhave their day in court, a chance to be treated fairly. That is what \nthis bill says. That is why Senator Mikulski's leadership is so \nimportant.\n  We are saying to the Supreme Court, wake up to reality. You don't \nknow what the person next to you is being paid. They don't publish it \non a bulletin board. Maybe they do for public employees such as us, and \nthat is right. But in the private sector, that doesn't happen. That is \nwhat this is all about. That is what the battle is all about.\n  Senator Hutchison comes here and says: Here is another thing Lilly \nLedbetter should have had to prove; in her words, Lilly Ledbetter would \nhave been required to prove that she should not have been expected to \nhave enough information to support a reasonable suspicion.\n  I think it goes too far. We ought to look at the obvious. If a person \nis a victim of discrimination, once they have discovered those facts \nand assert those in court, they should have compensation. Employers \nought to be given notice nationwide that we want people to be treated \nfairly, Black, White, and Brown, men and women, young and old, when it \ncomes to job responsibilities. If you do the work, you get the pay. If \nyou get discriminated against because your employer is secretly giving \nsomebody more for the same job, you will have your day in court.\n  I think it is pretty American, the way I understand it. It gets down \nto the basics of what this country is all about.\n  I salute Senator Mikulski for her leadership and urge my colleagues \nto oppose the Hutchison amendment and to pass the underlying bill.\n  Now I will quote a newspaper from Chicago which occasionally endorses \nme but not very often, the Chicago Tribune, no hotbed of liberalism. \nWhen they read the Ledbetter decision from the Supreme Court, they \nsaid:\n\n       The majority's sterile reading of statute ignores the \n     realities on the ground. A woman who is fired on the basis of \n     sex knows she has been fired. But a woman who suffers pay \n     discrimination may not discover it until years later, because \n     employers often keep pay scales confidential. The \n     consequences of the ruling will be to let a lot of \n     discrimination go unpunished.\n\n  Those who vote against the Ledbetter bill or vote for the Hutchison \namendment will allow a lot of discrimination in America to go \nunpunished. President-elect Obama has said that passing this bill as \none of the earliest items in his new administration is part of an \neffort to update the social contract in this country to reflect the \nrealities working women face each day.\n  I urge my colleagues to help update the social contract with this new \nadministration and this new day in Washington. Let us, after we have \ncleaned up the mall and all the folks have gone home, not forget why we \nhad that election, made that decision as a nation, and why America is \nwatching us to see if our actions will be consistent with our promises.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, is the pending legislation my \nsubstitute for the Mikulski bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendments are the two Specter \namendments.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 25\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nHutchison substitute be laid on the table and be the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it was my understanding that when \nSenator Specter laid aside my amendment, we would return to my \namendment, my substitute, after his two amendments had been offered. \nThat was what we intended and that is what I was trying to restore.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I believe that clarifies it. I concur. I withdraw my \nreservation of objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment of the Senator from Texas will be the pending business.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nHutchison substitute amendment to\n\n[[Page S699]]\n\nthe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. I do believe this substitute \namendment strikes a fair balance in ensuring that employees can be \nrelieved of discrimination. I wish to say, at the outset of my \ncomments, I am very pleased we are able to offer amendments to this \nlegislation. I do intend to work with my colleagues to craft and \nsupport any other amendments that I believe will improve the \nlegislation before us.\n  Before speaking directly to the Hutchison substitute, I wish to make \nvery clear one point: Discrimination because of an individual's gender, \nethnicity, religion, age or disability cannot be tolerated. No American \nshould be subject to discrimination. If they are, they have the right \nto the law's full protection.\n  The heart of the Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision is the ruling \nthat the law requires an employee to file a complaint within 180 days \nof when the discriminatory intent is first activated by paycheck. Last \nyear, I had the opportunity to speak with Lilly Ledbetter. I know she \nmade a visit to many offices. I had a good conversation. I believed her \nwhen she told me she didn't know her wages were lower than those of her \nmale colleagues. I agreed it is often very difficult, perhaps \nimpossible, to know how one's wages compare with another employee's, \nand that even if an employee does know that he or she is being paid \nless, that often it is very difficult to know for sure that the reason \nfor the disparity is discrimination.\n  The best solution to this problem, though, is not necessarily to \nrestart the clock at each paycheck. I believe the best solution is to \nclarify that if the employee did not know about the discriminatory \naction at the time it was supplied or could not have reasonably \nsuspected discrimination, the clock starts when that knowledge is \navailable to the employee or when it is reasonable for the employee to \nhave known of the discrimination.\n  It is also reasonable to require that an employee file a complaint in \na timely manner, once that knowledge or that suspicion is available. \nThe Hutchison substitute is a good fix to the Ledbetter decision. Her \namendment not only recognizes that many employees do not know what \ntheir colleagues are being paid or that any disparity is due to \ndiscrimination, the Hutchison substitute amendment would also restore \nthe reasonable requirement that the employee file a complaint in a \ntimely manner.\n  We all know memories have a tendency to fade away. Paperwork may be \nlost or thrown away. People leave jobs. Requiring an employee to file a \ntimely claim benefit benefits the employee in pressing his or her \nclaim. How can the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigate \na claim of discrimination and find the truth, if the discriminating \nsupervisor has retired, moved away or, perhaps, even died? That is what \nhappened to Lilly Ledbetter. The supervisor who made the original \ndiscriminatory decision about her wages died before she could even file \nher complaint. He wasn't even available to be questioned or cross-\nexamined. How can the EEOC find out the truth, if the records were lost \nthat show a woman or a minority or senior or disabled person's first \npaycheck was inordinately lower than the first paycheck of his or her \npeers?\n  So Senator Hutchison's amendment ensures that this clock does not \nstart running on the 180-day statute of limitations until an employee \nfinds out about, or could reasonably be expected to suspect, the \npossibility of discrimination. It ensures that workers can hold their \nemployers accountable for pay discrimination.\n  Now, some have argued--or some will argue--Senator Hutchison's \namendment would institute an unfair discovery rule. They argue it will \nforce employees to file before they are sure of discrimination, when \nthey may most fear retaliation. But I disagree. Senator Hutchison's \namendment says the clock starts when the employee ``did not have, and \nshould not have been expected to have, enough information to support a \nreasonable suspicion of such discrimination, on the date on which the \nalleged unlawful employment practice occurred.'' It does not say the \nemployee must file when they have a hunch. It says a ``reasonable \nsuspicion.''\n  Opponents of this amendment may also contend that the Lilly Ledbetter \nFair Pay Act simply restores the paycheck accrual rule that was in \nplace before the Supreme Court decision and that a discovery rule would \nbe a new hurdle for employees to deal with. Again, I disagree with \nthis. Prior to the Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision, the EEOC \napplied, through regulation, the concept--many attorneys are familiar \nwith it--of ``equitable tolling.'' This concept basically means that a \nplaintiff may proceed with a complaint notwithstanding missing a \ndeadline if the employee did not know he or she was being discriminated \nagainst.\n  The Hutchison amendment actually strengthens that familiar, often \nused legal concept that protects employees' rights by putting it in the \nstatute.\n  Opponents of placing a so-called discovery rule in the law also \nallege it would lead to confusion in the courts. They call it an \nunclear and untested rule. Again, I would disagree. The EEOC and the \ncourts are quite familiar with the concept of equitable tolling, and \nthere is substantial case law in which it has been applied.\n  Opponents also claim a discovery rule will force plaintiffs to prove \na negative--that the employee should not be expected to have known \nabout the discrimination--before they even get to the question of \nwhether there was discrimination. I believe it is fairly easy to prove \nthat one did not have access to the pay records of other employees, \nthat it is fairly easy to prove the piece of information that led the \nemployee to file the complaint was not available to him or her earlier.\n  I believe the substitute amendment we have before us strikes the \nright balance in ensuring that employees can be relieved of \ndiscrimination. It recognizes employees often do not know their pay is \ndifferent from their colleagues. It recognizes it is not always obvious \nthat a pay disparity is based on discrimination.\n  For those reasons, I have cosponsored this amendment by my colleague, \nSenator Hutchison, and I urge my other Senate colleagues to support it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for \nher support of my amendment.\n  I wish to lay out my amendment one more time, and then the long-\nsuffering and ever-patient Senator from Maryland will have the chance \nto rebut. She has been so wonderful about making sure everyone got a \nchance to speak and knowing we would still be here to debate this \namendment, and then setting a time agreement for the vote tomorrow, \nwhen the leaders have made that decision.\n  This is such an important issue. As the Senator from Alaska has said, \nand really everyone has said, we all want to make sure we give every \nopportunity to a person who has faced discrimination in the workplace \nto be able to have a redress of that discrimination.\n  The law, as it is today, gives 6 months for a person to be able to go \nforward to the EEOC, and then later to the courts, to say there has \nbeen an act of discrimination. Now, most of the time it is easy for an \nemployee to know when a cause of action occurs. If it is age \ndiscrimination and someone has been demoted; if it is a firing, of \ncourse; any lessening of duties or responsibilities, that is a signal \nthat perhaps there is some discrimination of some kind--whether it be \nbased on age or gender or whatever might be alleged.\n  The harder issue is pay, there is no question because most people do \nnot talk about what they make around the water cooler or in the break \nroom. Most people hold that close because there are many factors that \ngo into pay. Because of that, it is harder to do the fair thing. That \nis what I am trying to do with my amendment, to make sure there is a \nfair opportunity for an employee to have the right of redress and also \na fair opportunity for the person in business to know if there is a \nliability or a mistake.\n  If the Mikulski bill passes, one would be able to sit on a claim \nbecause it would not matter if the person should have known of the \nalleged discrimination. They can pick their time, and it could be \nmonths, years, decades after a discrimination has occurred. This is a\n\n[[Page S700]]\n\nproblem because the employer has to be able to have an opportunity to \nmount a legitimate defense with records that would be kept, with \nwitnesses who would come forward, with memories that would be fresh, to \ngive the employer the right to know what the liability is and be able \nto have witnesses or the person who is accused there to make the other \nside of the case.\n  In pay discrimination, what we are doing in my substitute is \nbasically setting a standard that will be uniform across the country, \nin all courts. It is what the Supreme Court has said should be the \ntest. In some districts, the court will say: Well, let's hear from the \nemployee why she did not know or why he did not know. If the court \nsays: Well, I think that is reasonable--maybe there is a policy in the \ncompany that if you talk about your salary, that is grounds for firing. \nNow, that would be a very strong presumption for the employee that \nmaybe they were in the dark. So we want that employee to have the right \nto say there is no way I could have known. There was a policy against \nit. But we need to have that standard across the board in every \ndistrict. Some courts will do it, but not every court will do it, which \nis why my substitute amendment is needed, because we need every \nemployee to have the ability to make the case that person could not \nhave known.\n  Now, the distinguished assistant majority leader said that puts the \nemployee with the burden of proof. Well, the employee is the plaintiff. \nThe plaintiff always has the burden of proof in our legal system. We \nwould certainly--if it were something that would make a difference to \nthe Senator from Maryland or the Senator from Illinois; if it would \nmake a difference that we would establish a rebuttable presumption that \nwould favor the employee but be allowed to be rebutted by the \nemployer--we could talk about that, and I would be open to that \nsuggestion.\n  But the plaintiff bringing the case in our system does have the \nburden of proof. What we want is to assure that responsibility is \ncodified in the law, that it is codified so that person has the right, \nbut also the responsibility to press a claim. This is the important \npart of the substitute that says we want the right of the employee to \nbe able to say they did not know, and why, and give courts the chance \nto apply a standard that would be set for everyone in this country to \nhave the right to press the claim if they did not know.\n  On the other hand, the reason we have statutes of limitations--and we \nhave had since the beginning of law in this country, and in other civil \nlaw countries--is that the defendant does have a right to be able to \nmake the defense and be able to anticipate what the liability might be. \nA small business that has a person come forward who has a claim from 10 \nyears ago, and they did not know the employer did not know this right \nwas accumulating and could result in a catastrophic effect on a small \nbusiness--when if the employee, when he or she suspected, brought \nforward this claim, perhaps it could be settled right then and there so \neveryone wins.\n  So I hope we can work on this bill so we do give fairness to both \nsides in a legal case. We wish to have the right of the employee to \ncome forward when that person knew or should have known within 6 months \nof that right accruing; and we need to have the right for the business \nto be able to have evidence, records, witnesses, and fresh memories to \nmount an effective case in defense if they are going to rebut the \ncharge. That is one part of the substitute.\n  The other part is, I think, also very important; and that is that in \nthe bill before us there is a major change in common law and in tort \nlaw that has also been a part of our legal system and our case law \nsince the beginning of law in our country and in other countries that \nhave the types of laws we do; and that is that a tort accrues a right \nto the person who is offended or damaged or hurt by another action. It \ndoes not accrue to another person who is affected by or might be \nconsidered affected by this claim.\n  Now, there are exceptions to that. But in the main, it is, I think, \nessential, if we are going to have a statute of limitations that goes \nbeyond the act itself--and in this case it would be 6 months, which is \nthe law today--that it accrue to the person actually injured, the \nemployee, and not some other person on behalf of the person who did not \nbring the case.\n  Under the Mikulski bill, the Ledbetter Act, a new right has been \ngiven to a person who may not be the person with the injury. So it \ncould be a case where the person dies after working at a place of \nemployment, a business. The person dies, and within 6 months of that \nperson's last paycheck and subsequent death, some other person--an \nheir, a child, a mother, a father--could bring a case, which the person \nwho has allegedly been discriminated against chose not to bring or did \nnot bring. In such an absurd case, possible under the Ledbetter bill, \nyou do not even have the person discriminated against to testify. I \nthink this is a very big hole in the concept of fair play that our \nlegal system tries to provide. By saying ``other affected parties,'' I \nthink we have opened up a whole new right and possible class of \nplaintiffs that has not been contemplated before and could achieve an \ninequitable result.\n\n  So I hope very much that people will look at my substitute and try to \nget to the same end Senator Mikulski and I both want, by trying to \nshape the legislation so that it keeps the fairness in the process for \na person who claims a discrimination and a person in the business that \nhas hired this person to have a fair right for a defense. That should \nbe our goal. I think my substitute does achieve that balance. I hope \nvery much we can work this into a bill that all of us can support for \npeople who have certainly known discrimination, as I have, and for \npeople who want to make sure their children and grandchildren don't \nface discrimination, as well as for those who wish to make sure we \ndon't discriminate against that small business owner who is all of a \nsudden, after 10 or 15 years, maybe looking at a liability that they \ndidn't know about, couldn't prepare for because they don't know about \nit; maybe it is a mistake and maybe it could be corrected if we keep \nthat statute of limitations that would say a person knew or should have \nknown can have 6 months to file a claim so there can be an equitable, \njudicial remedy for this potential claim.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from \nMaryland for such time as he may consume. He has been a longstanding \nadvocate for women. He is a current member of the Judiciary Committee. \nHe was the Speaker of the House in Maryland. He was a member of the \nHouse of Representatives, and now is a member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. He is a real leader and I think we can look forward to a \nthoughtful presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland does not control the \ntime.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me first thank my colleague from \nMaryland for giving me the opportunity to speak, but also to thank her \nfor her extraordinary leadership on behalf of gender equality in our \nNation. Senator Mikulski is no stranger to this issue. She has fought \nher entire life on behalf of equality for all people in this country. \nFrom her days as a social worker to her service on the City Council of \nBaltimore and now to the Senate, she has been our leader on speaking \nout for what is right on behalf of women, on behalf of all of the \npeople of our Nation. So I thank Senator Mikulski very much for \neverything she has done, not just on this issue but on so many issues \nthat affect equality for the people of our country.\n  This has been an extraordinary week. On Monday we celebrated the life \nand legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King had a dream that \neveryone in this country would have the equal opportunity of this great \nland, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. He \nhad a dream. Then, yesterday, we saw this Nation take a giant step \nforward in reaching that dream with the inauguration of Barack Obama as \nthe 44th President of the United States. We can take another giant step \nforward now by passing the legislation that my colleague from Maryland \nis bringing forward, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. It is so \nimportant that we do this.\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\n  Let me give my colleagues some of the facts. They know this, but it \nis worth repeating. Today in the workplace women are being \ndiscriminated against. On average, women make 77 percent of what a male \nmakes for the same work. That is unacceptable and inexcusable. We need \nto change that.\n  Lilly Ledbetter worked for 19 years at Goodyear Tire Company. It was \nshown that she was making $15,000 less than her male counterparts were \nmaking in the United States of America. Well, we passed legislation to \nmake sure that could not happen and that there were rights to protect \nwomen who were discriminated against by that type of action by an \nemployer. Lilly Ledbetter did what was right. She filed her case and it \nwas found that, yes, she was discriminated against, but guess what. Her \nclaim was denied by the Supreme Court of the United States by a 5-to-4 \nvote because she didn't bring her case within 180 days of the \ndiscrimination. She didn't know about the discrimination until a fellow \nworker told her about it, well past 180 days. She couldn't possibly \nhave brought the case within 180 days.\n  Now it is time for us to correct that Supreme Court decision, and \nthat is exactly what the legislation Senator Mikulski has brought \nforward will do. It will reverse the Supreme Court decision giving \nwomen and giving people of this Nation an effective remedy if an \nemployer discriminates based upon gender.\n  I have listened to some of the debate on the floor. I don't want to \nsee us put additional roadblocks in the way of women being able to have \nan effective remedy. I respect greatly my colleague from Texas. She is \nvery sincere and a very effective Member of this body. However, I don't \nwant to have lawyers debating whether a person can bring a claim, as to \nwhether they had reasonable cause or try to think of what someone was \nthinking about at the time. This is very simple. If you discriminate \nagainst your employee, they should have an effective remedy. The \nSupreme Court turned down that remedy. The legislation that is on the \nfloor corrects it. It is our obligation, I believe, to make sure that \nis done.\n  So I wish to take these few moments to urge my colleagues to pass the \nlegislation that is before us. Let's not put additional roadblocks in \nthe way. Let's not pass amendments that will become ways in which \nemployers such as Goodyear Tire could prevent their employees from \ngetting fair pay. The time is now. Let's pass this legislation.\n  I again congratulate my colleague from Maryland for her leadership on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his eloquent \nand persuasive argument.\n  I rise to debate with my colleague from Texas her amendment. Before I \ngo into the Hutchison substitute amendment, I wish to clear up two \nmisconceptions. The first misconception is that there have been no \nhearings on this bill; somehow or another this is a fast-track, jerry-\nrigged, gerrymandered process. That couldn't be further from the truth.\n  In 2008, we held two hearings on Ledbetter, one in January of 2008--\njust about this time--in the Senate Health, Education and Labor \nCommittee, which was a very active committee. Second, we also held a \nhearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee to get the extensive legal \ncommentary. That hearing was held on September 23. There are those who \nwould say, But that was the last Congress. Well, that was last year, \nbut the relevant facts are the same. So there have been extensive \nhearings in the Senate and in the House. I believe we are following a \nframework for getting views through the regular process.\n  Now, our new President, President Barack Obama, has said very clearly \nthat he wants to create jobs in this country. If you don't have a job, \nyou get a chance to get one, and if you do have a job, you get a chance \nto hold on to it. Additionally, he said that if you have a job or you \nare going to get a job, you will not face wage discrimination in the \nUnited States of America. That is why he wants not only in his first \n100 days, but in his first 10 days, to pass legislation that closes a \nloophole on wage discrimination.\n\n  That takes me to the second misconception. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair \nPay Act, which I am the lead sponsor of--but I wish to acknowledge the \nrole of Senator Kennedy as the lead sponsor, and I am carrying this \nresponsibility as a member of the committee. Now, the second \nmisconception is that somehow or another the Fair Pay Act only deals \nwith wage discrimination affecting women. Oh, no. It deals with wage \ndiscrimination affecting all people. So if you are discriminated \nagainst in your paycheck because of your race, ethnicity, religion, \nnatural origin, or gender, this legislation will protect you. This \nloophole was created by the Supreme Court, and I will elaborate on that \nas well.\n  So we followed hearings. This bill, as part of President Obama's hope \nfor America, makes sure that when you get a job or you keep your job, \nyou will never be discriminated against in your wages. So I wanted to \nclear up those two misconceptions.\n  Now I wish to go to the Hutchison substitute. First, I wish to \nacknowledge the Senator from Texas, my truly very good friend, for her \nlong-standing advocacy for women. We have worked together on a \nbipartisan basis for women. Her advocacy has been steadfast. She has \nbeen of particular help. We have worked together on the women's health \nagenda. We have mammogram standards in this country because of the \nHutchison-Mikulski amendment. We have helped with breast cancer \nresearch funding because we have worked together, and I could give \nexample after example.\n  I also wish to acknowledge that the Senator from Texas herself was \ndiscriminated against in the workplace. Maybe later on in the debate \nshe will share her own very compelling personal story. So I wish to \nacknowledge that.\n  I also wish to acknowledge that we--the women of the Senate--can \ndisagree, which she and I do tonight, without being disagreeable. There \nis no doubt that the Senator from Texas and I agree that we do not want \nwage discrimination against women. Where we disagree is not on the goal \nbut on the means. She has her substitute, and I have, which I think is \nthe superior framework, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. I wish to be \nclear that in this new Senate, we can offer amendments, we can have our \nshared goals, and we can do it in a way that is not prickly or \nrancorous and so on. So I wish to be able to say that. Although I \ndisagree with her, my bill--the Kennedy-Mikulski bill--which has 54 \ncosponsors, simply restores the law before the Supreme Court decision. \nIt is a legal standard that nine separate decisions in front of courts \nof appeal agreed with.\n  Let me elaborate. The Hutchison amendment acknowledges that the \nSupreme Court Ledbetter decision is unfair and it has closed the \ncourthouse door for legitimate claimants. Unfortunately, Senator \nHutchison's effort to fix Ledbetter's problem is flawed. I think it is \na well-intentioned but misguided attempt. Her amendment will not fix \nthe problem caused by the Ledbetter decision. In fact, review of her \namendment leaves the core of the Ledbetter's harsh ruling intact, \ncreating only a very narrow and vague exception. Moreover, the \nexception creates significant legal hurdles for those workers who try \nto take advantage of it.\n  In the Ledbetter decision, the Supreme Court said an employee must \nchallenge pay discrimination within 180 days of the employer's initial \ndecision to discriminate or the employee will be forever barred from \nenforcing her rights. This decision gave employers a free pass to \ncontinue discrimination. By keeping in place the heart of the Ledbetter \ndecision, the Hutchison amendment would allow such injustice to \ncontinue.\n  The Senator from Texas says her amendment would bring balance to our \nantidiscrimination laws, but in reality it imposes a very unreasonable \nstandard on workers--a standard that would be almost impossible for \nsomeone to meet.\n  Under the Hutchison framework, a worker would have to prove not only \nthat she did not know she was being discriminated against but also she \n``should not have been expected to have had enough information to \nsupport a reasonable suspicion of discrimination.''\n\n[[Page S702]]\n\n  How can workers prove what someone else expects of them? How does a \nworker prove a negative, that she didn't suspect that something in the \nworkplace wasn't quite right? And--again quoting the Hutchison \nrecommendation--what is a ``reasonable suspicion of discrimination''? \nThat phrase, ``reasonable suspicion of discrimination,'' is vague, and \nfuzzy, and I am concerned would even add to the already legal burdens. \nThere is no similar standard in any other discrimination law.\n  Workers would have to prove they could meet this vague standard \nbefore they could even raise their allegations of discrimination. This \nmeans time and resources spent on what workers knew and when they knew \nit instead of on the conduct of unscrupulous employers.\n  Even conservative commentators are worried about the Hutchison \namendment. Andrew Grossman of the Heritage Foundation noted that the \nHutchison amendment would fail to provide the certainty of a hard \nstatute of limitations.\n  By contrast, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would restore a bright \nline for determining the timeliness of pay discrimination claims. We \nknow employers and workers can understand this rule and live with it \nbecause it was the law of the land in most of the country for decades \nprior to the Ledbetter decision. Our bill would simply put the law back \nto what it was before the Supreme Court upended the law.\n  Although Senator Hutchison claims her amendment would protect \nemployers from unreasonable lawsuits, it could cause an explosion in \nthe number of lawsuits. If this amendment was adopted, workers would \nfeel compelled to file claims quickly for fear that they would miss \ntheir statute of limitations. So the only way you can protect yourself \nis to file a claim because you might have a reasonable suspicion. Given \nthe way women are treated in the workplace, you could have a reasonable \nsuspicion every time you walk in somewhere. Workers have to run to the \nEEOC even if the only evidence of discrimination is rumor or \nspeculation. This could create a very nasty and hostile work \nenvironment. Without any guidance of what constitutes a ``reasonable \nexpectation'' or a ``reasonable suspicion'' of discrimination, workers \nwill file a tremendous number of claims. That is just what we don't \nwant to do. We want to return to the law.\n  They say the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is only going to cause an \nexplosion of lawsuits, but it didn't before the Supreme Court decision. \nIn fact, we now know the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would not cause \nan increase in lawsuits because it gives the workers the time they need \nto consider how they have been treated and try to work out solutions \nwith employers before they get into filing complaints and also \nlawsuits.\n  You don't have to take my word for this. History proves it. The rule \nthat workers can file claims within 180 days of receiving a \ndiscriminatory paycheck did not encourage any unreasonable number of \nlawsuits in the decade before the Ledbetter Supreme Court decision.\n  We turned to CBO, again, a pretty cut-and-dry, button-down crowd. \nThey said this bill would not increase claims filed with the EEOC or \nlawsuits filed in court, meaning the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, not \nthe Hutchison amendment.\n  The best evidence the Hutchison amendment does not solve the problems \ncaused by the Ledbetter decision is that the amendment would not have \nhelped Lilly Ledbetter herself. Isn't that something. Under the \nHutchison framework, this amendment would have tipped the scales of \njustice against her in favor of her law-breaking employer because it is \nvirtually impossible to meet the reasonable expectation of a reasonable \nsuspicion standard. Ms. Ledbetter would have been forced to spend all \nof her time and all of her money trying to prove that she had no reason \nto suspect discrimination before the EEOC or the courts could have even \nconsidered Goodyear's illegal and unfair treatment of her. \nDiscrimination claimants face enough difficult hurdles. Brave workers, \nsuch as Lilly Ledbetter, do not need more disincentives to stand up for \nthemselves and their rights.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is a bipartisan solution. It \nresponds to the basic injustice of the Supreme Court Ledbetter v. \nGoodyear decision. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Hutchison \namendment and vote for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I was going to engage in a \ndiscussion with the Senator from Maryland. I see the Senator from \nMinnesota is in the Chamber. Is it OK to proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I wish to talk about a couple of \npoints that were made by the Senator from Maryland.\n  First, I want to say how much I appreciate her talking about how much \nwe have done together in the Senate for women. We have made significant \nlegislation that has improved the lives of women. She mentioned many of \nthe bills we cosponsored.\n  The other one I want on the record, because I think it is so \nimportant for the homemakers of our country, is the homemaker IRA, \nwhich was the Hutchison-Mikulski bill that allows stay-at-home spouses, \nthose who work inside the home, to put aside the same amount for \nretirement security that will accrue without being taxed as someone who \nworks outside the home, which was not the case before Senator Mikulski \nand I passed our bill. It is one of the singular achievements, I think, \nin helping especially women who usually go in and out of the workplace \nto save, without being taxed every year, in a retirement account the \nsame amount as if they work outside the home.\n  We have worked together, and I know we will work together on many \nother issues. And I hope we will end up working together on this issue \nbecause we do have the same goal, and that is to provide a fair legal \nprocess for people to have the right to sue for discrimination and the \nemployer that is accused to have the right of defense.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the report of the \nHeritage Foundation that was mentioned earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Heritage Foundation, Jan. 7, 2009]\n\n        The Ledbetter Act: Sacrificing Justice for ``Fair'' Pay\n\n                        (By Andrew M. Grossman)\n\n       Congressional leaders have said that they will fast-track \n     the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, a bill that would allow pay \n     discrimination lawsuits to proceed years or even decades \n     after alleged discrimination took place. Proponents say that \n     the legislation is necessary to overturn a Supreme Court \n     decision that misconstrued the law and impaired statutory \n     protections against discrimination, but the Court's decision \n     reflected both longstanding precedent and Congress's \n     intentions at the time the law was passed.\n       In addition, eliminating the limitations period on claims \n     would be bad policy. Since ancient Roman times, all Western \n     legal systems have featured statutes of limitations for most \n     legal claims. Indeed, they are so essential to the \n     functioning of justice that U.S. courts will presume that \n     Congress intended a limitations period and borrow one from an \n     analogous law when a statute is silent. While limitations \n     periods inevitably cut off some otherwise meritorious claims, \n     they further justice by blocking suits where defensive \n     evidence is likely to be stale or expired, prevent bad actors \n     from continuing to harm the plaintiff and other potential \n     victims, prevent gaming of the system (such as destroying \n     defensive evidence or running up damages), and promote the \n     resolution of claims. By eliminating the time limit on \n     lawsuits, the Ledbetter Act would sacrifice these benefits to \n     hand a major victory to trial lawyers seeking big damage \n     payoffs in stale suits that cannot be defended.\n       The Ledbetter Act would also lead to myriad unintended \n     consequences. Foremost, it would push down both wages and \n     employment, as businesses change their operations to avoid \n     lawsuits. Perversely, it could actually put women, \n     minorities, and workers who are vocal about their rights at a \n     disadvantage if employers attempt to reduce legal risk by \n     hiring fewer individuals likely to file suit against them or \n     terminating those already in their employ.\n       Rather than effectively eliminate Title VII's limitations \n     period, Congress could take more modest, less risky steps to \n     ease the law's restrictions, if such change is warranted. \n     Most directly, it could lengthen the limitations period to \n     two or three years to match the periods in similar laws. \n     Another option is to augment the current limitations period \n     with a carefully drafted ``discovery rule'' so that the time \n     limit on suing begins running only when an employee \n     reasonably suspects, or should reasonably suspect, that he or \n     she has been discriminated against.\n\n[[Page S703]]\n\n     While either of these options would sacrifice some of the \n     benefits of the current limitations period, they are far \n     superior alternatives to throwing the law wide open to stale \n     claims and abuse.\n\n\n                           The Ledbetter Suit\n\n       For all the rhetoric about the Supreme Court's Ledbetter \n     decision--the New York Times, for one, called it ``a blow for \n     discrimination''--it addresses not the substance of gender \n     discrimination but the procedure that must be followed to \n     assert a pay discrimination claim. Specifically, the case \n     presented only the question of when a plaintiff may file a \n     charge alleging pay discrimination with the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a prerequisite to suing.\n       Lilly Ledbetter, who worked for Goodyear Tire and Rubber \n     Co. from 1979 until 1998 as a factory supervisor, filed a \n     formal EEOC charge in July 1998 and then a lawsuit in \n     November, the same month that she retired. Her claim was that \n     after she rebuffed the advances of a department foreman in \n     the early 1980s, he had given her poor performance \n     evaluations, resulting in smaller raises than she otherwise \n     would have earned, and that these pay decisions, acting as a \n     baseline, continued to affect the amount of her pay \n     throughout her employment. She said she had been aware of the \n     pay disparity since at least 1992.\n       Initially, Ledbetter sued under the Equal Pay Act of 1963 \n     (EPA) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a more \n     general anti-discrimination statute. The EPA, unlike Title \n     VII, has been interpreted not to require proof that pay \n     discrimination was intentional but just that an employer paid \n     an employee less for equal work without a good reason for \n     doing so. For such claims, the EPA imposes a two-year statute \n     of limitations, meaning that an employee can collect \n     deficient pay from any discriminatory pay decisions made \n     during that period, whether or not the employer intended to \n     discriminate in any of those decisions. Title VII, while \n     imposing a shorter filing deadline of 180 days and requiring \n     proof of intent to discriminate, allows for punitive damages, \n     which the EPA does not. Perhaps for this reason, Ledbetter \n     abandoned her EPA claim after the trial court granted summary \n     judgment on it in favor of her former employer.\n       On her Title VII claim, however, Ledbetter prevailed at \n     trial before a jury, which awarded her $223,776 in back pay, \n     $4,662 for mental anguish, and a staggering $3,285,979 in \n     punitive damages. The judge reduced this total award to \n     $360,000, plus attorneys' fees and court costs.\n       Goodyear appealed, and the Eleventh Circuit Court of \n     Appeals reversed the decision on the grounds that Ledbetter \n     had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that an \n     intentionally discriminatory pay decision had been made \n     within 180 days of her EEOC charge. Ledbetter appealed to the \n     Supreme Court, challenging not that determination but only \n     the Court of Appeals' application of Title VII's limitations \n     period.\n       In a decision by Justice Samuel Alito, the Supreme Court \n     held that the statute's requirement that an EEOC charge be \n     brought within 180 days of an ``alleged unlawful employment \n     practice'' precluded Ledbetter's suit, because her recent pay \n     raises were not intentionally discriminatory. Ledbetter \n     argued that the continuing pay disparity had the effect of \n     shifting intent from the initial discriminatory practice to \n     later pay decisions, performed without bias or discriminatory \n     motive. The Court, however, had rejected this reasoning in a \n     string of prior decisions standing for the principle that a \n     ``new violation does not occur, and a new charging period \n     does not commence, upon the occurrence of subsequent \n     nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting \n     from the past discrimination.'' For those familiar with the \n     law, this appeared to be a rehash of a 1977 case that reached \n     the same conclusion on identical grounds.\n       Thus, the Court affirmed the lower decision against \n     Ledbetter.\n\n\n                  The Purposes of Limitations Periods\n\n       That result did not speak to the merits of Ledbetter's \n     case--that is, whether she had suffered unlawful \n     discrimination years before--but only to the application of \n     the statute's limitations period. Although it seems \n     intrinsically unfair to many that a legal technicality should \n     close the courthouse doors, statutes of limitations, as the \n     majority of the Court observed, do serve several essential \n     functions in the operation of law that justify their cost in \n     terms of barred meritorious claims. In general, limitations \n     periods serve five broad purposes.\n       Justice Story best articulated the most common rationale \n     for the statute of limitations: ``It is a wise and beneficial \n     law, not designed merely to raise a presumption of payment of \n     a just debt, from lapse of time, but to afford security \n     against stale demands, after the true state of the \n     transaction may have been forgotten, or be incapable of \n     explanation, by reason of the death or removal of \n     witnesses.''\n       Indeed, Ledbetter itself illustrates this function. \n     Different treatment, such as pay disparities, may be easy to \n     prove even after much time has lapsed, because the kinds of \n     facts at issue are often documented and, indeed, are rarely \n     in dispute. More contentious, however, is the defendant's \n     discriminatory intent, which Title VII requires in addition \n     to proof of disparate treatment. The evidence proving intent \n     can be subtle--for example, ``whether a long-past performance \n     evaluation . . . was so far off the mark that a sufficient \n     inference of discriminatory intent can be drawn.'' With the \n     passage of time, witnesses' memories may fade, stripping \n     their accounts of the details necessary to resolve the claim. \n     Evidence may be lost or discarded. Indeed, witnesses may \n     disappear or perish--the supervisor whom Ledbetter accused of \n     misconduct had died by the time of trial. Sorting out the \n     subtleties of human relationships a decade or more in the \n     past may be an impossible task for parties and the courts, \n     one at which the defendant, who did not instigate the suit, \n     will be at a particular disadvantage. This seems to have been \n     the case in Ledbetter.\n       Statutes of limitations, in contrast, require a plaintiff \n     to bring his or her claim earlier, when evidence is still \n     fresh and the defendant has a fair chance of mustering it to \n     mount a defense. In this way, statutes of limitations also \n     serve to prevent fraudulent claims whose veracity cannot be \n     checked due to passage of time.\n       Second, statutes of limitations also help to effectuate the \n     purposes of law. They encourage plaintiffs to diligently \n     prosecute their claims, thereby achieving the law's remedial \n     purpose. This is particularly the case for statutes such as \n     those forbidding discrimination in employment practices, \n     where Congress has created causes of action to supplement \n     government enforcement actions. Litigation under such \n     statutes is, in part, a public good, because the plaintiff in \n     a meritorious suit secures justice not just for himself but \n     for similarly situated victims, as well as the public at \n     large, which has expressed its values through the law. Anti-\n     discrimination law is the archetypical example of an area \n     where private suits can promote far broader good. Other \n     victims and the public are best served when workers who \n     believe they have been subject to discrimination have the \n     incentive to investigate the possible unlawful conduct, \n     document it, and then challenge it in a timely fashion. \n     This was an explicit goal of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n     whose drafters reasoned that the short limitations period \n     and mandatory EEOC administrative process would lead most \n     discrimination complaints to be resolved quickly, through \n     cooperation and voluntary compliance.\n       Third, time limits on filing lawsuits prevent strategic \n     behavior by plaintiffs. In some cases, plaintiffs may wait \n     for evidence favorable to the defense to disappear or be \n     discarded, for memories to fade and witnesses to move on, \n     before bringing claims. Particularly under laws that allow \n     damages continuing violations or punitive damages, plaintiffs \n     may face the incentive to keep quiet about violations as the \n     potential pool of damages grows. Concerns that plaintiffs \n     will game the system in this way are so prevalent that an \n     entire doctrine of judge-created law, known as ``laches,'' \n     exists to combat certain of these abuses. Laches, however, is \n     applied inconsistently, and courts often decline its exercise \n     in enforcing statutory rights. A limitations period puts a \n     limit on the extent to which plaintiffs can game the law by \n     delaying suit.\n       Fourth, time-limiting the right to sue furthers efficiency. \n     Valuable claims are likely to be investigated and prosecuted \n     promptly, while most of dubious merit or value are ``allowed \n     to remain neglected.'' Thus, ``the lapse of years without any \n     attempt to enforce a demand, creates, therefore, a \n     presumption against its original validity, or that it has \n     ceased to subsist.'' Statutes of limitations, then, are one \n     way that our justice system focuses its limited resources on \n     the most valuable cases, maximizing its contribution to the \n     public good.\n       Finally, there is an intrinsic value to repose. It promotes \n     certainty and stability. Putting a deadline on claims \n     protects a business's or individual's settled expectations, \n     such as accounting statements or income. At some point, \n     surprises from the past, in the form of lawsuits, cease to be \n     possible. As with adverse possession of land, the law \n     recognizes that, though a wrong may have been done, over time \n     certainty of rights gains value.\n       For these important reasons, statutes of limitation are \n     ubiquitous in the law and have been since ancient Roman \n     times. Limitations periods necessarily close the courthouse \n     doors to some potentially worthwhile claims--an outcome so \n     harsh that it would be ``pure evil,'' observed Oliver Wendell \n     Holmes, if it were not so essential to the operation of law. \n     That a single good claim has been barred, then, proves not \n     that the deadline for suit is unfair or unwise but only that \n     justice cannot provide a remedy in every case.\n\n\n                           The Ledbetter Act\n\n       Nonetheless, editorial reaction to Ledbetter was swift and \n     almost entirely negative, with most writers drawing from \n     Justice Ginsburg's bombastic dissent (which she read in part \n     from the bench) calling the majority's reasoning ``cramped'' \n     and ``incompatible with the statute's broad purpose.'' \n     Ginsburg's logic, repeated on the opinion pages, and often \n     news pages, of countless newspapers, was that Ledbetter was a \n     member of a protected class (women), performed work equal to \n     that of the dominant class (men), and was compensated less \n     for that work due to gender-based discrimination. End of \n     story. Pay discrimination, Ginsburg argued, is different than \n     other forms of discrimination and is more akin to a ``hostile \n     work environment'' claim, which by its nature involves \n     repeated, ongoing conduct. But\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\n     this is creative reimagining of the statute: Nowhere in it is \n     there any room for the limitations period present in the \n     statute or indeed any of the other requirements that Congress \n     crafted.\n       Unfortunately, though, it was Ginsburg's dissent, and her \n     unseemly urging that ``once again, the ball is in Congress' \n     court,'' that spurred the drafters of the Lilly Ledbetter \n     Fair Pay Act, which was introduced soon after the Court \n     issued its decision and passed the House in short order. The \n     bill would adopt Ginsburg's view, amending a variety of anti-\n     discrimination laws to the effect that a violation occurs \n     ``each time wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid'' \n     that is affected by any discriminatory practice. In this way, \n     the law would simply eliminate the limitations period as \n     applied to many cases.\n       Under the Ledbetter Act, employees could sue at any time \n     after alleged discrimination occurred, so long as they have \n     received any compensation affected by it in the preceding 180 \n     days. While this would certainly reverse Ledbetter, it goes \n     much further by removing any time limitation on suing in pay-\n     related cases, even limitations relating to the employee's \n     learning of the discrimination--an approach that is known in \n     other contexts, such as fraud, as a ``discovery rule.'' This \n     new rule is also broader in that it would apply to any \n     (alleged) discrimination that has had an (alleged) effect on \n     pay, such as an adverse promotion decision. In addition, \n     retirees could bring suits alleging pay-related \n     discrimination that occurred decades ago if they are \n     presently receiving benefits, such as pensions or health \n     care, arguably effected by the long-ago discrimination.\n       In these ways, the Ledbetter Act would allow cases \n     asserting extremely tenuous links between alleged \n     discrimination and differences in pay, which may result from \n     any number of non-discriminatory factors, such as experience. \n     Employers would be forced to defend cases where plaintiffs \n     present evidence of a present wage gap, allegations of long-\n     ago discrimination, and a story connecting the two. As wage \n     differences between employees performing similar functions \n     are rampant--consider how many factors may be relevant to \n     making a wage determination--a flood of cases alleging past \n     discrimination resulting in present disparity would likely \n     follow passage. In addition to investigatory and legal \n     expenses, employers will face the risk of punitive damages \n     and the difficulty of rebutting assertions of discriminatory \n     acts from years or decades ago.\n       The flood of lawsuits would not be endless, however, \n     because, as Eric Posner observes, employers can be expected \n     to change their hiring, firing, and wage practices to reduce \n     the risk of lawsuits. To the extent that disparities in \n     treatment are the result of discrimination, this may undercut \n     its effects. But if, as Posner puts it, businesses ``start \n     paying workers the same amount even though their productivity \n     differs because they fear that judges and juries will not be \n     able to understand how productivity is determined,'' the law \n     would impose significant costs on businesses and, by \n     extension, consumers and the economy. The result would be a \n     hit to employment and wages, combined with higher prices for \n     many goods and services.\n       Perversely, the Ledbetter Act may actually harm those it is \n     intended to protect. In making employment decisions, \n     businesses would consider the potential legal risks of hiring \n     women, minorities, and others who might later bring \n     lawsuits against them and, as a result, hire fewer of \n     these individuals. Even though this discrimination would \n     violate the law, it would be difficult for rejected \n     applicants to prove. Other employers might simply fire \n     employees protected by Title VII--and especially those who \n     are vocal about their rights under the law--to put a cap \n     on their legal liabilities. Again, this would be illegal, \n     but difficult to prove.\n       These kind of unintended consequences have been a chief \n     effect of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which \n     prohibits discrimination against individuals with \n     disabilities and enforces that prohibition through civil \n     lawsuits. Today, the disabled earn less and work far less \n     than they did prior to enactment of the ADA, and a number of \n     economists, including MIT's Daron Acemoglu, blame the ADA for \n     reducing the number of employment opportunities available to \n     the disabled. In this way, by dramatically increasing \n     employers' exposure to potential liability when they hire \n     members of protected classes, the Ledbetter Act would put \n     members of those classes at a disadvantage in the labor \n     marketplace.\n\n\n                     Big Payoffs for the Trial Bar\n\n       It is difficult to explain the hue and cry from parts of \n     the bar that accompanied Ledbetter, given that the plaintiff \n     clearly could have proceeded under the Equal Pay Act without \n     running into a limitations period problem. One explanation is \n     that Title VII, unlike the EPA, allows for punitive damages \n     in addition to several years' worth of deficient pay. Had she \n     proceeded under the EPA and prevailed, Ledbetter would have \n     received deficient pay going back two or three years prior to \n     filing a charge with the EEOC--about $60,000 according to the \n     trial court. But under Title VII, the case was worth six \n     times that amount, due to a large punitive award.\n       That result becomes all the more alluring to the \n     plaintiff's bar when one considers the possibility of follow-\n     on lawsuits and, in limited instances, class actions. A \n     single legal victory against an employer could provide the \n     fodder for scores of lawsuits by similarly situated employees \n     and former employees receiving benefits, each alleging a \n     pattern of discrimination affecting pay, as evidenced by the \n     previous lawsuits. In this way, each lawsuit becomes easier \n     and cheaper to bring than the last. Employers, then, would \n     face the choice of fighting every suit with all their might--\n     because any loss could lead to scores more--or agreeing to \n     generous settlements, even in marginal cases, to avoid the \n     risk of high-stakes litigation.\n       This may account for the trial bar's keen interest in the \n     Ledbetter Act--it is among the top priorities of the American \n     Association for Justice (formerly the American Trial Lawyer's \n     Association)--despite the existence of other, less attractive \n     statutory remedies for those who are the victims of recent or \n     continuing discrimination or unjustified pay disparities.\n\n\n                            Safer Solutions\n\n       It is true, as proponents of the Ledbetter Act have noted, \n     that the statute of limitations for Title VII is shorter than \n     most others. There are good reasons for this, though, \n     considering the context in which it was drafted. Chief among \n     them, many Members of Congress, when they considered the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964, feared that businesses would be \n     overwhelmed with litigation. Others favored voluntary \n     conciliation over litigation. Some might have been concerned \n     that evidence of discriminatory intent would fade away if the \n     limitations period were too long. A relatively brief \n     limitations period certainly satisfies these concerns.\n       But if Congress believes that it is too short, it has far \n     less drastic and disruptive options at its disposal than \n     effectively eliminating the limitations period altogether. It \n     could, quite simply, extend the period to two or three years \n     to match the EPA. This would give employees more time to \n     uncover possible discrimination and seek remedies, without \n     allowing a flood of lawsuits premised on aged grievances. \n     There is also more logic to matching the more specific \n     statute's limitations periods than leapfrogging it so \n     dramatically.\n       Another option was proposed in the last Congress as the \n     ``Title VII Fairness Act'' (S. 3209, 110th Cong.). This \n     legislation would maintain the current limitations period but \n     augment it with a ``discovery rule'' so that the period \n     begins running only when the employee reasonably suspects, or \n     should reasonably suspect, that he or she has been \n     discriminated against. This approach has the benefit of \n     encouraging employees to investigate and take action on \n     worthwhile claims, while keeping many stale claims out of \n     court. Some courts, however, might twist this looser rule to \n     allow stale claims brought by sympathetic plaintiffs, such as \n     Lilly Ledbetter, who learned about the possible \n     discrimination fully six years before filing a charge. It \n     would also undermine, somewhat, the clear bright-line rule \n     that a hard statute of limitations provides. Nonetheless, \n     this approach would provide far more certainty, and prove far \n     less disruptive, than eliminating the limitations period.\n\n\n                            A Perfect Storm\n\n       It was a surprise to many legal observers a year and a half \n     ago that the Ledbetter case--an unremarkable application of a \n     rule settled 20 years prior--would attract any interest at \n     all. But on closer examination, the course of events leading \n     up to the Supreme Court's decision, and the reaction since, \n     have not been by chance but by design, part of a ``perfect \n     storm'' orchestrated by trial lawyers, wrongheaded civil \n     rights organizations, and labor groups to achieve a radical \n     shift in employment law. These special interests have an \n     extensive agenda planned for the current Congress. Yet \n     Members should consider each plank of it on the merits.\n       Far beyond reversing the result of a single Supreme Court \n     decision--one that, viewed fairly, was consistent with \n     precedent and fairly represented Congress's intentions--the \n     Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would open the door to a flood \n     of lawsuits, some frivolous, that employers would find \n     difficult or impossible to defend against, no matter their \n     ultimate merit. Rather than help employees, the bill could \n     end up hurting them by reducing wages and job opportunities--\n     at a time when unemployment is rising and many are nervous \n     about their job prospects. Instead, Congress should recognize \n     that statutes of limitations serve many important and \n     legitimate purposes and reject proposals that would allow \n     litigants to evade them.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, it is very important that we have \nthe whole legal memorandum on the Ledbetter Act and my substitute \namendment. I want to read a couple of paragraphs from it. The Heritage \nFoundation report says:\n\n       Another option was proposed in the last Congress--\n\n  My bill--\n\n     as the ``Title VII Fairness Act.'' This legislation would \n     maintain the current limitations period but augment it with a \n     ``discovery rule'' so that the period begins running only \n     when the employee reasonably suspects, or should reasonably \n     suspect, that he or she has been discriminated against. This \n     approach has the benefit of encouraging employees to \n     investigate and take action on worthwhile claims, while \n     keeping many stale claims out of court. Some courts, however, \n     might twist the looser rule to allow stale claims brought by \n     sympathetic plaintiffs, such as Lilly\n\n[[Page S705]]\n\n     Ledbetter, who learned about the possible discrimination \n     fully six years before filing a charge. It would also \n     undermine, somewhat, the clear bright-line rule that a hard \n     statute of limitations provides. Nonetheless, this approach \n     would provide far more certainty, and prove far less \n     disruptive, than eliminating the limitations period.\n\n  Which the underlying bill does. I added for emphasis those last \nwords.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Far beyond reversing the result of a single Supreme Court \n     decision--one that, viewed fairly, was consistent with \n     precedent and fairly represented Congress's intentions--the \n     Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would open the door to a flood \n     of lawsuits, some frivolous, that employers would find \n     difficult or impossible to defend against, no matter their \n     ultimate merit. Rather than help employees, the bill could \n     end up hurting them by reducing wages and job opportunities--\n     at a time when unemployment is rising and many are nervous \n     about their job prospects. Instead, Congress should recognize \n     that statutes of limitations serve many important and \n     legitimate purposes and reject proposals that would allow \n     litigants to evade them.\n\n  The full reading of this legal memorandum by the Heritage Foundation, \nI think, makes the case for my substitute as the right approach, giving \nmore rights to the plaintiff but not eliminating or discriminating \nagainst the business to defend itself.\n  Let me make two points. My amendment codifies the employee's right to \nestablish what he or she didn't know. It is so necessary that we have \nthis right, and it is necessary to know when the person should have \nknown and make that part of the record. Otherwise, it would allow a \nperson to knowingly sit on a claim, to run up the amount that might be \nadded to the discriminatory act in punitive damages. That should not be \na part of our legal system.\n  There is one other point I want to make about the Supreme Court case \nthat the Mikulski bill will overturn.\n  The Supreme Court separated a discriminatory pay policy from a single \ndiscriminatory act. That was their intention. It is the law today, and \nit would be the law under my substitute, that if there is a policy of \ndiscriminatory pay, every paycheck would be a discriminatory act. So it \nwould continue if it were a policy. That is the law, and it should be \nthe law, and it will be the law if my substitute is adopted.\n  What the Supreme Court did in the Ledbetter case was say when it is a \nsingle act of discrimination, not one that is discriminatory in policy, \nthat should have a statute of limitations. But perhaps we could have a \nreasonable rebuttable presumption that the person should have known, \nand when the person brings the claim, that person can establish: I \ncould not have known because we weren't allowed to talk about our pay. \nThat could be a reason the court would say is legitimate, and it would \nuphold the statute of limitations.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania was here earlier. He has several \namendments. The Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, has an amendment. I \nthink we can make this a good bill that everyone will think is fair, \nthat will give more rights to the plaintiff but does not keep the \ndefense from having a fair chance to defend the business. And I believe \nthat is the right approach.\n\n  I hope we can pass my substitute. I hope we can continue to work on \nthis bill so that everyone will feel good about voting for it and our \nbusinesses won't be subject to a lawsuit 10 years after an act is \nalleged to have occurred and have a bill run up, when maybe if we have \na statute of limitations that is reasonable and you have the ability to \nbring it, it could even be settled right then and there so that the \nemployer is not going to have a big expense that might even close the \nbusiness and lay off more people, which is not a result any of us would \nwant. So I hope we can write the law carefully to avoid that \neventuality.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I know the Senator from Minnesota \nwishes to speak, and I also know the Senator from New Jersey is here. I \nbelieve we are going to turn next to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Madam President, while the Senator from New Jersey, who just arrived, \nis still organizing, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, is there a time limitation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise today to support the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act in order to defend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nand to protect all Americans from the evils of discrimination.\n  Yesterday, millions of Americans rejoiced as Barack Obama was sworn \nin as the 44th President of the United States. Hope for a more \ninclusive America, a more unified America, a more just America swept \nacross this land from our biggest cities to our smallest towns. There \nwas a sense of wonder that someone who wouldn't have been allowed to \neat in certain restaurants or drink from certain water fountains over \n40 years ago had just become the freely elected leader of the greatest \ncountry on Earth. We should be incredibly proud of the progress we have \nmade since the errors of slavery and Jim Crow.\n  But while we believe our Union can be perfected, we know it still \nisn't perfect. We know that equal opportunity and impartial justice for \nall have yet to be attained. And we know what the consequences are, \nfor, as Dr. King so eloquently put in his letter from a Birmingham \njail, ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.''\n  Despite the progress we have made, we live in a country where women \nstill earn 78 cents for every dollar a man makes, where African \nAmericans earn only 80 cents for every dollar a White man makes and \nLatinos earn only 68 cents for every dollar a White man makes. Our \ncountry, therefore, is still far from perfect.\n  Today, the Senate has a historic opportunity to narrow the gap \nbetween our ideals and our practices. We have the opportunity to say \nthat women should be treated the same as men. We have the opportunity \nto say that people should be fairly paid for their labor. We have the \nopportunity to loudly proclaim in a unified voice that discrimination \nwill not be tolerated in America.\n  As of last year, after a misguided Supreme Court decision overturned \nwhat had been the law of the land for decades, a worker can't bring an \naction for wage discrimination if the original decision to discriminate \nhappened more than 180 days beforehand. The Supreme Court said \nemployers can get away with discrimination if they hide it long enough, \neven though the effects of that bigotry have no expiration date.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would recognize the long-term, \ncontinuous, systemic discrimination as it really is and not let \noffending companies get away with it through loopholes and \ndisinformation. If a woman sees her wages continuously fall behind \nthose of her male counterparts or a worker gets paid a wage far lower \nthan the company average just because she is Black, they should be able \nto challenge their employers even if the original decision to \ndiscriminate was made years ago.\n  Narrowly defining discrimination as merely the original decision to \ndiscriminate makes no sense at all. Let's say, for example, that a \ncriminal hacks into your bank account and decides to steal a portion of \nyour paycheck every 2 weeks. If we were to apply a precedent similar to \nthe Ledbetter case, if the hacker doesn't get caught 180 days after the \ninitial decision to hack in, he can keep stealing forever with no fear \nof prosecution. Current discrimination law makes about that much sense.\n  Now, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will ask \nwhy workers often don't file their claim within 180 days from the first \ninstance of discrimination. Well, there are several reasons. To begin \nwith, workers generally find it difficult to compare their salaries to \ncoworkers, and many businesses actually prohibit it. Even if a worker \nsees her pay is lower than her coworkers, she might not recognize it \nwas a result of discrimination. And if workers do recognize it as \ndiscrimination, they often wait to contact the EEOC--the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission--or decide not to due to feeling \nashamed or more often they fear retaliation by their company.\n\n[[Page S706]]\n\nThey fear the consequences of ``rocking the boat'' and figure a job in \nwhich they are discriminated against is better than being fired and \nhaving no job at all. And certainly, in these incredibly tough economic \ntimes, that is a rising reality. To make matters worse, skyrocketing \nunemployment rates have only put these vulnerable workers in a more \nprecarious and often helpless position.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues will also argue that this \nlegislation will open the floodgates, leading to thousands of lawsuits \nclaiming wage discrimination. But this argument simply has no merit. \nFor over 40 years, the courts have interpreted the Civil Rights Act of \n1964 to be consistent with the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Eight out \nof nine appellate courts interpreted it that way, and yet there was no \nflood of litigation then, nor will there be after we enact this vital \npiece of legislation into law.\n  Some of my conservative colleagues will argue that this legislation \nwill make companies liable for decades of backpay and will encourage \nworkers to intentionally delay and file claims years later when those \naccused might no longer be around to defend themselves. Again, these \narguments simply ignore the facts. Under this legislation, backpay \nwould be capped at 2 years regardless of how long the victim was \ndiscriminated against and the burden to prove discrimination took place \nis borne by the worker. Any lack of witnesses available to testify \nwould only hurt the worker's efforts to prove their case.\n  Critics who say this legislation will cripple businesses miss the \npoint. The fact is that companies following the law are currently put \nat a competitive disadvantage compared to those who exploit their \nworkers. The executive director of the U.S. Women's Chamber of \nCommerce--a strong business advocacy group--succinctly noted:\n\n       The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act rewards those who play \n     fair--including women business owners--unlike the Supreme \n     Court's decision, which seems to give an unfair advantage \n     to those who skirt the rules.\n\n  So we have a strong business advocacy group saying treat those who \nare obeying the law as it was intended and as it, in fact, has been \npursued for over four decades in a way that doesn't put them at a \ncompetitive disadvantage. The vast majority of businesses that practice \nlegal hiring procedures will not have to change anything and will no \nlonger be punished for doing the right thing.\n  Wage discrimination is real. The Fair Pay Act would strike a clear \nblow against it. So we have to make sure to keep the legislation \nstrong. Unfortunately, I am afraid the amendment offered by our \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, would severely undermine it. \nThat amendment would require people to prove they had no reason--no \nreason--to suspect their employer was discriminating against them in \n180 days. The amendment is pretty confusing just on its face. I have to \nask, how does an employee prove she doesn't suspect discrimination? And \nwhen should she have to? In general, I don't see how it is relevant \nwhether a victim suspects discrimination; the issue is whether there is \ndiscrimination. If it is happening, it has to be stopped, plain and \nsimple. You can't ultimately be in a position in which you are allowed \nto discriminate and get away with it. If we send that message in our \nsociety, then all the progress we have made will be rolled back.\n  Madam President, I would like to believe that every Member of this \nbody champions principles of equality, justice, and liberty as much as \nI do. But principles are meaningless without practice. Without \nvigilantly ensuring that no person is discriminated against because of \ntheir gender, their race, their religion, their ethnicity, or their \nsexual orientation, our principles become just empty words.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that inaction on this issue is \nakin to tacit acceptance. And as Dr. King said:\n\n       We will remember not the words of our enemies but the \n     silence of our friends.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to remember those wise words and put their votes \nwhere their values are by supporting this vital piece of civil rights \nlegislation.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Maryland for leading the \ncharge. She has been an exceptional fighter on this issue, and I know \nshe will soon see the fruits of her labor, not for herself and her \nadvocacy but for millions of women, Latinos, and African Americans who \nfind themselves discriminated against and who deserve the ability for \nall to be able to enjoy the fruits of their labor without such \ndiscrimination.\n  Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Minnesota \nfor allowing me to move forward in this time, during this process, and \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I am proud to join with Senator \nMikulski and so many others in calling for the Senate to take up and \npass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and to do it as soon as possible.\n  Many here have told Lilly Ledbetter's story, so I am not going to go \nthrough it again. But I will tell you, sometimes when you get to know \nsomeone, as I have gotten to know Lilly Ledbetter as a person, it means \nmore to you. It is like when someone is arguing against a change in the \nlaw, and they suddenly find it happens to their own wife or their own \ndaughter, they start to feel a little differently about it. So that is \nwhy I believe it is very important to do this and to make this as \nsimple as possible and as easy as possible in order to make sure there \nis not discrimination in the workplace, because it is a sad reality, \nthat still, 88 years after the 19th amendment gave women equal voting \npower, and 45 years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act, it still \ntakes women 16 months to earn what men can earn in 12 months.\n\n  I have been listening to some of the arguments made today. I was \npicturing what would happen if, in fact, that Supreme Court decision \nstayed in place, which basically said that you are supposed to somehow \nfigure out you are being discriminated against. It says it doesn't \nmatter if you knew or not. If it happens, you have to sue right away. I \nwas thinking how that would work in reality, how you are supposed to \nfind out and how Lilly Ledbetter was supposed to find out. It would be \nas if Senator Menendez and I worked in the same company and we were \ndoing the same job and both doing it well and he was paid more than I \nwas. How would you know that, if you are an employee at a workplace? \nAre you supposed to start snooping through their paychecks and opening \nthem and trying to figure out how much he is paid? I don't think a \nnormal person would do that.\n  Are you supposed to start getting to know the people who work around \nhim to find out how much money he makes, see if he told anyone, start \nasking around about your fellow employee? This doesn't make sense in \nthe real world workplace, and it certainly, as has been pointed out, is \nnot consistent with 40 years of law in this area.\n  Today we have before us the Hutchison amendment. I appreciate the \nwork of Senator Hutchison in so many areas, how the women of the Senate \nwork on a bipartisan basis, but I believe in the end this amendment is \nwrong. What this amendment basically says is you are not going to be \nable to bring any kind of claim of discrimination, even a valid one, \nwithout having to go through a bunch of hoops and dot a bunch of I's \nand cross a bunch of T's that is very hard to do. Again, if you want to \nmake sure this discrimination doesn't take place, make it a clear rule, \nmake it a bright-line rule, as we do in so many other employment cases.\n  Under the Hutchison amendment, our workers are subject to that \nSupreme Court decision in Ledbetter, unless they can prove they had no \nreason to suspect that their employer was discriminating against them.\n  Again, I believe this is done for good motives, in the spirit of some \nkind of compromise. But, again, I try to look at the real world and \nthink: How would you be able to prove this? Maybe things happen in the \nreal world, maybe one of your work colleagues--if Senator Menendez and \nI were working in the same factory and maybe someone else, maybe you, \nthe Presiding Officer, also worked there and maybe sometime at a coffee \nbreak you said: You know, I think he is making more money than you are, \nand it goes away and nobody talks about it. Would that be enough? Would \nthat be enough to show a suspicion that you thought you were being\n\n[[Page S707]]\n\ndiscriminated against, that he was making more money?\n  What if he bought a new car, a nice new car. He is driving around in \nthat nice car and people are starting to think: I wonder if he got a \nraise. Is that a suspicion that he is making more money? What if you \njust think he is making more money and you tell one person on the \nphone, but you don't know for sure?\n  When you start thinking this through, you realize why this standard, \nthis ``reasonable suspicion'' standard, doesn't appear in our \nemployment statutes. It is because it is simply unworkable as a \nstandard, despite the good motivation to try to come up with some \nunderstanding, some kind of compromise. It doesn't make any sense. It \nis based on rumor.\n  I believe there are enough rumors around this place without starting \nto put them into law. A rumor starts somewhere. It changes someplace \nelse. By the time it comes back to you, it is totally different, and I \nwould rather not write rumors and suspicions into the law. I prefer a \nbright-line rule.\n  As has also been mentioned by some of my colleagues, we have not seen \nthis unfair rush of litigation under the existing law. In fact, under \nthis, if you have suspicions, it would force you to try to rush to file \nyour claim. I think a good argument could be made--we don't know for \nsure, but a good argument could be made it would actually lead to more \nclaims. This idea that it would force a worker, put the burden on the \nworker to spend time and money trying to meet this complicated standard \nthat does not appear anywhere else in the law deprives employers and \nemployees of a clear bright-line rule for determining the timeliness of \nclaims.\n  I know from my work in the private sector for 13 years, people prefer \nbright-line rules. It makes it easier for everyone.\n  One of the arguments made is that somehow this would allow some \nraving employee, some mad employee to go back--they would simply hide \ntheir case so no one would know about it so they could keep getting \nbackpay. This argument defies the actual rules. What are the actual \nrules? It says you can go back for only 2 years. Look what happened in \nthe Lilly Ledbetter case. She went to her trial. The jury awarded her a \nbig amount, but then it had to be reduced because the law acknowledged \nthis, the argument made of the difficulty, and said you can only go \nback for 2 years. The law also has caps on damages for major employers. \nI think it is something like $300,000. There are caps. There are look-\nback rules that get to the argument that was made here. You can see it \nright in the Ledbetter case, if you do not believe me. The money was \nreduced because of those rules that are in place.\n  Why suddenly we would put in a standard that we do not have in the \nlaw today, when, in fact, we have that 2-year backpay rule to protect \nagainst exactly the arguments that were being made, and we have caps in \nplace?\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is the only bill that gives \nemployees the time to consider how they have been treated and try to \nwork out solutions with their employers. That often happens. We \nencourage that. We would like that to happen. You don't want everyone \nrunning into court. It fulfills Congress's goals, creating incentives \nfor employers to voluntarily correct any disparity in pay they find, \nand it ensures that employers do not benefit from continued \ndiscrimination. That is all it does. It is simple.\n  Let me tell you a little story from the State of Minnesota to end \nhere, why I care about this so much. That is that my grandpa was a \nminer up in northern Minnesota. He worked hard his whole life. He never \ngraduated from high school, saved money in a coffee can to send my dad \nto college. He worked hard in those mines. It was a rough-and-tumble \nworld up in the mines of northern Minnesota.\n  In the mine next door to where my grandpa worked, there were a number \nof women--decades later, after my grandpa worked there--who started \nworking in the mines. It was not an easy life. If anyone has seen the \nmovie ``North Country,'' that was the basis of the movie. It happened \nin the mines. My relatives were right next door.\n  The women there were discriminated against. I am not sure of all the \ndetails. Maybe some of it was pay, but some of it was just \ndiscriminatory treatment. It went on and on. It was an example, if you \nhave seen that movie, of how difficult it was for them to get the \ngumption to stand and finally file suit because they liked these guys. \nThey were their coworkers. They worked with them. They wanted to fit in \nand they tried so hard. Eventually, they brought a lawsuit, but it took \ntime for them to be able, in that hard, rough-and-tumble world of those \niron ore mines, to bring that lawsuit.\n  They eventually did and they eventually won that suit at great \npersonal sacrifice to them, as documented in that movie, ``North \nCountry.''\n  Things changed as a result of that lawsuit at the mines. It was not a \npopular thing they did. It is not even popular right now. But things \nchanged in those mines. When I ran for the Senate, the first \nendorsement I got was from the United Steelworkers. The guy who gave it \nto me was the guy who was the union steward, the same guy, Stan \nDaniels, at that mine at that time, that was the subject of the \nlawsuit.\n  I got elected the first woman Senator from Minnesota. The world \nchanges. That is why this bill is so important, to maintain that right \nof workers. I know in my State there is lots of the discriminatory \ntreatment going. The world changes as people realize and understand the \nlaw and employers are educated on the law, but we still need that \nsafety valve in place. We still need those protections in place so \nworkers can get paid fair pay for what they do.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, we are awaiting the arrival of the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee because he wishes to offer an amendment this \nevening. We wish to accommodate him. The Senator from Wyoming has been \nthe soul of civility on this issue and has helped us to move the bill \nthus far. But it is our intention to ask all speakers to come now \nbecause the Senator from Texas and I would like to be able to conclude \nthis debate for this evening--not to conclude the debate, but for this \nevening--around 7. I am not making a unanimous consent request, I just \nwish to put a few things out there.\n  While we are waiting for the arrival of our colleague from Wyoming, I \nwould like to have printed in the Record an excellent monograph put out \nby the National Women's Law Center on the Hutchison amendment. It is a \nvery lawyer-like paper, but it is also done in plain English. That \noutlines some of the real issues the Hutchison substitute could \npresent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this paper in its entirety be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Just to give a few highlights, they advise us that the \nHutchison bill allows clear pay discrimination to continue without a \nremedy. That is why we are doing this Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in \nthe beginning. They make that point because they say:\n\n       The Hutchison bill prevents employees from challenging \n     discrimination to which they continue to be subject. [It] \n     perpetuates the basic problem created by the Ledbetter \n     decision.\n\n  That is what I argued earlier in the evening.\n\n       Under the bill, employers are left without any remedy \n     against present and continuing pay discrimination if they do \n     not file a government complaint within 180 days of the first \n     day when they ``have or should be expected to have'' enough \n     information to suspect discrimination.\n\n  One of the main arguments, the differences we have with our colleague \nfrom Texas, is the should have, we should have, we should have known--\nhow should you have known?\n  When you go into a workplace, one of the few things that is not \ndiscussed is pay. I commented in an earlier debate, you can talk about \nanything in the workplace. You can talk about religion at the water \ncooler. You can talk about politics at the Xerox machine. But you \ncannot talk about pay. This could have, should have--we don't want to \nhave a framework where everyone who has been discriminated against by \nour culture and by our practice in the\n\n[[Page S708]]\n\nworkplace goes into a new job with a chip on their shoulder. We are \ngoing to presume people are fair-minded. That is the way most people \nshow up every day. This Hutchison amendment, could have, would have, \nshould have, I think is going to create a nightmare. It is going to do \nexactly what the Senator doesn't want. I think it is going to generate \nmore lawsuits and not only more lawsuits but more lawyers arguing about \ncould have or should have suspected.\n\n       The Hutchison bill permits employers to escape \n     accountability for continuing pay discrimination. Like the \n     Ledbetter decision, the Hutchison substitute immunizes an \n     employer from any challenge to pay discrimination, even where \n     the employer continues to profit from it. Under the Hutchison \n     bill, an employer is off the hook for, and can continue to \n     gain a windfall from, continued pay discrimination. . . .\n\n  You know, when you discriminate, you don't usually just discriminate \nagainst one person in the company. It is usually more than one--others. \nAgain, we are back to this would have, should have, could have.\n\n       The Hutchison bill deprives employees of the chance to \n     assess the extent of the discrimination and work voluntarily \n     with their employers to address any disparities.\n       [It] forces employees to forfeit their claims if they take \n     the time to work out disputes amicably.\n\n  That is exactly what we want. We want to be able to work out disputes \namicably, to go to maybe some alternative dispute resolution \nmechanism, have time to find out the facts: What is the situation? \nParticularly because pay disparity may start small and grow over time. \nEmployees may want to give their employers the benefit of the doubt \nhoping the employers will voluntarily remedy that gap or may want to \nwork actively with the employer to resolve the dispute. This is \nespecially true for employees new on the job. The Hutchison amendment \ndenies employees this opportunity, forcing them from the get-go to file \nadversarial Government complaints immediately upon suspecting \ndiscrimination or risk losing the right to any relief.\n\n  Now, not only is this bad law, it is bad policy, and it is going to \nbe bad budget. I chair the Appropriations Committee which funds the \nEEOC. Under the administration that left town, they were revenue \nstarved. They have a tremendous backlog right this minute of a variety \nof discrimination cases. Some were wages, some dealing with gender or \nrace or ethnicity or religion. Many of those workers really feel under \nsiege with the workload they are going to carry. Under the Hutchison \namendment, as soon as you walk into your workplace and you have a \nwhiff, a rumor, gossip, or, oh, gee, wonder what is going on, then you \nhave to run right to the EEOC and file a complaint.\n  I do not think that is good common sense. It sure is not good money \nsense from the strain it is going to put already on an overburdened \nEEOC. I think we are headed in the wrong direction.\n  This Hutchison bill creates burdensome and expensive, time-consuming \ndistractions from the fundamental issue of whether an employee has been \nsubject to pay discrimination. I fear that the Hutchison bill will \nincrease the number of lawsuits filed against employers, and it is \ngoing to result in very protracted and very expensive minitrials in \nthose cases that are brought.\n  We want to get into making sure we end wage discrimination. This bill \nwill result in confusion for the courts and for employers. This bill \nrejects the bright-line familiar rule in effect before the Ledbetter \ndecision in favor of a standard that raises numerous thorny legal and \nfactual issues.\n  I like the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which is my bill, and also is \nsponsored by 54 other Members of the Senate which simply restores the \nfamiliar role for assessing the timeliness of discrimination claims \nthat prevailed in virtually every court in this country prior to the \nLedbetter decision. The Hutchison bill creates an entirely new legal \nregime.\n  The bill raises innumerable questions, including when an employee \ncould have been found to have a ``reasonable suspicion of \ndiscrimination.''\n  Madam President, I have more arguments to make, but at the end of the \nday, why is the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act so excellent? Well, the \nbill from the viewpoint that I am advocating and the legislation that I \nam sponsoring would give employees the time to evaluate their \nsuspicions of discrimination and work toward solutions with their \nemployers, including voluntarily.\n  It would ensure that employers are held accountable for continued \ndiscrimination and, most of all, it would provide certainty in \nassessing the timeliness of pay discrimination claims and restore the \nlaw before the outrageous Supreme Court decision.\n  Congress should reject the approach of the Hutchison bill and instead \nact expeditiously to enact the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 [From the National Women's Law Center]\n\n The Title VII ``Fairness'' Act, S. 3209, Allows Pay Discrimination To \n                                Continue\n\n       On May 20, 2007, in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber \n     Co., the Supreme Court held that employees must file claims \n     with the government for compensation discrimination within \n     180 days of an employer's initial decision to discriminate or \n     be barred from future challenges--no matter how long the \n     discrimination has continued. The Court's decision upends \n     decades of prior precedent and is fundamentally unfair to \n     those subject to pay discrimination. Under the Ledbetter \n     rule, employees have no recourse--and employers have no \n     accountability--for continuing discrimination once 180 days \n     have passed from the initial pay decision.\n       In July, 2007, the House of Representatives passed the \n     Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to overturn the Ledbetter \n     ruling. The Act would restore the law that applied virtually \n     everywhere in the country before the Supreme Court's \n     decision--that each discriminatory paycheck constitutes an \n     act of discrimination that can be challenged. The Senate's \n     vote on a motion to advance the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act fell \n     just three votes short of passage in April of 2008.\n       In June, Senator Hutchison (together with other Senators \n     who voted against advancing the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act) \n     introduced S. 3209, an alternative titled the Title VII \n     Fairness Act. But unlike the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the \n     Hutchison bill fails to restore prior law or solve the \n     problems created by the Ledbetter decision; it instead \n     creates damaging new legal hurdles for people receiving \n     discriminatory pay to overcome. Indeed, the Hutchison bill \n     stands to set back basic anti-discrimination protections in \n     the workplace even beyond equal pay.\n       The Hutchison bill allows clear pay discrimination to \n     continue without a remedy.\n       The Hutchison bill prevents employees from challenging \n     discrimination to which they continue to be subject. The \n     Hutchison bill perpetuates the basic problem created by the \n     Ledbetter decision. Under the bill, employees are left \n     without any remedy against present, continuing pay \n     discrimination if they do not file a government complaint \n     within 180 days of the first day when they ``have or should \n     be expected to have'' enough information to suspect \n     discrimination.\n       The Hutchison bill permits employers to escape \n     accountability for continuing pay discrimination. Like the \n     Ledbetter decision, the Hutchison bill immunizes an employer \n     from any challenge to pay discrimination even where the \n     employer continues to profit from it. Under the Hutchison \n     bill, an employer is off the hook for, and can continue to \n     gain a windfall from, continued pay discrimination that is \n     not immediately challenged when the employee first ``should \n     have'' suspected it.\n       The Hutchison bill deprives employees of the chance to \n     assess the extent of the discrimination and work voluntarily \n     with their employers to address any disparities.\n       The Hutchison bill forces employees to forfeit their claims \n     if they take the time to work out disputes amicably. \n     Particularly because pay disparities may start small and grow \n     only over time, employees may want to give their employers \n     the benefit of the doubt, hoping that the employers will \n     voluntarily remedy the pay gap--or may want to work \n     actively with their employers to resolve the dispute over \n     time. This is especially true if an employee is new on the \n     job. But the Hutchison bill denies employees this \n     opportunity, forcing them to file adversarial government \n     complaints immediately upon suspecting discrimination or \n     risk losing the right to any relief.\n       The Hutchison bill denies employees adequate time to assess \n     the merits of their claims. Particularly because employees \n     subject to pay discrimination may be in an ongoing \n     relationship with an employer, they are likely to want to be \n     sure that they have meritorious claims before filing a \n     government challenge to their employers' practices. But the \n     Hutchison bill limits employees' ability to take the time \n     necessary to confirm their suspicions of discrimination or \n     act when the problem reaches serious proportions.\n       The Hutchison bill creates burdensome, expensive and time-\n     consuming distractions from the fundamental issue of whether \n     an employee has been subject to pay discrimination.\n       The Hutchison bill will increase the number of lawsuits \n     that are filed against employers. Employees who suspect \n     discrimination will be forced to file preemptive claims to \n     avoid forfeiting their rights. The Hutchison bill will thus \n     increase the amount of litigation that occurs.\n\n[[Page S709]]\n\n       The Hutchison bill will result in protracted and expensive \n     mini-trials in the cases that are brought. Employers and \n     employees will be forced to engage in costly battles before \n     even getting to the merits of a discrimination dispute--that \n     is, whether a pay decision was, in fact, based on sex, race, \n     disability or another prohibited ground. A court will have to \n     resolve multiple threshold issues, including what the \n     employee suspected about pay discrimination and when s/he \n     suspected it. On top of that, even if an employee in fact had \n     no suspicion of discrimination, she will have to prove that \n     her failure to suspect was reasonable. These time-consuming \n     battles will only add to the cost and burdensomeness of \n     litigation--and will increase the difficulty employees denied \n     equal pay will have in getting the wages they have earned.\n       The Hutchison bill will result in confusion in the courts \n     and for employers.\n       The Hutchison bill rejects the bright-line, familiar rule \n     in effect before the Ledbetter decision in favor of a \n     standard that raises numerous thorny legal and factual \n     issues. Unlike the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which simply \n     restores the familiar rule for assessing the timeliness of \n     pay discrimination claims that prevailed in virtually every \n     court in the country prior to the Ledbetter decision, the \n     Hutchison bill creates an entirely new legal regimen. The \n     bill raises innumerable questions, including when an employee \n     can be found to have a ``reasonable suspicion of \n     discrimination.''\n       The Hutchison bill will result in inconsistent standards \n     for employers in different parts of the country for years to \n     come. Because courts will likely reach different conclusions \n     on the many legal and factual questions raised by the bill, \n     employers in different parts of the country will likely be \n     subject to conflicting rules, making it difficult, if not \n     impossible, to understand their legal obligations. It will be \n     years, if not decades, before these questions are \n     authoritatively resolved by the Supreme Court.\n       The Hutchison bill could limit protections for employees in \n     contexts beyond pay discrimination.\n       The Hutchison bill is not restricted to pay discrimination. \n     The so-called Title VII Fairness Act applies to any unlawful \n     employment practice under the anti-discrimination laws. As a \n     result, it goes well beyond the targeted, restorative \n     approach of the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n       The Hutchison bill could have particularly troubling impact \n     on harassment claims. Under current law, employees can bring \n     harassment claims as long as any incident of ongoing \n     harassment occurs within 180 days prior to the complaint--\n     regardless of how many incidents have occurred previously. It \n     is predictable that some employers would use this bill's \n     broad scope to try to escape their responsibility for sexual \n     harassment and other types of discrimination.\n       The Hutchison bill responds to a purported ``problem'' that \n     is, in fact, wholly invented.\n       Employees have no incentive to delay filing pay \n     discrimination claims. Because employees typically cannot \n     afford to struggle without pay to which they are legally \n     entitled, it is simply a red herring to suggest that they \n     will delay filing pay discrimination for years, or even \n     decades. Furthermore, because Title VII has a two-year limit \n     on the back pay that any plaintiff can receive, that means \n     that if they delay they will lose compensation for all but \n     the last two years of pay discrimination they suffer. \n     Therefore, there is every incentive for an employee to file a \n     pay discrimination complaint as soon as reasonably possible. \n     It is the employer, not the employee, who benefits from any \n     delay.\n       Employers were satisfied with the rules in place before the \n     Ledbetter decision. Prior to the Ledbetter decision, \n     employers were not asking for a change to the longstanding \n     rules relating to the timeliness of pay discrimination claims \n     that the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act restores. There is no \n     evidence that the operation of the rule prejudiced employers \n     or resulted in the success of non-meritorious claims. In \n     fact, employers benefited from the certainty of the rule in \n     place before Ledbetter.\n       The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is the only bill that will \n     address the basic pay discrimination that Lilly Ledbetter, \n     and others like her, suffer.\n       The Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is the only bill that would have \n     helped Lilly Ledbetter. Under the Hutchison bill, Lilly \n     Ledbetter--to whom a jury awarded more than $3 million in \n     damages for the egregious discrimination she endured--would \n     have been embroiled in protracted arguments about what she \n     knew about her workplace and when. A court would have had to \n     decide, for example, whether idle gossip and boasting by her \n     coworkers--who had harassed and lied to her in the past--were \n     sufficient to give Ms. Ledbetter a ``reasonable suspicion'' \n     of discrimination. By contrast, the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \n     creates a bright line rule that would ensure the timeliness \n     of claims like Ms. Ledbetter's, when the pay continues into \n     the present.\n       The Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is the only bill that corrects \n     the problems with the Supreme Court opinion. Unlike the \n     Hutchison bill, the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would:\n       Give employees the time to evaluate their suspicions of \n     discrimination and work toward solutions with their \n     employers;\n       Ensure that employers are held accountable for continued \n     discrimination;\n       Provide certainty in assessing the timeliness of pay \n     discrimination claims;\n       Restore the law.\n       Congress should reject the approach of the Hutchison bill \n     and should instead act expeditiously to enact the Lilly \n     Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I know the Senator from Rhode Island \nwants to speak. I will take a minute and say a couple of things.\n  We are going to codify a right that is not in the law today. It is \nsometimes applied by judges and sometimes not. We do clarify so that \nthere is fairness for the employee as well as for the small business \nowner to know if something is occurring.\n  Our standard is, should have known, and that is what the person can \nshow, that they had no way to know that a discrimination was occurring. \nWe are clarifying and trying to make it more fair and more clear and \nmore uniform across all the districts in our country.\n  That is our goal, and I do hope we will be able to have this \namendment that will make it a law that is better for employees who \nmight have been discriminated against, but also give the fair right to \nan employer not to have a right sat on and built up so that it becomes \nsomething that could hurt the small business and be unexpected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Accountability\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise as we celebrate a new \nPresident, a new administration, a new mode of governing, and a new \nfuture for America.\n  Even in the gloom of our present predicaments, Americans' hearts are \nstrong and confident because we see a brighter future ahead. President \nObama looks to that future. Given the depth and severity of those \npresent predicaments, we need all his energy to look forward to lead us \nto that brighter day, forward to what Winston Churchill in Britain's \ndark days called ``broad and sunlit uplands.'' But as we steer toward \nthis broad and sunlit future, what about the past?\n  As the President looks forward and charts a new course, must someone \nnot also look back to take an accounting of where we are, what was \ndone, and what must now be repaired? Our new President has said, \n``America needs to look forward.'' I agree. Our new Attorney General-\ndesignate has said: We should not criminalize policy differences. I \nagree, and I hope we can all agree that summoning young sacrificial \nlambs to prosecute, as we did after Abu Ghraib, would be reprehensible.\n  But consider the pervasive, deliberate, and systematic damage the \nBush administration did to America, to her finest traditions and \ninstitutions, to her reputation, and integrity. I evaluate that damage \nin history's light. Although I am no historian, here is what I believe: \nThe story of humankind on this Earth has been a long and halting march \nfrom the darkness of barbarism and the principle that to the victor go \nthe spoils, to the light of organized civilization and freedom.\n  During that long and halting march, this light of progress has \nburned, sometimes brightly and sometimes softly, in different places at \ndifferent times around the world.\n  The light shone in Athens, when that first Senate made democracy a \nliving experiment, and again in the softer but broader glow of the \nRoman Empire and Senate. That light burned brightly, incandescently, in \nJerusalem, when Jesus of Nazareth cast his lot with the weak and the \npowerless.\n  The light burned in Damascus, Baghdad, Cairo, and Cordoba, when the \nArab world kept science, mathematics, art, and logic alive, as Europe \ndescended into Dark Ages of plague and violence.\n  The light flashed from the fields of Runnymede when English nobles \nforced King John to sign the Magna Carta, and it glowed steadily from \nthat island kingdom as England developed Parliament and the common law \nand was the first to stand against slavery.\n  It rekindled in Europe at the time of the Reformation, with a bright \nlight flashing in 1517 when Martin Luther nailed his edicts to the \nWittenberg Cathedral doors, and faced with excommunication stated: \n``Here I stand. I can do no other.''\n\n[[Page S710]]\n\n  Over the years, across the globe, that light, and the darkness of \ntyranny and cruelty, have ebbed and flowed. But for the duration of our \nRepublic, even though our Republic is admittedly imperfect, that light \nhas shown more brightly and more steadily in this Republic than in any \nplace on Earth as we adopted the Constitution, the greatest achievement \nyet in human freedom; as boys and men bled out of shattered bodies into \nsodden fields at Antietam and Chickamauga, Shiloh, and Gettysburg to \nexpiate the sin of slavery; as we rebuilt shattered enemies, now \nfriends, overseas and came home after winning world wars; and as we \nthrew off bit by bit ancient shackles of race and gender to make this a \nmore perfect Union for all of us.\n  What has made this bright and steady glow possible is not that we are \nbetter people, I believe, but that our system of government is \ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people. Why else \ndoes our President take his oath to defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America? Our unique form of self-government is a \nblessing, and we hold it in trust, not just for us but for our children \nand grandchildren down through history; not just for us but as an \nexample out through the world.\n  That is why our Statue of Liberty raises a lamp to other nations \nstill engloomed in tyranny. That is why we stand as a beacon in this \nworld, beckoning to all who seek a kinder, freer, brighter future.\n  We hold this unique gift in trust for the future and for the world. \nEach generation assumes responsibility for this Republic and its \nGovernment, and each generation takes on a special obligation when they \ndo. Our new President closed his inaugural address by setting forth the \nchallenge by which future generations will test us: Whether ``with eyes \nfixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that \ngreat gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.''\n  There are no guarantees that we will. This is a continuing experiment \nwe are embarked upon and a lot is at stake. Indeed, the most precious \nthing of man's creation on the face of this Earth is at stake. That is \nwhat I believe.\n  So from that perspective, what about the past? No one can deny that \nin the last 8 years America's bright light has dimmed and flickered, \ndarkening our country and darkening the world. The price of that is \nincalculable. There are nearly 7 billion human souls in this world. \nEvery morning, the Sun rises anew over their villages and hamlets and \nbarrios, and every day they can choose where to invest their hopes, \ntheir confidence, and their dreams.\n  I submit that when America's light shines brightly, when honesty, \nfreedom, justice, and compassion glow from our institutions, it \nattracts those hopes, those dreams, and the force of those 7 billion \nhopes and dreams, the confidence of those 7 billion souls and our \nlively experiment is, I believe, the strongest power in our national \narsenal, stronger than atom bombs. We risk it at our peril.\n  Of course, when our own faith is diminished at home, this vital light \nonly dims further, again, at incalculable cost. So when an \nadministration rigs the intelligence process and produces false \nevidence to send our country to war; when an administration descends to \ninterrogation techniques of the Inquisition of Pol Pot and the Khmer \nRouge, descends to techniques that we have prosecuted as crimes in \nmilitary tribunals and Federal trials; when institutions as noble as \nthe Department of Justice and as vital as the Environmental Protection \nAgency are systematically and deliberately twisted from their missions \nby odious means of institutional sabotage; when the integrity of our \nmarkets and the fiscal security of our budget are open wide to the \nfrenzied greed of corporations, speculators, and contractors; when the \nintegrity of public officials, the warnings of science, the honesty of \ngovernment procedures, and the careful historic balance of our \nseparated powers of government are all seen as obstacles to be overcome \nand not attributes to be celebrated; when taxpayers are cheated and the \nforces of government ride to the rescue of the cheaters and punish the \nwhistleblowers; when a government turns the guns of official secrecy \nagainst its own people to mislead, confuse, and propagandize them; when \ngovernment ceases to even try to understand the complex topography of \nthe difficult problems it is our very purpose and duty to solve and \ninstead cares only for those points where it intersects with party \nideology so that the purpose of government becomes no longer to solve \nproblems but only to work them for political advantage; in short, when \nyou have pervasive infiltration into all the halls of government--\njudicial, legislative and executive--of the most ignoble forms of \ninfluence; when you see systematic dismantling of historic processes \nand traditions of government that are the safeguards of our democracy; \nand when you have a bodyguard of lies, jargon, and propaganda emitted \nto fool and beguile the American people, well, something very serious \nin the history of our Republic has gone wrong, something that dims the \nlight of progress for all humanity.\n\n  As we look forward, as we begin the task of rebuilding this Nation, \nwe have an abiding duty to determine how great the damage is. I say \nthis in no spirit of vindictiveness or revenge. I say it because the \nthing that was sullied is so precious. I say it because the past bears \nupon the future. If people have been planted in government in violation \nof our civil service laws to serve their party and their ideology \ninstead of serving the public, the past will bear upon the future. If \nprocedures and institutions of government have been corrupted and are \nnot put right, that past will assuredly bear on the future.\n  In an ongoing enterprise such as government, the door cannot be so \nconveniently closed on the closets of the past. The past always bears \non the future. Moreover, a democracy is not just a static institution. \nIt is a living education, an ongoing education in freedom of a people.\n  As Harry Truman said, addressing a joint session of Congress back in \n1947:\n\n       One of the chief virtues of democracy is that its defects \n     are always visible, and under democratic processes can be \n     pointed out and corrected.\n\n  Entirely apart from tentacles of the past that may reach into the \nfuture are the lessons we as a people have to learn from this past \ncarnival of folly, greed, lies, and sabotage, so that it can, under \ndemocratic processes, be pointed out and corrected. If we blind \nourselves to this history, if we pull an invisibility cloak over it, we \nwill deny ourselves its lessons. Those lessons came at too painful a \ncost to ignore. Those lessons merit discovery, disclosure, and \ndiscussion. Indeed, disclosure and discussion is the difference between \na valuable lesson for the bright upward forces of our democracy and a \nblueprint for darker forces to return and do it all over again.\n  A little bright, healthy sunshine and fresh air so that an educated \npopulation knows what was done and how can show where the tunnels were \nbored, when the truth was subordinated, what institutions were \nsubverted, how our democracy was compromised; so this grim history is \nnot condemned to repeat itself; so a knowing public, in the clarity of \nday, can say: Never, never, never again; so we can keep that light, \nthat light that is at once America's greatest gift and greatest \nstrength brightly shining. To do this, I submit, we must look back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                   Amendments Nos. 28 and 29, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \ncurrent amendment so that I may offer two amendments, amendments Nos. \n28 and 29, and then return to the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] proposes amendments en \n     bloc numbered 28 and 29.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 28\n\n                     (Purpose: To clarify standing)\n\n       Beginning on page 3, line 22, strike ``adopted,'' and all \n     that follows through ``including'' on page 4, line 1, and \n     insert ``adopted or when an individual becomes subject to a \n     discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, \n     including''.\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\n                            Amendment No. 29\n\n                     (Purpose: To clarify standing)\n\n       Beginning on page 5, line 6, strike ``adopted,'' and all \n     that follows through ``including'' on page 5, line 10, and \n     insert ``adopted or when a person becomes subject to a \n     discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, \n     including''.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 25\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Hutchison \namendment. Before I do that, I want to voice some concern, again, about \nthe process we have gone through on this bill and that we might be \ngoing through on others. I just came from a health care meeting where \nwe are, in a bipartisan way, trying to reform health care. That is \nbeing done the right way. We have a task force and the task force has \nset down principles and questions. Those of us on the task force are \nreturning to Members of our side of the aisle and gathering their \ninput, answers, and additional questions. We will keep going through \nthis process until we have hammered out the principles. Then we will \nstart putting substance in it. Then it will go to the two committees of \njurisdiction. That makes it a lot more difficult than most bills. It \nwill go to both the HELP Committee for the health policy portion, and \nthen it will go at the same time to the Finance Committee for the way \nto finance what we are talking about in the policy.\n  We did this on the pension bill. That was a 1,000-page bill that only \ntook up an hour of floor time while we debated two amendments, had \nthose two votes, and a final vote. That is the simpler way of doing \nbipartisan work that winds up with an actual result. So often here we \nspend all of our time debating the 20 percent we don't agree on and \nfail to look for any kind of a third way of doing something that solves \nthe problem we started out on originally. This is not a very conducive \natmosphere to negotiate anything. It is not a negotiation. It is a lay \ndown your amendment, have it voted up or down, and because there can't \nbe any nuances in it, the hundred voices are not heard. The voices of \nthe constituents of the 100 people who serve here are not heard. We \nvote down a lot of things. Occasionally, we vote for something. But \nusually, what is brought to the floor is done so without any kind of a \nreal set of principles, let alone consensus, and thus, never makes it \nthrough the body.\n  I know there have been some changes in majority and minority. That \nwill still hold true, and I appreciate the majority agreeing that there \nwill be amendments and that I got to offer two amendments that we will \nbe debating and voting on later, I hope. This is kind of a test to see \nif we are going to do anything in a bipartisan way, and to see if we \ncan do it from the floor of the Senate rather than in committee. This \nhas not had a committee markup. This has not had the voice of the 23 \npeople working, in some detail probably, through a couple hundred very \ndetailed amendments, and that would be resolved between the Members. \nThat is the most effective way to address the issue and to get it \nresolved.\n  The issue that was raised is, what if an employer discriminated \nagainst an employee because she was female and paid her less than male \ncolleagues doing the same job with the same skills and experience? That \nis terrible. Such conduct by an employer has been illegal for 45 years \nunder one statute and 46 under another. But like virtually all rights \nof action, it has to be exercised within a statute of limitations. So \nthis bill's supporters ask: What if the employer hid the information \nthe employee needed to realize she was the victim of discrimination and \nshe missed the deadline to sue? We don't want that to happen, and \ncourts have dealt with that issue by extending the statute of \nlimitations on a case-by-case basis through the use of estoppel and \nequitable tolling. The reason this was not applied in the Lilly \nLedbetter case was because there she stated in court proceedings that \nshe was aware of the pay disparity many years before she brought the \nlawsuit. But putting her case aside, I can certainly agree that the \nstatute of limitations should be extended, particularly in cases where \nan employer has deliberately hidden the fact of discrimination.\n  Senator Hutchison's amendment does just that. It codifies the \ndiscretion courts have applied for years. Under the Hutchison \namendment, individuals who, because of conscious concealment or simple \nlack of information, are not aware of discrimination are not prevented \nfrom filing and pursuing their discrimination claim, even if it is well \nbeyond the statute of limitations. Here we have an amendment that would \nprovide some statute of limitations but takes care of that case where \nsomebody illegally hides information or where it isn't the normal \ncourse of business to get that information.\n  I wish to review what the Hutchison amendment does not do. It does \nnot eliminate the statute of limitations for all employment \ndiscrimination cases and thereby create a litigation bonanza. It does \nnot eliminate the incentive for employees to air and resolve concerns \nabout whether they are being treated fairly in the workplace. It does \nnot open up standing to bring employment discrimination cases to \nindividuals other than the affected employee. That is an important part \nright there. In the bill we are talking about, I know we would have \nextensive committee discussion about other affected parties. Who would \nthey be? How long could they make a claim? Can it be generations later? \nDoes it have to be at the time of death, while the person is still \nworking there? We can't tell from the bill, but other affected persons \nis anybody the person may or may not be related to who could be \naffected by the decision.\n  Can you think of anything broader than that? Don't you think that \nought to be pulled back a little bit? Again, we didn't talk about \nprinciples. We didn't go through committee. We didn't put in multiple \namendments that could have brought up some of these points, so here we \nare on the floor of the Senate kind of doing up-or-down amendments and \nI am sure arriving at things that, even if they pass, will come to \nraise a lot of questions in a very short period of time. That is not \nwhat we are supposed to be getting done for the American people.\n  The Hutchison amendment does not present a direct threat to our \nalready struggling defined benefit pension system. The more strain we \nput on that, the less people are going to do it, and we want people to \nhave pensions. So for all of those reasons, I will support Senator \nHutchison's wise and effective approach, one that could probably be \nnegotiated finer and done more carefully, but that would be committee \nwork. I will support it because I think it is a wise and effective \napproach that will ensure that no one loses the right to sue because \nthey didn't have the information to realize they were being mistreated. \nThat is our goal.\n  While I am expressing strong support of S. 166, which is the \nHutchison alternative, and I spoke on this matter earlier, I continue \nto express my deep concern shared by most of my colleagues about the \nway the bill has been handled. I will keep bringing that up on this and \nevery bill that skips the process.\n  By circumventing the regular order and not subjecting this \nlegislation to the committee amendment process, I believe it has \ninadequate review and debate and no opportunity for a measured \nconsideration of other means of achieving its same stated legislative \ngoals. That is a process which should be done in committee, not \nattempted to be done on the floor. However, that is the route that is \nbeing forced on us, the minority, so that is the route we will have to \nfollow now. We hope this is not a precedent-setting bill--or precedent-\nsetting process. It definitely will be a precedent-setting bill \nregardless of whether it is S. 181 or S. 166. Yet when we compare the \nsubstance of S. 181 with that of the Hutchison bill, it should be clear \nthe legislation has suffered from a lack of process and the review and \nscrutiny it needs and could bring.\n  Now, we should begin by first keeping clearly in mind the harm which \nS. 181 was purportedly designed to address. The problem is a simple \none. Title VII requires that the victims of employment discrimination \nmust commence a legal claim within 180 days of the act of \ndiscrimination, or in the case of a series of discriminatory acts, \nwithin 180 days of the last act in the series.\n  I should note that in most States the limitations period is actually \n300 days. But in Mrs. Ledbetter's home State of Alabama, it is 180 \ndays, so I will use that number in my statement today.\n\n[[Page S712]]\n\n  When title VII was drafted, Congress consciously used the 180-day \nperiod because they wanted to ensure that all claims of employment \ndiscrimination were raised immediately and remedied quickly--get the \nrelief to the person right away. However, what happens if the victim \ndoes not know he or she has been discriminated against? There are a lot \nof possible examples of this. Suppose an individual who is a member of \na racial minority applies but is not selected for a job bid or a \npromotion yet learns, more than 180 days after being denied the job, \nthat it was awarded to a White applicant with the same or lesser \nqualifications? Or suppose a female worker receives a wage increase but \ndoes not learn until well beyond 180 days from when she gets the wage \nincrease that she has received less than her male peers? She may not \nknow she is being compensated less because her employer has \nintentionally hidden those facts or simply because employees may simply \nnot know such information. In either case, the result is the same--the \nemployee, through no fault of his or her own, simply does not know they \nmay be the victim of discrimination until well beyond the 180 days from \nthe time they received their wage increase or lose their job bid.\n  Let us be completely clear. I do not believe there is anyone who \nbelieves an employee in any of those or similar circumstances should \nlose the right to file a discrimination claim because they did not have \nthe necessary facts and did not have any reason to know they were being \ndiscriminated against before the 180 days passed. This was precisely \nthe problem that S. 181, the Ledbetter bill, was allegedly designed to \naddress. If that were actually the case, I would vote for the Ledbetter \nbill. But the Ledbetter bill goes way beyond addressing the kind of \nsituations I have outlined here--so far beyond that it creates new \nproblems that make supporting it impossible for me and many other fair-\nminded Members.\n  By contrast, the Hutchison bill directly addresses and solves the \nvery problems I have outlined. Under the Hutchison bill, the denied job \napplicant who did not learn the facts until long after his bid was \ndenied or the female worker who did not know her wage differential \ncompared to her male peers, either because of conscious concealment or \nsimple lack of information, are not prevented from filing and pursuing \ntheir discrimination claim, even if it is well beyond the 180 days from \nwhen they got the raise or did not get the job. The Hutchison bill does \nthis by making the 180-day period a flexible one that can be readily \nextended in the kind of cases I have mentioned.\n  On the other hand, the Ledbetter bill does this by eliminating the \n180-day limitation period completely. The Hutchison bill is a rifle \nshot to solve a problem that everyone agrees must be solved. The \nLedbetter bill is a shotgun blast that causes collateral damage to \nimportant safeguards in our system of laws.\n  Limitation periods, such as the 180-day period for Title VII \nemployment discrimination claims, are a feature in every law that \ngrants the right to someone to bring a legal action against someone \nelse. They are universal because such limitations serve two very \nimportant purposes.\n  First, the existence of a limitations period is an inducement to \nthose who have claims to seek redress promptly. All of us have an \ninterest in a society where the laws are promptly enforced and, where \nthe beneficiaries of those laws are promptly protected and promptly \ncompensated. This is particularly true in the area of discrimination \nwhere society benefits best when discrimination is immediately exposed \nand immediately remedied. It may affect more than just the one person.\n  Second, limitations periods serve to ensure fairness in our \nlitigation process. The simple truth is that the more removed in time \nan event is, the less likely anyone is to remember it clearly or \naccurately. In a work setting, those who made compensation decisions 5, \n10, 20 years ago, may no longer be around. And even if they are around, \nhow could they possibly remember with any accuracy the basis for the \ndecisions? Under our Tax Code, records are not kept nearly that long \nfor individuals or for businesses.\n  The inability to fairly defend against a claim and the inability to \ndevelop reliable evidence are the exact reasons why laws invariably \ncontain a limitations period. Limitations periods are why someone \ncannot come along and try to sue you over an automobile accident that \ntook place 20 years ago, or commence a legal action to take your house \naway because of a claimed defect in the title that is decades old, and \nwhy the Government cannot pursue actions against citizens that have \nbecome stale with time.\n  But S. 181 would do away with such limitation periods in employment \ndiscrimination cases and allow individuals to reach back in time to \nraise claims about which there is no fair chance to defend, no evidence \nof any value, and possibly nobody who was even there. We do not have to \ndo this to address the concerns raised by the proponents of S. 181. \nSenator Hutchison's bill addresses those concerns completely.\n  S. 181 has a number of other problems which will be explained by my \ncolleagues as we proceed to this bill, such as the potential to \nseverely destabilize defined benefit pension plans and the expansion of \nindividuals with standing to sue under civil rights laws. These are \nnormally the kind of discussions we would have in the committee of \njurisdiction, which in this case would be the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, where our members and staff are well-versed in \nemployment laws. However, the majority's actions will require us to \nhave those discussions on this floor. It is not the way I want to do \nit, and it is not the way the American people expect us to do business, \nand it is not the way we will get things done.\n  Now, on this bill a vast number of people voted to proceed to the \nbill, and we all waived the 30 hours that could have been required \nbefore we could even make the first amendment. It was a nice concession \non both sides; speeds up the process. But there are a number of \nopportunities--if the process were to get jammed--that huge hours can \nbe added to the deliberations on this bill that do not need to be, that \nwould not have been, probably, had it gone through the committee \namendment process.\n  I just cannot emphasize enough how important that is to me. I made \nsure it happened when we were in the majority. I am hoping it will \nhappen on future bills while I am in the minority. Cooperation around \nhere gets a lot more done, and that is what the American people expect \nof us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the Nation and the world \nwitnessed the peaceful transfer of power from one President to the \nnext.\n  While this now seems normal and fair, the idea that a head of state \nwould relinquish his power willingly amazed many when George Washington \nwillingly stepped down as commander-in-chief.\n  Two centuries later, that idea serves as one of the strongest \nprinciples of our democracy.\n  I congratulate President Obama, Vice President Biden, and their \nfamilies.\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\n   I am proud to say that the Commonwealth of Kentucky was well \nrepresented during this week's historic celebration.\n  My office received thousands of requests from Kentuckians for \ninauguration tickets. While we only had about 400 tickets to give out, \nmany more came for the event and for the celebrations.\n  The inauguration of the country's first African-American President is \ntruly a reason for the whole country to celebrate.\n   It is no secret I wish he were a conservative Republican, but \nregardless of party, this is a proud moment for our country, and I \ncongratulate him and his family. And I hope his beautiful daughters \ncome to like their new home.\n  America certainly will face many challenges ahead, and the Congress \nwill work with our new President to find solutions.\n  Where the President seeks to cut wasteful spending, reduce the \nnational debt, provide tax relief for working Americans, or work \ntowards energy independence, he will have Republican support.\n  When he works to tackle big issues, and does so by listening to and \ntaking into account all sides he will find enormous support here in the \nCapitol.\n  And to help get his administration off to a smooth beginning, the \nSenate yesterday confirmed seven Cabinet-level positions.\n  Today we will consider the nomination of a fellow Senator, Mrs. \nClinton, as Secretary of State; more nominations will be considered in \nthe days ahead.\n  It is my intent that Congress and the new administration can work \ntogether to find solutions that are equal to the moment. Confirming \nthese administration nominees is a good step in that direction.\n  Now that the balls and parades are behind us, the hard work of \ngoverning lies ahead. I am eager to get started doing the business of \nthe American people.\n\n\n                       Nomination of William Lynn\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, on Tuesday our Nation witnessed the \nhistoric swearing in of President Barack Obama. President Obama has \nnominated Mr. William Lynn to the position of Deputy Secretary of \nDefense. In this time of war and economic crisis, the U.S. Senate has \nendeavored to rapidly take up the nomination of Mr. Lynn, as well as \nmany other senior nominees to the Obama administration, to provide our \nnew President the ability to begin his work with key members of his \nteam from the outset.\n  Last week, Mr. Lynn faced the members of the Senate Committee on \nArmed Services in a hearing conducted to vet Mr. Lynn. I attended that \nhearing and posed questions to Mr. Lynn. The day prior I also visited \nprivately with him to discuss his nomination.\n  I have significant concerns about the message the nomination and \nconfirmation of Mr. Lynn will send within the Department of Defense and \nacross the Federal Government. While I will not object to Mr. Lynn's \nconfirmation by the U.S. Senate today, I feel it important for me to \nexpress my concerns as a matter of record.\n  Following service in various defense ``think tanks'' and as a Senate \naide, in 1993 Mr. Lynn joined the Department of Defense as an \nexecutive, first as Director of Program Analysis and Evaluation. In \n1997 he was promoted to be the Department's Comptroller, where he \nserved until 2001 when the Clinton presidency concluded.\n  After a short stint as a consultant, Mr. Lynn made a decision that \nmany DOD executives before him have made. He decided to accept a senior \nposition in defense industry, where his expertise, experience and \ncontacts within DOD were greatly sought after and valued. Specifically, \nMr. Lynn joined the defense giant Raytheon as a senior executive \nhandling management and government relations.\n  Mr. Lynn has served with Raytheon since that time and continues there \npending his confirmation today. Importantly, it appears that Raytheon \nsubstantially improved the integrity of its government contracting \noperations during Mr. Lynn's tenure, a time when Raytheon also built \nitself into the fourth largest defense contractor in the U.S. and the \nfifth largest in the world.\n  On repeated occasions in this body, I have expressed my deep concerns \nwith the revolving door between industry and government. Those concerns \nare amplified when I speak of DOD, which is well known for its wealth \nof ``insiders'' and its closeness to the military-industrial complex. \nIt is not uncommon to hear people speak of the fact that DOD is an \ninsider's game. Some try to explain away this insider's notion by \nclaiming that the complexity of DOD and its weapons and services buying \noperations require these types of relationships. Even as I acknowledge \nthe complexity of the DOD operation, I tend to believe this ``special \nknowledge'' concept is a double-edged sword which at a minimum can lead \nto an appearance of impropriety.\n  Returning to Mr. Lynn, it is clear that his case presents a strong \nexample of this industry-government executive revolving door \nphenomenon. Frankly, we live in a time when many Americans, not just \nthose who watch DOD closely, know of concerns about the relationship of \nDOD with contractors. More specifically, many believe that defense \ncontractors have the ability to influence DOD decisions for the profit \nof the contractor but not necessarily for the best interest of DOD or, \nfor that fact, the taxpayer. With this backdrop, setting aside Mr. \nLynn's merits, the narrative of his story alone is problematic. \nFurther, it comes at a time when we are vigorously endeavoring to \nrestore public confidence in government.\n  My concern perhaps might be mitigated were it not for the fact that \nMr. Lynn is nominated to what is fairly characterized as the most \ncritical management position within DOD and perhaps the most important \nposition in the making of significant decisions on major defense \nacquisition programs. In other words, Mr. Lynn will have possibly the \nmost powerful position in the Department to influence how the \nDepartment does business with private industry and, in some cases, to \ninfluence with whom the Department does business.\n  To be frank, the way DOD does business with defense contractors must \nchange because the status quo is unacceptable. In part because of Mr. \nLynn's recent past, I am concerned that he will not bring the sense of \nurgency to or, worse yet, see the need for substantial reform in DOD's \nweapons and services procurement practices. Further, in my limited \ninteraction with Mr. Lynn to date, I have not sensed a strong \ncommitment to this type of change, although I understand he has \ncommunicated such a commitment to others with greater vigor.\n  To be clear, I am not questioning Mr. Lynn's integrity. His integrity \nhas been testified to by many of his present and former colleagues. He \nis clearly highly regarded by our incoming President and his \nadministration. And I am encouraged by the historic ethics guidelines \nthat President Obama has put in place just today for officials in his \nadministration. I am confident that Mr. Lynn will fully meet the letter \nof these new rules and act much more broadly in living up to their \nspirit both in his individual actions and in his oversight of other DOD \nofficials.\n  Let me close by making mention of the exchange I had with Mr. Lynn at \nthe Committee on Armed Services. I put much of what I have discussed \nhere in regards to my concerns with the revolving door at DOD before \nMr. Lynn. I further discussed concerns that he may face a conflict of \ninterest because his former employer Raytheon is a major defense \ncontractor. Mr. Lynn offered a limited response to my question, \ncommitting to meet every ethical requirement of the Department of \nDefense. I have no doubt that he will meet these requirements and \nfrankly exceed them. But Mr. Lynn did not discuss his views on the \nrevolving door at DOD, of the adequacy of the ethical controls at DOD \nor of any willingness to further study these issues if confirmed. I \nhope nonetheless that he will take these issues up during his tenure at \nDOD. I firmly believe that business as usual must come to an end at \nDOD, both as to these matters and in regards to many more. The chief \nmanagement Officer at DOD, of which Mr. Lynn will serve, must be a \nreformer, a disciplinarian, a person committed to change and a person \nwilling to challenge the system in order to drive change.\n  As stated earlier, I will not oppose the nomination of Mr. Lynn. Even \nas I have expressed my concerns today, I respect Mr. Lynn and the views \nof so\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\nmany of my colleagues and of his former colleagues about his abilities \nand his commitment to improving the state of affairs in business \noperations at DOD. I am excited by the opportunity he has before him. \nAnd I am optimistic about what he will accomplish alongside many others \non the team that will form at DOD. But I will be watching closely \nbecause this is my duty to the people of Missouri, to the people of \nAmerica and to the command of our constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/21/senate-section/article/S714-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S714-S715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n\n                              Barack Obama\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I want to take a moment to thank \nPresident Obama for his service in the Senate. Our new President has \nsome very difficult challenges ahead, as he faces a serious economic \ndownturn, and many critically important national security issues. But \nhe has already shown his ability to handle tough challenges through his \noutstanding work here in the Senate since his election in 2004.\n  From the moment he arrived, Barack Obama showed himself to be an \noutstanding legislator and public servant. I was very pleased to work \nwith him on ethics and lobbying reform issues, first authoring a bill \ntogether, and then working together to pass the Honest Leadership and \nOpen Government Act. Passing that landmark legislation took a \ndetermined, focused effort over many months, and then-Senator Obama \nshowed that he was both a deeply principled, and very effective, member \nof this body. I was also pleased to work with him on a number of other \nissues, including the presidential public funding legislation, and I \nlook forward to his continued support on that issue in this new \nCongress.\n  I was proud to support his efforts, along with many other members, on \nthe efforts to support our wounded warriors, which he championed. And, \nfinally, I thank him for his support of my bill, authored with Majority \nLeader Harry Reid, to safely redeploy our troops from Iraq. His support \nhelped to build momentum for our effort to redeploy the troops from \nIraq and move toward a better national security strategy, and I thank \nhim for it.\n  We will miss his presence here in the Senate, but of course the \nNation needs his unparalleled skills, and deep commitment to public \nservice, more than ever as he is now President of the United States. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with him on issues important to the \nAmerican people, and I thank him once again for his service here in the \nSenate.\n\n\n                              Joseph Biden\n\n  Mr. President, it has been a pleasure to serve with Senator Joe Biden \nfor the last 16 years. He is an outstanding colleague and a good \nfriend, and I know that he will make a terrific Vice President. I have \nbeen pleased to work with him on so many issues over the years. For \ninstance, I was proud to support him in his tremendous work on the COPS \nprogram. In turn I appreciate his steadfast support of campaign finance \nreform issues over the years.\n  Most of all, I want to say how much I have enjoyed serving with \nSenator Biden on the Foreign Relations and Judiciary Committees. I also \ncan attest to his mastery of the complicated issues he faced in both \ncommittees. It is a huge challenge to take on the chairmanship of a \nSenate committee, and to do it well, but to serve with such distinction \nas chair of two of the Senate's most important committees is very rare, \nand it speaks volumes about Joe Biden's service in this body.\n  I have always found Senator Biden to be someone who I could talk with \nseriously about issues of mutual concern, or when we disagree. He is \nopen-minded and he really listens. That quality will surely serve him \nwell in his new position. He also, in my view, can be uniquely \npersuasive. He is one of the few Senators who I have actually seen \nchange people's minds during a committee debate. In a policy fight \ninvolving complex issues, Joe Biden is someone who you want to have on \nyour side.\n  Now Senator Biden becomes Vice President, and I know he will serve \nthe Nation with the same outstanding commitment and skill with which he \nserved the people of Delaware. I thank him for his many years of \ndistinguished service in the Senate, and look forward to continuing to \nwork with him, and President Obama, in the years to come.\n\n\n                         Hillary Rodham Clinton\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in thanking Senator \nHillary Rodham Clinton for her outstanding service in the Senate, and \nwishing her our very best as she becomes our Secretary of State. One of \nthe many reasons I strongly support her nomination for Secretary of \nState is because I have had the pleasure of working with Senator \nClinton, and I know what a skilled legislator and committed public \nservant she is. We have worked on a number of issues together over the \nyears, including fighting for family farmers and especially the dairy \nfarmers that are so important to both New York and Wisconsin. Finding \ncommon ground, we worked together to make sure dairy markets functioned \nproperly, to improve the milk income loss contract or MILC program, and \npushing for country-of-origin labeling, or COOL, legislation for dairy \nproducts. I was also proud to support the Paycheck Fairness Act, which \nshe authored, and to work with her on many other issues.\n  I also had the opportunity to travel with Senator Clinton and a \nnumber of other senators on an official trip to Afghanistan, Iraq, \nKuwait and Pakistan, where we listened to service men and women on the \nground, as well as local leaders. On that trip Senator Clinton deeply \nimpressed me with her depth of knowledge on foreign relations and \nnational security issues. Later I was very pleased to have her support \nfor my effort with Majority Leader Harry Reid to safely redeploy our \ntroops from Iraq, and I look forward to continuing to work with her on \nthese critically important issues as she becomes our next Secretary of \nState. Once again, I thank her for her service in this body, and I wish \nher all the best as she continues her service to the American people.\n\n\n                              Ken Salazar\n\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in thanking Ken Salazar for his \noutstanding service to the people of Colorado over the last 4 years. It \nhas been a pleasure to work with him on a number of issues; he is \nextremely easy to work with, both someone of integrity and great \npersonal decency. In particular, he has been one of the Senate's \nleaders when it comes to protecting the rights and freedoms of the \nAmerican people as we work to strengthen our national security. I was \nproud to work with him and a bipartisan coalition of Senators on the \nSAFE Act to change flawed provisions of the PATRIOT Act. I also \nappreciated his critical support of the NSL Reform Act, to address the \nserious misuse of the FBI's national security letter authorities. I \nalso know Senator Salazar's deep commitment to public lands and energy \nresources issues, and I think he will be an excellent Secretary of the \nInterior. Again, I thank him for his service in this body, and I look \nforward to continuing to work with him as he assumes the leadership of \nthe Interior Department.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to say a word of good wishes to the \nsenior Senator, albeit very briefly, from Colorado, Ken Salazar, as he \nleaves the Senate to become Secretary of the Interior.\n  As the son of 11th generation immigrants, from a family that farmed \nColorado's San Luis Valley for a century and a half, no one has a \ndeeper, more powerful connection to what opportunity means in this \ncountry than Ken Salazar.\n  I can remember one of the first times I met Senator Salazar. After we \nhad exchanged greetings, I said to him, ``My family came to America in \nthe 1800s. When did your family come here?''\n  He replied, ``Oh, about 500 years ago.''\n  Indeed, it is remarkable to think that the descendant of a family \nthat settled in the American West almost half a millennium ago will \nsoon be a Member of the cabinet of first African-American President of \nthe United States.\n  Only in America.\n  Indeed, though his parents, who served their country in World War II, \nwere not college-educated themselves, they made sure that Ken, his \nbrother, John, and their six brothers and sisters all graduated from \ncollege.\n  To be sure, Senator Salazar is a son of Colorado--a small businessman \nwho owned ice cream stores and radio stations and a farmer for more \nthan 30\n\n[[Page S715]]\n\nyears. Indeed, he practiced water and environmental law. Our \ncolleague's affection for the pristine, majestic beauty of the Silver \nState and its people is embedded in his DNA.\n  Senator Salazar also made a mark instantly on this institution. In 4 \nyears, he developed a reputation for bringing people together in common \npurpose--whether it was advancing renewable energy policy, confirming \njudges, standing up to abuses at the Justice Department, or championing \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  And I would add that as we work to expand that latter program today, \nhis leadership will be missed.\n  His time in this institution was short, but he has made those moments \ncount. As Senator Salazar seeks to find a balance between renewables \nand fossil fuels in the administration's energy choices, protect our \npublic lands, and restore integrity to what has been a deeply troubled \nDepartment, I am confident that as Interior Secretary he will bring the \nsame temperament to the job that he has brought to his responsibilities \nin the Senate, never forgetting those who came before us--whose sweat \nand heart remain at the very foundation of this great country of ours.\n  And so, today, we thank Senator Salazar for his service and wish him \nwell. As he has throughout his life, I have no doubt he will do a \nremarkable job for our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/21/senate-section/article/S715-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S715-S716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL CHERTOFF\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep gratitude to \nSecretary Michael Chertoff for the service he has given his country \nover the past 4 years as head of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Secretary Chertoff came to the job in February 2005, upon the \nretirement of the Department's first leader, Pennsylvania Governor Tom \nRidge, with an impressive record of public service as a Federal judge, \nan assistant attorney general, and a prosecutor. He leaves office in \nthe next few days with even greater distinction for shepherding the \nDepartment through the growing pains of, shall we say, its toddler \nyears, making great strides to turn the amalgam of 22 agencies--all \nwith different cultures and missions--and 200,000 employees into a \nsingle, focused Department. His commitment to the security of the \nAmerican people remains unswerving, for which he deserves the Nation's \nappreciation.\n  Leading the Department of Homeland Security is one of Washington's \ntoughest jobs and probably one of the most thankless. The Department of \nHomeland Security carries with it the awesome responsibility for \nsafeguarding the Nation against terrorist attacks and natural \ndisasters. It incorporates many different agencies, with missions \ncritical to the American people, ranging from emergency management; to \nimmigration and border security; to air, rail, and highway travel \nsecurity; cybersecurity; science and technology; biological and \nchemical security; and infrastructure protection. Unfortunately, the \nSecretary gets no credit for terrorist attacks that have been averted \nand, of course, would be blamed if an attack were to occur. Let me say \nthat I believe our country is safer than it was when Secretary Chertoff \nbegan his tenure at the Department, and it is in part due to his \nattentive and forceful leadership--and the dedicated service of the men \nand women he had led--that the country has been spared from another \nterrorist attack. His contribution toward efforts to disrupt the plot \nto destroy airplanes en route from Great Britain to the United States \nin August 2006 is especially noteworthy.\n  Secretary Chertoff brought a rigorous, clear-eyed intensity to the \nDepartment's many challenges. He has worked hard to set priorities for \nthe Department and lay out a roadmap to achieve goals. While we in \nCongress have not agreed with all of his decisions, he has spoken \nclearly about his goals and been honest with us and the American people \nabout the difficult tradeoffs involved in many aspects of homeland \nsecurity.\n  Obviously, the Department is still a work in progress with many \nchallenges ahead. But the Secretary has made an indelible mark in a \nnumber of areas. I will mention just a few that are of deep importance \nto me. First, I would note that it has been under Secretary Chertoff \nthat the serious work of protecting the government's information \ntechnology infrastructure began. Our enemies and economic competitors \nare highly skilled at using computer systems to try to gain advantage \nover us. Secretary Chertoff realized this, took the threat seriously, \nand moved to secure government networks in a coordinated, comprehensive \nway through the creation of the comprehensive national cybersecurity \ninitiative, CNCI. CNCI is still in its nascent stages and many other \nagencies have responsibility for its success, but I am pleased the \nSecretary moved with resolve to improve our defenses against \ncyberintruders.\n  Under Secretary Chertoff's leadership, DHS has made important strides \nin improving its financial management. DHS has taken important steps \ntoward improving its grades from OMB on information security, and, I am \ntold OMB's latest data will show that the morale of the Department's \nemployees has definitely improved.\n  To his credit, Secretary Chertoff learned from his Department's \nmistakes responding to Hurricane Katrina and set to work to recreate \nFEMA, and enable it to leverage DHS' many other significant resources, \nso that it can become, for the first time in its history, an emergency \nmanagement agency capable of responding to a catastrophic disaster.\n\n  The fact is that today, FEMA is not the same agency it was in 2005. \nThat's because the Secretary has been an instrumental ally in \nimplementing legislation I was honored to draft with my colleague on \nthe committee, Senator Collins, to transform FEMA into a stronger, more \naccountable, and more coordinated agency. It is now elevated to a \nspecial status within DHS--like the Coast Guard--so that its \nauthorities and assets cannot be changed without congressional approval \nand its administrator is the President's principle adviser in an \nemergency. Key FEMA officials now are required to have relevant \nemergency management experience; its preparedness duties are united \nwith its response functions so that the same people who prepare for \nemergencies also respond to them. FEMA now has responsibility for \ndispensing $2 billion in homeland security grants and its 10 regional \noffices are getting stronger by the day. To the Secretary, I would say \nthat the Department's much improved internal coordination and \ncoordination with State and local officials during the 2008 hurricane \nseason attests to the improvements that have been made.\n  There are many other areas in which Secretary Chertoff's leadership \nhas been instrumental, including border and port security, chemical \nsecurity, information-sharing, and developing the architecture to \nprotect the nation of terrorist attacks using weapons of mass \ndestruction. And, of course, all Americans who travel by air have been \nmade safer by the Secretary's focus on improving the Transportation \nSecurity Administration.\n  I cannot talk about all of the Secretary's accomplishments today. But \nI would be negligent if I did not thank him for his assistance in \nachieving a goal that has a very low national profile, but which has \nsignificant ramifications for the 200,000 employees at the Department. \nI am talking about efforts to consolidate most of the Department's \nheadquarters under one roof at St. Elizabeths Hospital campus in \nsoutheast Washington. The Department's headquarters is spread \nthroughout more than 70 buildings across the Washington area, making \ncommunication, coordination, and cooperation between its component \nparts a real challenge. A unified headquarters would allow employees to \nwork more efficiently and interactively and is a critical cornerstone \nof the efforts to improve management and integration at the Department. \nI am pleased the National Capital Planning Commission recently approved \na master plan for a consolidated headquarters at St. Es. I expect \nconstruction to begin later this year, And I thank Secretary Chertoff \nfor his leadership in this effort.\n  In the short time since it was created in 2002, the Department of \nHomeland Security has become an equal among the most important \ngovernment agencies responsible for our national security, such as the \nDepartment of Defense. Secretary Ridge launched the process and \nadmirably led the Department through the initial challenge of\n\n[[Page S716]]\n\nmerging scores of agencies and programs--the largest government \nreorganization in half a century. Secretary Chertoff has moved the \nDepartment to the next level, where it now has a focused, long-term \nstrategy clarifying the Department's priorities, roles, and \nresponsibilities, as well as those of other key Federal, State, and \nlocal partners. He has worked tirelessly to ensure an integrated and \noverarching vision of how the government will tackle its role of \ndefending the homeland.\n  We have much work ahead to transform the Department into a mature \nagency whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts. But we have \nmade steady progress. The threat of natural disasters is ongoing and \nthe threat of terrorism remains with us. As I have often said, these \nare not ordinary times. They demand extraordinary commitment from those \nwho have chosen public service. Secretary Chertoff has given our \ncountry his extraordinary commitment, and he will be well and \ngratefully remembered for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/21/senate-section/article/S716-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            75TH ANNIVERSARY OF HOSTELLING INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to \nrecognize the 75th anniversary of Hostelling International USA. Since \n1934, Hostelling International USA has helped facilitate travel within \nthe United States by the world's youth and promoted intercultural \nunderstanding. As part of the international hostelling movement, this \norganization has helped Americans to experience different parts of \ntheir own country and helped international travelers to better \nunderstand our unique and proud history, people, and way of life.\n  The sharing of cultures that naturally occurs in a hostel helps \npeople to better understand and identify with others of various \nbackgrounds. Instead of retreating to a hotel room every night, \ntravelers in a hostel are literally living beside and interacting with \nfellow travelers from other countries. Several of my staff have stayed \nin hostels while traveling, and I know their experiences have helped \nshape their ability to appreciate different cultures and points of \nview. In this respect, it is the small, everyday human interactions \nthat can have the biggest impact, like encountering someone who may not \nspeak English and learning to communicate or sharing favorite foods \namong an international group of travelers.\n  In my home State of Iowa, the Northeast Iowa Council of Hostelling \nInternational USA has provided activities for youth and adults alike in \nPostville and surrounding communities since 1975. I am glad that Iowans \nhave the benefit of this programming to give a greater understanding of \nthe world and its people to residents who may not have had a chance to \ntravel widely. I am also glad that Hostelling International USA \ncontinues to provide the opportunity for people from around the world, \nand especially young people, to see the real America firsthand and meet \nthe American people. This is the best way to build good will across the \nglobe, and I congratulate Hostelling International USA for its 75 years \nof service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/21/senate-section/article/S716-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S716-S718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am an Idaho youth, currently learning how to drive, but \n     due to the ridiculously high gas prices it is not as much fun \n     as I was expecting it to be. Because of these prices I feel \n     bad about doing something I need to know how to do. I am also \n     a musician and because of that I am constantly going to \n     rehearsals and performances and need to drive in order to get \n     where I need to be. I do in fact carpool but because most of \n     the people I would carpool with also have very busy schedules \n     it is extremely hard to coordinate. Not only must I travel to \n     get to my rehearsals and performances but I am also a \n     transfer student at my school due to their spectacular music \n     program. Because I am not in the school's boundary it is \n     quite a distance for me to travel two ways every day. Simply \n     because I have a passion for music and want to pursue a \n     career in it I must break not only my own but also my \n     parents' wallets. Due to my age many people will not hire me \n     so it is quite a financial strain seeing as how I do not make \n     an income, and only so many people need a babysitter.\n       I personally would greatly appreciate if the government \n     would take the time and money to look into alternative \n     renewable energy sources. Not only can we do that on a \n     national level but on a more local level we could create more \n     public transportation systems. The only place we have \n     anything is in Boise, and I, as well as many others, live in \n     Meridian. If there was a bus or light rail that I could get \n     on in my town and travel to Boise or Nampa, and anywhere in \n     between, I assure you I would use it. And, I'm pretty \n     positive that I'm not the only person who would. Not only \n     would this save many people's wallets but it would also be \n     very handy for those of us who are yet to be licensed. Not to \n     mention that the reduced number of cars would lower pollution \n     levels greatly. Please look into a public transportation \n     system locally. It would be greatly appreciated by many, and \n     thank you for finally giving the people more of a voice on \n     the issue and for bringing attention to the Congress.\n     Brittan Chastaine.\n                                  ____\n\n       I assume you have already seen this website dollargas.us. \n     It seems to me that as a nation we are not only in serious \n     debt, but we are allowing ourselves to be put in ``bondage'' \n     by other countries needlessly. I am angry and frustrated that \n     we are not more assertive in addressing this problem.\n       We have a family of nine children all are on their own. \n     Some are married and have young families as well as trying to \n     get through college. As you know, job wages are not very \n     substantial in college towns for students. The increase in \n     the cost of fuel is driving other costs up as well. These \n     young adults are trying very hard to make ends meet and it is \n     becoming more difficult for them to live within their means. \n     Wages are not keeping up with the cost of living. This is \n     forcing mothers out of the home and children which is not in \n     the best interest of the family.\n       The rising cost of fuel is also precluding their visits to \n     our home as well as our visits to their homes. The visits are \n     the short range effect but the long range effect is \n     grandchildren having less interaction with grandparents which \n     further weakens the family structure. The family is the basic \n     unit of society and as the family weakens the values of \n     society and our nation are also weakened. There is strength, \n     honor, value and a sense of duty in knowing personal \n     heritage.\n       Our livelihood is farming, luckily we have enough fuel \n     which was bought two years ago and hopefully will finish out \n     the needs for this year. It is a tragedy that farms are being \n     sold and subdivisions are taking over good Idaho farm ground. \n     Rising fuel costs and fertilizer prices are becoming a \n     serious burden.\n       I do hope you will strongly support opening and drilling \n     domestic oil resources as well as other technologies that \n     provide efficient energy alternatives.\n       Thank you for your time. Thank you for listening. Please \n     represent the state of Idaho in finding ways to cut rising \n     fuel and energy costs.\n     Cheryl Okelberry.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband is a Viet Nam veteran who retired after 30 years \n     with the Boise Police Department. I have worked all my life \n     so when he was eligible for retirement, we had saved and \n     planned and we were in a good position to do so. In the five \n     years since he retired, we have seen our insurance premiums \n     rise over $400 per month to $1,020 per month, and we know \n     that is a bargain! Because of oil prices, grocery prices are \n     rising, Idaho Power just raised their rates, the gas company \n     is sure to follow and fuel prices have made it almost \n     prohibitive to travel except in necessity. We have a little \n     place in the mountains and to get there now costs $90+ just \n     to enjoy a weekend away from the heat and noise in Boise. Our \n     nest egg is dwindling, and we are stuck in the house watching \n     it disappear! And we are far luckier than most--we don't have \n     to choose between food and gas, yet.\n       Saudi Arabia says they make money at $70 per barrel; why is \n     the price $130? The government has so mismanaged its own \n     affairs that we find ourselves at the mercy of speculators \n     and oil shieks who don't like us much anyway. We have been so \n     short sighted that we haven't the refineries to process oil \n     even if\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\n     you do allow drilling in the Arctic or offshore. While France \n     gets 80% of its power from nuclear plants, we languish and \n     waste costly oil to light and power our homes when Nuclear \n     power would do the job for pennies comparatively. We need a \n     ``Manhattan Project''--throw the weight of the government and \n     the best minds behind getting nuclear facilities on line, \n     build new refineries, develop methods for cleaner burning \n     coal. Stop arguing about which side of the aisle is the right \n     side, and do something for the people you were elected to \n     represent.\n     Penny Taylor, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for taking the time to hear my input on fuel \n     prices. I hope this letter reaches the ears of your fellow \n     Senators. I own and operate a small business with one truck. \n     I spend approximately $700 each time I fill my truck with \n     diesel. This occurs about 3-4 times per month. I also own and \n     operate heavy equipment which costs about $800 to $1,000 per \n     month to fuel. I have raised my prices slightly, however, \n     work is scarce. Raising prices too high will result in loss \n     of work. It appears that many people in government do not \n     care about their constituents. Do you pay for fuel? How about \n     health care? Maybe we ought to vote on whether you and your \n     fellow senators should receive a fuel allowance and free \n     health care on taxpayers' money. Maybe then, you can get your \n     heads back out where the sun is shining! It is time to tell \n     the environmentalists to cram it. Start drilling in our own \n     country, providing jobs to our own people, and supplying our \n     own nation with energy. By the way, how is the government \n     going to tax electric cars? Let me guess, raise our electric \n     rates? I guess I could use biodiesel, but it costs more than \n     regular diesel. Oh yeah, big oil cannot profit from \n     biodiesel. Are you going to do anything about the oil \n     speculators? No. Reducing speculation would cut into the \n     retirement accounts of 90 percent of Senators and \n     Congressman. After all, you already have free health care and \n     fuel allowances. Why is it okay for other countries to drill \n     off our coastline, but we cannot? Quite frankly, Senator, no \n     disrespect, but something needs to be done. Enough already. \n     Tell your fellow Senators to do something.\n                                                            Devin.\n       Gasoline Prices at the Pump--I am sure there are many watch \n     dog groups out there looking at the record breaking profits \n     of the large oil companies, but does DOE or DOJ investigate \n     price fixing, price gouging and record profits of the large \n     oil companies? I am not talking about regulating the oil \n     industry, but just watching out for the average Joe who has \n     no option but ``has to grin and bear it'' at the pumps.\n       Miles Per Gallon--Before the fleet MPG average included \n     light trucks and SUVs the automakers call a lot of cars \n     ``SUVs'' as to not include them in the car category, now that \n     light trucks and SUVs are included in the average, maybe \n     automakers will be forced to work on raising Fleet MPG \n     averages. But the MPG mandates that the government set for \n     Auto Makers to establish for their fleets is still not high \n     enough. Maybe it needs to revised each and every year and not \n     on the Washington average for change--Ten Years.\n       On a personal level, I cannot run out and buy a new vehicle \n     that gets 10 percent better MPG. That would cost me 20K in \n     order to save $500 per year in gas. Maybe if all vehicles had \n     a Green rating (scale of 1-10, one being a \\3/4\\ ton PU and \n     10 being a 40 MPG car) and you got a tax rebate of $100 times \n     the Green rating of your primary family vehicle.\n       Example: $100 times a Green rating of 8 lets you deduct \n     $800 from your taxes.\n       Nuclear Power--There is a reason why France generates 80 \n     percent of their electricity from Nuclear Power, it is a \n     national initiative. In the US, it's left up to large \n     electrical companies to decide whether they can make it work \n     economically before they decide to build the next generation \n     power plants. Remember, what killed the US nuclear industry \n     is not safety, fuel recycling, waste disposal but economics. \n     Look at Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant, its construction was \n     stalled to the point with legal red tape until it would never \n     make a profit for its owners and it never will. What you and \n     other politicians need to do its step forward and mandate DOE \n     to fund, build and operate the next generation nuclear power \n     plant as a National Strategic Initiative. It is essential to \n     the Nations Security as any Military Base, Port Security \n     Effort or any other effort to keep this country safe in the \n     world. If the government does it ``strong arm method'' and it \n     gets done (on time and with in budget) and it is demonstrated \n     how safe and economically feasible it is, commercial Nuclear \n     Power Plant Building will follow.\n       Alternative forms of electrical generation either need an \n     increase in their incentives (they almost did not get \n     extended this year) or Carbon Producers (Coal and Oil Power \n     Plant) need higher ``Carbon Taxes''.\n       Electrical Reduction at Home--I would love to install new \n     windows in my home, but at $6,000 to replace all my windows, \n     I need help in the form of tax credits in order to afford it. \n     If the government reinstituted many of its programs from the \n     70's to help pay for home improvements, it would help.\n     John K., Ammon.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have been traveling back and forth from Burly every \n     weekend for the past couple of years. My ex-husband took my \n     kids from me in the divorce because I could not afford to pay \n     for a lawyer. He then moved from Boise to Burly to be closer \n     to his parents who had moved back to Burly a couple of years \n     earlier. The trip used to cost about sixty dollars to get \n     them and then take them back later. I make the trip so my \n     parents and I can spend time with my children. I have been \n     forced to cut that back to every other week because it costs \n     us almost a hundred dollars each time to go and get them. It \n     breaks my heart.\n       Now solutions to high gas prices:\n       For one drill our resources in and around the US. Open up \n     everything: Alaska, the coast, outer continental shelf, \n     everywhere. We need to have both Congress and the President \n     lift their moratoriums on this issue. We must start now \n     because the problem will still exist in five and even ten \n     years. It may get better for a time but it will come back \n     again and again if we don't solve it.\n       Secondly we need to begin to convert coal and shale to oil. \n     Converting coal to oil is more than sixty-five year old \n     technology. My understanding is that shale is a more recent \n     technology, but very reasonable. We need to have Congress \n     back companies to convert these products to oil with a \n     subsidy that in the event that prices drop below profitable \n     levels that these companies will not be out billions of \n     dollars. OPEC dropped prices last time we attempted to become \n     oil independent. They will do it again. We need to be energy \n     independent regardless of what OPEC does with prices this \n     time or this will happen again.\n       Lastly develop nuclear power. We need to take our \n     expendable resources away from electric production. Nuclear \n     power is a viable alternative especially considering recent \n     technology advances in this field.\n       We must take control of our own destiny. Take the power \n     away from foreign countries.\n     Angela.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am disgusted with our legislators in the federal \n     government. They aren't acting in our best interests, nor \n     have they for many years. I do not trust them to do right by \n     the U.S. citizens; collectively, greed and the lust for power \n     have become commonplace and acceptable behavior among many \n     legislators.\n       I retired last year but am going to have to find a part \n     time job to help make ends meet, as prices in general are \n     escalating faster than my fixed income in retirement. I do \n     not have the answers, but I am sure that our legislators own \n     stock in the major oil companies, and that pretty much says \n     it all. Americans are just a big cash cow for our ravenous \n     government to feed upon.\n       Additionally, I wanted to add something regarding the \n     transit system in the Treasure Valley. I am from Seattle and \n     have seen the problems the Puget Sound area has experienced \n     as a result of rapid growth. The transit system in the \n     Treasure Valley is way behind in its development. The City \n     and county fathers had better do something soon. But the \n     transit system issue doesn't seem to be holding a place of \n     great importance in the development of this area. That's \n     worrisome. There should be more advertising and incentives \n     for people to use the transit system, and more routes made \n     available. Encouraging ridership is important, but it needs \n     to be (and can be) made more convenient and attractive.\n       Thanks for your time.\n     Gretchen, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for your concern about our high energy costs. We \n     are very concerned about this issue because it is hitting our \n     household in two ways. We own a small trucking company and to \n     be truthful, we don't know how much longer we will be able to \n     run. The rising price of diesel is making our profit margin \n     shrink and our own household budget is struggling to make \n     ends meet. It is difficult to expand our budget for the \n     rising energy costs, because the money just isn't there. We \n     are doing the best we can, but it is so frustrating when we \n     feel that our own country is not utilizing its own energy \n     sources. It is time to allow drilling offshore and in our own \n     country for oil and natural gas. We also can further \n     knowledge in alternative energy sources at the same time. \n     Those two ideas should not oppose each other, they can and \n     should both be explored.\n       Please vote for those measures that would allow both \n     pursuits\n       Thank you,\n     Ralph and Julie Miller.\n                                  ____\n\n       I feel very depressed that our country is going down the \n     tubes all being done by the left wing special interests. I \n     would like to see a full blown debate on global warming. Just \n     because the father of the Internet, Al Gore, says it so and \n     the UN agrees does not mean that it is true. We are told all \n     kinds of things that are happening and are suppose to agree \n     when one simple question should be asked: Has it happened \n     before? Why not ask this simple question ask when pictures \n     showing glaciers melting, hurricanes, cyclones, etc.? We need \n     to put all these doomsday projections into perspective. In \n     college I took geology 101 and one of the things that I \n     remember is the world is always changing.\n       I was also an economics major and was taught about supply \n     and demand. I was taught that if the demand went up and the \n     supply stayed the same, the price went up. I guess that I \n     should have been taught you demagogues it. Do the liberals \n     have one idea on how to increase the supply. I would like to \n     see Republicans stand up and take a strong position that we \n     need to secure our future by drilling. We need to get back to \n     what made the country great. The one thing that makes a \n     country great verses a socialist country is a free market \n     that will sort out\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\n     the problem if left free. Republican Party used to stand for \n     something and it needs to again. What happened to small \n     government, sound economic policies, stay out of our way? We \n     have a drug benefit plan but would it be better if they \n     allowed a free market to bring prices down. I used to get my \n     US manufactured meds from Canada but now pay a little less \n     under a Medicare plan. If they can sell in Canada and make \n     money, why not in the US? Why not free trade and competition?\n       By the way, because of the lack of sun spots we might be \n     going into a little ice age, then what will the politicians \n     do?\n       Thank you for reading this.\n     Bob.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/21/senate-section/article/S718-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S718-S719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-498.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to \nmodify the conditions for the release of products from the Northeast \nHome Heating Oil Reserve Account, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I rise today to speak on a bill I am introducing with my \ncolleagues, Senators Dodd and Kerry, to improve the Northeast Home \nHeating Oil Reserve program to ensure that when our country experiences \nthe next energy crisis we are better prepared. Specifically, I believe \nthat this legislation will provide flexibility as well as certainty \nthat heating oil currently sitting in New England will be used when it \nis most essential to the region's population.\n  Through Senator Dodd's leadership in 2000, Congress created the \nNortheast Home Heating Oil Reserve, which put in place a critical tool \nto reduce supply disruptions. At that point, heating oil prices were \n$1.49 per gallon, and while the situation has improved since the price \nspikes this past summer, it is clear that the Northeast remains \ndangerously reliant on a commodity that has shown extreme volatility in \nrecent years. The need for of the Heating Oil Reserve was clearly \ndemonstrated this past summer when a catastrophe was emerging for our \nregion with heating oil reaching the unprecedented level of $5 per \ngallon. Thankfully, the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve provided a \nbasic level of assurance that heating oil could be provided if supplies \nwere dramatically interrupted.\n  However, the trigger mechanism for the release of the funds is \nconvoluted to the point that the program's functionality is in \nquestion. Indeed, under the law, the President does not have the \nability to release heating oil from the reserve even if the health and \nsafety of the population is at risk. Rather, the current threshold for \nrelease is when the differential between crude oil and heating oil is \n60 percent higher than the 5 year average. As a result, neither the \noverall price of heating oil nor the plight of our constituents has any \nfactor on the release of the reserve. The formula trigger in statute is \nflawed to the point that the actual trigger has come close to being met \nnot when crude oil prices are rising, but actually falling. This is \nclearly not the intent of the reserve.\n  The legislation that I am introducing with Senators Dodd and Kerry \ntoday streamlines the federal law to provide the President the \ndiscretion to release the reserve if the health and safety of the \npopulation is at risk. Furthermore, if heating oil prices are above $4 \nper gallon during the critical winter months, the heating oil \nautomatically will be distributed for sale. I believe this will \ndramatically improve the functionality of the reserve program and I \nlook forward to working with Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member \nMurkowski of the Energy Committee to enact this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 285. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat reimbursements for costs of using passenger automobiles for \ncharitable and other organizations are excluded from gross income, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce legislation \ntoday that would increase the mileage reimbursement rate for \nvolunteers.\n  Under current law, when volunteers use their cars for charitable \npurposes, the volunteers may be reimbursed up to 14 cents per mile for \ntheir donated services without triggering a tax consequence for either \nthe organization or the volunteers. If the charitable organization \nreimburses any more than that, they are required to file an information \nreturn indicating the amount, and the volunteers must include the \namount over 14 cents per mile in their taxable income. By contrast, for \n2009, the mileage reimbursement level permitted for businesses is 55 \ncents per mile, nearly four times the volunteer rate.\n  During this economic downturn we are asking volunteers and volunteer \norganizations to bear a greater burden of delivering essential \nservices, but the 14 cents per mile limit is imposing a very real \nhardship for charitable organizations and other nonprofit groups. This \nwas an even harsher constraint on volunteer activity when gasoline \nprices spiked last summer.\n  I have heard from a number of people in Wisconsin on the need to \nincrease this reimbursement limit. One of the first organizations that \nbrought this issue to my attention was the Portage County Department on \nAging. Volunteer drivers are critical to their ability to provide \nservices to seniors in Portage County, and the Department on Aging \ndepends on dozens of volunteer drivers to deliver meals to homes and \ntransport people to their medical appointments, meal sites, and other \nessential services.\n  As many of my colleagues know, nutrition is one of the most vital \nservices provided under the Older Americans Act and ensuring that meals \ncan be delivered to seniors or that seniors can be taken to meal sites \nis an essential part of that program. As I discovered during my ten \nyears as Chair of the Wisconsin State Senate Committee on Aging, the \nsenior nutrition programs not only provide needed nutrition services, \nbut in many cases, the congregate meals program provides an important \ncommunity contact point for seniors who may live alone, and the meals \nprogram may be the point at which many frail elderly first come into \ncontact with the network of services that can help them. For that \nreason, the senior nutrition programs are often at the heart of the \naging services network, and as such are essential for many critical \nservices that frail elderly may need.\n  Unfortunately, Federal support for the senior nutrition programs has \nstagnated in recent years, increasing pressure on local programs to \nleverage more volunteer services to make up for that lagging Federal \nsupport. The 14 cents per mile reimbursement limit has made it far more \ndifficult to obtain those volunteer services. Portage County reported \nthat at 14 cents per mile, many of their volunteers cannot afford to \noffer their services.\n  If volunteer drivers cannot be found, either those services will be \nlost, and those most vulnerable in our society will go wanting, or the \nservices will have to be replaced by contracting with a provider, \ngreatly increasing costs to the Department, costs that come directly \nout of the pot of funds available to pay for meals and other services. \nThe same is true for thousands of other nonprofit and charitable \norganizations that provide essential services to communities across our \nNation.\n  By contrast, businesses do not face this restrictive mileage \nreimbursement limit. As I noted earlier, for 2009 the comparable \nmileage rate for someone who works for a business is 55 cents per mile. \nThis disparity means that a business hired to deliver the same meals \ndelivered by volunteers for Portage County may reimburse their \nemployees\n\n[[Page S721]]\n\nnearly four times the amount permitted the volunteer without a tax \nconsequence.\n  This doesn't make sense. The 14 cents per mile volunteer \nreimbursement limit is badly outdated. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, Congress first set a reimbursement rate of 12 cents \nper mile as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, and did not \nincrease it until 1997, when the level was raised slightly, to 14 cents \nper mile, as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  The bill I am introducing today is identical to a measure I \nintroduced in the 109th Congress and the 110th Congress, and largely \nthe same as the version I introduced in the 107th and 108th Congresses. \nIt raises the limit on volunteer mileage reimbursement to the level \npermitted to businesses, and provides an offset to ensure that the \nmeasure does not aggravate the budget deficit. The most recent estimate \nof the cost to increase the reimbursement for volunteer drivers is \nabout $1 million over 5 years. Though the revenue loss is small, it is \nvital that we do everything we can to move toward a balanced budget, \nand to that end I have included a provision to fully offset the cost of \nthe measure and make it deficit neutral. That provision increases the \ncriminal monetary penalties for individuals and corporations convicted \nof tax fraud. The provision passed the Senate in the 108th Congress as \npart of the JOBS bill, but was later dropped in conference and was not \nincluded in the final version of that bill.\n  I also extend my thanks to the senior Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer, for including my bill in his larger omnibus volunteer driver \nrelief measure, the GIVE Act, last year, and the junior Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Cardin, for including my bill in this year's version of \nthe GIVE Act. Both Senators are keenly aware of the need for the change \nprovided by this bill, and I thank them for their leadership on this \nissue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure. It will help ensure \ncharitable organizations can continue to attract the volunteers that \nplay such a critical role in helping to deliver services and it will \nsimplify the tax code both for nonprofit groups and the volunteers \nthemselves.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 285\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to repeal the imposition of withholding on certain \npayments made to vendors by government entities; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nthe Withholding Tax Relief Act of 2009, which would repeal Section 511 \nof the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005. Section \n511 will require a 3 percent withholding on all Government contracts \nbeginning on January 1, 2011.\n  This legislation was sponsored in the 110th Congress by Senator Larry \nCraig, S. 777, and with his retirement, I have decided to continue to \npress for its passage to protect small businesses, contractors, and \nState and local governments who will be unfairly burdened by this \nonerous provision.\n  In 2006 Congress enacted tax relief on capital gains, dividends, and \nthe Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, as part of the Tax Increase \nPrevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005. These provisions provide \nimportant incentives for small businesses by encouraging investment \nthat can lead to job creation and economic growth. At the same time, \nthe Section 511 withholding tax provision was inserted at the last \nminute by conferees as a revenue raiser. As a result, the legislation \nwhich was intended to provide tax relief ended up containing a $7 \nbillion tax penalty on Government contractors.\n  If no action is taken to repeal this provision, Section 511 will \ninstitute a 3 percent tax withholding on all local, State, and Federal \nGovernment payments, effective on January 1, 2011. This will apply to \nGovernments with expenditures of $100 million or more, and will affect \npayments on Government contracts as well as other payments, such as \nMedicare, grants, and farm payments. Impacted firms will ultimately get \na refund when they file their tax return if the amount withheld is in \nexcess of what is actually owed.\n  The proponents of Section 511 argue that it will be an effective tool \nto close the tax gap--the difference between what American taxpayers \nowe and what they actually pay. However, an examination of the \nmechanics of the provision support a different conclusion. At the time \nof passage, Section 511 was estimated to increase revenue by $7 billion \nfrom 2011 to 2015. However, $6 billion of that amount is attained \nsolely because of the initial collection on contracts in 2011, not \nbecause of an actual revenue increase from increased\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\ntax compliance. Estimates show that Section 511 will only generate $215 \nmillion in 2012 and increases slightly in each of the 3 years \nthereafter.\n  While I support efforts to close the tax gap, those efforts must be \nweighed on a case-by-case basis against the unintended harm that is \ndone to those impacted. For example, the 3 percent figure is an \narbitrary amount and does not take into account the company's taxable \nincome or tax liability. As a result, an honest taxpaying contractor in \na loss year could be without access to the withheld capital for a \nsignificant period of time, only to see it returned when it files its \ntaxes. Many of these firms do not have extra capital on hand to get by \nand, because some file yearly returns as opposed to quarterly returns, \nwill not receive a refund on the amount withheld for 12 to 18 months. \nIn many cases, businesses operate with a profit margin that is smaller \nthan 3 percent of the contract; and in some cases, there is no profit \nat all. In these cases, Section 511 will effectively withhold entire \npaychecks--interest free--thereby impeding the cash flow of small \nbusinesses, eliminating funds that can be used for reinvestment in the \nbusiness, and forcing companies to pass on the added costs to customers \nor finance the additional amount.\n  Section 511 will also impose significant administrative costs on the \nFederal, State, and local governments who are required to create, or \nexpand, collections staffing to comply. The Congressional Budget \nOffice, CBO, said the provision constitutes an unfunded mandate on the \nState and local governments. According to CBO, the projected costs of \nSection 511 will exceed the $50 million unfunded mandate annual \nthreshold. On a Federal level, there is evidence that the high cost of \npreparation is unnecessary. For example, the Department of Defense \nestimated that the costs to comply with the 3 percent withholding \nrequirement could be in excess of $17 billion over the first 5 years, \nwhich is more than any estimated revenue gains.\n  There is strong support from a number of stakeholders for repeal of \nthe Withholding Tax requirement, including the Associated Builders and \nContractors, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of \nManufacturers, National Federation of Independent Business, and \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation.\n  I am pleased that this legislation garnered the support of 260 \ncosponsors in the House of Representatives, H.R. 1023, in the 110th \nCongress, with a broad mix of support from both parties. For example, \ncosponsors from the Pennsylvania delegation included Representatives \nAltmire, Brady, Carney, Doyle, English, Gerlach, Holden, Murphy, Pitts, \nPlatts, Sestak, and Shuster. In the Senate, I will seek to build on the \nefforts of Senator Craig and the 15 other cosponsors, including myself.\n  At the time of passage of the Tax Increase Prevention and \nReconciliation Act of 2005, Congress had not adequately debated the \nmerits of the withholding requirement in a committee hearing or with \ndebate in either body. An issue of this magnitude deserves proper \ndebate, and had that occurred, it is difficult to believe that Congress \nwould have included Section 511. For these reasons, I urge my \ncolleagues to support repeal of this unfair tax penalty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of supporters to \nthis bill be provided in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Government Withholding Relief Coalition\n\n       Aeronautical Repair Station Association; Aerospace \n     Industries Association; Air Conditioning Contractors of \n     America; Air Transport Association; America's Health \n     Insurance Plans; American Bankers Association; American \n     Concrete Pressure Pipe Association; American Congress on \n     Surveying and Mapping; American Council of Engineering \n     Companies; American Farm Bureau Federation; American Heath \n     Care Association; American Institute of Architects; American \n     Moving and Storage Association; American Nursery and \n     Landscape Association; American Road & Transportation \n     Builders Association; American Shipbuilding Association; \n     American Society of Civil Engineers; American Subcontractors \n     Association; American Supply Association; American Trucking \n     Associations.\n       Associated Builders and Contractors; Associated Equipment \n     Distributors; Association of National Account Executives; \n     Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers \n     Association; Coalition for Government Procurement; Colorado \n     Motor Carriers Association; Computing Technology Industry \n     Association; Construction Contractors Association; \n     Construction Industry Round Table; Construction Management \n     Association of America; Contract Services Association; Design \n     Professionals Coalition; Edison Electric Institute; \n     Engineering & Utility Contractors Association; Federation of \n     American Hospitals; Financial Executives International's \n     Committee on Government Business; Financial Executives \n     International's Committee on Taxation; Finishing Contractors \n     Association; Gold Coast Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; \n     Independent Electrical Contractors, Inc.\n       Information Technology Association of America; \n     International Council of Employers of Bricklayers and Allied \n     Craftworkers; International Foodservice Distributors \n     Association; Management Association for Private \n     Photogrammetric Surveyors; Mason Contractors Association \n     of America; Mechanical Contractors Association of America; \n     Messenger Courier Association of the Americas; Modular \n     Building Institute; National Association for Self-\n     Employed; National Association of Credit Management; \n     National Association of Manufacturers; National \n     Association of Minority Contractors; National Beer \n     Wholesalers Association; National Burglar and Fire Alarm \n     Association; National Defense Industrial Association; \n     National Electrical Contractors Association; National \n     Federation of Independent Business; National Italian-\n     American Business Association; National Precast Concrete \n     Association; National Office Products Alliance.\n       National Roofing Contractors Association; National Small \n     Business Association; National Society of Professional \n     Engineers; National Society of Professional Surveyors; \n     National Utility Contractors Association; National Wooden \n     Pallet and Container Association; North Coast Builders \n     Exchange; Office Furniture Dealers Alliance; Oregon Trucking \n     Association; Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors--National \n     Association; Printing Industries of America; Professional \n     Services Council; Regional Legislative Alliance of Ventura \n     and Santa Barbara Counties; Santa Rosa Chamber of Commerce; \n     Security Industry Association; Sheet Metal and Air \n     Conditioning Contractors National Association, Inc.; Small \n     Business & Entrepreneurship Council; Small Business \n     Legislative Council; Textile Rental Services Association of \n     America; The Associated General Contractors of America.\n       The Association of Union Constructors; The Distilled \n     Spirits Council of the U.S.; The Financial Services \n     Roundtable; U.S. Chamber of Commerce; United States Telecom \n     Association; Women Impacting Public Policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 293. A bill to provide for a 5-year carryback of certain net \noperating losses and to suspend the 90 percent alternative minimum tax \nlimit on certain net operating losses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to expand a widely-used business tax benefit whereby \nbusiness owners balance-out net losses over prior years when the firm \nhas a net operating gain. Spreading out this tax liability helps a \nbusiness to decrease the adverse impact of a difficult year. At the \ncurrent time, there is a critical need for pro-growth policy \ninitiatives to ensure an economic recovery.\n  Specifically, this legislation increases the general net operating \nloss, NOL, carryback period from 2 years to 5 years in the case of an \nNOL for any taxable year ending during 2007, 2008, or 2009. As an \nexample, a company could offset NOLs in 2008 against positive income it \nearned in 2003-2007; resulting in a refund paid in 2009. NOLs represent \nthe losses reported by a company within a taxable year and, under \ncurrent law, generally may be carried back 2 years and forward 20 years \nfor tax purposes.\n  Under current law, NOLs are not allowed to reduce Alternative Minimum \nTax, AMT, liability by more than 90 percent. My legislation would \neliminate this limit. This second provision is necessary for this bill \nto achieve its goal of allowing firms dollar-for-dollar access to their \nNOLs. This is because firms with temporarily low income are more likely \nboth to create NOLs and to find themselves subject to the AMT.\n  From an economic standpoint, the key impact of the bill will be to \nlower the user cost of capital for firms and to encourage business \nfixed investment for those firms that were profitable in the past 5 \nyears but are not profitable at the current time. Such firms will \nreceive an immediate refund for their current costs.\n\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, \nand National Federation of Independent Business, NFIB, have all been \nsupportive of this proposal in previous years.\n\n[[Page S723]]\n\n  Similar legislation was considered in the 110th Congress, but was not \nenacted. During consideration of the Recovery Rebates and Economic \nStimulus for the American People Act of 2008, an amendment drafted by \nthe Senate Finance Committee leadership included this important \nprovision, as well as other items. On February 6, 2008, the Senate \nrejected this broader package on a procedural vote, leaving it just 1 \nvote short of the 60 that were required. Ultimately, that bill included \ntax rebates for individuals and capital investment incentives for \nbusinesses. Following that debate, I introduced the NOL carryback \nprovision as a stand-alone bill, S. 2650, with 7 cosponsors.\n  Over the long-term, this is a low cost proposal for the taxpayer that \ncan stimulate economic growth. According to a February 2004 report \nentitled ``Stimulating Job Creation and Investment: Economic Impact of \nNOL Carryback Legislation,'' by Kevin A. Hassett, Ph.D, and Brian C. \nBecker, Ph.D, ``If enacted, this expansion of the carryback period \nwould result in current-year refunds for many companies that otherwise \nwould have to wait until future years to apply NOLs. Having done so, \nhowever, would reduce the quantity of losses that are carried forward, \nand hence increase, relative to baseline, tax revenue in the future. As \nsuch, the tax revenue implications are negative initially, but positive \nin the future.'' The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that passage \nof a similar provision as part of the Senate Finance Committee Stimulus \npackage, which I referenced earlier in my statement, would have cost \n$15 billion in 2008 and $5.1 billion over 10 years.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation that will \nhelp numerous industries that are currently struggling to survive in a \nharsh economic downturn.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 294. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nand modify the special allowance for property acquired during 2009 and \nto temporarily increase the limitation for expensing certain business \nassets; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to extend two important provisions that were enacted as \npart of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008: 50 percent Bonus \nDepreciation; and Increased $250,000 limit for the Small Business \nExpensing Allowance.\n  I introduced S. 2539 and cosponsored S. 269 similar legislation in \nthe 110th Congress.\n  I support tax policies to spur new business investments through the \nuse of partial and full expensing. When a company buys an asset that \nwill last longer than one year, the company cannot, under most \ncircumstances, deduct the entire cost and enjoy an immediate tax \nbenefit. Instead, the company must depreciate the cost over the useful \nlife of the asset, taking a tax deduction for a part of the cost each \nyear. By allowing firms to deduct the cost of a new asset in year one, \nexpensing spurs new investments quickly and drives immediate job \ncreation.\n  As part of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008--passed by Congress and \nsigned by the President on February, 13, 2008--I successfully included \nmy legislation, S. 2539, to allow for an immediate 50 percent ``bonus \ndepreciation'' on new equipment purchases. This provision only applied \nto purchases made in 2008 and my legislation would extend the benefit \nfor an additional year.\n  The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 also provided a 1-year boost in the \nSection 179 Small Business Expensing Allowance. This provision, which \nalso applies to equipment, was increased to a $250,000 limit for 2008. \nAbsent further action, the benefit reverts to $125,000 in 2009 and will \nexpire at the end of 2010 and revert to $25,000. On January 25, 2008, I \ncosponsored legislation, S. 269, to increase the Small Business \nExpensing Allowance and to make it permanent. This legislation I am \nintroducing today would extend the $250,000 limit for an additional \nyear.\n  Both of these provisions merely accelerate a benefit that will be \ngiven to firms over a longer span. To that end, the cost will be higher \nin year one, but tax revenue will be higher in the years thereafter. \nAccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the cost of the ``bonus \ndepreciation'' provision as part of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 \nwas $43.9 billion in 2008, but just $7.4 billion over 10 years. The \nSmall Business Expensing Allowance provision was scored at $900 million \nin 2008, and only $100 million over 10 years.\n  These provisions were included in a broader package drafted by \nSenators Baucus, Grassley, Kennedy, and Enzi at the end of the 110th \nCongress. I look forward to working with these Members to seek \nextension of these expiring provisions in the 111th Congress.\n  Enactment of these provisions was an important step in the direction \nof allowing full expensing of new equipment. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport these pro-growth policies that create incentives for business \nexpansion and long-term economic growth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 295. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the quality and efficiency of the Medicare program through \nmeasurement of readmission rates and resource use and to develop a \npilot program to provide episodic payments to organized groups of \nmultispecialty and multilevel providers of services and suppliers for \nhospitalization episodes associated with select, high cost diagnoses; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nQuality and Payment Reform Act of 2009. This legislation will help \nimprove the quality and efficiency of the Medicare program by analyzing \nreadmission and resource use and adjusting Medicare payments \naccordingly. In addition, the legislation develops a large scale pilot \nproject to allow for episodic payments to organized groups of \nmultispecialty and multilevel providers for select, high cost \ndiagnosis. Reforms such as these have been recommended by the non-\npartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission or ``MedPAC,'' the \nCommonwealth Fund and many other experts. In their December 2008 Budget \nOptions report, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates reforms \nsuch as these could result in more than 28 billion dollars in savings \nto the Federal Government over 10 years.\n  For several years, growth in healthcare spending, including in the \nMedicare program, has far exceeded the rate of inflation for all other \ngoods and services without a concomitant rise in health care quality. \nAccording to the 2007 report of the McKinsey Global Institute, \n``Accounting for the Costs of Healthcare in The United States,'' the \nU.S. spends almost half a trillion dollars more on healthcare than \nother similarly situated countries, when adjusted for population and \nincome. Moreover, according to a 2008 Dartmouth report, total waste in \nthe U.S. healthcare system accounts for approximately $700 billion. \nThese data are startling and deeply troubling to me and many of my \ncolleagues in the Congress. As we move to consider comprehensive \nhealthcare reform legislation in the 111th Congress, it is critical \nthat we consider bold and decisive reforms to incentivize quality and \nefficiency in the U.S. healthcare system.\n  Many experts tell us that the present fee-for-service payment system \ndoes little to encourage the prevention of readmissions or control the \nvolume of care and cost of services delivered. MedPAC, CBO, and others \nbelieve this fee-for-service distortion is a major driver of excess \nspending in the healthcare system. Consequently, per-beneficiary \nspending varies between regions by as much as one-third without any \nmeasurable difference in patient outcomes. In addition, a la carte \nhealth care delivery focuses on individual procedures and patient \ninteractions without much regard for the integration of care and \nappropriate mix of services necessary.\n  For example, MedPAC reports that within 30 days of discharge, 17.6 \npercent of Medicare admissions are readmitted for which Medicare spent \n$15 billion in 2005. The Commonwealth Fund Commission on a High \nPerformance Health System found that Medicare 30-day readmission rates \nvaried from 14 percent to 22 percent with respect to the lowest and \nhighest decile of states.\n  MedPAC and other expert groups report that the bundling of Medicare \npayments around episodes of care will align financial incentives within \nthe program to maximize quality and efficiency for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. It is\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\ncritical to note that such reforms not only lower overall healthcare \ncosts but also have the potential to lower Medicare beneficiaries out \nof pocket expenses while improving their health. For example, the \nMedicare Participating Heart Bypass Center Demonstration conducted from \n1990 to 1996 explored the utility of payment bundling. In this \ndemonstration, participating centers were reimbursed with a bundled \npayment for episodes of care related to heart bypass cases. The \ndemonstration resulted in reduced spending on laboratory diagnostics, \npharmacy services, intensive care, and unnecessary physician consults \nwhile still maintaining a high quality of care. In the end, the \ndemonstration saved the Medicare program approximately 10 percent on \ncost of bypass treatments.\n\n  There is considerable agreement in the health policy community about \na move toward ``episodic'' or bundled payments. The 16th Commonwealth \nFund/Modern Health Care Opinion Leaders Survey, released November 3, \n2008, found that more than \\2/3\\ respondents reported that the fee-for-\nservice system is not effective at encouraging high quality and \nefficient care. More than \\3/4\\ of respondents prefer a move toward \nbundled per patient payments. Shared accountability for resource use \nalso was favored as a means for improving efficiency, and \\2/3\\ of the \nexperts surveyed supported realigning provider payment incentives to \nimprove efficiency and effectiveness.\n  This legislation makes three broad reforms to the Medicare program \nleading to higher quality and more efficient care. First, the \nlegislation requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \nHHS, to report on risk adjusted readmission rates and resource use to \nMedicare providers, and over time, to the public. Second, the \nlegislation establishes risk-adjusted benchmarks based upon these data \nthat, over time, will be utilized to adjust Medicare payments. Finally, \nthe legislation institutes a voluntary ``episodic payment'' pilot \nprogram.\n  Readmission will be defined by the Secretary of HHS and will include \na time frame of at least 30 days between the initial diagnosis and \nreadmission, insure that the readmission rate captures readmissions to \nany hospital and not be limited to the initial health care provider \nentity, and verify that the diagnosis for both initial and readmission \nare related. Within 1 year from enactment, HHS will be tasked with \nconfidentially reporting to provider entities risk adjusted for \nreadmission rates and risk adjusted resource use for select high-volume \ndiagnosis-related groups, DRG, associated with high-rates of \nreadmission. After 3 years, HHS will publically release these reports \nwith an annual review of the list of DRGs reported. The data reported \nwill be risk adjusted taking into account variations in health status \nand other patient characteristics. Physician's not reporting these data \nto HHS for analysis will be penalized; although physicians do have the \nability to apply for hardship exceptions.\n  The legislation requires HHS to establish benchmarks for risk \nadjusted readmission rates and resource utilization for a given DRG and \nwithin 2 years of enactment, report to Congress on methodologies used \nto develop such benchmarks. Three years from the date of enactment, the \nbase operating DRG payment to hospitals not meeting the established \nbenchmarks will be reduced by 1 percent or an amount that is \nproportionate to the number of readmissions exceeding the benchmark. \nThe Secretary of HHS will devise a mechanism to allocate accountability \namong providers associated with the episode of care with regard to \npenalty distribution. The benchmark and penalty will be evaluated and \nupdated annually.\n  The legislation goes further and establishes a voluntary pilot \nprogram to allow for bundled episodic payments to organized groups of \nmultispecialty and multilevel providers for select high cost \ninterventions. Payments would be risk adjusted and would cover all \nMedicare Part A and B costs associated with a hospitalization episode \nincluding care delivered 30 days after discharge. Payments would be \nissued to the participating provider group which, in turn, would \nreimburse negotiated payments to all individual providers associated \nwith episode of treatment. The pilot would include testing models in a \nvariety of settings including rural and underserved areas. The initial \npilot will begin 2 years from date of enactment and continue for a \nperiod of 5 years. If the pilot proves successful, the Secretary of HHS \nwill have the authority to expand the payment mechanism to a larger set \nof providers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 295\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings Relating to Medicare Reporting of Readmission \n     Rates and Resource Use and the Medicare Fee-for-Service \n     Payment System.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) does not publically or \n     privately report to health care providers on resource use \n     and, as a result, many health care providers are unaware of \n     their practices with respect to resource use.\n       (2) In 2008, the Congressional Budget Office reported that \n     areas with higher Medicare spending scored lower, on average, \n     on a composite indicator of quality of care furnished to \n     Medicare beneficiaries.\n       (3) Feedback on resource use has been shown to increase \n     awareness among health care providers and encourage positive \n     behavioral changes.\n       (4) The Medicare program pays for all patient \n     hospitalizations based on the diagnosis, regardless of \n     whether the hospitalization is a readmission or the initial \n     episode of care.\n       (5) The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission reports that \n     within 30 days of discharge from a hospital, 17.6 percent of \n     admissions are readmitted to the hospital. In 2005, the \n     Medicare program spent $15,000,000,000 on such readmissions.\n       (6) The Commonwealth Fund Commission on a High Performance \n     Health System found that Medicare 30-day readmission rates \n     varied from 14 percent to 22 percent with respect to the \n     lowest and highest decile of States.\n       (b) Findings Relating to the Bundling of Medicare Payments \n     to Health Care Providers.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Bundled payments incentivize health care providers to \n     determine and provide the most efficient mix of services to \n     Medicare beneficiaries with regard to cost and quality.\n       (2) The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission reports that \n     bundled payments around a given episode of care under the \n     Medicare program would encourage collaboration among \n     providers of services and suppliers, reduce fragmentation in \n     health care delivery, and improve the accountability for cost \n     and the quality of care.\n       (3) The Medicare Participating Heart Bypass Center \n     Demonstration which was conducted during the period of 1990 \n     to 1996 found that bundled payments for cardiac bypass cases \n     were successful in reducing spending on laboratory \n     diagnostics, pharmacy services, intensive care, physician \n     consults, and post-discharge care while maintaining a high \n     quality of care. The Medicare program saved approximately 10 \n     percent on bypass patients treated under the demonstration.\n       (4) The 16th Commonwealth Fund/Modern Healthcare Health \n     Care Opinion Leaders Survey, released November 3, 2008, found \n     that more than \\2/3\\ of respondents reported that the fee-\n     for-service payment system under the Medicare program is not \n     effective at encouraging high quality and efficient care and \n     more than \\3/4\\ of respondents reported preferring a move \n     toward bundled per patient payments under the Medicare \n     program. Respondents favored shared accountability for \n     resource use as a means for improving efficiency, and at \n     least \\2/3\\ of respondents supported realigning payment \n     incentives for providers of services and suppliers under the \n     Medicare program in order to improve efficiency and \n     effectiveness.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, we have made good progress on this \nlegislation today, the Ledbetter legislation. I am not filing cloture \ntonight. I am very confident we will be able to finish this bill \ntomorrow. If we do not, I will file cloture on it for a weekend cloture \nvote because we have to finish this bill this week. If people need more \ntime, they want to have some more debate and amendments on Friday, that \nis fine with me too.\n  I think this legislation sets a good tone that we can legislate here, \npeople can offer amendments, with no restrictions on the amendments. I \nthink this is the way we need to move forward.\n  The simple fact that we have 58, 59 Senators should not in any way \ngive us any idea that we can move through here without bipartisan \nsupport. So I hope we can do that. But we still have a schedule to \nmaintain. If that cannot be done, we will do some things over the \nweekend.\n  Progress is being made with the nominations. I hope once we get some \nmore reported out of the committees, we can move some of them out of \nhere quickly.\n  We have so much work to do in just a short period of time.

Mr. President, I wish to begin by congratulating Senator \nMikulski on her continued efforts in fighting for pay equality for \nwomen workers. This is a struggle that has gone on for decades. We are \nmaking some progress, but we have a long way to go and it is imperative \nthat we pass the Ledbetter legislation.\n  Yesterday, as everybody in the world knows, Barack Obama was sworn in \nas the President of the United States. I can tell my colleagues that in \nmy State of Vermont, and I expect all over this country and, in fact, \nin virtually every country in the world, there was great anticipation \nand great joy, not only because we have made history in our country by \nelecting the first African American ever elected President, but also \nbecause the people of this country demand that we begin moving America \nin a very different direction than where we have been going for the \nlast 8 years. Unfortunately, as President Obama assumes office, the \nCongress, the American people, and he are looking out at a set of the \nmost serious problems that our country has faced since the Great \nDepression. Let me take a very few minutes to give a broad outline of \nsome of those problems and some of the efforts I personally will be \nmaking in order to address these crises.\n  As a result of the outrageous greed and recklessness and dishonesty \non the part of a few hundred or a few thousand speculators on Wall \nStreet, our entire financial system is in danger of collapsing. That \nimpacts not only the United States but, in fact, the financial markets \nall over the world. At this point, the American taxpayer--primarily the \nmiddle class--has already put into the TARP bailout some $700 billion, \nbut in addition to that, the Fed has lent out trillions of dollars with \nvirtually no transparency and certainly no accountability. This is a \ncrisis we have to deal with in a number of ways. I will tell my \ncolleagues as somebody who voted against the original bailout and who \nvoted against the second bailout, we have to develop a mechanism that \ndoes more than pump hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars to \nbail out Wall Street. This is a difficult issue, it is a complicated \nissue, but it is an issue that we have to address.\n  Furthermore, in my view, we need an investigation to get at the root \nof the problem. I reject the idea, as some suggest, that this was a \nproblem caused by everybody; all of us are guilty in causing this \nfinancial crisis. That is wrong. The fact is there are a relatively \nsmall number of people--by and large people who in the last 5 to 10 \nyears have made hundreds of millions of dollars; in fact, in some cases \nhave accrued billions of dollars of wealth for themselves, who have \noperated in utter recklessness and, in my suspicion, in illegal \nmannerisms in order to make these incredible profits and to bring our \nfinancial system to the edge of collapse. We need to know who these \npeople are, how they did it, hold them accountable, and create \nlegislation which makes sure that we never, ever again are placed in \nthe position we are in today.\n  The truth of the matter is that while the financial crisis of the \nlast few months has exacerbated the economic problems that we are \nfacing as a Nation today, for many years, despite the assertions of the \nBush administration, the middle class has been in a significant state \nof decline, poverty has been increasing, and millions of people have \nlost their health insurance and their\n\n[[Page S731]]\n\npensions. What is happening today as a result of the financial crisis \nand the huge increase in unemployment is a situation where when people \nlose their jobs, they are losing their health insurance; when they are \nlosing their income, they are losing their ability to maintain their \nhomes and they are losing their homes; when they are losing their \nincome, they are unable to take care of their parents, they are unable \nto send their kids to college, and the dreams many people have fought \nfor their entire working lives are now disappearing. I can tell my \ncolleagues that in the State of Vermont we have received many e-mails \nand communications from elderly people, elderly workers who have told \nme that they have spent their whole lives working so they would have a \nsecure retirement, and now that retirement is disappearing with the \ndecline of the stock market. We are in the midst of a grave crisis and \nwe are going to need some bold thinking in order to get out of it.\n  Not only are we seeing a huge increase in unemployment, people losing \ntheir health insurance, poverty increasing, the reality is we continue \nto have--and we do not talk about this enough--by far the highest rate \nof childhood poverty of any major Nation on Earth. During my years in \nthe House and my time in the Senate, I have heard some of my colleagues \ntalk about family values. Well, let me say very clearly that having the \nhighest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world is not a \nfamily value, it is a national disgrace. Every psychologist in the \nworld will tell us that when kids grow up in poverty, when kids do not \nhave early childhood education, when kids go to poor schools, there is \na direct correlation between that reality and the fact that we have \nmore people behind bars today, more people in jail than any country in \nthe world, including China. How does that happen, that millions of \nAmericans end up in jail more so than in an authoritarian country such \nas China? If one thinks it does not have a relationship to the high \nrate of childhood poverty in this country and the fact that we are not \ninvesting in our kids, I think you would be wrong.\n  Last year, we continued the process of seeing a growing gap between \nthe very rich and everybody else. I know this is not an issue that many \npeople in the Congress choose to talk about, but it is an issue that \nmust be talked about, not only from a sense of morality but from a \nsense of basic economic well-being. In my view, it is not acceptable \nthat the top one-tenth of 1 percent earn more income than the bottom 50 \npercent. It is not acceptable that the top 1 percent own more wealth \nthan the bottom 90 percent. The whole issue of greed is something that \nwe as a Congress and as a Nation have to be talking about. Do people \nneed billions and billions and billions of dollars in personal wealth \nwhen we have children in this city and all over this country who are \nliving out in the streets and who are denied basic, decent quality \nchildcare? Is that the kind of Nation that we are about?\n  Since 2000, since the year 2000, nearly 6 million Americans have \nslipped out of the middle class and into poverty, the median income for \nworking age families has gone down by over $2,300, over 7 million \nAmericans have lost their health insurance, more than 4 million decent \npaying manufacturing jobs have been lost, and over 4 million workers \nhave lost their pensions. All of those figures will get worse because \nof the statistics we have seen in recent months because of the \nfinancial crisis. The dream of a college education is fading away for \nmany working families in my State and all over this country as college \ncosts go up while incomes go down. We are seeing a situation where \nhundreds of thousands of qualified students are unable to go to college \nbecause they simply don't have the money to do that, and many others \nare coming out deeply in debt and have to take jobs which they would \nrather not take in order to pay back their student loans. Meanwhile, in \nthe last 8 years, despite the bailout of Wall Street, with ongoing tax \nbreaks for the very wealthy, and with the war in Iraq, we now have a \nnational debt of over $10.5 trillion.\n  Another issue this Congress has to deal with is to address the \nreality that the United States of America remains the only major \ncountry on Earth that does not provide health care to all of its \npeople. Yet we end up spending substantially more per capita on health \ncare than any other Nation. But 47 million Americans have no health \ninsurance. Almost 20,000 Americans die every single year because they \ndon't have access to decent primary health care--they can't find a \ndoctor when they need it--and we pay the highest prices in the world \nfor prescription drugs.\n  With a new President, with a new Congress, the American people are \nasking whether finally we will have the courage to stand up to the \nlobbyists who are outside of this building every single day, who are \nwalking the corridors; can we stand up to the insurance companies, can \nwe stand up to the drug companies so that we finally--finally--will \nprovide quality health care, low-cost prescription drugs to every man, \nwoman, and child as a right of citizenship? Will we have the courage to \ndo that? I certainly hope we will.\n  As we speak, we are currently involved in wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan which have cost us not only the lives of thousands and \nthousands of wonderful young men and women, but they cost us over $10 \nbillion every single month. These wars are also stretching the Army and \nour National Guard to the breaking point. My hope is that in the next \nseveral months we will be developing policy to bring our troops home \nfrom Iraq as soon as we possibly can. I hope very much that we will \nhave not only a debate right here in Congress but a national \nconversation about how we deal with the very difficult issues of \nAfghanistan.\n  Despite the reality of global warming, our Nation still, despite \ndecades of talk, has not yet broken our dependency on fossil fuel and \nforeign oil. In fact, every single year we are spending more than $500 \nbillion bringing in oil from abroad. We have only begun--just begun--to \nmake the advances we need to make in terms of energy efficiency and \nsustainable energy. As a member of both the Environmental Committee and \nthe Energy Committee, it is my view that we have the potential to \ncreate millions of good-paying jobs as we transform our energy system \naway from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. We \ncan do that. We must do that.\n  As my colleagues well know, the major issue that this Congress is \ngoing to be dealing with in the next several weeks is an economic \nrecovery program. I strongly support the basic outlines of that \nprogram. Obviously, there is going to be a lot of debate about the \ndetails within it and the hope that we can target that money in such a \nway as to create good-paying jobs as quickly as possible in the most \ncost-effective way imaginable. What I can tell my colleagues is that in \nmy State--and I expect in the other 49 States in this country--our \ninfrastructure is collapsing. We have roads in the State of Vermont \nwhich have huge problems. We have all kinds of bridges that are in need \nof repair in our small towns. We have water systems that are simply \ninadequate. We have wastewater plants that need to be rebuilt. All of \nthese are very expensive propositions. So in the stimulus package, my \nhope is that we are going to put substantial sums of money into \nrebuilding our roads, our bridges, our water systems. I hope we begin \nto make the investment we need in public transportation--certainly \nrural public transportation in the State of Vermont--as one of many \nneeds. If you are a worker in one part of the State and you want to go \n50 miles to your job, in almost every case there is no public \ntransportation to get you there. If you are a senior citizen and wish \nto go to the hospital or the grocery store, it is very hard to get \nthere if you do not have a car. I suspect that is true all over rural \nAmerica. In addition, our rail system is far behind, where Europe, \nJapan, and even China are now advancing forward. So I hope for and will \nsupport a major increase in funding to create a substantial number of \nnew jobs as we rebuild our infrastructure.\n  In addition--I know President Obama has been very strong on this \nissue, and I agree with him--we need to invest heavily in energy \nefficiency. I can tell you that in the State of Vermont and, again, all \nover this country but especially in cold-weather States, you have older \nhomes where energy is just going through the roof--literally going\n\n[[Page S732]]\n\nthrough the roof and the windows--because of poor insulation. We can \ncreate jobs making our homes, our offices, our schools more energy \nefficient.\n  We need to be extremely aggressive, as I mentioned a moment ago, in \nterms of public transportation.\n  Also, right now we are on the cusp of major breakthroughs in such \nrenewable technologies as wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. I \nsuspect that in 20 years, people will see a very different energy \nsystem than we have right now. It will be a cleaner system. It will be \na system not emitting greenhouse gases.\n  There is a lot of work that stands in front of us. There was an \nelection in November where the people said: We want change. That is \nwhat that election was all about. Unless we are bold, unless we are \nprepared to take on the big money interests that have dominated \nlegislation for the last many years, there will be a great deal of \ndisappointment all over this country.\n  Now is the time. There is a lot of enthusiasm in the work President \nObama has been doing since he has been elected. There is an enormous \namount of hope and confidence in the air that we can move America in a \nnew direction. I hope that with new national leadership, with strong \ngrassroots participation, with a Congress prepared to stand up and take \non the powerful special interests that have dominated us for so many \nyears, we can fulfill the faith the American people have expressed in \nus in recent years and that, in fact, we can move America in a very \ndifferent direction and become the country all of us know we can \nbecome.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
