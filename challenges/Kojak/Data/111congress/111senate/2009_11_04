Mr. President, what I just read is a short way of saying we \nwasted another day. With all the work we have to do, we stood and \nlooked at each other yesterday--30 hours of doing nothing and the \nability to move legislation forward. Anybody who has been watching what \nhas taken place in the last 3 years knows the Republicans have become \nexperts in wasting time, the American taxpayers' time, the American \npeople's time.\n  Yesterday was no different. Yesterday, Republicans used every trick \nin the book to slow and stall so we couldn't do important work. And \n7,000 additional people lost their ability to have a check. It is \nstarting to get cold. It is getting cold in Washington; it was 40 \ndegrees. Maybe people can buy a coat for one of their kids, maybe they \ncan make that payment on the car before it is repossessed, or maybe \nthey can pay their rent before they are evicted. These people have been \nout of work for a long time, and we are trying to extend unemployment \nbenefits. And it is paid for. We are not borrowing the money to do \nthat. But, no, the Republicans have stalled and stalled. Now more than \n200,000 people have lost their ability to get that extra dollar they \nneed. These 200,000 people need help, but Republicans can't be bothered \nwith that. They are stalling, showing everybody they can stall things \nhere. They are doing that.\n  But I am grateful that the American people watching--two \ncongressional seats were open; there were two special elections \nyesterday. They were both won by Democrats. Democrats, Independents, \nand Republicans around the country know what has happened in this body \nin recent years. Republicans are the party of no. That is why, in New \nYork, a congressional district that for 150 years had been Republican \nwent Democratic. The American people see what is going on in this \nCongress.\n  In addition to the unemployment compensation extension being held up, \nwhich is paid for--not a penny of taxpayer money is being borrowed--\nRepublicans are standing in the way of giving businesses a tax break. \nThis legislation, when we pass it, will allow businesses--big and \nlittle businesses--to take into consideration a tax break. If they have \nlost money in the last few years, they can get a tax break; that is, to \ncarry forward a loss. They get a benefit from the loss. If they make \nmoney, they can set it off against the money\n\n[[Page S11064]]\n\nthey made as a result of losses they have been going through. We are \ntrying to help businesses--especially small businesses--compensate for \nthe losses they have endured in recent years. Again, Republicans are in \nno rush to help them. Each day that goes by is a real hurt to small \nbusinesses.\n  The good news is that we are making progress on health care reform. \nWe look forward to receiving, in a matter of days, the CBO analysis of \nthe proposals for fixing our health system that is so broken. We only \nhave 1 week before Veterans Day, November 11, and 1 week before the \nThanksgiving recess after that, then we will have only 3\\1/2\\ weeks \nuntil Christmas, and we have unemployment insurance stalled by the \nRepublicans; military construction, which we are trying to get done to \nallow for construction of military bases around America and the world \nwhere we have installations; Commerce-Justice-Science, which is an \nimportant piece of legislation, stalled for weeks.\n  It is interesting, we hear the Republicans come to the floor--I heard \none of the most unbelievable statements yesterday. Senator Stabenow was \nover there, and she had a chart that showed that 85 times this year the \nRepublicans have stopped either efforts to move forward on a bill or \nalmost 60 times we have had to invoke cloture to stop filibusters. A \nRepublican Senator came and said: Every one of those 85 was the result \nof our not being allowed amendments.\n  That doesn't pass the test of a kindergartner. A number of the things \nthey have held up are nominations. We have scores of President Obama's \nnominations being held up. And with Commerce-Justice-Science, they say \nthey have no amendments. Interesting. They have amendments that have \nbeen filed, and as soon as we get cloture, they will be able to debate \nthose amendments and vote on them. But, no, that wasn't enough \namendments. Maybe on that one they needed another ACORN amendment \nbecause they only had one. I think that would have added up to five or \nsix. Maybe that would please them, another ACORN amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the leader is onto something because it has been \na full 2 weeks since we had an ACORN amendment on the floor. So it is \nclear we should move to one, which is of the highest priority of \nRepublicans. I wonder if we need more ACORN amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, maybe we should have agreed to a couple more ACORN \namendments.\n  For those not following this, that is an organization that has done \nsome tremendously good work around the country. I acknowledge they have \nsome problems. That is why I agreed with my friend from Illinois, who \ncalled for a complete investigation of ACORN. We agree that if they \nhave done things that aren't right, they should be brought before the \nnecessary tribunals or administrative agencies to look at that. But \nenough is enough. We recognize ACORN is not a perfect organization, but \nhow much time do we need to spend on that? I also say that with \nnominations.\n\n  Here are things we are going to do before we have our Veterans Day \nbreak: unemployment, which is tied to first-time home buyers, and net \noperating loss. We are going to do military construction. We are going \nto finish Commerce-Justice-Science.\n  We are going to do nominations. We are going to do Judge David \nHamilton, Seventh Circuit, who has been waiting since April. We have \nagreed to time agreements. Do you want an hour, 2 hours, 5 hours, 10 \nhours of debate? No, we don't want anything. Up-or-down vote. The \nDepartment of Justice--one of the key officials there has been held up \nfor months, and that is Chris Schroeder. We are going to also complete \nTara O'Toole. Here is a woman who is one of the most eminently \nqualified people in America to serve as science adviser to Secretary \nNapolitano. Her expertise is in a number of areas, including \nbioterrorism. She has written scores of articles, and she is also an \nexpert in pandemics. Janet Napolitano, the Secretary, called me and \nsaid, ``I am desperate for this woman to come and work with me.'' The \ncountry is not capable of doing all the things that need to be done as \na result of not having this job filled. Again, they won't let us vote \non her. They won't take a time agreement. This is so important that we \nwill spend 2 days debating it if we can have a vote. But that is not \ngood enough. No time is sufficient.\n  A 6-month highway extension--we would love to get that done so we can \nmeet the demands of the winter in America and so construction can go \nforward.\n  Mr. President, the American people see what is taking place. It is so \nobvious, and it is not constructive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11064-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about health care. \nI want to focus my comments today, if I could, on specifically the \nMedicare cuts and the impact that will have across this great Nation, \nand also I would like too zero in on what those Medicare cuts mean for \nmy home State, the great State of Nebraska.\n  Medicare is a program that is a source of health care for about 45 \nmillion Americans. As we all know, it is essentially a program for \nthose who are 65 and older. It dates back a lot of years.\n  In my State, the State of Nebraska, there are 272,000 Nebraskans who \nare Medicare beneficiaries. As I have talked to them--and I have done \ntownhall meetings and roundtables all around the State--they are \npleased with the health care they receive. If they get sick, they have \nthis program, this Medicare Program, that is there for them.\n  I want to start out saying that I believe the current plan, which \ncuts Medicare and claims reform, is really off base with this \npopulation. The proposal says Medicare will be cut by over $400 \nbillion.\n  Let me, if I might, just walk down through the various programs that \nwill be impacted within Medicare.\n  There will be a $130 billion cut for the Medicare Advantage Program. \nIf anybody has spent any time talking to senior citizens about Medicare \nAdvantage, they will tell you they like this program.\n  Mr. President, $45 billion will be cut from hospitals that care for \nrecipients of Medicare; $40 billion will be cut from home health \nagencies; $14.6 billion will be cut from skilled nursing facilities; \nand nearly $8 billion will be cut from hospice programs.\n  I suggest, very respectfully, that this health care reform, which \nwill cut Medicare by over $400 billion, is not an improvement. These \ncuts ultimately will compromise the ability of Medicare beneficiaries \nto access the care they need.\n  If I may spend a moment this morning to talk about the profound \nimpacts this will have in Nebraska, the Medicare Advantage Program, as \nI said, will be impacted by about a $130 billion cut. Nationally, there \nare 11 million seniors enrolled. One Democratic Senator described these \ncuts as ``intolerable.'' I agree with that description. Mr. President, \n35,000 Nebraskans have Medicare Advantage plans. The plans provide \nchoice and options that people like.\n  The President said that ``if you like your plan, you can keep it.'' \nAnd relative to the Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, he said you will \nget a plan that is ``just as good.''\n  The Finance Committee markup was very instructive on this issue. The \nCBO Director stated that those people who have Medicare Advantage \n``will see changes and reductions in their benefits.''\n\n[[Page S11065]]\n\n  Let me turn to hospitals. The news is no better with hospitals. \nHospitals that serve large numbers of seniors and the poor will have \nreduced payments. The current government programs actually underpay for \nthese services. Hospital administrator after hospital administrator has \ntold me in my State: We could not keep our hospital open on Medicare \nand Medicaid. They need the additional payments they get from private \ninsurance to keep the doors open. Yet this so-called reform bill cuts \nNebraska hospitals by about $142 million; that is, 36 percent of \nNebraska hospitals will be affected.\n  Relative to home health care--a $40 billion cut nationally--seniors \nreceive care in the home instead of going to a nursing home. That is \nwhat this program is all about. Under ``reform,'' Nebraska home health \nprograms will lose $126 million over 10 years. By 2016, two-thirds of \nNebraska home health agencies will be in the red.\n  It is especially devastating to rural areas where 80 percent are \nexpected to lose money under this reform plan. It is hard to keep the \ninfrastructure in place right now, much less to look at what is coming. \nA home health director in a small rural hospital in Cherry County, NE, \nsaid this to me:\n\n       Nebraskans are a tough and a convicted people. We have \n     chosen to live in a more rural environment and respect the \n     fact that not all services can be provided.\n       However, there are two registered nurses that provide home \n     health services for seven counties. Our radius to see \n     patients is 100 miles one way. If a citizen was sick or \n     injured, they may have to travel 100 miles to see a doctor. \n     If they are unable to travel, they would just not receive the \n     care they need.\n\n  You see, home health care is not a convenience in our State, it is a \nnecessity. Cuts will likely cause them to close that operation and quit \nproviding the services. If the mission is to improve access, how does \nthat do that?\n  Skilled nursing care facilities is another area that is targeted with \n$14.6 billion in cuts. Registered nurses help provide 24-hour care to \npeople who can no longer care for themselves. People depend on them for \nboth short- and long-term care.\n  What is the impact in Nebraska? The impact is $93.2 million. This \ndollar figure does not take into account the job loss and financial \nimpact on local communities.\n  I will mention a facility, a great facility, like all facilities in \nNebraska, in Fullerton--the Golden Home Living Center. That is a \npopulation in that community of 1,300 people. The nursing home there is \nthe second largest employer. They have a $1.5 million payroll. However, \nthey are already struggling to try to figure out how to stay open, much \nless facing these cuts.\n  The hospice program will have $8 billion in cuts nationally. Hospice \nprovides dignity and comfort to seniors at the end of their life. With \nthis ``reform,'' there will be a nearly 12-percent reduction in \nhospital reimbursements over the next decade.\n  We have 38 licensed hospice programs in our State. We are so proud of \nthem. Currently, 97 percent of Nebraskans have access to at least a \nhospice program. The cuts, I believe, would negatively impact the care \nof dying Nebraskans.\n  Let me wrap up with this point. Every study that is out there says \nMedicare is heading toward insolvency, and 2017 is the date most often \nused. How do we keep Medicare viable? Cutting Medicare to fund a new \nentitlement, I respectfully suggest, is so misguided. Unfortunately, \nthat is the determined effort of this reform plan. We can do better. We \nmust do better. Nebraskans are watching. Americans are watching. We \nhave to improve on what we are doing here. We need to be able to say to \nthose who are Medicare beneficiaries: We protected Medicare. You are \nfirst and foremost in our mind.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss Medicare also in \nthe context of the proposed health care reform we are dealing with in \nthe Senate.\n  This is one of the most troubling aspects of the health care reform \nproposals that are being considered in the Congress: the massive cuts \nto Medicare that will total, under the legislation that came out of the \nFinance Committee at least, about $500 billion in cuts and similar \nlevels of cuts are included in all major legislation being moved at \nthis point.\n  In this time of economic downturn, all Americans must look to their \nbudgets and to their own spending very carefully. The same is true for \nthe Federal Government.\n  Some will argue these Medicare cuts are necessary for fiscal \nresponsibility and that everybody must play a part. Others are going to \nargue that Medicare is facing insolvency in 2017 and that these cuts \nare necessary to slow the growth of Medicare spending. In fact, the \n2009 trustees report shows that Medicare's annual costs were 3.2 \npercent of the gross domestic product of the United States in 2008. To \ngive a little bit of context, that is about three-quarters of Social \nSecurity's costs. These costs are projected to surpass Social Security \nexpenditures in 2028 and reach 11.4 percent of GDP by 2083.\n  The unfunded obligation of the Medicare hospital trust fund is $13.4 \ntrillion, which is $1 trillion higher than even last year's estimate. \nAnd Medicare's total unfunded obligations, which include Part B and \nPart D programs, have reached $37.8 trillion.\n  Yes, we do need to address the solvency issues related to Medicare. \nWe must deal with it. But let's be clear about one thing: These \nproposals in these health care bills do not strengthen the solvency of \nthe Medicare Program.\n  These cuts accomplish one simple goal; that is, they take money from \nthe Medicare Program in order to create a new entitlement program. The \nprogram is created at the expense of America's seniors. We are not \nshoring up Medicare for America's seniors with these bills; we are \ntransferring $500 billion out of the Medicare programs into a new \ngovernment entitlement program.\n  A recent article described it like this: Let's imagine that Medicare \nis your family's overall budget. You have lived beyond your means and \nyou have run up a huge debt. In order to deal with this new debt, your \nfamily thinks of creative ways to cut spending and reduce expenses and \nput some of your savings aside to catch up. Then, though, you see all \nthis cash that you saved up and you would like to go out and buy a \nbrandnew car. So instead of using the cash to help pay off your debts \nand your obligations and shore up your financial circumstances, you \ntake this cash and go out and spend it on a brandnew car, in this case \na government-run car.\n  This is what is happening with the Medicare system in the bills \nbefore us. These cuts damage the existing program in order to create a \nnew one, harming America's seniors along the way. They are negatively \ngoing to impact choice, access, benefits, and quality of care. When \nAmericans said they wanted change, I don't think this is what they were \ntalking about.\n  Let's talk about a few specifics.\n  Among the largest cuts to the Medicare Program are the $117 billion \nin cuts to the Medicare Advantage Program. Currently, there are nearly \n11 million seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage, which represents \nabout one out of every four Medicare beneficiaries. In my home State of \nIdaho, there are more than 60,000 Medicare Advantage beneficiaries or \n27 percent of Medicare beneficiaries in the State.\n\n  Since the creation of the Medicare Advantage Program in 2003, overall \nenrollment in private plans has been steadily increasing and \nbeneficiaries across the country have had more private plans to choose \nfrom than they did 10 years ago.\n  A 2007 study reported ``high overall satisfaction'' with the Medicare \nAdvantage Program. Mr. President, 84 percent of respondents said they \nwere happy with their coverage, and 74 percent would recommend Medicare \nAdvantage to their friends or family members.\n\n[[Page S11066]]\n\n  According to Congressional Research Service, as of January 2009, all \nMedicare beneficiaries across the country had access to Medicare \nAdvantage plans along with traditional Medicare plans. The choice is \nparticularly crucial in rural areas. Between 2003 and 2007, more than \n600,000 beneficiaries in rural areas joined the Medicare Advantage \nProgram, which is a 426-percent increase.\n  The Medicare Advantage cuts proposed in the Finance bill will force \nplans to cut benefits, increase premiums, or drop coverage altogether. \nIn fact, CBO estimates that enrollment in Medicare Advantage will \ndecrease by 2.7 million people by 2019, resulting from the changes in \nthis proposed legislation.\n  This number represents not only people who would lose their plan but \nalso those who would no longer be able to choose Medicare Advantage \nbecause of the decrease in benefits.\n  CBO estimates that the value of extra benefits offered by Medicare \nAdvantage plans will drop from $135 a month to $42 a month. When we \nwere in the Finance Committee markup, I asked CBO Director Elmendorf to \nconfirm this point. I asked him:\n\n       So approximately half of the additional benefit would be \n     lost to those current Medicare Advantage policyholders?\n\n  His response was:\n\n       For those who would be enrolled otherwise under current \n     law, yes.\n\n  The point is, the Medicare Advantage cuts in the Finance Committee \nbill will clearly break the President's pledge that if you like the \ninsurance you have, if you like the protection you have, you can keep \nit.\n  Even if some seniors on Medicare Advantage are able to keep their \nplans, they are not going to be able to enjoy the same level of \nbenefits they enjoy today. During the Finance Committee markup, I \noffered an amendment that would have prohibited the implementation of \nthe bill's Medicare Advantage provisions if their implementation would \ndecrease choice and competition for seniors in Medicare--very simple \nand straightforward. The amendment was defeated on a straight party-\nline vote.\n  Many congressional Democrats argue that by defending Medicare \nAdvantage you are actually defending overpayments to insurance \ncompanies. That is not true either. Medicare Advantage plans are paid \n14 percent more, on average, than traditional Medicare fee-for-service. \nHowever, these overpayments--or alleged overpayments--don't go into the \nplans. They go to the seniors enrolled in the plans in the form of \nextra benefits. That is why Medicare Advantage is so popular among \nseniors. Seventy-five percent of the additional payments to Medicare \nAdvantage are used to provide seniors with additional benefits--\nbenefits such as dental coverage or vision coverage or preventive \nmedicine or flu shots or hearing aids. The remaining 25 percent is \nreturned to the Federal Government. So the cuts to Medicare Advantage \nwill reduce benefits and will deprive seniors of choice.\n  But that is not the only kind of cuts we have coming to Medicare. In \naddition to the cuts to the Medicare Advantage Program, the Finance \nCommittee bill also contains massive cuts to other Medicare providers. \nIt contains $40 billion of cuts to home health agencies, there are \nnearly $8 billion of cuts to hospice, and more than $16 billion of cuts \nto skilled nursing facilities. These levels of cuts would be \ndevastating for providers and will threaten access as well. As more and \nmore providers will not take Medicare patients, it will be harder and \nharder for beneficiaries to find care.\n  I spoke to Gary Thietten, the president and owner of Idaho Home \nHealth & Hospice, just last week about the impact of the Medicare cuts \nto home health and hospice. He described to me how bad the fiscal \nsituation has become for home health, hospice, and other Medicare \nproviders in Idaho. Idaho lost nearly 30 percent of its home care \nproviders in 1998 and 1999, including the State's largest provider. The \nproviders that are still in business in my home State are working under \nthe same Medicare reimbursement levels they received in 2001--8 years \nago. If the cuts from the Finance Committee bill go into effect, on top \nof the current reimbursement issues, the situation will get \nsignificantly worse for many providers, and the net result, again, \nwould be a loss of providers, a loss of options, and a loss of services \nto our seniors.\n  Costs have gone up considerably due to the economic downturn, and \nrural Idaho is being hit the hardest. Gary compared the situation for \nhome health and hospice providers to the farmers in Idaho. Most farmers \ndon't grow just one crop. Similarly, home health agencies don't provide \njust one service. They provide hospice and private-duty care, along \nwith medical supplies and equipment. All of these services are going to \nsuffer because of the home health and hospice cuts.\n  These proposed cuts will not just affect providers in my home State, \nthey will affect Medicare providers in every State around the country, \nparticularly rural States, which already face significant provider \naccess problems. At some point, providers will no longer be able to \ngive the best care or any care, for that matter, to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. As I indicated earlier, we have already seen the trend \nstart with those medical service providers that simply can't afford to \ntake Medicare patients.\n  I have long supported policies that increase access to high-quality \naffordable health care for all Americans and provide for fair \nreimbursements to providers of the medical services rendered. However, \nthe types of blunt, across-the-board cuts we see in these proposed \nbills will result only in increased harm to providers and to Medicare \nbeneficiaries around the country.\n  It is my hope that as we face these difficult times, and dealing with \nneeded health care reform, we will not take the cuts out of the \nMedicare Program that are proposed in this legislation. Specifically, \nand importantly, it is critical that we not cut our Medicare \nbeneficiary services in order to simply fund a new, massive government \nentitlement program.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11066-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico).

Mr. President, the American people are paying close \nattention to the ongoing debate over health care, and they have noticed \na worrisome trend. The longer this debate goes on, the further \nDemocrats in Congress seem to drift from the original purpose of \nreform.\n  At the outset of this debate, the American people were told reform \nwould lower costs, a goal all of us supported. The administration is \nright when it says the rising cost of health care in this country is \nunsustainable. Costs must be reined in. But the proposals we have seen \nso far don't address that problem. In fact, they make it worse. Instead \nof reining in costs, the proposals they have advanced are expected to \ndrive costs even higher, costs that will then be shifted onto families \nand small businesses.\n  Yesterday, I pointed out the absurdity of the situation we are in. \nReform that was meant to lower costs is now independently confirmed to \nmake health care more expensive. Reform that was meant to make life \neasier is now expected to make life harder for families, businesses, \nand seniors from one end of our country to the other.\n  Let's focus on Medicare a moment, a program tens of millions of \nAmerica's seniors rely upon. How is this program doing financially? It \nis not a pretty picture. Medicare started running a deficit last year, \nand the Medicare trust fund is expected to run out of money in less \nthan a decade. Looking a little further ahead, Medicare is slated to \nspend nearly $38 trillion that it doesn't have. Simply put: Medicare is \nbroke. For the sake of our seniors, we need to fix it.\n  But the advocates of this legislation look at Medicare and they see \nsomething else. They do not see a problem to be fixed, they see a giant \npiggy bank. Rather than fix it, they want to use it to fund an entirely \nnew set of government-run health care programs.\n  Medicare was an attractive target for the people who wrote this bill. \nThey\n\n[[Page S11067]]\n\nwere in a bind. At a time of shrinking government revenues, nearly 10 \npercent unemployment, and record deficits and debt, the bill writers \nlooked around for the money to cover the cost of their health care plan \nand they couldn't find it. So they decided on massive cuts to Medicare, \ncuts that will have serious consequences for millions of American \nseniors.\n  I am sure they didn't want to resort to cutting Medicare when they \nstarted out, but the fact is they are now proposing massive cuts that \nwill inevitably lead to fewer services. Here is what they plan to cut: \n$8 billion from hospice, more than $40 billion from home health care \nagencies, more than $130 billion from Medicare Advantage, and more than \n$130 billion in Medicare cuts to hospitals that care for seniors.\n  At the outset of this debate, all of us knew Medicare faced \nsignificant challenges that needed to be addressed. A program that is \nalready spending more than it is taking in, a program that is expected \nto be insolvent in just 8 years, should be fixed, not raided. Just \nabout every day I receive letters in my office from Kentuckians who \nhave Medicare. They are counting on this program. They are worried \nabout its future. We have an obligation to our seniors, an obligation \nto keep our promises.\n\n  At some point, the majority will have to work with Members to address \nthis problem. When they do, we should focus on a solution to out-of-\ncontrol entitlement spending that Americans will embrace.\n  Forty-four years ago, when President Johnson signed Medicare into \nlaw, he vowed that we would never refuse the hand of justice to those \nwho have given a lifetime of service and wisdom and labor to their \nNation. We have an obligation to fulfill that vow. We have an \nobligation to work together on solutions that both parties and the \npeople for whom this vital program was created--seniors--will support.\n  The health care plan we have seen is deeply flawed. Far from \nfulfilling the original goal of lower cost, the Democrats' bill would \ndrive costs even higher--an outcome that has most Americans scratching \ntheir heads in confusion and disbelief. What is worse, the plan slashes \nMedicare, too, as a way to pay for new government programs.\n  Clearly, the effort to reform health care has gotten off track. \nHigher taxes, higher premiums, and cuts to Medicare is not the reform \nAmericans are looking for. They want commonsense, step-by-step \nsolutions, not a health care experiment that makes existing problems \nworse. While some may want to move this bill as quickly as possible, \nAmericans have a different message: They would like for us to start \nover.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I wish to follow up on the comments of \nLeader McConnell and Senator Crapo concerning Medicare. I don't think \nthere is a State that is more affected by these potential cuts to \nMedicare than my home State of Florida, where we have nearly 3 million \nFloridians who enjoy the Medicare Program. Ultimately, the question in \nour health care debate is: How we are going to pay for this $1 trillion \nnew program--this program that encompasses some 1,990 pages in the \nHouse proposal?\n  As Leader McConnell said, it seems it is the opinion of the majority \nin this Chamber, and in this Congress, that the way we are going to pay \nfor this new entitlement program is to take money from health care for \nseniors. Frankly, it amazes me that we would have this conversation; \nthat we would take nearly $500 billion--$\\1/2\\ trillion--out of health \ncare for seniors.\n  It amazes me for a couple of reasons: One is that this money was paid \ninto the system by seniors out of their paychecks for their entire \nlives. This was not some handout from government. This is a program \nthey have paid into and they expect a return on it. It is a covenant \nwith our seniors--our greatest generation, now retiring. We told them \nthat if they paid into this system, they would have health care for the \nrest of their lives through Medicare. Now, even though this program is \nin and of itself, as Leader McConnell said, in jeopardy of going \nbankrupt in the next few years--because less people will be paying in \nand more people will be taking out--we are going to take $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion out of this program to pay for a new program. That doesn't \nmake any sense to me.\n  I received a letter from one of my constituents, Shirley Anderson \nfrom Gotha, FL, which is right outside the Orlando area in central \nFlorida, and she gets it. She says to me:\n\n       I am writing to express my deep concern about the proposed \n     Medicare cuts in reimbursement for outpatient tests and \n     procedures. I understand that these cuts may force doctors to \n     either refuse to take care of me, as I have Medicare, or \n     leave the State of Florida altogether. It has taken me a long \n     time to find a doctor that I trust and I cannot afford to \n     lose him. If this happens I will be forced to go to the \n     hospital for these routine cardiac tests and procedures. My \n     waiting times are going to be longer and more importantly my \n     out of pocket expenses are going to be much higher and I \n     simply cannot afford this. I strongly believe this is going \n     to adversely affect my health care and well-being.\n\n  What are we doing? We are going to jeopardize the promises we have \nalready made to seniors in order to create a new program that is not \ngoing to reduce the cost of health care for Americans, a new program \nthat is fraught with problems. It doesn't make any sense to me.\n  As was stated before, the proposal in the House and what we think \nwill be the proposal in the Senate--although we have not seen the final \ncopy--cuts $135 billion from Medicare Advantage, $150 billion from \nhospitals that care for seniors, $51 billion from home health agencies, \nand nearly $70 billion in additional cuts or fee increases. What is \nthis going to do to the process?\n  I talked this morning to Ron Malone, who is the vice president of a \nhealth services company that provides home health care in Florida. They \nhave 16 locations, they have 2,000 clinicians, they serve about 25,000 \npatients. He told me this proposal, as written, is going to put half of \nthe providers underwater and out of business. Half of the home health \nproviders, in his estimation, will go out of business. Which ones will \ngo out of business? The small companies, the companies we are trying to \nhelp in this economy where we have over 10 percent unemployment in \nFlorida and nearly 10 percent unemployment in this country. We are \ngoing to put those small businesses out of business.\n\n  Home health care saves costs. Home health care is the more affordable \noption than a nursing home. Plus seniors like it better because they \nget to stay in their own homes. We are going to put these people out of \nbusiness. As Senator Crapo said, where is this home health care most \nimportant? In areas where there is not a hospital or nursing home \navailable, out in the rural areas, not only in places in Idaho but \nplaces in Florida. So we are going to make it harder for seniors to get \nthe care they want, and we are going to do something that ultimately is \ngoing to be more expensive.\n  I want to also talk about Medicare Advantage. This is a program that \nwas started to give seniors more options under Medicare. It is not a \nrequirement, it is voluntary--they can choose it--and it is more like a \nprivate program, more like a program in the private sector where the \ncompanies actually cater to the seniors, provide them with more \nbenefits, such as eyeglasses and dental care and hearing aids and flu \nshots. They have someone on the other side of the equation who is \ntrying to give them some service, unlike government usually does.\n  Now we are going to cut that program. We have 915,000 Floridians in \nMedicare Advantage, and we are going to take $150 billion out of it. So \nwhat is going to happen? They are going to get less services. We cannot \nget blood from a stone. When the money comes out of the program, the \nprogram is going to suffer. Who is going to suffer? Our seniors.\n  These are increasingly popular programs in Medicare Advantage. It is \nalso important to note that 40 percent of African Americans and 53 \npercent of Hispanics who do not have Medicaid or employer-based \ncoverage are now enrolled in Medicare Advantage. Our minority \npopulations enjoy this program also.\n  As a Senator from Florida, the State with the highest per capita \npopulation of seniors, the second highest total population of seniors \nin America--3 million seniors on Medicare--who made this country what \nit is, who are our greatest generation, who paid into this\n\n[[Page S11068]]\n\nsystem and now are going to see less benefits and less care, I can't \nstand by and let that happen.\n  What I am afraid of is we are going to have two classes of health \ncare in this country. If we pass a bill like this, what worries me is \nthat fewer providers are going to be in the Medicare system because \ntheir reimbursement rates are going to have to go down. So our seniors \nand our disadvantaged are not going to get the best doctors. In fact, \nsomeday I don't think a lot of these doctors are going to take \ninsurance. So we will have one quality of health care for the rich and \none quality of health care for everybody else. That is not American. \nThat is not what we promised our seniors, and it is not something we \nshould be doing.\n  The Hippocratic Oath tells doctors: ``First, do no harm.'' This \nproposal, from all we can read about it, first does harm. It harms our \nmost vulnerable people, our seniors, whom we owe and should respect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for \nhis insightful remarks. I listened with interest to the Republican \nleader describe the congressional Democrats' bill, which is now about \n2,000 pages. We know we do not have a Senate bill yet. It is being \nwritten behind closed doors somewhere, I think in the majority leader's \noffice. We are not sure who is writing it. We will have it sooner or \nlater. But we do know some things about the health care bills.\n  Today what I would like to talk about is just one of those things. \nThen I want to suggest what the Republican plan is because we have a \nvery different approach toward dealing with health care than the \nDemocratic bills that we have seen. Today I want to talk about \nMedicare.\n  Medicare is very important to about 40 million Americans and to a lot \nof other Americans who are about to be of the age to depend on \nMedicare. To get it down into a nutshell, here is what all of the plans \nwe have seen so far from the Democratic side propose to do: to take \nabout $\\1/2\\ trillion over 10 years from Medicare--in other words, cut \nMedicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion, not to put into the Medicare Program to \nmake it more solvent but to start a big new entitlement program called \ngovernment-run health insurance for other people.\n  We hear from the other side the Republicans are scaring people about \nMedicare. The Republicans aren't scaring anybody about Medicare, it is \nthese Democratic bills that are scaring people about Medicare. And they \nhave a right to be worried about them because the Medicare trustees \nhave told us this program, that 40 million seniors depend on, is going \nto become insolvent between 2015 and 2017. That affects the 40 million \nof us who are already eligible and a part of Medicare, and it affects \ntens of millions more who will become eligible for it.\n  The idea would be, if these bills are passed, to pay for new programs \nby cutting that $\\1/2\\ trillion from this program that is going broke. \nThe Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback, described it this way. He said: \nThis is a lot like writing a big check on an overdrawn bank account to \nbuy a new car.\n  He said: Your bank shouldn't let you do that, and the American people \nshould not let us do this, and I don't think they will, which is why we \nare glad a number of the Democratic Senators joined with all 40 \nRepublicans and said to the Democratic leader: We want two things about \nthis health care bill by the time it gets to us. No. 1, we want to know \nwhat it does; and, No. 2, we want to know what it costs.\n  What that means is, it should go up on the Internet for at least 72 \nhours, the complete text--that is what the letter from the Democratic \nSenators, as well as Senator Bunning in the amendment he authored, \nsaid--and, No. 2, we want a complete formal estimate from the \nCongressional Budget Office about what the bill costs because the \nAmerican people are significantly worried about health care reform. \nThat, as the Republican leader said, is supposed to reduce costs, \nreduce premiums, reduce the government's debt. But, instead, everything \nwe heard about it so far makes it look like it is more likely to \nincrease the cost of premiums, to increase taxes, and one thing we know \nfor sure, it will cut Medicare. So let's talk about Medicare for a \nmoment.\n  A couple of weeks ago we had the first vote on health care reform. \nFor the country, it was a fortunate vote because we saw a bipartisan \nact in the Senate. The proposal by the Democratic leader was to run up \nthe debt another $\\1/4\\ trillion in Medicare spending. But 13 Democrats \nand all 40 Republicans were not going to do that. We have too much debt \ntoday. We had a deficit this year of $1.4 trillion, which is as much as \nthe entire debt of the United States from the days of George Washington \nuntil 1990. So we all said: No, slowdown. It may be a worthy thing to \ndo.\n  It is important to deal with the physician reimbursement problem. But \nwe are not going to start off the health care debate by borrowing $\\1/\n4\\ trillion for more Medicare spending.\n  The Washington Post wrote about that proposal:\n\n       A decade ago, Congress passed legislation designed to limit \n     health-care costs by slowing the growth of Medicare payments \n     to doctors. Each year, Congress passes a patch to prevent \n     the cuts from taking effect. [The Senator from Michigan] \n     proposed to make this system ``honest'', [in her words] by \n     eliminating the cuts permanently . . . it's a strange \n     interpretation [the Washington Post said] of honesty to \n     separate this $250 billion cost from the health-care bill \n     and then claim that the other bill doesn't raise the \n     deficit.\n\n  Fortunately, the Senate came to its senses and said no. We are not \ngoing to raise the debt $\\1/4\\ trillion for more Medicare spending. But \nthe House Democrats--who came up with a 2,000-page bill they say they \nmay be voting on in the next few days--apparently did not get that \nmessage. Their 2,000-page bill did not include the fix, or the \nphysician reimbursement, which we all know is a part of health care \nreform. It is a part of the Medicare system. It has to do with the \namount of money doctors are paid for seeing Medicare patients. It has \nto be dealt with. Yet they have left it out to the side and, again, we \nhave a proposal that adds to the deficit $\\1/4\\ trillion.\n  A Wall Street Journal editorial this week, appropriately titled ``The \nWorst Bill Ever,'' notes this absence by saying:\n\n       The House pretends [as some Senators did] that Medicare \n     payments to doctors will be cut by 21.5 percent next year and \n     deeper after that, ``saving'' about $250 billion.\n\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, making those kinds of \nassumptions means the 2000-page bill that has been written in the House \nis more likely to cost closer to $2 trillion over 10 years instead of \n$1 trillion. So we know the era of the 1,000-page bill is over because \nwe have a 2,000-page bill; and I guess the era of the $1 trillion \nlegislative proposal is over because we have a $2 trillion health care \nproposal being considered in the House.\n  The article in the Wall Street Journal goes:\n\n       All this is particularly reckless given the unfunded \n     liabilities of Medicare--now north of $37 trillion over 75 \n     years.\n\n  In other words, over the next 75 years we have $37 trillion in \nobligations that the Medicare Program has, $37 trillion more than we \nhave money coming in. How is that going to make you feel if you are \npart of the Medicare Program and some Member of Congress says: OK, we \nare going to take this program with $37 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities, a program on which you rely for your Medicare, and we are \ngoing to cut it by $429 billion in order to start a new program for \nsomebody else? I think you are going to say: I don't like that very \nmuch. I don't like the sound of it. And, increasingly, as Americans \nread these bills and understand what it costs and understand what they \nmean to each American, they come to that same conclusion.\n  So we wait with great interest to see what bill the Senate majority \nleader will bring from behind his closed doors when he takes the 1,500-\npage Finance Committee bill and the 900-page--nearly 900-page--HELP \nCommittee bill in the Senate and puts it together, I assume, with this \n2,000-page bill in the House, and all of them depend on cutting \nMedicare for about half of their costs.\n  Any reductions in Medicare, any savings in Medicare, any elimination \nof waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare should go to Medicare. We should \nnot be cutting grandma's Medicare to spend money on somebody else. We \nought to save money in grandma's Medicare to spend on grandma because \ngrandma's Medicare Program is going\n\n[[Page S11069]]\n\nbroke. That is what the Medicare trustees have told us.\n  What does this mean for seniors? The Senator from Florida outlined \nthem: Nearly $140 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage--one out of \nfour seniors, I believe, has a Medicare Advantage Program--nearly $150 \nbillion in Medicare cuts to hospitals that care for seniors, more than \n$40 billion from home health agencies, nearly $8 billion from hospices.\n  My understanding is the House bill also makes roughly $100 billion in \nMedicare cuts for hospitals that care for seniors--this is the House \nbill--$57 billion from home health agencies, and nearly $24 billion \nfrom nursing homes.\n  The President stated that while ``people who are currently signed up \nfor Medicare Advantage are going to have Medicare at the same level of \nbenefits. . . .'' That was President Obama. Yet the Congressional \nBudget Office Director, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nDirector, said after looking at the Senate Finance health care bill \nthat fully half of the benefits currently provided to seniors under \nMedicare Advantage would disappear.\n  The Congressional Budget Office Director said the charges would \nreduce the extra benefits, such as dental, vision, and hearing \ncoverage, that would be made available to beneficiaries.\n  What about the cost to the government? Remember, as the Republican \nleader said, we thought health care reform was about cost.\n  I remember being invited--I appreciated it very much--to a summit \nPresident Obama had earlier this year on entitlement spending. The \nPresident said he needed to work on that, and every speaker who was \nthere said that if we do not do something about health care spending, \nabout Medicaid and about Medicare, we are going to go broke as a \ncountry and that almost all of our debt and deficit problems are \nrelated to health care spending.\n  So our goal here is to reduce the cost of premiums to individual \nAmericans and reduce the cost of government to individual Americans. \nThat should be our goal. But according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the cost of the 2,000-page House bill reflects a gross spending \ntotal of over $1 trillion. Now, who thinks we can spend another $1 \ntrillion without adding to the debt? I don't think many Americans do. \nThis mainly includes outlays for Medicaid, children's health, and \nsubsidies.\n  According to the Budget Committee's staff, though, the real 10-year \ncost of the Senate Finance Committee bill when fully implemented would \nbe closer to $2 trillion--$1.8 trillion--because the main spending \nprovisions do not go into effect for another few years, starting in \n2013. The taxes and the fees--the new taxes, nearly $1 trillion in \ntaxes--start right away, over the full 10 years, but the benefits don't \nstart until 2013. They make some other assumptions along the way such \nas that there will be a Medicaid commission, which will cut Medicare \nmore. Well, those procedures haven't worked so far. And if there are \nsavings in Medicare, they should be spent on Medicare, not to start \nsome new program.\n  So Republicans--and, we hope, discerning Democrats--are not scaring \nseniors about Medicare; these bills are scaring seniors about Medicare. \nAnd they have a right to be worried. They have a right to be worried \nbecause they are the 40 million Americans who depend on Medicare. Just \nanswer the question for yourself. If we are going to take $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion out of your Medicare Program that the trustees say is going to \ngo broke in a few years and spend it on someone else, what does that do \nto your Medicare benefits? It puts them in more jeopardy, is the only \nobvious answer to that.\n  So we have proposals that, so far, cut Medicare, raise taxes, raise \npremiums, add to the debt, transfer expenses to the State that \nDemocratic and Republican Governors say will bankrupt some States--\nthese are the Medicaid Programs--and they create a new government-run \nprogram.\n  I am already getting e-mails from businesspeople in Tennessee who \nsaid that if a bill like this goes through, they are out of providing \nhealth care to their employees, they can't stand the costs. And so \nmillions of Americans will be losing their employer insurance and \nshifting over to the new government program which is being paid for by \ngrandma's Medicare. That is the scheme that is being put together here.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  So here is what we know about the Congressional Democratic health \ncare plan which is 2,000 pages long: higher premiums, Medicare cuts, \nhigher taxes, more debt. It is a government-run plan. When you put the \nwhole scheme together, if you are one of the 177 million whose employer \nprovides insurance to you, you run a great risk--let's say it this \nway--of losing your employer insurance because the employer says: I \ncan't afford to provide it anymore, and plus, the government started a \nnew program, so you go over to the government program. That could lead \nto rationing. Your Governor will tell you the States can't afford the \ncosts being transferred to them, so that means either higher State \ntaxes or higher college tuition to pay for the reduced payments to \npublic higher education, and a $2 trillion cost over 10 years, \naccording to the Wall Street Journal. That is not real health care \nreform.\n  So what is real health care reform? What is the Republican plan or \nwhat hopefully could be a bipartisan plan that we could work on? We \nwould suggest, and we have suggested this day after day, week after \nweek, committee meeting after committee meeting: Let's start over. We \nare headed in the wrong direction. Let's go in the right direction. And \nthe right direction is having the simple goal of reducing costs, costs \nto those paying for health care insurance, in their premiums, and the \ncost to the government, which we all have to pay for as well. And how \ndo we do it? Instead of a big, comprehensive, 2,000-page, $2 trillion, \nfull of surprises and mandates bill that terrifies everyone, let's go \nstep by step in the right direction, which in this case is reducing \ncosts.\n  What would that mean? Well, No. 1, we could start with a small \nbusiness health insurance plan. This permits small businesses all \nacross America to pool their resources and leverage those resources.\n  Let's say you are in a small business and there are 80 employees. Two \npeople get very sick, and they use up all of the available money that \nsmall business has to help pay for employees' health care. The employer \nhas to say, I have to reduce everybody's health care; or, I am sorry, I \njust can't offer it anymore. But if you allow that small business to \njoin with small businesses all across America and pool their resources \nand leverage their money, then you have a different outcome. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office, that would mean 750,000 more \nAmericans would be insured. It would mean three out of four people \ninsured by small businesses would pay lower premiums. And it would \nreduce the cost of Medicaid, as those people went onto their own \nprivate insurance, by $1.4 billion. So more people insured at lower \ncosts for premiums and less debt for Medicaid--that is one step on \nwhich we should be able to agree. Senator Enzi and the late Senator \nKennedy worked on that for a long time, but we have not passed it. Why \ndon't we pass it as the first step? That is 88 pages; that is not 2,000 \npages.\n  Then a second step: Why don't we allow Americans to buy insurance \nacross State lines? That increases competition. We have a number of \nbills that have been introduced that would allow that. Senator DeMint \nof South Carolina has one of those bills, and that is 30 pages, not \n2,000 pages.\n  Junk lawsuits. Virtually everyone who has looked at it agrees that \nlawsuits against doctors add to the cost of health care that we all \npay. Some States have taken some steps and shown it makes a real \ndifference. Maybe it is a small part of the cost, maybe it is a large \npart of the cost, but it is a part of the cost. Anyone who is injured--\nanyone who is injured by a negligent doctor should be paid 100 percent \nof the damage to that person. But this would begin to restrict the \npunitive damages that are often added to that which greatly benefit the \ntrial lawyer and increase the cost to all of us. So why don't we take \nsteps to do this?\n  We know of examples in my State of Tennessee--and I am sure in \nvirtually every State--where OB/GYN doctors\n\n[[Page S11070]]\n\nhave moved out of rural counties because their medical malpractice \npremiums have gone through the roof. They just will not practice \nanymore. So pregnant women are having to travel to Memphis, 60 or 80 \nmiles, for their prenatal health care and to deliver their babies. They \ndo not have that service in the county where they live. This would help \nthem, those women, and this would help reduce costs.\n  So those are three steps we can take.\n  A fourth step would be equal tax treatment for every individual on \nour health care tax policy. That is 21 pages.\n  Information technology for health care--this may take a few years to \nactually reduce costs, but virtually everyone agrees that the record \nkeeping in our health care system is a great drag on the productivity \nand an obvious addition to the cost. Democrats as well as Republicans \nhave worked on legislation to change this.\n  There is a 13-page bill introduced by Senators Coburn, Burr, and \nEnzi. I am sure there are good proposals on the Democratic side. We \ncould take that step. And that would be five steps.\n  Then we could help create more health care exchanges. That is in many \nof the bills. It is common to many of them. It is a supermarket in \nwhich any individual can go to buy, more easily, a health care plan for \nthat individual or for that person's family. It just takes eight pages \nto create better health care exchanges across this country.\n  And then waste, fraud, and abuse. Senator LeMieux from Florida, the \nnew Senator, made his maiden address on waste, fraud, and abuse. It is \na scandal that, in the Medicaid Program, for example, $1 out of every \n$10 is waste, fraud, and abuse. That is $32 billion a year. We can go \nto work on that in a variety of ways, which he talked about this \nmorning. That is just 21 pages.\n  So there are seven steps in the right direction which are reducing \nhealth care costs. We should be able to take those steps in a \nbipartisan way.\n  So we have a choice of approaches here in the Congress. The American \npeople want real health care reform, but they do not believe that \nraising taxes, raising premiums, cutting Medicare, increasing the debt, \nand 2,000-page bills full of surprises are real health care reform.\n  The American people are properly skeptical of a grand and risky \nscheme that claims we are wise enough to solve everything at once. They \nknow we are more likely to mess up everything at once if we try such \nrisky schemes. So to re-earn the trust of the American people, we \nshould go step by step. Here is the choice: a 2,000-page bill or a 200-\npage bill.\n  Sometimes, the assistant Democratic leader will come on the floor and \nsay: Where is the Republican plan? I said to him yesterday, if he is \nwaiting for Senator McConnell to bring a wheelbarrow in here with a \n2,000-page Republican alternative that costs $2 trillion and is just \nour way to spend $2 trillion and is full of surprises and our grand and \nrisky scheme, he is going to be waiting a long time because he is not \ngoing to see it. We are going to bring up several steps which we know \nwill reduce costs, which we know we can afford, which we know will help \npeople, which we know we can implement, and which we believe will have \nsignificant Democratic support as well as Republican support.\n  So is it 2,000 pages or 200 pages? Reduce premiums or increase \npremiums? Reduce debt or increase debt? Cut Medicare and start some new \nprogram with it or make Medicare solvent by taking any savings we can \nfind in Medicare and use it to help Medicare?\n  Higher taxes--I did not say much about that, but there is $900 \nbillion of new taxes in the program when it is fully implemented in the \nFinance Committee program. And the Congressional Budget Office Director \nsaid the obvious about that--by and large, most of those new taxes will \nbe passed on to whom? Those of us who pay insurance premiums. So there \nis another reason your premiums are going up, and the cost.\n  We should be able to enact a good health care plan this year. The \ncountry needs for us to do that. But we Republicans are offering a real \nchoice to the American people. The American people are appropriately \nskeptical of risky schemes that run up the debt, cost $2 trillion, and \nare filled with higher premiums, more taxes, and Medicare cuts.\n  To re-earn the trust of the American people, we should set a charge \ngoal of reducing costs and move step by step in that direction. That is \nthe Republican health care plan, and I believe that is a plan \nRepublicans and Democrats can agree upon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kirk). The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11070-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11070-S11075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, when I listen to my colleagues today from \nthe Republican side of the aisle, part of me is incredulous. Part of me \nsays: I can't believe what I am hearing. The other part says: Of course \nI can believe what I am hearing, because I have heard it since 1995, \nwhen the Republicans tried to privatize Medicare when I was a Member of \nthe House of Representatives and heard it; when I read books about what \nhappened in 1965, when Medicare started; and I heard about it in stuff \nI read from the 1930s when F.D.R. first tried to create something like \nMedicare. My Republican colleagues have become the party of no. They \ngenerally opposed the minimum wage, generally opposed the creation of \nSocial Security in the 1930s, generally opposed the creation of \nMedicare in 1965, generally opposed SCHIP to help poor children and \noften not the poorest children, children whose parents had jobs but \ndidn't have insurance. The party of no generally opposed most of those \nthings. So why should we be surprised that they are opposing health \ncare reform?\n  What makes me incredulous is to hear them say now that the Democrats \nare going to cut Medicare and that we are going to use the Medicare \ncuts to pay for health care reform. Nice try. For the party of no, the \nparty that was against the creation of Medicare, the party that fought \nhealth insurance forever, the party that, when they got their chance, \nthe first time Republicans had a chance, when they had a Republican \nCongress and a Republican President--that was the first time they had \nhad that in many years--as soon as they got a chance, they tried to \nprivatize Medicare.\n  I hear my colleagues come to the floor, at least five of them come to \nthe floor and talk about Democrats cutting Medicare. They are the party \nthat didn't like Medicare. They are the party that wanted to privatize \nMedicare throughout the 1990s, what President Bush partially succeeded \nin doing.\n  We know the history of Medicare is the history of interest groups, \nmostly insurance groups, teamed up with Republicans to try to stop \nMedicare's creation, then the interest groups, led by the insurance \nindustry, teaming up with Republicans to try to privatize Medicare. And \nnow it is the interest groups, led by the insurance companies, teaming \nup with Republicans to try to kill our health care reform, then \nwrapping themselves in the flag of Medicare, saying: We are protecting \nMedicare. Look what the Democrats are doing. The Democrats are going to \ncut Medicare and pay for health care reform.\n  It is such an exaggeration. It is the same arguments, the same \ndistortions, the same exaggerations, the same scare tactics we are used \nto. It should not surprise us at all. I see Senator Durbin who is \nfamiliar with many of these things.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to ask the Senator from Ohio if he \nhas missed the latest criticism of health care reform. The Senator from \nTennessee comes to the floor every day and the focus of his attention \nis the length of the bill, how many pages are in the health care reform \nbill. I am not making this up. He has come to the floor, even though \nthe Senate health care reform bill is still in process--it has not been \nwritten; it will be written, posted on the Internet, as promised--the \nSenator from Tennessee comes to the floor and each day the number of \npages gets inflated. Today he is claiming 2,000 pages in health care \nreform. Then he puts his alternative up and says: I can do it in 200 \npages. It reminds me of the old show ``Name That Tune.'' How many notes \ndo you need to hear to name that tune. The Senator from Tennessee says \nhe can name that tune for health care reform in 200 pages. Therefore, \nhe has a better proposal.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from Ohio, how much importance should we \nattach to the number of pages in a bill,\n\n[[Page S11071]]\n\nand ask the Senator if he remembers when the previous President, \nPresident Bush, under a Republican administration, brought to Congress \na 3-page bill to create the Troubled Assets Relief Program that cost \n$800 billion and did it in 3 pages. Does that tell us there was wisdom \nin this idea of spending billions of dollars to bail out the banks? In \nOhio, as you travel around, how many people have stopped you and said: \nWait a minute. I will not support any health care reform bill that goes \nover 200 pages? If it is 201 pages, I want you to vote against it. If \nit is 2,000, I hope you will filibuster it. Has the Senator run into \nthat?\n  Mr. BROWN. I know the question in part is in jest, but it is pretty \ninteresting, when you contrast this bill with the TARP bill. President \nBush, Secretary Paulson, and Chairman Bernanke came to us and said: \nPass this 3-page bill, and we will all be better off. Obviously, that \ndidn't quite work the way they wanted. I come to the floor regularly \nand read letters from people around my State, from Zaynesville, Toledo, \nBowling Green, Athens, Oxford, and Dayton. I guess the Senator is \nright. I don't see anybody saying: Please vote yes for the short bill \nand no for the long bill. I wish we could talk less around here and \nwrite a little more concisely. The letters I get that I read on the \nfloor are letters generally from people who a year ago, if you had \nasked them, would have said: I have really good health insurance or at \nleast I think it is good. But then they got sick and found out that the \ninsurance company practiced rescission which is insurance company speak \nfor taking your policy away or canceling your policy, or they had a \nchild. One of my letters is from a woman who had a child and thought \nshe had good insurance. The child had a preexisting condition. She had \nher insurance canceled. Others come from people who graduate from \ncollege. They are 22 years old. They are taken off their parents' \ninsurance policy, and they are struggling because they are not making \nenough money. They don't have a job that has insurance at that stage in \ntheir lives. They would like to stay on their parents' policy for \nanother 4 or 5 years, as our bill allows them to do.\n  I guess when I hear the assistant majority leader ask that question \nabout the length of the bill--and he is right, that is what Senator \nAlexander was talking about mostly, the length of the bill. Part of \ntheir criticism is the length of the bill. Their other criticism is to \ntry to scare people. How long have they been trying to scare people?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I may I ask the Senator another question through the \nChair, I also understand that the major force opposing health care \nreform is the health insurance companies, the private, for-profit \nhealth insurance companies that, incidentally, are declaring some of \nthe largest profits in their history, even in the midst of this \nrecession. This week Humana announced record-breaking profits primarily \nfrom Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage was the health insurance \ncompanies' challenge to the Federal Government. The private insurance \ncompanies said: The Federal Government has been running Medicare for 40 \nyears and has done a rotten job. We can do better. We can cover seniors \nwith the benefits promised in Medicare at a lower cost because we are \nthe private sector. We know efficiency. We are not a bureaucracy. We \nare the private sector.\n  They were given that chance. A few years ago they started offering \nthe Medicare Advantage plan to compete with traditional government-run \nMedicare. At the end of the day, after years of evaluation, what we \nfound was the private companies were charging 14 percent more, many of \nthem, than government-run Medicare, which meant that the Medicare \nProgram was paying them more for the basic benefits than what the \ngovernment was asking to provide the same benefits.\n  These health insurance companies have gotten rich on it. Humana this \nweek announced a record-breaking profit primarily based on their \nMedicare Advantage plan which was supposed to save us money. In fact, \nit cost us more money.\n  I say to the Senator from Ohio, when we write a bill that deals with \nhealth insurance reform to stop these major companies from denying \ncoverage to people for preexisting conditions, putting a cap on the \namount of money that they will give them if they have a serious \nillness, you can count on these health insurance companies hiring their \nlaw firms, teams of lawyers to fight us. If it takes another 50 pages \nor 100 pages to make sure we state clearly in the law the rights of \nAmerican families and consumers and businesses when it comes to health \ninsurance reform, that is paper well spent. That is time well spent.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Ohio, he has listened to the Republicans on \nthe other side of the aisle. I have yet to hear the first Republican \nSenator come forward in favor of health insurance reform. They have not \ncome out for the consumer protections which are fundamental to our \nbill. I ask the Senator from Ohio if he has heard that?\n  Mr. BROWN. No, I haven't. Again, who are the major opponents to this \nbill? It is two groups. It is the insurance industry, and it is the \nRepublican Party. Not Republicans who live in Springfield, IL or \nSpringfield, OH, not Republicans who live Urbana, IL or Urbana, Oh. \nThey are Republican Members of Congress. They are very closely aligned \nwith the insurance industry. Of course, they are not going to support \nthis legislation because the insurance industry didn't write it. In \nfact, it is legislation that the insurance companies obviously don't \nmuch like. We have seen these battles before. They did it with the \ncreation of Medicare, the same arguments and scare tactics, the same \ndistortions and the same exaggerations. And we are seeing it again.\n  The Senator mentioned Humana. Look at this, Humana profits, while 47 \nmillion Americans are uninsured and tens of millions more underinsured, \npremiums double in 9 years, small business premiums increase by 15 \npercent or more in 2010. Small business always gets hit harder than \nlarger companies, because they can't spread their risk quite as much, \nbecause the companies can charge smaller businesses more for their \ninsurance than they can charge larger companies.\n  You go back to their business plan. Look at what insurance companies \ndo. The private sector says the government has these big bureaucracies. \nMedicare administrative expenses are significantly under 5 percent. \nPrivate insurance administrative expenses are anywhere between 15 and \n30 percent. Look at their business plan. The insurance industry hires a \nbunch of bureaucrats to figure out how to deny care. They hire \nbureaucrats to say: Sorry, you have a preexisting condition. We won't \ninsure you. They hire bureaucrats to discriminate against people \nbecause of a disability or gender or something else. They hire people \nso they can sift through and get the ``right customers.'' Then they \nhire a bunch of other bureaucrats on the other end to deny claims that \npeople submit. They hire this huge bureaucracy in order to keep people \nfrom buying insurance, if they are not a good risk. And they hire this \nhuge bureaucracy to deny your claims.\n  Something like 30 percent of insurance claims are denied the first \ntime around. If you get sick, you send it in to Wellpoint or Aetna or \nCigna, they deny your claim. What do you have to do? Instead of taking \ncare of your sick wife or your mother, helping her, if you are on your \nown, you spend your time fighting with the insurance company instead of \ntaking care of them. That is the good news, if you win on those. So \noften they turn you down and you still don't win if you appeal.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to give the Senator a specific example. Several \nyears ago the Illinois State Medical Society invited Members of \nCongress to spend a day with a doctor. I wasn't sure I wanted to do it \nbecause I thought doctors and patients, will this work? It didn't sound \nright to me, but I said: Only if each time I am about to see a patient, \nyou tell them, watch out, there is a politician in the room. And make \nsure they give permission. Lo and behold, we did rounds with the \ndoctor, and many folks in their hospital rooms were bored enough that \nthey wanted to see not only their doctor but this trailing Congressman. \nI was in St. John's Hospital in Springfield, IL as we went into this \nwoman's room. She was living by herself at home. She was suffering from \nvertigo and dizziness. As a consequence, she had stumbled down the\n\n[[Page S11072]]\n\nstairs. She had not hurt herself too badly, but the doctor admitted \nher. After an examination, he said: We will have to do brain surgery. \nYou have an imbalance caused by a brain tumor, and the operation will \nbe on Monday. This was a Friday. So he said: I am going to want to keep \nher in the hospital until the brain surgery on Monday. I can't send her \nhome. She lives alone. She will fall down again. She could hurt \nherself. I want to make sure she is ready for the surgery, which was \nvery important for her.\n  Then he found out that the insurance company said: No, send her home, \nbring her back Monday morning for the brain surgery. This doctor said: \nThat is an outrage.\n  I watched him as he went to the nurses' station, picks up the phone \nand gets into a debate with the clerk at an insurance company who is \nsaying: Send her home. Finally, he slams down the phone, after spending \n15 minutes arguing with no benefit to this clerk, and says: I don't \ncare what they say. I am leaving her in the hospital. Either I will pay \nfor it or we are going to fight it out later on.\n  Think about that for a minute. This is a medical doctor, a surgeon \ngetting ready to prepare this woman for surgery, fighting with a clerk \nat an insurance company who says: Send her home. We don't want to pay \nfor 2 extra days.\n  Mr. BROWN. These are not government bureaucrats. Medicare doesn't \nexclude people for preexisting conditions; right?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right.\n  Mr. BROWN. But insurance companies will use their bureaucracy to deny \ncare that way.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Deny care. This is the reality of what we are up against. \nSo when the Republicans come to the floor and do not want to support \nour efforts toward health care reform, they are saying the current \nsystem is just fine.\n  I saw, incidentally, the Senator from Tennessee come to the Senate \nfloor and say: You ought to be able to buy health insurance across \nState lines. Well, there is some appeal to that. You would not think \nmuch of going from Ohio--I would not encourage this--to go to an \nadjoining State to buy a car. You know, it is the same car, and so \nforth.\n  But isn't it a fact that as you go State by State, the standards for \nhealth insurance change? Some States have very high standards of the \nkinds of health insurance we can expect to buy in our States; others, \nvery low standards. Some States are much better at looking at the books \nof insurance companies to make sure they can pay off as promised. If \nyou go moving around State by State shopping, you may end up with \nsomething that looks like good insurance until you really need it.\n  So our bills--at least the ones considered in the HELP Committee and \nin other committees--try to establish a basic standard of care so no \nmatter where you live in America, you are going to have the same kind \nof basic protection when it comes to what your family needs. And, \nbelieve me, I have had personal examples in my family and as a lawyer \nwhere you need it.\n  We had, in Illinois--before we changed the law--companies that were \nselling health insurance to new mothers covering their obstetric care \nand then would not cover the newborn baby until it was 30 days old. You \nknow what that is all about. Brandnew babies sometimes are very sick \nand very expensive. So this health insurance company was excluding \nnewborn infants from coverage for 30 days. We changed the law in \nIllinois and said: You cannot do that. If you want to cover the mother \nand the baby, you cover that baby from the very moment of birth. So \nthere are laws to protect them.\n  Other States may not have this law. Their premiums may be cheaper. \nThen what happens when you have a sick baby?\n  Mr. BROWN. Well, we know from these letters I have brought to the \nSenate floor from Ravenna and Gallipolis and Galion and Mansfield--\nthese letters are examples of how people thought their insurance policy \nhad some consumer protections in it. It was a fine policy as long as \nthey did not use it. Once somebody got sick, they found out the State \nlaws were too weak in some States.\n  In my State, they are not bad, but they are not as strong as they \nshould be. In most States, the consumer protections are not nearly \nstrong enough. That is why our legislation says no more preexisting \ncondition. Our legislation says, no more discrimination based on gender \nor geography or disability. Our legislation says no more annual caps or \nlifetime caps, so if you get really sick and your care is really \nexpensive, they will not cancel your insurance.\n  That is why we are building these consumer protections into our bill. \nThat is why the insurance industry and the Republicans do not much like \nour bill: it makes the insurance companies do some things they do not \nwant to do. That is why the public option is so important. Not only do \nwe change the rules for the insurance companies for consumer protection \non preexisting condition--it is outlawed--and there are no more caps, \nno more discrimination, but we need the public option to enforce that.\n  I would like to talk about something else Senator Durbin touched on. \nThe Republican opponents to this, in their opposition and some of their \nexaggerations--again, I make the very clear distinction between what \nRepublicans in Lima and Middletown, OH, think about this health care \nbill and what Republicans who are elected to office, who have very \nclose ties to the insurance industry, think about this bill.\n  As Senator Durbin suggested, I do not hear anyone on the street--I do \nnot ask their party affiliation, but if I am in a Republican part of \nthe State, I probably assume they may be a Republican. It does not \nmatter. They may be an Independent or a Democrat. But I do not hear \nthem say: The bill is too long or hear them say: I want the insurance \ncompanies to continue to be able to discriminate or be able to use a \npreexisting condition to exclude people.\n  It might be Republicans here who say that who are elected to office, \nwho are close to the insurance company lobby and the pharmaceutical \ndrug companies' lobby. But regular people in Mansfield, OH, and Shelby, \nOH, and Zanesville, OH, and Cambridge, OH, do not think that way.\n  Last week, as shown on this chart, a constituent shared this mailing \nwith me from Homerville, OH, Medina County. It is an official-looking \nnotice, complete with a Pennsylvania Avenue address. As you can see, \nthis shown here is the envelope: ``325 Pennsylvania Avenue, Southeast, \nWashington, DC.'' ``IMPORTANT: PROJECTED MEDICARE CHANGES.'' \n``Presorted, United States Postage.'' It has some identifying numbers \nthat suggest perhaps it is a government mailing. This is not a mailing \nfrom the U.S. Government. This is not a mailing from the Center for \nMedicare & Medicaid Services. This is not a mailing sanctioned by \nanybody in our government. But it sure looks like it with ``325 \nPennsylvania Avenue, Southeast, Washington, DC.'' They did not send \nthis from Columbus, OH, or Troy, OH. They sent it from Washington, DC, \nwith a Pennsylvania Avenue address.\n  This official-looking notice declares:\n\n       Proposed cuts to existing government programs include a \n     significant reduction in the federal Medicare program, \n     resulting in an increase in premiums and fees that you must \n     pay . . . and a decrease in some benefits.\n\n  It goes on to state:\n\n       This new cutback in the federal Medicare program means that \n     you will become responsible for an even greater portion of \n     your health care expenses . . . expenses that were previously \n     paid by Medicare.\n\n  Again, this is made to look like a government mailing. Clearly, that \nwas their intent. Clearly, their intent is to deceive. Clearly, their \npurpose was to obfuscate and to confuse and to exaggerate. These are \nthe same accusations we hear from insurance companies, the same \naccusations we hear, not from Republicans in Columbus or Zanesville or \nSaint Clairsville, OH, but from Republicans who dress like this and who \nwere elected to represent us around the country who are very tied in \nwith the insurance industry.\n  Look at the facts. Health care reform will not increase the premiums \npaid by seniors for regular Medicare by a dime--no increase, zero. \nHealth care reform will not reduce Medicare benefits, which are \nguaranteed by law. They will not reduce benefits.\n  If health care reform affects the additional benefits some seniors in \nMedicare Advantage receive, if it affects the\n\n[[Page S11073]]\n\npremiums seniors pay for that coverage, it will not be because of any \naction on the part of Medicare. It will be because private insurers, \nthe private insurance industry has decided to use health care reform as \nan excuse to squeeze more money out of seniors.\n  All you have to do--again, as Senator Durbin suggested--is look at \nwhat has happened. In the last 7 or 8 years, the profits of private \ninsurance companies have gone up 400 percent. Humana profits went up 65 \npercent in the third quarter--$301 million. How can they make that kind \nof money? How can they pay their executives what they do? Aetna pays \nits CEO $24 million. For the 10 largest insurance companies in America, \nthe average CEO pay at those 10 companies is $11 million. How can they \ndo that? They do that because they double the premiums in 9 years.\n  They do that because they increase premiums, especially on small \nbusinesses. They are able to do that because they have squeezed people. \nThey do that because they use preexisting conditions to deny care. They \ndo that because they hire bureaucrats who refuse to pay legitimate \nclaims people submit to their insurance companies.\n  Taxpayers and seniors will continue to pay these private plans tens \nof billions of dollars each year to provide coverage to seniors, enough \nto keep premiums where they are, and, according to the industry itself, \nenough to offer the same benefit packages as they do today.\n  How is that? Medicare Advantage plans are required by law to provide \nthe same benefits as Medicare. If they offer extra benefits, those \nbenefits are supposed to be paid for out of efficiencies, not extra tax \ndollars.\n\n  So the insurance companies, 10 years ago, said: Let us in on Medicare \nand we will save taxpayer dollars because we are the insurance \nindustry. We are the private sector. We can do it more efficiently than \nthe government can. So let us into this and we will save you money. We \nwill actually give taxpayers back 5 percent of what you now pay per \nperson for Medicare.\n  Well, that is how it started. But then the insurance lobby went to \nwork. The insurance lobby worked on Newt Gingrich successfully. The \ninsurance lobby went to work on the Republican majority in both Houses \nsuccessfully. The insurance lobby went to work on George Bush and Dick \nCheney very successfully. All of a sudden, instead of discounting and \npaying the taxpayers back 5 percent, they have raided the Federal \nTreasury and have gotten 12 or 13 percent more dollars than we spend on \nregular Medicare, which more than 80 percent of the American people are \nin.\n  They have always claimed they operate so much more efficiently than \nregular Medicare that they can offer basic Medicare benefits, plus \nextra benefits, and not spend a penny more than Medicare spends on \nbasic benefits only. Unfortunately, 10 years ago, some in Congress \nbelieved them. Even more tragically, some in Congress continue to \nbelieve them, as they shovel dollars out of the Federal Treasury into \ninsurance company coffers--people who put things like this out, as \nshown on this chart.\n  So here is the question: Are Medicare Advantage plans no more \nefficient than Medicare? Do they require a government handout to keep \ntheir promises to seniors or is all the propaganda being fed to the \npublic simply a ploy to pump up profits?\n  I find it so interesting--as the country overwhelmingly supports the \npublic option, as doctors, in survey after survey, overwhelmingly \nsupport the public option--I hear conservatives say: The government \ncan't do anything right. The government just messes everything up. Why? \nIt is a big bureaucracy. It can't do anything right. Those same \nconservatives say: But if we have a public option, it is going to be so \nefficient, it is going to drive the insurance industry out of business.\n  Which is it? Is it they are so wasteful and bureaucratic they cannot \ndo anything right or are they so efficient they are going to drive the \ninsurance industry out of business? They always want to have it both \nways. They want to have it both ways in Medicare Advantage. They get \nthese government subsidies. They raid the Federal Treasury. They shovel \nthe money off to their buddies in the insurance industry. And look what \nhappens. Taxpayers are paying way too much, and seniors are not getting \nwhat they ought to get.\n  Then this mailing comes along, which is outrageously misleading, not \nonly by what it says but by what it does not say. It does not say that \nhealth care reform legislation will actually increase Medicare benefits \nand decrease Medicare costs; that health care reform legislation will \ndecrease--not increase--the amount of money that the more than 8 \nmillion seniors have to pay out of pocket for prescription drugs once \nthey hit the doughnut hole. Remember the doughnut hole?\n  The doughnut hole--for people who are not seniors, they probably are \nnot too aware of this, but the doughnut hole was created because when \nPresident Bush and the Republicans in the House and Senate wrote the \nMedicare drug bill 6, 7 years ago, they allowed the drug industry and \nthe insurance companies to have a little too much influence on that \nbill. So they created this doughnut bill, this desert, if you will, \nwhere people still had to continue to pay their premiums month after \nmonth after month, but they did not get anything for it. They did not \nget any payment for their drugs.\n  So our legislation, first of all, begins to close that doughnut hole \nwhere seniors will not have to continue to reach into their pockets and \npay that.\n  Health care reform legislation, in other words, will reduce, by half, \nthe amount of money that Medicare beneficiaries must pay for needed \nprescription drugs. By 2019, our legislation will totally eliminate \nthat doughnut hole. That is good news for seniors, especially those who \nhave high prescription drug costs.\n  In addition, health care reform legislation will eliminate the copays \nthat Medicare beneficiaries must pay for such crucial diagnostic \nservices as mammograms and colonoscopies. Seniors in Medicare now \ntypically pay 20 percent of the cost of their preventive services.\n  So a man who goes in for a colonoscopy--$700, if you can get it for \nthat--has to pay $140 out of pocket. What does that mean for a lot of \nseniors? It means they probably don't get a colonoscopy. They just \ncross their fingers and hope they are not going to get sick, that they \nare not going to get colon cancer. Most of them will not, but some of \nthem will, and some of them will have colon cancer that could have been \ndetected early, diagnosed early, and saved both a lot of pain and \nperhaps their lives and saved a lot of money for the health care \nsystem.\n  What our bill does is very simple. It will say that preventive care \nwill be paid for entirely by Medicare. There will be free annual \ncheckups. Our health care reform legislation will provide a new \nMedicare benefit: free annual checkups for seniors. So once a year, a \nsenior will get a checkup for free, and that can make all the \ndifference in the world.\n  None of us should be surprised that opponents of health care reform \nare sending out these deceptive mailings. Of all the offensive aspects \nof this mailing, I am most appalled at the very visible writing in the \nlower left corner, which states down here--I did not see this when I \nsaw it. Somebody in Ohio from Medina County handed me this little \nmailing, and we obviously blew it up. I never saw it until it was \npointed out by Jessica McNiece in our office. The language says: ``Not \nAffiliated With Any Government Agency.'' But you sure would not see \nthat when you look at everything else that is on this mailing. But that \nis the game they play.\n  One can sure notice the large, bolded writing at the top, though, \nwhere it says: ``IMPORTANT: PROJECTED MEDICARE CHANGES.'' Projected by \nwhom? Projected by the insurance industry? This isn't clear because the \nmailing conveniently doesn't tell you who is sending it.\n\n  We are trying to get to the bottom of where this mailing originated \nbecause we know the best way to defeat legislation in this body is to \nscare people. The best way is to exaggerate and distort, to turn the \nvery young against the very old. When I hear my colleagues in this body \nsay the Democrats are going to cut Medicare to pay for insurance for \nthe rest of the population, they are trying to turn older people \nagainst their kids and against their grandkids. It is pretty despicable \nto play that game, to scare people, trying to get\n\n[[Page S11074]]\n\nseniors upset because they are going to cut our Medicare to pay for \ninsurance for these other two populations.\n  A similar mailing in 2004 led Texas to sue the American Seniors \nAlliance, the front group that masterminded that scam. When we think \nabout all this, we need to ask ourselves, what does health care reform \nmean for seniors? What does it mean for taxpayers? Be careful whom you \nbelieve.\n  When the insurance industry attacks health care reform, it is not out \nof altruism, it is out of greed. Usually, anybody who has been around \nhere very long knows that when the insurance industry and the drug \nindustry are trying to defeat legislation such as this--and, of course, \nthey don't like this legislation; the CEO of Aetna is not going to make \n$24 million anymore if our bill passes, the CEO who in 1 year made $24 \nmillion. Their profits aren't going to keep going up and up and up and \nup, so they put everything they have into this. But what we see around \nhere is, when the drug industry and the insurance industry oppose a \nbill, they don't send out a mailing coming from CIGNA or Aetna. They \ndon't send out a mailing coming from Pfizer or Merck. They send out a \nmailing from a group they have created called--not precise names but \nnames such as Americans For Better Patient Health Care or Americans For \nSafe Drugs or associations or trade names; they make them up on paper \nand then the drug companies and the insurance companies funnel money \nin. This one is not even identified that well. We don't know who sent \nthis one out, but we are finding out.\n  If they had your best interests at heart, they would tell the truth. \nThey would come to the table and play a productive role instead of a \ndestructive one, not in their various front groups. Insurance companies \nare in the business of businesses. If they thought health care reform \nwas going to help their bottom line, they would be for it. But \nRepublicans here have consistently opposed health care legislation, at \nthe behest of the insurance companies and the drug companies that have \nconsistently opposed it.\n  I see Senator Leahy, who wishes to speak, so I will close with this: \nWe know these tricks. In 1965, the insurance companies teamed up with \nthe Republicans to try to defeat the creation of Medicare. In the \n1990s, the insurance companies and their allies in the drug industry, \nwith Republicans, teamed up to try to privatize Medicare. In the first \npart of this decade, they succeeded, teaming up--the drug companies and \nthe insurance companies teamed up with Republicans for a privatized \nprescription drug benefit that meant tens of billions of dollars for \nthe insurance companies, tens of billions of dollars for the drug \ncompanies. But it doesn't work for the American people. That is why our \nhealth insurance legislation is so important. That is why we need to \nmove forward and do the right thing. So dismiss mailings such as this, \nwhen they are not identified, when you don't know who sends them. When \nthey try to be something they are not, ignore them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a period of morning business.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted to follow the Senator from \nOhio, who has been such a leader in this area. Of course, I am \ndelighted to see my distinguished friend from Massachusetts in the \nchair, a friend of probably more years than either one of us is willing \nto count.\n  Today, we as Members of Congress have the opportunity to complete an \neffort that actually began decades ago. The status quo has a powerful \nlobby, and the centuries of status quo have killed health insurance \nreform before. They are pouring all their energy not into offering \nconstructive solutions but into erecting new pillars of obstruction at \nevery turn.\n  Each of the various reform plans that have been brought forward by \nnow have their strengths and their weaknesses. We all know that. But \none other thing we should know: Radical reforms they are not.\n  As President Obama asked, these proposals are based on the existing \nsystem of employer-based private insurance. But in the absence of \ncomprehensive national reform, several States have helped fill the void \nby crafting some of their own solutions. I am proud my home State of \nVermont has been a leader and an innovator on several issues that are \nnow being wrapped into the reform package. One such provision mirrors a \npilot program in Vermont, the Blueprint for Health. This coordinates \ncare among patients and does it in a way to prevent costly \nhospitalizations and procedures. Patients who participate in the \nprogram have their care monitored to ensure they are receiving the \nkinds of preventive services and disease management they need. The \nblueprint rewards physicians who keep their patients healthy. The \nprogram has already slowed costs. Of course, it has reduced emergency \nroom visits.\n  Vermont has also coordinated patient care as one of the States at the \nforefront of the movement toward electronic medical records. That is a \nreform I have long promoted. Recently, I visited Montpelier Pharmacy in \nour capital city, a small city of 8,500. I had the privilege of being \nborn there. But I visited Montpelier Pharmacy to announce a grant I \nsecured to help small pharmacies across Vermont adopt a system for \nelectronic prescriptions. With electronic prescribing, you can have all \nkinds of computer safeguards to prevent dosages from being too large or \nalso prescribing a medication which may conflict with another \nmedication that has already been prescribed. The system gives the \nphysicians--but also the pharmacists--a concrete medication history \nthat doesn't rely just on a patient's memory alone. In fact, if you \nhave a patient who cannot or does not remember what medication they \nhave been taking, this can be lifesaving. It is a little bit better \nthan a patient saying: Well, I have that small white pill, and I think \nit is something for heart or something like that; they can press the \nbutton and know exactly what medications they have and what the \ncontraindications are for other medications.\n  Vermont has also been a national leader in children's health care and \nin expanding coverage for low-income Vermonters to the Medicaid \nProgram. All this in a little State of 650,000 people. But because of \nour early action, more than 96 percent of Vermont's children have \nhealth insurance. In our little State--not a wealthy State, but 96 \npercent of Vermont's children have health insurance. We have one of the \nlowest rates for uninsured adults in the country. It makes Vermont a \nleader and model for the rest of the Nation.\n  The proof is in the pudding. We have 96 percent of the children with \nhealth insurance, the lowest rates for uninsured adults, so it should \nbe no surprise that Vermont has been ranked the healthiest State in the \nNation by the American Public Health Association and the Partnership \nfor Prevention and ranked No. 1 in health care by the Commonwealth \nFund. We can talk about things to do, but when you actually do them, it \nworks.\n  While Vermont has been a model in coordinating care and offering \nwider health coverage through public programs, a provision to expand \nMedicaid coverage nationwide threatens to penalize States such as \nVermont that have acted early to do the right thing; States, such as \nVermont, that did not wait but went forward to protect the people in \ntheir State. Instead of rewarding States that have taken the initiative \nto expand Medicaid Programs early, one of the Senate bills would \nrequire States that have been leaders in expanding coverage to accept \nless Federal assistance than other States who are offered only the bare \nminimum of coverage. In other words, it penalizes those that have done \nthe right thing and rewards those that have done the wrong things. \nTaxpayers in early leader States such as Vermont would be forced to \nsustain programs in States across the country that traditionally \nignored the needs of their citizens. So to address this disparity, I \nrecently joined with 13 other Senators from early leader States to \noffer a proposal that treats all States fairly. We can all share the \ngoal of increasing access to essential medical services by expanding \nMedicaid coverage nationwide. I look forward to working with others in \na way that does not misguidedly harm early leader States.\n\n  Even though Vermont has long recognized the importance of a health \ncare system that includes all Vermonters\n\n[[Page S11075]]\n\nand Americans, individual States can't make enough progress without \ncomprehensive health insurance reform. We need that. Workers nationwide \nare losing insurance for their families when they change or lose jobs. \nInsurance companies can and do discriminate against sick people. \nNotwithstanding what the hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of ads \nsay, they can and do discriminate.\n  I hear heartbreaking stories daily from constituents in Vermont. They \ntell me of the trouble they have getting, paying for, and keeping \nhealth insurance. I hear it when I go to the grocery stores at home. I \nhear it when I am putting gas in my car at home. I hear it when I am \nwalking down the street or coming out of church, such as the woman from \nWinhall, VT, who spends $500 a month on prescriptions--$500 a month on \nprescriptions--but she would be uninsured if not for her husband's job. \nShe is working two jobs just to make ends meet and afford their health \ncare costs.\n  Then there is the small business owner in Vermont who has three full-\ntime employees and one part-time worker and she works 6 and 7 days a \nweek, but she can't afford the blood test her doctor recommended. If \nshe becomes sick, she will lose her business, she will lose her home, \nher employees will lose their insurance.\n  There is the man from central Vermont who told me about his sister-\nin-law who lost parts of both feet because she didn't have health \ninsurance. She didn't have health insurance, and when she needed \nmedical attention, she waited, hoping things would get better. Well, \nthey didn't, and she had to be rushed to the emergency room for \namputation.\n  Real-life stories such as these make us ask: Why are we the only \nindustrialized Nation in the world that lacks health insurance for its \ncitizens? Why does the wealthiest Nation on Earth lack health insurance \nfor its citizens? Why does the most powerful Nation on Earth lack \nhealth insurance for its citizens? It is shameful. We owe it to all \nAmericans to pass meaningful reform.\n  I strongly believe the best way to meet these goals is to include a \npublic health insurance option in health insurance reform. A public \noption would give consumers more choices to purchase an affordable and \nquality health insurance plan. It would bring about competition. It \nwill bring down costs. I applaud the majority leader for saying the \nSenate bill will consider this.\n  In order to introduce true competition in the insurance industry we \nmust also end the exemption from antitrust scrutiny that has been \ncarved out of our laws for the benefit of health insurers and medical \nmalpractice insurance companies. The antitrust laws exist to protect \nconsumers and promote competition, and we should no longer allow the \ninsurance industry to hide behind its special, statutory exemption from \nthe antitrust laws. During the Senate's debate on health insurance \nreform, I will offer as an amendment the Health Insurance Industry \nAntitrust Enforcement Act, which I introduced last month, to end the \nhealth insurance industry's exemption from our antitrust laws.\n  We know our current health system is unsustainable. It threatens not \nonly our health security but also our economic security. Doing nothing \nhas been seen as an option before us. It is always easier to do \nnothing, but that is not an option now. We tried doing nothing for \nyears and the situation has grown worse. So let's debate and let's pass \nhealth insurance overhaul in the coming weeks. Let's give Americans the \ncompetition they need. Most importantly, let's give Americans the \nchoice they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I wish to compliment my good \nfriend from Vermont on his excellent remarks. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor on his legislation on the antitrust exception. I also wish to \nsay to my friend that I know he was a little bit under the weather the \nlast few days. I called him a couple times to wish him well. I think I \ncan speak for every one of the other 99 of us, we are glad the Chairman \nis back and in fighting form.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11075-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11075-S11077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nunemployment relief expansion that the Senate is poised to pass, \nhopefully, later today, with broad bipartisan support, although there \nwere, I am sorry to say, some unnecessary delays from the other side.\n  This bill is vitally important and we could have, and should have, \npassed it weeks ago. I am relieved to finally see the light at the end \nof a very long, very dark tunnel that being out of work has caused for \nhundreds of thousands of American workers who have lost their jobs.\n  Since we first began considering this vital legislation nearly a \nmonth ago, nearly a quarter of a million Americans, and 50,000 New \nYorkers have seen their benefits dry up. With each passing day of \ninaction, tens of thousands of middle-class families have seen their \nsafety net pulled out from under them. So I am glad to see the Senate \nfinally take action.\n  I think of something that happened to me on Monday. I was rushing to \nmy New York City office in midtown Manhattan. A well-dressed gentleman \nwas obviously waiting at the front door of the office building in which \nmy office is 17 floors up. He was well dressed, in a camel hair coat, \nand he was well groomed. I could see anxiety in his eyes. He pulled me \naside and said, ``Senator, I have been waiting for you. Can I speak \nwith you for a minute?'' I said, ``I am late for a meeting, so can you \nwalk with me?'' He said to me again, ``I would like to ask you a \nquestion. When will you pass an unemployment benefit extension? I have \na lot of friends who are asking.'' I sort of knew what was happening. \nOf course, he was a man who was obviously middle class, and maybe more, \nwho had lost his job and could not find his benefits. He was too proud \nto ask me for himself, so he asked me for others.\n  It hit home to me that New Yorkers of all backgrounds and economic \nlevels and all parts of our State are out of work through no fault of \ntheir own. They are desperately looking for jobs, and not enough of \nthose jobs have come back. Our job is to help them. That is what this \nbill does. I am glad to see the Senate finally take action.\n  The bill will also extend the home buyer tax credit for 7 months, \nwhich I support, and it will provide for a 5-year carryback of net \noperating losses, or NOLs.\n  The main focus of my remarks today is on this last provision, since \none of the important effects of this NOL part of the legislation will \nbe to provide much needed and deserved tax relief and, in too many \ncases, the money needed to survive to thousands of Americans who were \nlured into Ponzi schemes such as Bernie Madoff's and have lost \neverything. These evil schemes hurt so many people.\n  When we hear about the Madoff investors, we hear a lot about \ncelebrities who lost hundreds of millions. But for every wealthy \nindividual, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people not at all \nof wealth who had their retirement savings stolen from them. They \ntrusted Madoff or their investment adviser who put their money with \nMadoff. Now these poor folks have lost everything. In many ways, these \naverage people are worse off than the people who lost many times as \nmuch, because so many--too many--of these smaller victims lost \neverything.\n  As you know, many of them are in New York, because Bernie Madoff was \nlocated there. I want to explain to my colleagues how what we are doing \ntoday helps the little guy, the average person, who saved for their \nretirement and now finds, at age 60, 65, or 70, that their retirement \nsavings are gone. Everything they have worked for their whole life has \nbeen stolen from them. In many cases, the victims are destitute and \nhave nothing to live on. They saved their money for years. They got \nstatements and confirmations and 1099 forms that looked real. The SEC \nhad checked out Madoff and said everything was fine. The victims did \neverything right. They played by the rules, and then their future \nfinancial security evaporated before their eyes on December 11 of last \nyear.\n  Here is what we are doing to try to help those thousands of smaller \ninvestors. There are basically two types of Madoff investors, leaving \nout the charities and pension funds that were also\n\n[[Page S11076]]\n\ndecimated. There are the direct investors, who knew Madoff and invested \ndirectly with him. Then there are the indirect investors, who went \nthrough someone they knew or an investment advisor called ``feeder \nfund'' investors. In general, direct investors tend to be the bigger \ninvestors, the wealthy who had personal relationships with Madoff. The \nindirect investors are the folks who tend to have a lower net worth, \nand a lot of them are elderly people who saved all their lives, and \nsuddenly they are destitute. Many gave their money to somebody they \ntrusted, such as an investment advisor, and didn't even know their \nmoney was invested with Bernie Madoff.\n  When the IRS issued a revenue ruling in April, which I urged them to \ndo, the ruling simplified and clarified the rules under which a direct \ninvestor could take a theft loss deduction for their Madoff losses, by \nsaying that theft losses could be treated as NOLs, as if the individual \ninvestors were small businesses. Direct investors were allowed to \n``carry back'' their losses for 5 years instead of 3 and carry forward \nany remaining losses for up to 20 years. A longer carryback is \nimportant because it allows the investor to recoup some of those losses \nand put cash in their pockets.\n  But investors in a ``small business'' with more than $15 million in \nassets could not qualify for this relief. As a result, the IRS guidance \nwas of help only to direct investors because the feeder funds that had \nthe money of thousands of smaller investors were usually worth more \nthan $15 million. They aggregated lots of little investors and gave one \nbig chunk of money to Madoff. The IRS was sympathetic. They told us it \nwas right to help these people, but they said they needed a change in \nthe law.\n  I should also add that the indirect investors are also not eligible \nfor the $500,000 of relief from the Security Investor Protection \nCorporation, or SIPC, so they have been hit by a double whammy: They \nare the smaller people usually, and they got shut out of the expanded \ncarryback on the theft losses because the feeder funds of which they \nwere a small part were too big, and they get no SIPC relief either.\n  The bill we are considering today will allow larger businesses to \ncarry back their NOLs for 5 years. They can offset 100 percent of the \nincome for the first 4 years and 50 percent in the fifth. I have worked \nhard to ensure that this language is drafted in such a way that the \nMadoff indirect investors will qualify for the expanded NOL relief, \nbecause these individuals will no longer be subject to the ``small \nbusiness test.''\n  I believe very strongly that the indirect and direct investors should \nbe treated equally. I tried to amend the bill so that those who are \nvictims of theft losses from fraudulent investment schemes could get \nthe full 100 percent in the fifth year. I particularly thank the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, and his staff, for \nbeing receptive to this, and for working with my very capable staff to \nmake it happen. I believe we could have added this to the bill if we \ncould have gotten it scored in the compressed timetable that we had \nhad.\n  I will continue to work with the Finance Committee and the Joint \nCommittee on Tax and the victims advocates to get the necessary data so \nthat future tax relief for Ponzi scheme victims can be considered by \nthe full Senate, and not stalled by unrelated scoring issues.\n  The action we are taking today will help millions of unemployed, \nthousands of home buyers, and many large corporations that need the \nrefunds to improve their cash flow and make new investments, and that \nis hugely important. But I also wanted to explain how what we are doing \ntoday will help provide some modest assistance to thousands of people \nwhose life savings were stolen from them 11 months ago.\n  The victims haven't been sure where to turn, but I assure them that \nthey have allies in the Senate, including the chairman of the committee \nand myself. We hear them, and we are doing everything we can to help \nright these wrongs and at least make up for some of the evil done by \nBernie Madoff.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to address one particular \naspect of the bill before us, the Home Ownership and Business \nAssistance Act of 2009.\n  Home ownership is addressed in this bill through an extension of the \n$8,000 credit to first-time home buyers. There are some adjustments to \nthat credit encapsulated in the bill, but I will not get into that. I \nwant to address a different aspect. This is an idea that hasn't been \nfully debated in the Senate. I think it is an appropriate time to put \nit forward.\n  We need a permanent $5,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers. \nFolks may say: But we have a mortgage interest deduction, and that is a \nmajor home ownership program in America. Why should we have a \ndownpayment tax credit for first-time home buyers on an ongoing basis?\n  In the bill before us, the tax credit is designed to stimulate the \neconomy, stimulate the housing market. But I put this idea forward from \na different direction--the direction of empowering our working families \nthrough home ownership.\n  Why is that so important? I will tell you and I will give you a few \nvignettes.\n  I spent years working as director for Habitat for Humanities, working \nwith low-income families trying to become homeowners. The community \nmade it affordable and possible by donating land and materials and \nparticipating in the construction of the home. Habitat sold the homes \nto the individuals on a zero interest mortgage. Those families \nparticipated in the construction, which is often called ``sweat \nequity.'' They were out there hammering nails, putting up walls, \npouring foundations, putting on roofing, putting their own labor and \nsweat into the construction of the house.\n  What I saw through that experience was the profound impact of home \nownership on working families. I saw families, who were unstable and \nhad been going from living in a van to living in a basement, become \nstable. I saw the positive impact on the children, who had never been \nable to invite a friend over before--now having pride in their home and \nhaving the ability to invite friends over, having more self-respect. I \nsaw them doing better in school. I saw parents who didn't believe they \nhad a stake in the community. Now they had a stake in the community, \nand that affected the way they behaved. They became more involved in \nthe affairs of the community.\n  I want to turn first to laying out the fact that studies that look at \nthe details of home ownership impact find that indeed home ownership \nhas an enormous impact on working families. Sociologist R. J. Bursik \nfound that crime, unemployment, suicides, juvenile delinquency, teen \npregnancy, and drug use are decreased by home ownership. The Journal of \nUrban Economics found that children in home-owning families tend to \nhave higher levels of achievement in math and reading, to have fewer \nbehavioral problems, stay in school longer, are more likely to graduate \nfrom high school, and are more likely to go to college.\n  A study by Alba, Logan, and Bellaire titled ``Living with Crime'' \nfound that home ownership resulted in family members being \nsignificantly less likely to be involved in crime.\n  All of this is common sense. It is common sense that a family who \nfeels part of a community is going to be less likely to be involved in \ncrime, is going to be more involved in the community, that children who \nhave more stable lives have more self-respect and are going to fare \nbetter in school. The stability of home ownership makes it more likely \nthat children are going to graduate from high school. But I think it is \nimportant to document those impacts from the studies, as well as from \nour common sense or from vignettes.\n  We have a major program in America, the home mortgage interest \ndeduction, which is designed to facilitate home ownership. It is a \nterrific program, but the program does not assist working families \ngetting into their first homes.\n  Let me put up a chart to explain what I am talking about.\n  Take a working family. Maybe they are earning $40,000 or $50,000 or \n$70,000, and they buy a $150,000 house and put 5 percent down. Right \nnow, mortgage rates are low, so they pay 5 percent interest. Their \ntotal interest is $7,078. That is less than the standard deduction for \na year. The standard deduction\n\n[[Page S11077]]\n\nis $11,400. So working families are not assisted by the home mortgage \ninterest deduction in getting into homes.\n  It is still a good program. It still empowers home ownership over the \nlong term. It certainly is beneficial in an increasing way to families \nwho earn more.\n  Here is a family buying a $500,000 house. While the interest is the \nsame, the same assumptions--5 percent down, 5 percent interest, \n$23,591, far exceeding the standard deduction. So if you are a family \nwho is better off, you can buy a bigger house. The home mortgage \ninterest deduction helps launch you into home ownership. But if you are \na working family in America, it does not help much. In fact, often the \ninterest is less than your standard deduction. So it has no impact \nwhatsoever. This is why we should debate fully a permanent $5,000 \ndownpayment tax credit for first-time home buyers.\n  Of course, we always struggle with the cost of programs and that is a \nvery important thing to do. The cost of the home mortgage interest \ndeduction in this last year was about $97 billion. That is the cost of \nthe home mortgage interest deduction, with most of the benefits going \nto affluent families. So $97 billion is directed in ways that do not \nhelp our working families get into their first home.\n  What if we were to spend a fraction of that to help working families \nbecome homeowners, knowing that the externalities of home ownership--\nthe stability for children, the lower crime rates, more likely to \nfinish school, more likely to earn more money, you pay more in taxes, \nless likely to end up on public programs. All those programs are paid \nback to us in multiples.\n  What would the cost be of providing a $5,000 downpayment tax credit, \na permanent one, to first-time home buyers? It would be on the order of \n$10 billion, assuming that every family, regardless of income, was \neligible.\n  A $97 billion program, an important program, a good program, but it \ndoes not help working families get into homes. Why not spend 10 percent \nof that on a program that would help launch our working families into \nhome ownership, which makes much better lives for them and a much \nbetter community, stronger communities for everyone else, and a much \nbetter future for their children?\n  I will conclude in this fashion. Home ownership has enormous value to \nour society--home ownership done right, not with liar loans, not with \nprepayment penalties, not with steering payments, not with mortgages \nthat are basically scams. But home ownership done right has enormous \nreturns--responsible, good, solid mortgages. We should support our \nworking families to become homeowners, for their sake and for \nstrengthening all of America and for the future of our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11077-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 3548, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3548) to amend the Supplemental Appropriations \n     Act, 2008, to provide for the temporary availability of \n     certain additional emergency unemployment compensation, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Baucus/Reid) amendment No. 2712, in the nature of \n     a substitute.\n       Reid amendment No. 2713 (to amendment No. 2712), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 2714 (to amendment No. 2713), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 2715 (to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 2712), to change the enactment \n     date.\n       Reid amendment No. 2716 (to amendment No. 2715), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nis expired, the substitute amendment is agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider is considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The amendment (No. 2712) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12:15 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, that will be, I suppose, about 12 minutes \neach side; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise in full support of the extension \nof the unemployment insurance compensation. I rise also to express my \nthanks to a number of people in this body.\n  First, as everybody knows, we adopted a substitute to the \nunemployment compensation bill by Senator Reid. Senator Reid, the \nmajority leader, has been instrumental in seeing to it this bill not \nonly passes but that enhancements are made to this bill to help the \nU.S. economy, and it is totally paid for and a net positive to the \nFederal Treasury. I appreciate more than I can express Senator Reid's \nhard work to help this take place.\n  Secondly, I thank Max Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee. \nSenator Baucus and his staff have been unbelievably cooperative in \nhelping us find the pay-fors to match and actually exceed the cost of \nthe home buyers tax credit which will be extended in this legislation.\n  Senator Dodd, chairman of the Banking Committee, 3 weeks ago hosted a \n3-hour hearing in the committee on the housing tax credit and the \nhousing market. Without his giving us that time to bring forward the \nissues that are so pressing in our country today, I am not sure we \nwould be standing here at all. So I am greatly appreciative of Senator \nDodd.\n  I particularly thank Chris Cook on my staff for the work he has done \nin helping make this take place.\n  Lastly, but not least, I thank Mr. Richard Smith, a private citizen, \na person in the housing industry who dedicated countless hours of his \nlife in the past month to educate people on the positive effects of \nwhat we are about to do.\n  Briefly, I want to say the following: We learned about 8 months ago \nthat a tax credit for first-time home buyers worked. It worked to bring \nback the entry level marketplace in housing, and it helped to begin to \nstabilize the housing market which led us in late 2007 into the \ndifficulties we have experienced over the last 20 months. Extending it \nis important, as long as everybody still understands permanent \nextension would be bad. Extending it to next April, which this bill \ndoes, with a closing no later than June 30, allows the American housing \nmarket and first-time home buyers to exercise their right to take tax \nthey pay, convert it to equity in the investment and net appreciating \nasset, and help stimulate what is the rock-solid base of the American \neconomy.\n  We also add, in addition to the $8,000 credit extension for first-\ntime home buyers, a move-up buyer tax credit of $6,500. This is the \ncornerstone of the substitute before us now. It offers to any previous \nhomeowner who has lived in their home for at least the last 5 years the \nopportunity to sell that home, invest in a new home, and take up to a \n$6,500 tax credit. That is going to help us boost what is the problem \nin the U.S. housing economy today, and that is what is called the move-\nup market. It is the gentleman who is transferred from Delaware with \nHercules to Brunswick, GA, who cannot sell his house in Wilmington and \ncannot buy a house in Brunswick because the markets are so frozen and \nthe move-up market is dead. Now he has an opportunity to sell that \nhouse and have an incentive for its purchase in Delaware and an \nincentive to come and reinvest that money in Georgia in a house in \nBrunswick. It will make a measurable difference over the next 7 months \nin our economy.\n  We also raised the means test on income from $75,000 to $150,000, \nwhich is in the current credit, to $150,000 and $225,000 in the new \nbill for both move-up buyers as well as first-time home buyers. Those \nincome thresholds will open the incentive to more Americans and I think \nwill show a measurable increase in the amount of business that takes \nplace.\n  In response to the Internal Revenue Service concerns we expressed a \nfew months ago on fraud, we put in every single request they made for \nfraud to\n\n[[Page S11078]]\n\nsee to it the HUD-1 is attached to tax statements, to see to it there \nis no fraudulent claim of the money, and to see to it the IRS has every \ntool they can to prosecute to the fullest anybody who would abuse this \ncredit.\n  Lastly, we have one exemption to the payback. As the Presiding \nOfficer knows, the credit has to be paid back if somebody sells their \nhouse within the first 3 years of occupancy and moves. That is because \nthey are required to own it at least 3 years. That payback is waived if \nthey are a member of the U.S. military who has redeployed in our \nmilitary in the United States or overseas. It is not right for them to \nrespond to our country's call and then penalize them on the tax credit \nif they used it before by not knowing they would be called or moved \nagain.\n  Again, I thank Senator Reid, Senator Baucus, and Senator Dodd for \ntheir tremendous work. I thank the Members of this body for their \npositive vote of 85 to 2 on cloture on Monday night and hopefully what \nwill be a very positive vote tomorrow night to extend and pass the \nfirst-time home buyers credit and add to it the move-up buyers home \ncredit.\n  I add to this list everybody who has an interest, everybody who \nthinks it is a great opportunity. It is a great opportunity, but it \nends on April 30 for contracts and on June 30 for closing. It would not \nbe in the best interests of the United States or this Senate to extend \nthis credit. Part of the benefit of a tax credit is the scarcity or the \nurgency of its sunsetting. This tax credit will sunset on April 30, \n2010, and it will not be extended. Closing will have to take place by \nJune 30 or it will not count.\n  I urge all Americans who have always dreamed, if they are a first-\ntime home buyer, of having a home of their own or Americans who have \nbeen gridlocked in the failure of our move-up market to actually move \nup and work, you have a 7-month opportunity that is good for you, it is \ngood for the United States of America, and it is good for this economy.\n  I yield the floor by thanking all the Members of this body and urging \nthem to vote in favor of the adoption of the substitute and ultimately \non the passage of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend several of my colleagues who \nbrought us one step closer to passing an extension of unemployment \ninsurance which is absolutely critical in the lives of millions of \nAmericans. Hundreds of thousands--millions, indeed--have run out of \ntheir benefits or are about to run out of their benefits. They are \nfacing the prospect of a tough economy without jobs and looking \nfeverishly and not finding them and not having a basic support for \ntheir families. This is critical.\n  Majority Leader Reid has helped immensely, together with Chairman \nBaucus. I particularly single out Senator Isakson and Senator Bunning. \nThey have worked collectively, collaboratively to bring to this bill \ntwo other measures which are critical. As Senator Isakson explained, \nthe housing tax credit. One of the real benefits of this body when it \nworks well is we are able to have the expertise and the judgment and \nthe knowledge of someone such as Senator Isakson who understands better \nthan anyone else the real estate market because he came up through that \nbusiness.\n  His vision months ago gave us the option to move forward on this \nhomeowners tax credit. It has been a huge success, and it is much to \nthe credit of Senator Isakson.\n  Senator Bunning recognizes the need for the net operating loss \nfavorable treatment to small businesses.\n  When we work together, pooling our best ideas, we can contribute to \nthe well-being of Americans all through this country. I thank those two \nSenators.\n  I hope that after what I anticipate to be another overwhelming \nprocedural vote that we could move immediately to consideration of \nfinal passage of the unemployment compensation bill, together with the \nmeasures Senator Isakson and Senator Bunning have offered.\n  I hesitate, but I will add that it has been 20-plus days since we \nhave been considering this unemployment extension. We have been through \nnumerous procedural votes. These procedural votes have been \noverwhelming. Monday evening, it was 85 to 2. Typically, when we have \nthat kind of underlying support for a measure, we do not need 30 \nadditional hours, particularly now since we are considering a \nbipartisan bill, incorporating unemployment compensation extensions, \nfirst-time home buyers, together with net operating loss treatment for \nsmall businesses.\n  So I anticipate a successful procedural vote. I would like to \nanticipate swift and unanimous passage, and I hope that is the case.\n  The issue of unemployment compensation is absolutely critical all \nacross this country. There is no place today in the United States that \ndoes not see a serious crisis in unemployment. In my home State, we \nhave a 13-percent unemployment rate. My assembly was briefed today with \nthe prediction that the rate will peak sometime next year at 14 \npercent. That is crippling in terms of its effect on families.\n  We have seen some progress in our economy. We saw last week, for the \nfirst time in a year, a growth in the gross domestic product--3.5 \npercent. The economy is expanding. We are growing again. The downward \ncollapse has stopped, and we are beginning to grow. But, as I suggested \npreviously on the floor, you can't feed your family GDP. You need a \njob. You need to be able to work. You need to have the certainty of \nyour work, that it will be there. And you have to be able to have that \njob to provide for your family and to give us the confidence we need to \ncontinue to grow and expand the economy.\n  One of the economic effects we have seen is lagging consumer \nconsumption, which was a major driving force in our economy. It is \nobvious that when people are afraid of losing their jobs, when people \nhave lost their jobs, their consumption is necessarily limited. So in \norder to sustain our growth, we have to go ahead and rebuild our \nemployment situation.\n  But what we have to do immediately is to recognize there are people \nwithout jobs. These are people who have worked all their lives. My \ncolleagues have come to the floor repeatedly and they have read--\nSenator Durbin and so many others--letters from constituents, husbands \nand wives who are now faced with no employment, are faced with the loss \nof their insurance because their COBRA is running out, their health \ncare, and they are worried about losing their homes. For the first \ntime, they are at the edge of financial ruin. Many have already \nexhausted their 401(k)s, all their retirement benefits, just to get by, \njust to survive.\n  Again, these are people who have worked all their lives. We owe them \nsomething more than procedural niceties in the Senate. I hope that \ntoday we will pay that debt to these people.\n  We are here on the verge, I hope, of quick passage and not additional \ndelay. We have taken it step by step. The leadership of Majority Leader \nReid and Chairman Baucus has been extraordinary, and with the \nthoughtful and substantive contributions of my colleagues, Senators \nIsakson and Bunning. I hope that with this now bipartisan approach, we \ncan, in fact, not only procedurally take it a further step but pick up \nthe pace dramatically and cross the finish line--today, I hope. I would \nobviously urge all my colleagues to support this measure and support \nthe underlying legislation as quickly as possible.\n  At this juncture, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during \nthe quorum be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, again I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S11079]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Anniversary of Iran Hostage Crisis\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to note the 30th anniversary of \na very sad day in American history. On this day 30 years ago, an angry \nmob of so-called students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took \n66 U.S. citizens hostage there. The original plan of the terrorists was \nto hold the Embassy for 3 days. In the end, they held 52 American \nhostages for 444 days.\n  The images of hostages blindfolded, with their hands tied behind \ntheir backs, should remain seared in our memories. The ABC News program \n``Nightline'' essentially has its beginning in this crisis. The title \nof the news program at the time was ``The Iran Crisis--America Held \nHostage.'' Each night, as Americans went to bed, it would add a day to \nits count of how long Americans were held hostage. Walter Cronkite \nwould similarly sign off his newscast.\n  I am sure many remember the chants of the hostage takers and those \nwho supported them--``Death to America,'' they would say. The Iranian \nregime would call us the ``Great Satan.'' The thing is, although the \nhostages have long been released, not much else has changed. The \ngovernment still leads its citizens in chants of ``Death to America.''\n  After Ayatollah Khamenei came to power, a Time magazine article in \n1980 described him as the face showing ``the ease with which terrorism \ncan be adopted as government policy.'' Terrorism remains the policy of \nthe Government of Iran today. Earlier this year, the State Department \nissued its annual report on terrorism, finding that ``Iran remained the \nmost active state sponsor of terrorism.''\n  The Ayatollah Khamenei blessed this brazen terrorist act of holding \nAmericans hostage. Upon his coming to power, Iran went from being an \nAmerican ally in the region to our mortal enemy. The hostage crisis \nwas, and remains, the defining symbol of this rupture.\n  In his inaugural address, in keeping with his campaign promises, \nPresident Obama stated to countries such as Iran, ``We will extend a \nhand if you are willing to unclench your fist.'' On the nuclear weapons \nissue, the hand has been extended many times to Iran, but Iran has yet \nto unclench its fist.\n  Sadly, its resistance is nothing new. In October 2003, Iran concluded \nan agreement with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom known as the \nEU-3 in which Iran promised to suspend its uranium-enrichment \nactivities. It did not live up to that promise. Iran arranged again, in \nNovember 2004, a suspension agreement with the EU-3, only to repudiate \nit again. This Iranian duplicity continues to this day.\n  In June 2006, the EU-3 was joined by Russia, China, and the United \nStates to become the P5-plus-1. They called on Iran to suspend its \nuranium-enrichment activities in exchange for a variety of incentives. \nA revised version of this proposal was presented to Iran in the summer \nof 2008.\n  The International Atomic Energy Agency issued its most recent report \non the matter in August 2009. In paragraph 27, it found that:\n\n       Iran has not suspended its uranium enrichment related \n     activities or its work on heavy water related projects as \n     required by the Security Council.\n\n  The most recent Congressional Research Service report on the matter \nsays:\n\n       Iranian officials maintain that Iran will not suspend its \n     enrichment program.\n\n  Yet another deal to bribe Iran to comply with its international \nobligations is before Iran today. Under this proposal, Iran would \ntransfer stocks of its low-enriched uranium to Russia, Russia would \nenrich the uranium further and transfer that to France for France to \nfabricate into fuel assemblies, and then finally France would transfer \nthis enriched uranium back to Iran. This deal came after the G-20 \nmeeting in Pittsburgh in September, at which it was revealed that Iran \nhad a covert enrichment facility in defiance of all of its \ninternational commitments and requirements.\n  French President Sarkozy said:\n\n       If by December there is not an in-depth change by the \n     Iranian leaders, sanctions will have to be taken.\n\n  Prime Minister Brown stated:\n\n       I say on behalf of the United Kingdom today, we will not \n     let this matter rest. And we are prepared to implement \n     further and more stringent sanctions.\n\n  I hope President Obama will join in the Europeans' forceful and clear \nresponse to continued Iranian intransigence on the nuclear issue.\n  This current Iranian regime represents the same terrorists who took \nU.S. citizens hostage 30 years ago today and held them in humiliating \ncaptivity for 444 days. That seminal event is still celebrated in Iran. \nI do not believe it has ever been repudiated or condemned by the \nIranian Government.\n  In his book ``Guests of the Ayatollah,'' Mark Bowden describes how \nthe U.S. Embassy has perversely become an anti-American museum to which \nstudents are bussed to commemorate the terrorist event. He further \ndescribes how ``the takeover is remembered as one of the founding \nevents of the Islamic `republic.' ''\n  Mr. Bowden also writes:\n\n       The Iran hostage crisis was for most Americans their first \n     encounter with Islamo-fascism and, as such, can be seen as \n     the first battle in that ongoing world conflict. [The \n     hostages] were the first victims of the inaptly named `war on \n     terror.' ''\n\n  Now Iran continues its nuclear activities in defiance of Security \nCouncil resolutions, and it remains the world's leading state sponsor \nof terrorism. This regime is not negotiating in good faith over its \nnuclear program, and during the time we have attempted to bring it into \ncompliance with its international obligations, Iran has continued to \ndefiantly develop its nuclear capabilities.\n  Thirty years ago today, Iran directly threatened and harmed the most \nvital and core U.S. interests. No one in this Chamber should be \nconfused that 30 years later this regime still means to do us harm.\n  Mr. President, I wish to especially thank Michael Stransky for his \nresearch on this matter.\n  As a sign of remembrance and respect, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the names of all of those taken hostage in Iran \n30 years ago today, as well as the 8 servicemembers who lost their \nlives in an attempt to free them.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    The Hostages and The Casualties\n\n       Sixty-six Americans were taken captive when Iranian \n     militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979, \n     including three who were at the Iranian Foreign Ministry. Six \n     more Americans escaped. Of the 66 who were taken hostage, 13 \n     were released on Nov. 19 and 20, 1979; one was released on \n     July 11, 1980, and the remaining 52 were released on Jan. 20, \n     1981.

Madam President, I note that my colleague from New \nHampshire is also on the floor. Did she want to go first?\n\n[[Page S11081]]\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Go ahead.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Debt and Deficit\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, last night's elections have been \ninterpreted in a variety of different ways. I listened to one channel \nand got one certain interpretation, I listened to another channel and I \ngot the exact opposite interpretation. So I will throw in my \ninterpretation.\n  I think the American people, most Americans today, are going through \nsome tough times. They are finding it very difficult to make ends meet. \nMany Americans have lost their jobs, unfortunately. Those Americans who \nhave jobs are worried about their jobs. They are going home at night, \nthey are sitting down with their husbands or with their wives and they \nare trying to work through the family finances.\n  They are concerned about making ends meet. They are worried about \ntheir credit card debt, they are worried about their mortgage, they are \nworried about how they are going to pay for their children's schooling, \nif their kids are in school. If they are graduate students, they are \nnot kids, they are worried about how they are going to pay all those \ndebts they are running up to get through school.\n  I think Americans understand the debt is a problem personally and now \nthey look at the Federal Government and they see we are running up this \nmassive debt on them. We are going to be asked, fairly soon, to raise \nthe level of the national debt by maybe $1 trillion.\n  This year the deficit will exceed $1.4 trillion--or last year--and we \nare seeing deficits projected for the next 10 years of over $1 trillion \na year. They are seeing our Federal debt being bought up by foreign \ncountries. Yet our Federal debt keeps going up dramatically. They are \nasking themselves: How can this be? How can a country as strong and \nvibrant as the United States continue to run up all this debt and \ncontinue to be successful? We cannot do it as family members. We cannot \ndo it in our household. How can the Federal Government do this?\n  I think the answer is fairly intuitive: It cannot do this. Yet we \ncontinue to do it as a government. So I think some of the vote last \nnight was a statement that, hey, Federal Government, take a pause. \nThink about what you are doing in the area of running up deficits and \nrunning up debt and passing on to the children, to our children and to \nour grandchildren, a situation which is not fiscally sustainable.\n  Think about what is going to occur if we continue to run these \nmassive deficits and this massive debt. It will be a situation where we \nhave a new saying in this country, ``No child left a dime'' as a result \nof all this debt being run up. Our kids will be put in a position where \ntheir quality of life will be fundamentally undermined. They will not \nbe able to buy their home. They will not be able to send their children \nto college. They will not be able to do the things we have been able to \ndo in our generation because they will have to be paying for the debt \nwhich we put on their backs, $1 trillion of deficit every year for the \nnext 10 years, the public debt going to 80 percent of GDP.\n  Yet the proposals we are seeing come across this floor aggravate the \nsituation almost on a daily basis. Two weeks ago, there was a proposal \nby the White House to add $13 billion of new deficit spending because \nthey wanted to give $250 to every Social Security recipient.\n  Well, I think most Social Security recipients are sophisticated \nenough to know that putting $13 billion of debt on their children's \nbacks, in a system that already has severe fiscal problems, is not \nworth it for $250. It is not worth doing that to their kids and their \ngrandkids.\n  Then, 1 week ago, it was proposed we spend almost $\\1/4\\ trillion--\n$250 billion--to fund the doctors fix. The doctors need this \nadjustment. But it was going to be funded by passing debt, putting debt \non our children's backs. We could not afford to do that to them.\n  It is not right to fix the doctors' problem by passing the bill on to \nthe next generation. Yet that was what was proposed. It passed in the \nHouse. Fortunately, over on the other side of the aisle, a number of \nfolks stood and joined all the Republicans and said: No, that is not \nthe way to do it. We should pay for that.\n  We are going to see a highway bill coming through here pretty soon. \nThat bill is going to add potentially $150 billion of new debt to the \ndeficit.\n  The most egregious example of this problem of expanding the deficit \nand the debt on our children and leaving our children in a situation \nwhere no child has a dime is the situation that is coming down the pike \non the health care bill. The House of Representatives leadership on the \nDemocratic side has proposed a bill that, when fully implemented--in \nthe first 10 years, it is not fully implemented so the costs are \nunderestimated--is going to cost $2.4 trillion of new spending. It will \ntake health care spending up to 22 percent of the gross national \nproduct. We will be spending more than a fifth of this country's wealth \non health care as a result of the House bill.\n  The practical implications of that are staggering, not only to our \neconomy but to this government. To grow this government by $2.4 \ntrillion is going to put us in a situation where we will basically have \na government that is piling more debt on top of debt we already can \nafford.\n  It is alleged that this is paid for. It is paid for in the first 10 \nyears, if you use the most rosy assumptions, because they start the \npay-for years on year 1, and they don't start the expenditures until \nyear 4. So in a 10-year period they have 6 years of expenditures \nmatched against 10 years of income. But when you get it fully \nimplemented, it is not paid for. There is a huge gap. The pay-for \nassumes that you are going to take $4- to $500 billion out of Medicare \nand move it over to a new entitlement. You will take $4- to $500 \nbillion of new tax increases and pay for this new entitlement. We can't \nafford that. If we are going to adjust Medicare spending by $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion, which is what the House is proposing, that money should go to \nmaking Medicare solvent. It should not go to creating a brand new \nentitlement which is going to weight down even further the ability of \nthe Federal Government to pay its bills. Yet that is the proposal. If \nyou are going to dramatically increase taxes, as the bill suggests, by \n$\\1/2\\ trillion, that money should also go to address the deficit and \nthe debt. It should not go to expanding the size of government.\n  The fundamental problem with this health care bill, as it left the \nHouse and the Senate Finance and HELP Committees, is that it grows the \ngovernment at a dramatic rate and uses resources which should be used \nto get the deficit under control or to make Medicare more solvent. It \nuses those resources to expand a brand new entitlement. We know, \nbecause we have seen it in all sorts of initiatives, that when you put \na new program on the books, you inevitably, especially an entitlement \nprogram, underestimate the cost, and you equally overestimate revenues. \nInevitably, the majority of that cost is financed through deficit \nspending and is added to the debt. You just have to look at our history \nto know that is true.\n  As we go forward from this point, I hope we will think a little bit \nabout addressing what most Americans who voted last night were thinking \nabout, at least when they went home to do their own budgets, and that \nis the deficit and debt, and that we won't put on the books a brandnew \nentitlement that will cost us $2.4 trillion when fully implemented and \nwhich will dramatically aggravate our ability to pay for debt we \nalready know is coming down the road to make Medicare more solvent, \nwhich we know is a big issue and will increase the size of the \ngovernment. When this bill is fully implemented, if it were passed in \nits present form, the Federal Government would grow from 20 percent of \nGDP to 23\\1/2\\ percent of GDP. That would be the largest percentage of \nthe economy the Federal Government has taken out of it since World War \nII. Then it continues to go up. It ends up, after 10 years, at about 26 \npercent of GDP, if we factor in all the different expenditures which \nare proposed in other parts of the budget.\n  It is not sustainable. It is not fair. It is not right. One \ngeneration should not do this to another generation. We should not \npromise new programs we cannot pay for and which will pass on to our \nkids costs which they will have\n\n[[Page S11082]]\n\nto bear in a way which will dramatically affect their quality of life. \nI hope we will take a little time out and say: Let's see if there isn't \na better way to do this. Let's see if we can't do this in a more \nfiscally responsible way, in a way that doesn't grow the government by \ntrillions of dollars, and which doesn't pass massive new debt on to our \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I agree with my colleague from New \nHampshire. We have too many people who are struggling right now in this \nrecession. We have too many people who are unemployed, who need help \nuntil they can get back on their feet, find a new job, until the \neconomy starts creating jobs again. That is why I am having so much \ntrouble understanding why it has taken this body so long--4 weeks now--\nto extend unemployment benefits for those people who are losing their \nbenefits before the end of this year, almost 2 million Americans, and \nwe have been trying to pass an extension of unemployment for the last \nmonth.\n  I rise to speak in support of the Worker Home Ownership and Business \nAssistance Act, a bill that will extend unemployment benefits 14 weeks \nfor unemployed workers in every State and for an additional 6 weeks in \nthose States with over 8.5 percent unemployment. I am pleased that \ntoday the Senate has voted by an overwhelming majority, 97-to-1, to \nproceed to final passage of this legislation.\n  This broad, bipartisan vote acknowledges that unemployment affects \nevery community in every State in every part of the country. In fact, \nthis is the third vote we have had now to proceed to this bill. Every \nvote has passed overwhelmingly with a bipartisan vote. Despite those \nstrong votes in support of an extension, opponents have put up \nobstacles at every turn to delay passage of the bill. As a result of \nthese delay tactics, approximately 200,000 workers have lost their \nbenefits in the last month.\n  Hopefully after 4 long weeks, the end is in sight. Soon people like \nRichard, one of my constitutents from Winchester, NH, who called my \noffice yesterday, will get the help he desperately needs. Richard is a \nsingle father of three boys. He lost his job as a machinist at \nGreenfield Tap and Dye plant, a small manufacturing plant in the \nsouthwestern part of the State, more than a year ago. Since then he has \nbeen using his savings, his unemployment benefits to pay his mortgage, \nto buy food, to buy gas, and to pay for other necessities. Richard has \nbeen out looking for other manufacturing jobs, but no one is willing to \nhire him until this economy improves.\n  That is what the Senate has been working on. I disagree respectfully \nwith my colleague from New Hampshire. Much of the effort we have \nexpended in the Senate has been to support the economy so it does \nimprove, so we can create jobs again.\n  We are on the cusp of finally passing this legislation to help \nRichard and his family and millions of other jobless Americans whose \nbenefits will run out, to help them get through the holidays. As I have \nsaid many times, when we extend unemployment, we are not only helping \nthose workers whose benefits have been exhausted, we are helping small \nbusinesses that provide the goods and services the unemployed are going \nto need. They are going to go out and spend those unemployment checks \non those goods and services so that for every $1 we spend on \nunemployment, it turns over $1.61 in the economy. People collecting \nunemployment spend their benefits immediately on necessities to keep \ntheir families going, which means these dollars get into communities \nalmost as soon as the checks arrive. Economists say that dollar for \ndollar, extending unemployment benefits is one of the most cost-\neffective actions we can take to stimulate the economy.\n  Passing this extension is the right choice for unemployed workers and \nfor communities. I look forward to passing this extension for Richard \nand for the millions of Americans who are counting on us to act.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Two months ago, I stood on the floor of this Chamber and made a \nsolemn commitment. It is a commitment I have restated almost every day \nthat the Senate has been in session, and I will say it once again \ntoday: I will not vote for any health care reform bill that fails to \ninclude a strong public option.\n  Unfortunately, there has been a great deal of misinformation about \nwhat the public option is really about and what it would mean to \nordinary Americans. So let's cut through the distractions and scare \ntactics and talk seriously. Let's define exactly what a strong public \noption means.\n  I hear people talk about public options and triggers and opt-outs and \nopt-ins and all kinds of other proposals. Some people throw words \naround interchangeably. But words are important, and this is not some \nabstract idea, this is a real set of proposals that will affect real \npeople in real ways. So let's define exactly what we are talking about.\n  The strong public option is about three things: competition, lower \ncosts, and accountability. That is why a strong public option is \nessential to achieve real, meaningful reform.\n  We can all agree that we need to fix our health care system now, but \nlet's also agree to fix it the right way.\n  First and foremost, a strong public option must create true \ncompetition in the health care insurance market. A key problem with \nhealth coverage is that consumers do not have any options. In America \ntoday, only two industries are not bound by antitrust laws that apply \nto every other business in this country: health care insurance and \nMajor League Baseball. When every other private enterprise has to \ncompete in the open market for their business, why does big insurance \ndeserve special treatment? In my opinion, they don't. In such a highly \nconcentrated environment, there is no incentive to compete. There is no \nreason to improve service, expand access, or work with patients and \ndoctors to achieve better health outcomes. In fact, there is every \nincentive to do just the opposite.\n  We have seen unprecedented consolidation in the insurance market, and \nthat has led to a lack of competition and choice for American \nconsumers. Over the past 13 years, there have been more than 400 \ncorporate mergers involving health insurers. As a result, 94 percent of \nour Nation's health markets are now considered ``highly concentrated,'' \nmeaning they are virtual monopolies.\n  In my home State of Illinois, just two companies control 69 percent \nof our market. Sadly, Illinois is far from alone. In Alabama, a single \ncompany controls almost 90 percent of the market, and in Iowa, Rhode \nIsland, Arkansas, Hawaii, Alaska, Vermont, Wyoming, Maine, and Montana, \nthe two largest insurance companies control at least 80 percent of the \nmarket. In fact, there are only three States in the entire country \nwhere the largest three companies control less than 50 percent of the \ninsurance market.\n  This must end. We must restore competition and choice to the health \ninsurance industry. It is time to create a strong public option that \nwill make insurers compete for people's business, just like any other \ncompany in America.\n  A strong public option will give people a choice for the first time \nin decades. No one would be forced to change their coverage, but if \ntheir current provider isn't treating them right, they deserve the \nopportunity to choose something better and more affordable.\n  That brings me to my next point. In order to achieve real reform, a \npublic option must be strong enough to significantly lower costs. Every \nMember of this Senate knows what America pays for insurance. One dollar \nout of every $6 we spend in this country goes to pay for health care. \nHealth outcomes are down, but somehow insurance company profits are \nthrough the\n\n[[Page S11083]]\n\nroof. This does not make sense. Premiums are rising four times faster \nthan wages. In fact, between 2000 and 2007, 10 of the country's top \ninsurance companies increased their profits by an average of 428 \npercent. There is nothing wrong with making a profit. I think all \nbusinesses should make a profit. But there is nothing fair about \ncreating a monopoly and then wringing money out of sick Americans who \nare counting on them in their hour of need.\n  Not only are there almost 50 million Americans without health \ninsurance, there is also a massive segment of the population who can't \nafford what little coverage they have.\n  The American people deserve the chance to shop around, to compare \noptions and pick plans that are right for themselves and their families \nor small businesses. If private companies have to compete with a strong \npublic plan, people's premiums will come down, companies will bring \ncosts under control, and this will help save money. But it is not just \ncosts that will improve. Providers will also improve quality of \ncoverage. They will start to focus on patient outcomes rather than \nprofits. As a result, better care will become available to more people.\n  A strong public option would require some capital to get off the \nground, just like any other business, but after that, it would rely on \nthe premiums it collects to remain self-sufficient. It would operate \nlike a not-for-profit insurance company, setting affordable rates based \non the actual cost of care, not a desire to give giant bonuses to their \nexecutives and pay dividends to their stockholders.\n  The current system is a drain on the American taxpayer, but a strong \npublic option would not be. It would not be a handout, it would not \nforce anyone to change their current coverage, but it would drive down \ncosts and give people a real choice for the first time in decades. A \nstrong public option would provide a cheaper alternative to private \ncompanies and would force those companies to improve their product or \nrisk losing customers.\n  That brings me to the third goal we must achieve with real health \ncare reform. A public option must be strong enough to bring real \naccountability to the health insurance industry. For far too long, \nprivate insurance providers have been running roughshod over the \nAmerican public. More often than not, those most in need are the ones \nwho suffer the worst abuse. There is a lot of money to be made off of \nthe poor. I will repeat that statement. There is a lot of money to be \nmade off of the poor. Insurance companies don't seem to mind raking in \nthe cash at their expense. Private insurance companies will drop your \ncoverage for almost any reason. They routinely exploit minor \ntechnicalities to avoid paying claims for those who need assistance the \nmost. These companies continue to look at new and innovative ways to \ndeny coverage to sick Americans because they know these people have \nnowhere else to turn. A strong public option, coupled with the rest of \nour insurance reform, will change all of that.\n  Our reforms would make it illegal to deny coverage because of a \npreexisting condition. A strong public option would allow people to \nshop around if they don't like the coverage they have or if they are \npaying too much. As the system exists today, the health insurance \ncorporations are accountable to their shareholders first and their \ncustomers second. A strong public option would reverse that; it would \nprioritize patients over profit. It would give the American people the \nchance to hold their companies accountable for the first time in many \nyears.\n  So that is why I support a strong public option. That is what it \nwould mean for America: competition, cost savings, and accountability. \nUnless we are able to meet these three conditions in the bill, I will \nnot vote for it. I believe a strong public option is the best way to \nachieve these goals. In fact, my preference is to have a robust plan \nthat would be tied to Medicare. Whatever form the legislation takes, I \nwill ultimately judge it based on its ability to bring about real \ncompetition, lower costs, and restore accountability.\n  So it is time to make good on the promise first articulated by Teddy \nRoosevelt almost 100 years ago. It is time to make comprehensive health \ncare reform a reality. After a century of debate, we are faced with the \nopportunity to accomplish something truly historic. If we do this now \nand if we do this right, we can make a real difference in the lives of \nmillions of Americans. That is why I will not stop fighting until this \nfight has been won.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me to make sure America has access to \nquality, affordable health care through a system that is competitive, \ncost-effective, and accountable.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor and note the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Job Creation\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for \nadditional policies to create jobs in our country and about how energy \nlegislation can help to accomplish that goal.\n  First, let me make a point I made last week on the Senate floor; that \nis, despite the recent positive economic news, Congress needs to take \nadditional steps if we are going to create the jobs we need in this \ncountry. The economy has lost 7.2 million jobs during this recession--1 \nout of every 20 jobs in the country. In percentage terms, this is the \nbiggest job loss since the recession in 1948 and 1949.\n  This chart vividly describes the jobs deficit we are seeing. The \nheading is: ``Not enough job creation to maintain employment at level \nin January 2001.'' Let me explain that a little bit. These job losses \nwe have experienced in this recession add to the jobs deficit that has \nbeen accumulating over the last 9 years. The country needs--our economy \nneeds--12 million new jobs in order to bring employment back to where \nit was at the end of the Clinton administration. Economists expect the \njobs report--which comes up in 2 days, this Friday--to show even more \njobs were lost in October of this year.\n  We should not, in my view, overlook the positive news about our \neconomy reported last week. The gross domestic product jumped to 3.5 \npercent in the third quarter, a complete turnaround from the 6.4-\npercent decline in the first quarter of this year. It is reported that \nthe Recovery Act has created or saved 1 million jobs--640,000 through \ndirect spending alone. The Recovery Act is working, but Congress still \nneeds to take additional action. We need additional policies to create \njobs if we are going to prevent this recovery from being a jobless \nrecovery, much like the previous two recoveries we had from recessions.\n  Let me go to another chart. This chart is entitled ``Job losses \ncontinued for months after the recessions in 1990-91 and 2001.'' What \nthe chart shows is the change in the number of jobs during the \nrecessions--the two recessions I have referred to, 1990-91 as one \nrecession and 2001 as another recession. During the months after those \nrecessions ended, the job losses continued. As you can see, the economy \ncontinued to shed jobs for 2 months after the 1990-91 recession ended, \nwhich is the green line, as you can see. After the 2001 recession, job \nlosses continued for a staggering 18 months--not 2 months but 18 \nmonths--at that time.\n  This is the paradox of the recoveries from the past two recessions. \nThe GDP began to grow, as it now has in our own period, with the \nresults of this last quarter, but the country continued to lose jobs. \nWhen jobs finally did return, they returned very slowly.\n  Let me go to another chart. This chart is entitled ``Unemployment \nrate continued to rise after the recessions in 1990-91 and 2001.'' This \nchart shows what happened to the unemployment rate. The unemployment \nrate rose for 16 months after the 1990-91 recession ended. The \nunemployment rate rose for 20 months after the 2001 recession ended.\n  Even 5 years after the 2001 recession ended, more people were out of \nwork than before that recession began. So Congress needs to take steps \nto ensure that the recovery this time is different.\n  The tax cuts enacted during the Bush administration were meant to \nstimulate job growth, but it is apparent now they failed to do so. \nThose tax cuts\n\n[[Page S11084]]\n\nwere too blunt an instrument to do the job. They were not focused \nenough on creating jobs. The $4 trillion hole they dug in the Federal \nbudget has made it harder for us to recover from the current recession. \nSo the country needs policies that are more targeted on job creation.\n  Last week, I outlined four ideas Congress should consider: a jobs \ncreation tax credit; second, a manufacturing tax credit; third, \nemergency bridge loans to homeowners to keep them in their homes; and \nfourth, additional aid to States.\n  It should be noted the aid to States that has already been provided \nhas been effective at saving hundreds of thousands of teaching jobs--\n325,000 of the 640,000 jobs created or saved by the Recovery Act were \njobs in education. Congress should consider providing additional aid to \nStates to help close those budget shortfalls which are projected. The \ncumulative budget shortfalls are projected to total $175 billion for \nthe States over the next 2 years.\n  Let me turn now to another action we should take to create jobs. To \ncreate jobs, in my view, Congress should go ahead, at the earliest \npossible time, to enact the American Clean Energy Leadership Act. This \nis legislation that was reported out of our Energy and Natural \nResources Committee in June of this year, where it received bipartisan \nsupport. The vote there was 15 in favor of reporting that legislation \nand 8 members voted against it.\n  This Energy bill I am referring to is a jobs bill. The Energy bill \ncould create 350,000 to 500,000 jobs over the next decade. It would \ncreate jobs by increasing the amount of research and development that \nis supported by the Department of Energy. It would create jobs by \nincreasing the demand for renewable energy by establishing a renewable \nelectricity standard. It would create jobs by financing the \nconstruction of nuclear powerplants through the establishment of a \nclean energy deployment administration. It would create jobs by \npromoting energy efficiency retrofits for homes and for commercial \nbuildings. These are jobs that cannot be outsourced. It would create \njobs by building new clean energy and improving energy efficiency \nthroughout the manufacturing sector.\n  Reducing energy usage means reducing the cost of doing business, \nwhich will make American businesses more competitive in the global \nmarket and allow them to expand and to create jobs in the United \nStates. This is part of what this Energy bill is all about, creating \njobs and making the United States more competitive in the global \neconomy.\n  The Energy bill would position our country to lead in the development \nof clean energy technologies, which is a rapidly growing industrial \nsegment that I believe will be one of the most important sectors of \nindustry in the 21st century. It will also make our economy stronger by \nenabling businesses to flourish in other areas of the economy.\n  Before elaborating on some of the provisions in that bill, let me \ngive a concrete example of how forward-thinking energy legislation has \nthe effect of creating jobs for middle-class Americans. In September of \nthis year, the Department of Energy awarded Fisker Automotive a $529 \nmillion loan through a program that was created by the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007. This last week, Fisker announced \nit will be reopen a previously owned General Motors plant in Delaware \nthat has been shut down, and it will use that plant to produce a plug-\nin hybrid car. The new Fisker plant will employ 2,000 people and \nindirectly create another 3,000 jobs in the surrounding area. So not \nonly will consumers benefit from the increased choices they will have \nin energy-efficient automobiles, but American workers will benefit from \nincreased clean energy jobs. Similar good news stories can be told \nabout new or retooled factories in Michigan, Indiana, and Tennessee as \nwell.\n  The American Clean Energy Leadership Act I have been referring to \nwould provide more loans of this kind by creating this clean energy \ndeployment administration--or CEDA. CEDA will be an independent agency \nwithin the Department of Energy with a mission to support the financing \nof low-carbon energy projects. For example, CEDA could provide loans \nand loan guarantees or other credit enhancements to enable the \nconstruction of powerplants that produce renewable energy or factories \nthat make wind turbines or other components. CEDA will also create \nfinancial mechanisms to allow affordable financing for energy \nefficiency retrofits and distributed generation in entire communities. \nThis new agency will give special focus to high-risk, high-reward \ntechnologies that are otherwise difficult to finance.\n  Additional financing is critical at this time, when credit markets \nare still very tight and private investors are reluctant to take on \neven low-risk commercial projects. In the first quarter of 2009, \ninvestments in renewable energy totaled only $500 million, just one-\ntenth of the $5 billion invested in the same period the year before. \nEven when financial markets recover, banks are leery of the risk \nassociated with new technologies. Without CEDA--which we are creating \nin this legislation--to fill the gap, we run the risk of these \ninvestments continuing to be made overseas, where market conditions are \nbetter for innovative clean energy technologies.\n  CEDA initially will be capitalized under the legislation at $10 \nbillion in appropriated funds that can conservatively support Federal \nlending of approximately $100 billion.\n  Combined with funds from private partners, a reasonable estimate \nwould lead to $20 billion worth of clean energy projects.\n  CEDA could potentially be scaled up in the future, enabling it to \ncreate even more jobs.\n  The energy bill would also establish a Renewable Electricity \nStandard, or RES, for the entire country. This policy would require \nelectricity companies to get 15 percent of their power from renewable \nresources by 2021, with an exemption for small-scale utility companies. \nBy increasing the demand for clean energy, the Renewable Electricity \nStandard will promote the construction of new wind farms, solar power \nplants, and geothermal plants. A variety of other clean technologies \nwill also qualify, technologies such as hydro, biomass, and ocean \npower. Constructing these plants and manufacturing the components \nneeded could create 100,000 to 125,000 jobs by 2025.\n  In addition to the Renewable Electricity Standard, the energy bill \nincludes policies to strengthen the Nation's electricity transmission \ngrid and increase the production of renewable energy on public lands. \nThese policies would complement the Renewable Electricity Standard.\n  Improving energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to reduce the \nenergy costs of homeowners and improve the competitiveness of American \nbusinesses. The energy bill has programs targeted both at the \nmanufacturing sector and at residential and commercial buildings.\n  For residential and commercial buildings, the bill creates a grant \nprogram that states could use to fund retrofit programs for residential \nand commercial buildings. A home energy retrofit finance program would \nalso be created. States could use this program to set up revolving \nfinance funds to help homeowners pay for energy efficiency \nimprovements. This support would be in addition to the support \navailable through CEDA.\n  The residential and commercial energy efficiency programs in the \nenergy bill could create tens of thousands of jobs. Overall, energy \nretrofits is potentially a large job creator. Rebuilding America \nestimates that retrofitting 50 million homes over the next 10 years \nwould create 625,000 jobs that could be sustained during that period. \nThe programs in the energy bill would accomplish part of that goal.\n  The bill also includes programs to increase the energy efficiency of \nAmerican manufacturers. Energy Department financing will help small and \nlarge manufacturers upgrade to energy efficient production equipment \nand processes. Public/private partnerships will map out and develop the \ntechnologies needed by specific industries to reduce their energy \nintensity. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy \nestimates these energy efficiency programs would at a minimum create \n15,000 to 20,000 jobs by 2020.\n  But more important than this estimate is the competitive edge \nAmerican manufacturers would gain by increasing their energy \nefficiency. This is a\n\n[[Page S11085]]\n\nkey step to revitalizing the manufacturing sector and ensuring it \nremains strong in the future.\n  Nearly everyone agrees that research and development is vital to \ncreating jobs and to the competitiveness of the United States. The \nenergy bill would nearly double the authorization for the Office of \nScience in the Energy Department, to over $8 billion in 2013. At that \nfunding level, the Office of Science could support over 27,000 Ph.D.-\nlevel researchers across the United States. The authorization would \nalso double for applied energy research to $6.5 billion, research \nfocused nuclear energy, fossil fuels, and energy efficiency. Other \ncountries in Asia are well ahead of the United States creating \nresearch, development, and deployment roadmaps for clean energy \ntechnologies. With additional resources, this research will make \nAmerican industries competitive in a carbon constrained economy.\n  All told, using both the specific estimates that have been made for \npolicies in the American Clean Energy Leadership Act, and a midpoint \nestimate for jobs resulting from the retrofit provisions of the bill, \nthe act could create up to 500,000 jobs over the next decade if it is \nenacted and funded.\n\n  This is just a part of the job creation potential in the energy \nsector. The National Commission on Energy Policy estimates that the \ncountry will need 400,000 new jobs in the electricity sector alone. If \nindirect jobs are included, the number of new jobs created could total \n1 to 1.5 million. Similarly, the Center for American Progress has \nestimated the job-growth potential if both the public and private \nsectors combined were to invest $150 billion per year in clean energy. \nThat is the level of investment that the center estimates would be \nmobilized by a comprehensive set of policies that include both what \nCongress has already enacted as part of the American Reinvestment and \nRecovery Act and a full suite of policies surrounding a cap-and-trade \nsystem for regulating greenhouse gases. In that larger context, the \nCenter for American Progress has concluded that there is the potential \nto increase the number of permanent jobs in the economy related to \nclean energy by a net amount of 1.7 million.\n  The energy bill is a downpayment on reaching that target, and has \nsignificant potential to create jobs in the near term. It would \nstrengthen the competitiveness of American businesses through energy \nefficiency improvements and investments in research and development. \nAnd it would position the United States to be the global leader in the \ndevelopment of clean energy technologies. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation when it does come to the floor for \nconsideration.\n  The jobs we can create as we transition to a clean energy economy are \nnot the total answer to our job needs in the coming years. But they are \nan important part of the answer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation not only for what it \nwill do to meet our energy needs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, \nbut for what it will do to create jobs and put our economy on a growth \ntrack in future years.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I know there has been a lot of discussion \nthroughout our country and probably some here on the Senate floor \nregarding the elections that took place last night and what that means. \nI think most of it has been centered around politics.\n  I wish to suggest something. I think that much of what the country is \nin some degree of upheaval about is the policies we are discussing here \non the Senate floor and the things that are moving through committees. \nObviously the major issue of the day is health care, health care \nreform.\n  We have a bill over in the House, we have one that can essentially be \non the Senate floor in the very near future. I would like to sort of \ncreate a picture, if I could, for my friends on the other side of the \naisle.\n  As I look at the bill, the health care bill that seems to be coming \ntogether, that I think again will be put together soon, I know, No. 1, \nthere is a lot of hesitation. I know our majority leader is having \ndifficulty finding 60 votes to actually move the bill ahead. What I \nwish to mention to my friends on the other side of the aisle is this: \nIf Republicans had put forth a health care bill that took $400 to $500 \nbillion out of Medicare to leverage another program that was not used \nto make Medicare, which is insolvent, more solvent; if Republicans had \nput forth a bill that created an unfunded mandate for States by making \nStates raise their Medicaid levels--in other words, we are mandating \nthat in my State alone it is going to cost $735 million; and if \nRepublicans had put forth a bill that we knew was going to raise \npremiums--in our State it is going to raise premiums by 60 percent over \nthe next 5 years based on an independent study; if Republicans had put \nforth a bill that had the exact same building blocks as the bill that \nhas been put together through our Finance Committee, that is now being \nmerged with the HELP Committee bill, I do not believe there would be a \nsingle Democratic vote for that bill. I absolutely do not believe that \nif Republicans put forth exactly the bill we have been discussing here \nin the Senate, I do not think there would be one Democratic vote for \nthat bill.\n  What I am suggesting is that I know there is a lot of unease on the \nother side of the aisle regarding this bill. There is tremendous unease \non our side.\n  I do not think we have a single Republican today who feels in any way \ngood about the legislation that has been discussed. A lot of times we \nas parties make a lot of mistakes by ``doing one for the Gipper,'' \nthrough supporting our President. Republicans have done that in the \npast where sometimes we get behind a policy that maybe we were uneasy \nwith, but our President, our leader, wanted a particular policy to be \nbrought forth.\n  My sense is that is exactly what is happening right now with my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle and our sitting President; that \nis, for political victory people are seeking this health care reform. \nBut I believe, again, if Republicans offered exactly this same bill \nwith the same fundamental funding mechanisms, there would not be a \nsingle Democratic vote.\n  For that reason, there has been a message sent to this body by the \nrecent elections that have taken place. People across the country are \nconcerned about the policies this health care bill we have been \ndiscussing puts forth. I say to my friends on the other side of the \naisle: Let's stop what we are doing right now. I know there is a lot of \nunease. Let's get this right. I am one of those Republicans who would \nlike to see health insurance reform. I campaigned on that when I ran \nfor the Senate in Tennessee. I was commissioner of finance for our \nState in the middle 1990s and dealt with many of the issues of people \nin our State not having health insurance. I would like to see us do the \nright thing. I would like to see us have a policy that will stand the \ntest of time.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle: Let's throw this \nbill aside. You wouldn't vote for this bill if we offered it. You \nshould not vote for it just because your leadership and your President \nwant to see it happen. Let's step back and do something that will stand \nthe test of time.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side, who I know are incredibly \nuneasy about this legislation that has very poor building blocks, I \nhope they will listen. I hope together we can step back, and I hope we \nwill put in place some policies that, again, will benefit Americans and \nstand the test of time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this afternoon I wish to share my insights \nabout health care reform efforts in the\n\n[[Page S11086]]\n\nU.S. Congress and how beneficiaries who currently participate in the \nMedicare Advantage Program, Medicare Part C, would be impacted.\n  When I think of health care reform, I envision legislation that \nreduces health costs and improves affordable access to coverage. \nUnfortunately, the bills reported by the Senate HELP and Finance \nCommittees do not achieve either of those goals. As a Senator from \nUtah, I have cast many tough votes throughout my service. Regarding \nhealth care reform, I have pushed for a strong bipartisan vote. \nUnfortunately, it is obvious that Senate and House floor debates on \nthis issue will be another largely partisan exercise.\n  This summer I participated in more than a month of debate and \npartisan votes in the HELP Committee and 2 weeks of the same in the \nFinance Committee. Unfortunately, however, it appears those many hours \nof debate were all for naught.\n  It is important to note that the bills the members of the Senate HELP \nand Finance Committees spent hours considering will not be the \nlegislation debated on the Senate floor. In fact, we have yet to see a \nbill that will be considered on the Senate floor.\n\n  I certainly hope Members of the Senate will have the opportunity--at \nleast 72 hours--to review not only the entire bill but also the final \nCongressional Budget Office cost estimate before considering any such \nbill on the floor. This bill affects every American and every American \nbusiness. Therefore, I believe there should be a comprehensive public \nreview before it is even considered.\n  Let me take a few minutes to talk about the specifics of how Medicare \nwill be impacted by the health care reform proposals before Congress.\n  The President has consistently pledged not to ``mess'' with Medicare. \nAgain, this is another pledge that is not honored through the Senate \nhealth reform bills I have reviewed. The Senate Finance Committee bill \nreduces Medicare by over $400 billion--according to CBO, $117 billion \ncomes out of the Medicare Advantage Program. I offered an amendment \nduring the Finance Committee markup to protect extra benefits currently \nenjoyed by Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. Unfortunately, that \namendment was defeated.\n  Bottom line, the President's pledge assuring Americans they would not \nlose benefits was not met by the Finance Committee bill. Here is how \nsupporters of the Finance bill justified it: The extra benefits that \nwould be cut--such as vision care, dental care, reduced hospital \ndeductibles, lower copayments, and premiums--were not statutory \nbenefits offered in the Medicare fee-for-service program; therefore, \nthose extra benefits do not count. I believe there is no logic to that \nposition.\n  Let me quote what our President said last Thursday about this \nimportant promise:\n\n       The first thing I want to make clear is that if you are \n     happy with the insurance plan that you have right now, if the \n     costs you're paying and the benefits you're getting are what \n     you want them to be, then you can keep offering that same \n     plan. Nobody will make you change it.\n\n  Quite frankly, when a promise such as that is made assuring Americans \nthey will not lose their benefits, that promise should be extended to \nMedicare Advantage beneficiaries. Congress is either going to protect \nexisting benefits or not. It is that simple. However, under the bill \nreported by the Senate Finance Committee, if you are a beneficiary \nparticipating in Medicare Advantage, that promise simply does not apply \nto you.\n  I am a staunch supporter of the Medicare Advantage Program. I served \non the Medicare Modernization Act House-Senate conference committee in \n2003, which created the program. Medicare Advantage works. \nMedicare+Choice and its predecessors did not.\n  I know it works. I represent a State where Medicare managed care \nplans could not exist due to low reimbursement rates. To address that \nconcern, Congress included language, which was signed into law, \nestablishing a payment floor for rural areas. But it was not enough. In \nfact, in Utah, all the Medicare+Choice plans eventually left because \nthey were operating in the red. This happened after promises were made \nthat Medicare+Choice plans would be reimbursed fairly and that all \nMedicare beneficiaries would have access to these plans.\n  So during the Medicare Modernization Act conference, we fixed the \nproblem. First, we renamed the program to Medicare Advantage. Second, \nwe increased reimbursement rates so all Medicare beneficiaries, \nregardless of where they lived--be it in Fillmore, UT, or New York \nCity--had choice in coverage. We did not want beneficiaries stuck with \na one-size-fits-all government plan.\n  Today, Medicare Advantage works. Every Medicare beneficiary has \naccess to a Medicare Advantage plan. Close to 90 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries participating in the program are satisfied with their \nhealth coverage. But that would all change should the health care \nreform legislation currently being considered becomes law.\n  Choice in coverage has made a difference in the lives of over 10 \nmillion individuals nationwide. The extra benefits I mentioned earlier \nare being portrayed as gym memberships as opposed to lower premiums, \ncopayments, and deductibles. To be clear, the SilverSneakers Program is \none that has made a difference in the lives of many seniors because it \nencourages them to get out of their homes and remain active. It has \nbeen helpful to those with serious weight issues and has been \ninvaluable to women suffering from osteoporosis and joint problems.\n  Additionally, these beneficiaries receive other services, such as \ncoordinated chronic care management, dental coverage, vision care, and \nhearing aids. Medicare Advantage is better for seniors than traditional \nMedicare because beneficiaries have a choice in coverage instead of a \none-size-fits-all health plan.\n  Another important point is, the House bill will affect Medicare \nAdvantage enrollees differently than the bill reported by the Senate \nFinance Committee. The Senate bill includes competitive bidding in the \nMedicare Advantage Program. My analysis of competitive bidding is that \nsome States will be hit harder than others, especially if there is not \na competitive market. I worry about what happens if only one plan \nsubmits a bid. While CBO believes Medicare beneficiaries will continue \nto enroll in the Medicare Advantage Program should competitive bidding \nbe implemented, fewer beneficiaries will enroll in the future.\n  In the House health reform bill, Medicare Advantage plans will be \npaid at 100 percent of the Medicare fee-for-service rate, which is fine \nfor Miami beneficiaries but will kill Medicare Advantage plans in rural \nparts of the country. Those beneficiaries living in States such as \nUtah, Montana, South Dakota, and North Dakota could be in serious \njeopardy because it is possible Medicare Advantage plans serving that \npart of the country could pull out due to low reimbursement rates.\n  CMS actuaries have estimated that more than 6 million Medicare \nAdvantage enrollees would be forced out of the program under the House \nbill, leaving only 4.7 million in Medicare Advantage by 2014. This does \nnot fulfill the President's goal that you can keep what you have. I \nbelieve it is unwise for Congress to take such a risk because, in the \nend, the Medicare beneficiaries will suffer the consequences.\n  I also wish to touch on the recent CMS guidance on how Medicare \nAdvantage plans may communicate with their beneficiaries. It is \ngratifying to know HHS will now allow plans to communicate with \nbeneficiaries once prior authorization is received from the plan \nenrollee.\n  To be frank, I was outraged by the actions taken by CMS in September. \nTo me, there is a fine line between freedom of speech and government \ninterference. I feel CMS may have crossed the line when it sent \nMedicare Advantage companies correspondence on this issue. While the \nnew guidance is an improvement, I am still concerned about the \nbeneficiary opt-in requirement.\n  Another issue that needs to be discussed is the removal of the open \nenrollment period for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. Prior to 2006, \nbeneficiaries could enroll and disenroll from Medicare Advantage plans \nat any time. This open marketplace allowed beneficiaries to find the \nplan best suited for them. The Medicare Modernization Act included a \ntransition to enrollment periods for Medicare Advantage plans to help \nbeneficiaries become comfortable with the program and to ensure that \nthe selected plan was the right plan for them.\n\n[[Page S11087]]\n\n  Today, there are two enrollment periods for most beneficiaries. \nFirst, the annual election period takes place between November 15 and \nDecember 31 each year. Changes take effect on January 1 of the \nfollowing year. During this time, beneficiaries may change prescription \ndrug plans, change Medicare Advantage plans, return to traditional \nMedicare or enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan for the first time.\n  Second, there is an open enrollment period from January 1 to March 31 \neach year. One Medicare Advantage-related selection may be made during \nthis timeframe, such as enrolling in a new plan, changing plans or \ndisenrolling from a plan. Coverage is then locked in until the \nfollowing December 31 for most beneficiaries.\n  The House health reform bill essentially eliminates the Open \nEnrollment Period for Medicare beneficiaries starting in 2011. In \naddition, the House bill proposes moving the annual election period up \n2 weeks, from November 1 to December 15, thus creating a 2-week \nprocessing period for enrollment--right around the holidays--before the \nJanuary 1 effective date. The Senate bill also moves up the annual \nelection period. It would take place from October 15 through December \n7.\n  The Senate bill does not eliminate the open enrollment period. \nHowever, it is important to note that while beneficiaries may disenroll \nfrom Medicare Advantage plans during the open enrollment period, they \nare not allowed to reenroll in another Medicare Advantage plan. \nTherefore, the only choice available to these beneficiaries under the \nSenate bill appears to be traditional Medicare.\n  I feel like little has been said about the dramatic impact these \nchanges will have on Medicare beneficiaries. The primary focus has been \nthe reductions to the program. When we wrote the Medicare Advantage \nprovisions in 2003, we viewed the open enrollment period as an \nimportant consumer protection for those who need flexibility when \nchoosing health coverage.\n  I am worried about the impact these little known changes will have on \nMedicare beneficiaries. I fear it could lead to a lot of confusion \namong seniors, especially when they are choosing their health care \nplans.\n  Another issue that troubles me is the fee on health insurance plans \nincluded in the Senate Finance Committee bill. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation, JCT, estimates that this provision will save $60 billion over \nthe next 10 years--$60 billion that comes from the health insurance \nindustry. It is no secret that these fees will be passed on to \nconsumers, including Medicare Advantage enrollees through premium \nincreases and the reduction of health care choices. Most seniors are on \na fixed income and are least capable of absorbing the added cost of \nthis burden. I strongly oppose this fee and will continue to fight \nagainst it when the Senate debates health care reform.\n  Finally, let me speak for a moment about the Nelson grandfathering \namendment that was included in the Senate Finance Committee bill. While \nmany Florida Medicare Advantage beneficiaries will not lose their \nbenefits due to this amendment, that provision does little to help \nMedicare Advantage beneficiaries living in rural parts of our country.\n  In fact, the grandfathering amendment approved during the Finance \nCommittee markup only helps Utah beneficiaries living in two--just \ntwo--counties. What happens to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries who \nlive in rural areas? I must conclude they will not be as lucky as the \nFloridian seniors. In my opinion, it does not make sense to only \ngrandfather the Medicare Advantage plans of certain seniors living in \ncertain States.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss \nissues associated with abortion coverage and conscience clause \nprotections for medical providers.\n  I am concerned about the bills before both the House and the Senate. \nI believe it is a real possibility Federal dollars will be used to \nfinance elective abortions through both the Federal subsidies to \npurchase health coverage and the new public plan created through the \nlegislation; that is, Federal taxpayers' dollars.\n  During both the HELP Committee and Finance Committee markups, we were \ntold over and over again the health reform bill would not cover \nelective abortions. We were assured Federal dollars would not finance \nabortions and that the Hyde-like language would apply. More \nspecifically, the Finance health bill attempts to segregate Federal \ndollars given to individuals to purchase health plans through the State \nexchanges. The reason these Federal funds would be segregated, we were \ntold, is so Federal taxpayers' dollars would supposedly not pay for \nabortion coverage.\n  Let me be clear. The provision included in both the Finance and HELP \nbills is not the way the Hyde language works today. For example, the \nMedicaid Program does not segregate dollars it receives either from the \nState or the Federal Government. Any Federal or State money received by \nthe Medicaid Program simply does not pay for elective abortions. There \nis no separation of funds. Should a person want abortion coverage, that \ncoverage is paid for separately, either by private dollars or State-\nonly money outside the Medicaid Program.\n  I think the way this needs to be resolved is simple: Hyde language, \nwhich, I wish to remind my colleagues, has been included in every \nappropriations bill that funds the Department of Health and Human \nServices since 1976, needs to be included in the legislation. The Hyde \nprovision is a specific prohibition on the use of any public funds for \nelective abortions and is enforced through strict accountability.\n\n  In addition, I am very worried about the government plan option that \nis included in both the House and the Senate health reform bills. The \ngovernment option is, of course, a Federal program, and therefore all \nof the money it spends is Federal funds. If the public or government \noption pays for abortions, then that is, without a doubt, Federal \nfunding using taxpayer dollars for abortion. Again, today Federal \ndollars may not be used to fund elective abortions. I believe the \nlanguage in the House and the Senate bills as currently written would \ninclude the coverage of elective abortions through this government \npublic plan. This must be addressed immediately. It is not fair to \nforce people who are totally opposed to elective abortions, either for \nreligious reasons, moral reasons, or whatever, to have their taxpayer \ndollars used to pay for these types of abortions.\n  I also do not understand why it is necessary to require all State \nexchanges to offer at least one plan with abortion coverage. I view \nthat as a mandate to cover elective abortions, and I wish to point out \nthat today there is not one Federal health plan that has such a \nrequirement.\n  In addition, I strongly support including protections in this \nlegislation to ensure health care providers are not required to perform \nabortions if they are opposed to abortions. It is unfair that these \nproviders who strongly oppose abortion should be forced to perform this \ntype of procedure. Why would we force Catholic hospitals, Catholic \ndoctors and nurses, and other people of similar religious beliefs on \nabortion to participate in something they believe is inherently evil \nand sinful and wrong? It does not make sense. We have always protected \nthe right of conscience. These bills do not.\n  It is also extremely important that State laws regulating abortion, \nsuch as those requiring parental consent or involvement or prohibiting \nlate-term abortions, for example, are protected and not preempted \nthrough this legislation. To me, it is unclear whether the current \nhealth care bills before Congress offer these protections.\n  Before I conclude, I wish to read a letter from the esteemed former \nSurgeon General, C. Everett Koop, dated November 2, 2009.\n  Mr. President, Dr. C. Everett Koop is one of the alltime great \nSurgeons General of the United States. Liberals and conservatives, \nmoderates and Independents, Democrats and Republicans would acknowledge \nthat. Here is what he says:\n\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Madam Speaker:\n       As the former Surgeon General of the United States, two \n     terms, from 1981 to 1989, I am writing to express my deep \n     personal concerns about the direction of the health care \n     reform bills currently being considered by the United States \n     Congress. More specifically, I am troubled about the \n     possibility of Federal dollars being used to pay for elective \n     abortions and Americans being forced to subsidize them. In \n     addition, I firmly believe\n\n[[Page S11088]]\n\n     that strong protections must be included in this legislation \n     so that health care providers are not forced to participate \n     in abortions against their will. Polls have recently shown an \n     increasing number of participants opposed to abortion.\n       It is essential that a Hyde-like abortion funding \n     restriction provision (like the amendment included in the \n     annual appropriations bill for the Department of Health and \n     Human Services since 1976) be included in any health care \n     bill that is signed into law.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I believe that including this legislative language is \n     necessary to ensure that elective abortions are not financed \n     either directly through a public plan or indirectly through \n     Federal subsidies provided to purchase health insurance \n     through State exchanges. I also find it troubling that the \n     legislation requires all State exchanges to offer at least \n     one health plan that includes abortion coverage--no other \n     Federal health plan has that specific requirement today.\n       As a physician, I also want to ensure that laws and \n     regulations remain intact, allowing health care providers to \n     exercise their consciences and not be forced to provide \n     services to which they have religious or moral objections. \n     Congress has a long history of protecting the conscience of \n     health care providers, first passing the Church Amendment in \n     1973.\n       Finally, I believe that it must be made clear through this \n     legislation that State laws are protected and not preempted \n     through this legislation, especially those that prohibit \n     abortion coverage. Since 2004, additional conscience \n     protections were included in the annual appropriations \n     legislation for the Department of Health and Human Services \n     to include health care entities such as hospitals, provider-\n     sponsored organizations, health maintenance organizations \n     (HMOs), health insurance plans, or any other kind of health \n     care facility, organization or plan. Today, virtually all \n     States have conscience law protections for medical providers.\n       From my first days as Surgeon General until today, I have \n     always been honest and straightforward with the American \n     people. Therefore, before this legislation becomes law, I \n     believe that the important issues outlined above must be \n     addressed so that it is consistent with current laws \n     regarding abortion coverage conscience protection. I would \n     appreciate your serious consideration of these matters before \n     this legislation is debated and approved by the Senate and \n     the House of Representatives.\n       Sincerely yours,\n       C. Everett Koop, M.D., ScD,\n       U.S. Surgeon General (1981-1989)\n\n  I believe Dr. Koop's letter says it all.\n  Again, both the Medicare Advantage Program and pro-life related \nissues are matters that I believe must be carefully addressed in this \nhealth care legislation. Medicare Advantage beneficiaries should be \nable to continue to be covered by the plan of their choice without \nlosing benefits, and the legislation needs to have specific and clear \nprovisions stating that no taxpayer dollars should be used to finance \nelective abortions. In addition, individual State pro-life laws must be \nprotected. Mandates that require abortion coverage should not be \nincluded in this bill. Finally, health care providers should not be \nforced to perform abortions against their will.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts with my colleagues \non these two very important issues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, do I need to ask for unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. CARPER. I so request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I go home almost every night. It is a lot \neasier to go home to Delaware than it is to Oregon every night, as the \nPresiding Officer knows. I love it because I get to really live among \nthe people I represent. I get up in the morning, go to the Y, work out, \njump on the 7:18 train, and come on down here and go to work with all \nof my colleagues and the staff. Almost everybody at home wants to talk \nabout, among other things, health care, and they want to find out what \nwe are doing and what we are not doing.\n  During the August recess, I did something I had never done before in \nterms of meeting with constituents. We did a couple of telephone \ntownhall meetings. I don't know if the Presiding Officer has done \nthose, but I had never done them before. I have done a lot of \ntraditional townhall meetings, but I went ahead and did one. Senator \nCorker from Tennessee told me he did a telephone townhall meeting in \nTennessee, and he said it went well and he thought I might want to \nconsider it as well.\n\n  I said: How many people were on the call?\n  He said: Fourteen hundred.\n  That is a lot of people.\n  Sure enough, we scheduled not one but two of them, one in August and \nthe other in early September before Labor Day.\n  When we had the first telephone town meeting, it was over after an \nhour or an hour and a half. I asked my staff: Any idea how many people \nwere on the call? They had 1,400 in Tennessee, a big State. In little \nDelaware, I thought maybe we might have 200, I don't know. They told me \nI had 4,000 people. Four thousand people. It really shocked me a lot.\n  About a week later, we had our second telephone townhall meeting, and \nthis was done in conjunction with AARP. It was not for the whole State, \njust AARP members in Delaware. So I knew we wouldn't have as many \npeople, but I thought we could have quite a few. When the second \ntelephone townhall meeting was over, done in conjunction with AARP, I \nsaid: How many people were on the call? They said 6,000--6,000 people. \nLittle Delaware, to have 4,000 one time and a week later have 6,000 \npeople in a telephone townhall meeting--I was blown away.\n  People were very polite, they asked good questions, and I tried to \ngive them good responses. We had hundreds of people who stayed on the \nline at the end of the conference call, if you will, to ask more \nquestions. We will do some more of those in the future, and we will do \ntraditional townhall meetings as well. But what I drew from that is \nthere are a whole lot of people who just had questions they wanted to \nhave answered. They were just confused and in some cases misinformed, \nand they wanted to have some straight talk--what we used to call it in \nthe Navy--just the straight skinny, the straight truth, just tell us \nthe story. We have tried to do that in the time since then.\n  About two or three weekends ago, I was getting gas for my minivan not \nfar from my house in Delaware, and I was standing there pumping the gas \ninto my Chrysler Town and Country minivan--listen to this: 236,000 \nmiles, and they say they don't build cars like they used to. We make \nthem better now.\n  Anyway, this lady pulled up on the other side and said: Senator \nCarper--just the person I have been looking for.\n  Sometimes when people say that, you think, maybe I should get back in \nthe minivan and drive away while I can still escape.\n  I said: What would you like to talk about?\n  She said: Let's talk about health care.\n  Pretty much it was: Why can't I have the kind of health care that you \nhave, the same health insurance for my family through my small business \nthat I run.\n  She said: We are paying about $24,000, $25,000 a year. What are you \npaying?\n  She wasn't belligerent or rude or anything.\n  I said: Well, as it turns out, we are paying about half that.\n  In my family, it is standard BlueCross BlueShield, and we have--the \nsecret to what we do, as the Presiding Officer knows, is we created \nhere, long before we came along, a very large purchasing pool that \nincludes all Federal employees, all Federal retirees and dependents. In \nall, it makes a huge purchasing pool of 8 million people in all. We \nhave the Federal Office of Personnel Management that gets a whole bunch \nof private health insurance companies to come in and offer their \nproducts to us, and we can choose from among those private plans. \nBecause there are so many of us, a lot of interest comes from wanting \nto offer the product to us. It helps drive down the cost because of the \ncompetition. With 8 million people in a purchasing pool, you can \nactually get pretty low administrative costs. It turns out our \nadministrative costs are 3 percent of premiums, which is very low.\n\n[[Page S11089]]\n\n  My guess is, the lady I was talking to that day at the service \nstation--I know she wasn't getting insurance through her small \nbusiness. She was a realtor. I know she wasn't getting it for 3 cents' \nadministrative costs on the dollar per premiums--probably not 23 cents, \nmaybe 33 cents.\n  She said: Why can't we have the kind of health insurance you have?\n  Actually, I like that. I would be happy to open it up and allow you \nand others in our State--small businesspeople, families, or individuals \nwho don't have coverage or who do--to buy your health insurance as part \nof a large purchasing pool. We will make it even bigger, and as a \nresult, maybe we will get better prices.\n  As it turned out, some of my colleagues on the left here in the \nSenate and some of my colleagues on the right aren't crazy about that \nidea. Folks on the left here say: If we do that, it will sort of take \nthe place of the public option; that will be the public option. Folks \non the right say: Well, that is too much like the public option. So \nboth sides are kind of against doing that. I still think it is a good \nidea.\n  What we are going to do is we are going to take the idea of a large \npurchasing pool and we are going to allow every State to create its own \npurchasing pool. We call them an exchange. We exchange. Each State can \nhave its own exchange.\n  Every State can enter into interstate compacts with other States and \ncreate compacts with other States. For example, I don't know if \nDelaware would create an interstate compact with the State of the \nPresiding Officer because it is on the other side of America. We may \nwant to do it with New Jersey or Pennsylvania or Maryland. We might \nwant to do it with Idaho or other States out West. What is interesting \nabout the interstate compacts is that States can create, under what has \nbeen reported out of the Finance Committee on which I serve, interstate \ncompacts between two or more States, and insurance can be sold in \nanother State, which would introduce competition, and that doesn't \nexist in a bunch of States.\n  In some States, just one or two insurance companies rule the roost \nand pretty much offer all the insurance. It is not very good for \ncompetition or affordability.\n  So what I want to do is make sure States have options to introduce \ncompetition. They can create interstate compacts across State lines, \ncreate regional exchanges and a larger purchasing pool, which would \ndrive down costs. Some of my colleagues want States to start health \ncare cooperatives, such as in Washington State, where there is an \noutfit called Group Health. The Presiding Officer is probably familiar \nwith that. Some States might want to do that. They seem to like that \nidea in Washington. Maybe that will work.\n  Some States have their own public plans. I think Minnesota is one. \nStates could set up their own public plan. That would be listed on the \nexchange as an option. States might want to open the State employees \nhealth benefit plan for State employees and pensioners and their \ndependents. That can be an option on the exchange.\n  The Senate will probably be prepared to offer a tax credit to lower \nincome folks. They can start with a low income and phase it out as the \nincome goes higher. That is an effort to help folks who need help in \naffording health insurance. They can let States choose from that menu \nwhen there are problems with lack of competition.\n  What do we do then? Are we going to have a national public plan in \nwhich everybody has to participate? Are we going to have a level \nplaying field? Senator Schumer has put a fair amount of time and \ninterest into exploring that. Are we going to have a national public \nplan with a level playing field, where the national plan doesn't have \nan advantage over those in the private sector? Should the States be \nable to opt out of this national plan? That is the proposal I think \nSenator Reid submitted to CBO to try to score and see what it would \ncost.\n  Should States have a right to opt into the national plan? There are a \nvariety of ideas. I think a number of centrists I have talked to are \ninterested, at the end of the day--if we have States where there is an \naffordability standard, and it is clear that affordability standard in \n1, 10, 20, or 30 States is not being met, there is lack of \naffordability and competition--should there be some other option? I \nthink parties are open to that.\n  There is probably a fair amount of concern over a couple of aspects \nof a public plan. One, who is going to run it? The government or the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services or the Department of Health and \nHuman Services? Should it be funded by the Federal Government beyond \nthe startup? I think if we will work around the idea that States need \nto meet some affordability standard, and for those that don't, there \nmight be the opportunity to create another option for those States, \nmaybe an option involving a national nonprofit board, and without \ngovernment funding--at least not beyond the beginning of the startup, I \nthink there is a center of gravity there that might provide a path \nforward for some of my colleagues, particularly the moderates.\n  In terms of government-run, government-funded, I think that can be \naddressed by having a national nonprofit board appointed by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate. They would have to retain \nfunding after the startup and create their own reserve fund so that if \nthe plan runs afoul or gets into financial difficulty, they would have \na reserve fund to be able to meet that. I just wanted to lay that out. \nThat is a place where we might find common ground.\n  There has been discussion in the last hour about cutting Medicare. I \nam not interested in that. I don't know any Democrat or Republican who \nis interested in doing that. The legislation I am most familiar with, \nreported out of the Finance Committee, doesn't cut Medicare benefits. \nIn fact, we add some benefits. One is, under Medicare, people only get \none lifetime only physical--just one--when they sign up for Medicare. \nIf they don't take advantage of it then, they don't get it. Most people \ntry to get an annual physical.\n  One of the changes that we make in our legislation that I hope will \nbe in whatever we finally pass is that every year, a Medicare patient \nwould be eligible for a physical. That is good preventive medicine. You \ncan catch problems early rather than wait until it is too late.\n  Some people are familiar with the Medicare prescription drug program. \nThey know when people exceed $2,500, up to about $5,500, for the most \npart, if their drug costs are in that range, almost all of the costs \nare borne by the senior citizens unless they are very low income. Then \nMedicare picks it up.\n  One of the principles in our legislation that I hope will be \navailable is that the pharmaceutical industry said they are going to \nput up about $80 billion, a lot of which will be used for filling the \ndoughnut hole to cut in half people's out-of-pocket expenses, when they \nwould otherwise be called upon to pay for prescription drugs. We want \nto make sure people, No. 1--if there are pharmaceutical companies out \nthere that will help--can find out about it, use it, and they can \nafford it. In the legislation reported out of our committee, I think we \ndramatically increase the likelihood that people will be helped by the \npharmaceutical industry.\n  In terms of reducing spending out of Medicare, we can go out and \nidentify--not just identify waste, fraud, and abuse, but identify it \nand quantify it, and we can go out and get the money back. We call that \npostaudit cost recovery. Last year, about $700 million was recovered in \n1 year in these postaudit cost recoveries in just three States. What we \nneed to do this year, and what we are going to do, is go to all 50 \nStates and do postaudit cost recovery for Medicare. The money will go \nback to the trust fund. If we can gather $700 million in just three \nStates, we can do a lot more than that in all 50 States. Those are the \nkinds of things we are going to do.\n  If folks were going to simply cut Medicare services and benefits, I \nam not aware of that in the legislation. I don't think that is the \ncase.\n  I have one or two other points, and I will close. I had the \nopportunity to visit a place called the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, \nOH, a month or two ago. I went to find out how are they able to provide \nbetter health care and better outcomes for less money and to see if \nthere is a lesson we can take from\n\n[[Page S11090]]\n\nthem and from the Mayo Clinic and from Geisinger up in Pennsylvania--\nwhat lessons can we take from those places--all nonprofits--where all \nthe doctors are on salary, where they focus on primary care and \nprevention and wellness, and where they focus on coordinating care \namong physicians and other providers within their units, and where the \nmedical malpractice coverage is paid for by the Mayo Clinic and the \nCleveland Clinic, not the individual physicians, and where all the \npatients have electronic health records.\n  If you look at all those nonprofits I have mentioned, including the \nMayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Geisinger, and Kaiser in California, \nthey are all pretty much the same. I think one of the things we sought \nto do in our legislation is infuse that delivery system, change that \nand infuse that into our system for health care and, frankly, learn \nfrom what works--look to see what works and act on that.\n  Lastly, we will have the opportunity, after the legislation is merged \ntogether and the products from several committees, including the HELP \nCommittee--but after the products of the two principal committees in \nthe Senate have been merged and that has been submitted by our majority \nleader to the CBO, they will come back and say whether the legislation \nincreases the budget deficit and whether the legislation can be \nexpected to rein in the growth of health care costs. We will find out \nthe answers to the questions, hopefully, in a week or two.\n\n  The President said, and I have heard others say:\n\n       I am not going to sign legislation that increase the \n     deficit by a dime, now or later.\n\n  I have said that I am not going to vote for legislation that \nincreases the budget deficit now or later. The version of the health \nbill that we reported out of the Finance Committee over the next 10 \nyears will reduce the deficit by $80 billion and the second 10 years by \n$400 billion to $800 billion. That is what we need to do.\n  At the end of the day, I think it is paramount for us to extend \ncoverage to people who don't have it--40 million plus. About 14,000 \npeople who woke up today with health insurance will not wake up \ntomorrow and have it. We pay way more for health insurance than anybody \nelse, without better results. Some are going out of business. GM and \nChrysler, who had a presence in my State, are bankrupt, and a lot of \ntheir trouble was because of enormous growth in health care costs.\n  One of the most important things we can do in health care reform this \nyear is rein in the growth in health care costs. The idea that health \ncare costs continue to go up two or three times the rate of inflation \nis not acceptable. The idea that we pay 1\\1/2\\ times more for health \ncoverage than any other nation in the world is not sustainable. The \nidea that we don't get better results--actually, we get worse results--\nis unacceptable also.\n  Lastly, a lot of times we say: What responsibility do people have for \ntheir own health? Is there some way we can get people to take better \ncare of themselves? As a population, we are overweight and, in many \ncases, obese. We have high blood pressure, and we have high levels of \ncholesterol. People suffer from hypertension. We smoke too much, and we \neat the wrong foods, and too much of the wrong foods. We don't \nexercise. There are a couple of companies around the country where they \nhave employee-provided health insurance to sort of self-insure. Some \nare encouraging us to allow them to do more in terms of reducing the \npremiums of people who basically do the right things. We have all heard \nabout the company called Safeway, a grocery store chain headquartered \nin California. There are other companies, such as Pitney-Bowes and \nDelta, that have figured that out, and they have started to invite \ntheir employees to voluntarily enter into programs to stop smoking. If \nthey do that, they can earn premium reductions. If they lose weight, \nthey can reduce their premiums.\n  One of our colleagues, Senator Ensign, and I offered legislation, \nadopted in the HELP and Finance Committees, that says that individuals \ncan reduce premiums by as much as 30 percent if they are doing things \nthat will help reduce their exposure and costs to their company through \nthe health plan. For example, at Safeway, if people stop smoking, they \nreduce their premiums by $400. If people lose 10 percent of their body \nmass, if they are overweight, there will be roughly another $400 \nreduction in their premium.\n  The idea is not just for people to say: I know I am overweight, and I \nneed to exercise. So they get a gym membership, but then they stop \ngoing. Or they will walk every other day and maybe on weekends, or they \nwill go on a diet and stay on it for a while, or they will stop smoking \nand then they start smoking again. That is kind of human nature, with \nall these temptations. Unfortunately, a lot of them lead to worse \nhealth outcomes for individuals. We want people to take better care of \nthemselves. That should be in this legislation.\n  Lastly, at the Cleveland Clinic, they talked to us about defensive \nmedicine, the fee-for-service delivery system where we incentivize \ndoctors to do more of everything--more visits, procedures, tests, more \nof this and that because when they do those they--they--No. 1, may \nprovide a better health outcome; No. 2, they make more money; and, No. \n3, they reduce the likelihood that they will be successfully sued.\n  We don't have jurisdiction in the Finance Committee over medical \nmalpractice. That is under the jurisdiction of the States. What we do \nwant to do when we come to the Senate floor, my colleagues, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, is to robustly test what is being done in \nStates to, No. 1, reduce the incidence of illness with defensive \nmedicine, reduce the incidence of medical malpractice lawsuits, and do \nso in a way that will encourage better outcomes; to take good ideas \nlike what works in a company in Michigan or the idea of health courts, \nthe idea of safe harbors where doctors who provide medicine basically \nunder best medical practices and best practiced guidelines, maybe give \nthem a safe harbor from lawsuits.\n  We can test a couple of these caps--a $250,000 cap or maybe a sliding \nscale cap on noneconomic. Ohio goes from $250,000 to $1 million. We can \ntest those and see do they work? The certification programs, such as in \nDelaware, if my doctor performs a procedure on me, and I am not happy \nwith the outcome, I have to go through a panel of knowledgeable people. \nIf they say I don't have a case, basically I don't do it.\n  Those are the kinds of things we want to have the opportunity to \nexplore, find out what is working in the States and other States to \nlearn from it. Those are the kinds of things we will have a chance to \ndebate on this floor in the next couple of weeks and in the end \nhopefully provide better insurance, a better outcome for less money, \nand use the savings to extend coverage to people who do not have it. \nThat is what we are trying to do.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona for his patience and for allowing \nme to finish my statement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I always enjoy hearing the words of wisdom \nof my friend and colleague from Delaware.\n\n\n             30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HOSTAGE CRISIS IN IRAN\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today we mark a painful anniversary for \nour country--the day, 30 years ago, when America's Embassy in Iran was \nviolently seized and an institution of diplomacy became a prison for \ndozens of peaceful servants of this Nation. For 444 days, the United \nStates and the world watched and feared for the safety of our citizens. \nEight brave Americans lost their lives trying to rescue our diplomats. \nAnd after so many days of dread, anguish, and heartbreak, we all felt a \ngreat weight lifted when our fellow citizens were returned home safely \nto their friends and families.\n  Today we express our deepest gratitude to those Americans taken \nhostage in Iran 30 years ago and to those who died to save them. They \nall gave more for our country than should be asked of any public \nservant, and we thank them for it.\n  Today, however, we are also mindful that the pain and suffering that \nbegan on November 4, 1979, did not end after only 444 days. For the \npeople of Iran, that hardship continued for 30 more years, and it \ncontinues to this day.\n  Iran is a great nation, and the Iranian people are the stewards of a \nproud and accomplished civilization.\n\n[[Page S11091]]\n\nThroughout their nation's history, Iranians have made spectacular \ncontributions to the arts and sciences, to literature and learning. \nThese achievements have not only benefited Iran, they have added to the \ndevelopment and enrichment of all mankind. So it is with profound \nsadness that we think today of all the potential of the Iranian people \nthat has been suppressed and squandered over the past 30 years by the \nrulers in Tehran.\n  I know that the Iranian Government is singing the praises of their \nrevolution today. But Iranians are not fools. They know what the real \nlegacy of the past 30 years is. Iranians know that the government in \nTehran has ruined their nation's economy and kept them isolated from \nthe promise of trading and engaging with the world.\n  Iranians are right to ask how much better off they would be if all of \nthe money--the billions and billions of dollars--that Iran's rulers \nhave spent sponsoring terrorist groups, tyrannizing their people, and \nbuilding weapons to threaten the world were instead devoted to creating \njobs, educating young people, and caring for the sick.\n  Iranians are right to wonder why a country so blessed with natural \nresources cannot meet the basic needs of so many of its own citizens. \nAnd yet corrupt members of the ruling elite are stuffing the wealth of \ntheir nation into their own pockets.\n  The rulers in Iran seized power 30 years ago, promising justice and \nbetter lives for all. But now they throw innocent Iranians in prison \nwithout proper trials. They mistreat and torture Iranians in jail. They \nbeat and murder Iranians in the streets for trying to speak freely and \nexercise their basic human rights.\n  The world watched in horror as Iran's rulers inflicted all of this \nabuse and more upon peaceful Iranian protesters after the flawed \nelections last June. But the world also watched in awe as courageous \nIranians risked everything for freedom and justice.\n  We Americans reflect with sympathy on Iran's continuing struggle for \nhuman dignity and human rights. Our country seeks a relationship of \npeace and prosperity with Iran, and it is incredibly unfortunate that \nthe Iranian Government seems determined to keep the relationship \nbetween our two countries mired in the past by funding and arming \nviolent groups that threaten our citizens and our allies, by building a \nnuclear weapons program in violation of Iran's own agreements and \nmultiple U.N. Security Council resolutions, and by spurning repeated \nAmerican efforts to reach out respectfully to resolve our differences \nin peace. The United States of America has no eternal enemies. We can \novercome even the most painful parts of our own history, as we are \ndoing now with countries such as Vietnam.\n  So today, on this solemn anniversary of the hostage crisis in Iran, \nwe honor our fellow Americans whose lives were forever altered by that \ntragic day. But we also look forward to a new day, a better day when \nthe long nightmare of the Iranian people is over and when our two \nnations share a relationship of mutual security, mutual respect, and \nmutual advantage.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes, if I can, to \nexpress my thanks first to Majority Leader Reid and the leadership team \nfor all they have done to bring us to a final vote later this evening \non the effort to extend unemployment insurance to jobless Americans as \nwell as to provide tax credits for homebuyers and allow more businesses \nto utilize the net operating loss carry back. I thank the leadership \nfor it.\n  I want to also thank Senator Baucus, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, who was responsible for putting this all together, and his \nstaff who worked very hard. I presume they did so in conjunction with \nSenator Grassley, the ranking member of that committee. I know it took \nsome time. I regret it took as long as it did to get the extension of \nunemployment insurance.\n  As I am sure Members have heard over the last few weeks, every day we \ndelayed in providing some relief to people who have lost their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own, 7,000 people were losing their \nunemployment insurance. Again, all of us know people within our \ncommunities, our neighborhoods, and our States who have lost their jobs \nas a result of the tremendous downturn in our economy. These people are \ntrying to pay mortgages, literally put food on the table and provide \nfor their families. Unemployment insurance has been absolutely critical \nover the years. This is not the first time, obviously, we have had an \nextension. It has traditionally been a bipartisan effort. Republican \nand Democratic administrations have agreed to provide these extensions. \nThis one, unfortunately, took too long, in my view, to put in place, \ngiven the depth of this recession, given the fact that so many people \nhave now fallen outside of the employment picture.\n  I know the numbers people talked about are anywhere from 8 to 15 \npercent unemployment rates, depending upon where you live. I don't \nthink those numbers are anywhere near close to reflecting what is going \non. If you asked me candidly what the unemployment rate is in this \ncountry, I think it hovers closer to 20 percent since an awful lot of \npeople are so discouraged they have stopped looking because the economy \nhas been that bad. So this extension of benefits is absolutely \nessential.\n  But extending unemployment benefits means in effect there is simply \nnot enough job creation in the economy. That gets me to the second part \nof this bill and that is the homebuyer's tax credit.\n  I see my friend from Georgia who has arrived on the floor. It is \nperfect timing, because I was about to talk about him. He was the \nprincipal author a number of months ago of the first-time home buyer \ntax credit that was included as part of the Recovery Act. That \nprovision authored by Johnny Isakson of Georgia which I was pleased to \nsupport has been used by almost 2 million people.\n  That provision is about to run out by the end of this month. As a \nresult of his efforts these past few weeks--and I am pleased once more \nto be his partner in this effort--we have been able to extend that \nbenefit to the first-time home buyer. But we have done something beyond \nthat, which Johnny Isakson has talked about over the many weeks he and \nI have talked and that is to expand it to the move-up buyer. That is \nthat person who literally moves up from the house they are in to that \nnew house. That family may have grown--a couple of additional \nchildren--and they are able to move up into that next category. This \nbill now provides not only the benefit to the first-time home buyer but \nto that move-up home buyer as well. 70 percent of existing homeowners \ntoday can potentially qualify for this move-up buyer credit. That is \ngoing to be a tremendous benefit, in my view.\n  The credit is still $8,000 for the first-time home buyer, but now \nmove-up buyers can claim a credit up to $6,500. You have to have an \nincome, if you are a single person, of $125,000 or less; if you are \njoint filers, $225,000 or less. There is a cap on the home price of \n$800,000 or less. Move-up buyers have to have lived in their current \nhome for at least 5 years. And all home buyers, first-time or move-up, \nhave to be prepared to stay in their new home for 3 years. This credit \ncannot be used by investors. We also included a lot of anti-fraud \nprovisions.\n  Again, I am confident my friend from Georgia has made this point: The \nfirst-time buyer traditionally is someone who has saved just enough to \nget into that first home. As I think Senator Isakson said, they are \nprobably sleeping on futons and eating a lot of Lean Cuisine or other \nthings just to survive in that new house. They are so excited to be in \nthere, and sacrificed tremendously to get into that first home they \ndreamed about having.\n  The move-up buyer is more inclined and capable of buying that \nfurniture, maybe building a porch, putting a garage on, a new roof on \nthe house and generally making improvements. So the ripple effect \neconomically from that move-up buyer is going to be a real benefit. The \nfirst-time home buyer obviously helps, but being able to actually make \nthose kinds of investments I\n\n[[Page S11092]]\n\nthink is going to be help create jobs in this country. It is not going \nto solve all our problems, but it is going to help get people working \nagain: the home builders, employees at home improvement and hardware \nstores, landscapers, contractors, people in the real estate business, \nthose kinds of jobs that can make a difference. So I am pleased we are \nextending unemployment insurance, but I am also very pleased we are \ndoing this on the homebuyer tax credit because it does provide some \neconomic lift in the country at a time when we desperately need to \nrestore confidence and optimism.\n  We have a way to go, obviously, before we start feeling that level of \nconfidence and optimism that was present before the current downturn. \nBut in most recessions our country has been in, real estate has been at \nthe heart of it, and the recoveries from our recessions have been led \nby the real estate sector of our economy. If this recession is typical \nof other recessions, real estate will help our economy to come out of \nthis downturn. It is not the only factor but it is a major factor in \nrecovery. This extension will run to next spring, at a critical time of \nreal estate sales in our Nation.\n  I can't begin to thank my colleague from Georgia enough for his \ntireless efforts in this arena. This is how it ought to be, by the way. \nThis is the way we are supposed to do business around here, where we \ncome together, listen to each other's ideas, and then try to work it so \nour colleagues will appreciate the effort that has been made and try to \nmake a difference in our country.\n  I thank my friend from Georgia for his leadership once again on this \nissue. But for him, I don't think this would have happened. You can't \nalways say that about every bill. A lot of people were involved in this \nissue. But I would say to my colleagues, had it not been for Senator \nJohnny Isakson of Georgia, I don't think we would be where we are \ntoday. On behalf of my constituents in the State of Connecticut, your \nfirst-time home buyer provision, which I was pleased to join in, will \nlikely help 10,000 home owners in my State. I don't know what the \nnumber will be as a result of this provision, but it is going to make a \ndifference to families in Connecticut, so we thank the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for his many kind words. But as I said earlier today in a \nspeech--and this is important for everybody to know--had it not been \nfor his willingness to call the hearing 3 weeks ago in the Senate and \nbring in the professionals from around the country, including the head \nof HUD, Shaun Donovan, to talk about the application of this credit and \nits extension, I don't think the information necessary to bring us to \nthis point would have happened. So the Congress and the people who take \nadvantage of this are in no small measure indebted to Senator Dodd for \nthat leadership and, I might add, to Senator Baucus who helped us \ndefine the pay-for. This bill, including the UI, the loss carryback, \nand housing tax credit, has a net plus against the deficit, not a cost \nto the country. That is extremely important. We couldn't have done that \nwithout Senator Baucus.\n  Quite frankly, Majority Leader Harry Reid helped us to make this \nhappen as only he could do as majority leader of the Senate. While I \nappreciate very much the kind words of the Senator, it is true this has \nbeen a team effort and the captain of the team has been the chairman of \nthe Banking Committee who brought about the hearing and helped it \nhappen. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for that and tell the \nSenate we are about to do something meaningful for the U.S. economy, \nmeaningful for the U.S. homeowners. This bill in the end is a jobs \nbill.\n  My last point to the Senator from Connecticut that people also need \nto know is this is the last extension. The benefit of tax credits is \nwhen they have a finality, when they have a sunset, when there is a \nsense of urgency to take advantage. Now is the time. With that type of \nmomentum, the U.S. economy will come back because housing, which led us \ninto it, will help lead us out of it.\n  I am grateful to the Senator for his kind remarks.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague and, as I said earlier, I thank \nSenator Reid and Senator Baucus and their staffs as well for allowing \nus to come to this moment. It is a good day for our country.\n  I thank my colleague again, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over the past few days, this Senator and \nseveral other Senators have been coming to the floor, talking about \nvarious aspects of the health care reform bills the majority has \nbrought forward so far. Today I want to review the impact of these \nbills on Medicare beneficiaries.\n  First, this is the Senate Finance Committee bill. It would cut \nMedicare by about $470 billion over 10 years. The House version takes \nan even bigger bite out of Medicare. In that bill, Medicare is cut by \nabout $540 billion. That is more, obviously, than $\\1/2\\ trillion. Cuts \nof this magnitude are sure to hurt Medicare providers and threaten \nbeneficiaries' access to care.\n  Take a look at the cuts in these reform bills. It shows why there is \ngenuine concern that health care for Medicare beneficiaries will suffer \ngreatly because of health care reform. The proposed legislation \npermanently cuts all annual Medicare provider updates. Permanently, or \nanother way to say it, cuts them forever.\n  In addition, some providers, such as hospitals, home health agencies, \nand hospices, would face additional cuts over the next 10 years. These \npermanent cuts are supposed to reduce Medicare payments to account for \nincreases in productivity by health care providers.\n  Supporters of those productivity adjustments believe Medicare \ngenerally overpays providers. I wish they would ask providers in my \nState of Iowa. And they say this would happen because today's Medicare \npayments do not take into account productivity increases that might \nreduce the cost of providing care to beneficiaries.\n  However, this proposal for productivity adjustments is an extremely \nblunt instrument that will threaten beneficiary access to care. It is \nflawed in at least two ways. First, the productivity measure used to \ncut provider payments in the bill does not represent productivity for \nspecific types of providers, such as nursing homes. I mean, you would \nthink that if Medicare is going to reduce your payments to account for \nincreases in productivity, it would at least measure your specific \nproductivity, but that is not the case. Instead, these reform bills \nwould make the payment cuts based on measures of productivity for the \nentire economy. So if productivity in the economy grows because let's \nsay computer chips or any other products are made more efficiently, \nthen health care providers see their payments go down. Where is the \nconnection?\n  But there is a second major problem. This other problem is that the \nproductivity adjustment actually punishes providers for increases in \nproductivity. This policy says that when a provider is more productive, \nMedicare is going to take it all--100 percent of the productivity \nincrease. The provider does not even get to keep half of the financial \nbenefit for that increase in productivity. Where is the reward? \nConfiscating the entire productivity increase removes all of the \nincentives for providers to improve their productivity in the first \nplace. This is a typical government policy. If you do better, the \ngovernment wants its share. But here, the government not only takes its \nshare, it takes all of it.\n  These cuts are sure to impact health care for seniors. But I don't \nwant you to take my word for it, so I am going to go to one of those \nnonpartisan people in government. There are a lot of nonpartisan, very \nprofessional people in government. But now I refer to the Chief Actuary \nof the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. He recently \nidentified this threat to beneficiary access to care. He confirmed\n\n[[Page S11093]]\n\nthis in an October 21 memorandum analyzing the House bill. The House \nbill and the Senate Finance bill both propose the same types of \npermanent Medicare productivity cuts.\n  Here we have a chart referring to the Chief Actuary. Here is what \nMedicare's own Chief Actuary had to say about these productivity cuts. \nIn reference to those cuts, he wrote that:\n\n       The estimated savings . . . may be unrealistic.\n\n  In their own analysis of the House bill, Medicare's own Chief Actuary \nsays:\n\n       It is doubtful that many could improve their own \n     productivity to the degree achieved by the economy at large.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       We are not aware of any empirical evidence demonstrating \n     the medical community's ability to achieve productivity \n     improvements equal to those of the overall economy.\n\n  In fact, the Chief Actuary's conclusion is that it would be difficult \nfor providers to even remain profitable over time as Medicare payments \nfail to keep up with the costs of caring for beneficiaries.\n  So let's go back to this chart again. Ultimately, here is their \nconclusion: Providers that rely on Medicare might end their \nparticipation in Medicare, ``possibly jeopardizing access to care for \nbeneficiaries.''\n  Medicare's Chief Actuary confirms what I have been hearing from \nproviders back in my State of Iowa about these permanent productivity \npayment cuts.\n  Those providers are doing everything they can to be efficient and to \nbe innovative. They are doing everything they can to get the biggest \nbang out of every Medicare dollar they can. But assuming the level of \nproductivity assumed in these bills would be like getting blood out of \na stone.\n  These health reform bills will make it even harder for them to keep \ntheir doors open. Look at providers such as nursing homes and hospices. \nThey provide labor-intensive services. There are few gadgets or \nprocesses in these settings that will increase productivity. Nothing in \nthese settings replaces staff being at their bedside and providing \ncare.\n  So it is very incorrect to assume these providers will achieve levels \nof productivity like the rest of the economy, justifying those cuts \nthat these bills anticipate.\n  Let's look at other providers affected by these productivity \nadjustments, like ambulances. The Finance Committee bill would \npermanently cut payments for ambulance services beginning in 2011. It \nwould do this in spite of the fact that Congress enacts payment \nincreases to ambulances year after year. In fact, the Senate Finance \nbill extends the existing add-on payments for ambulance services for \nanother 2 years, until 2012, and then you know what, it turns right \naround and cuts them.\n  I have no quarrel with providing additional payments for ambulance \nservices because without them many ambulance providers would not \nsurvive. Well, what about this slight of hand? What is the impact? The \nbill proposes that we cut ambulance payments while we vote to increase \nthem. It is kind of like, I voted to cut before I voted to increase.\n  There is another proposal in the Senate bill that cuts Medicare, and \nnow I am talking about the Medicare Commission.\n  The pending insolvency of Medicare is a very serious problem, and \nCongress needs to stop kicking the can down the road when it comes to \nshoring up Medicare. We are nearing the end of that road.\n  This Medicare Commission is fatally flawed, and the risk of \nunintended consequences that will hurt seniors outweighs any benefits \nit might have. Not only will it be harder to find a doctor or hospital \nthat will see Medicare patients, you can also forget President Obama's \npromise about keeping what you have.\n  After all the promises about not cutting Medicare benefits, \nCongressional Democrats and the White House are using the Medicare \nCommission to take aim at the popular Medicare prescription drug \nbenefits and the Medicare Advantage Program. Under the Finance \nCommittee bill, this new Medicare Commission would be given explicit \nauthority to cut Federal subsidies for Medicare prescription drug \npremiums. Think about that. Today, that Federal subsidy pays for about \n75 percent of the premium for Medicare prescription drug coverage for \nseniors, but the Finance bill says: Cut that subsidy. It says: Raise \nPart D premiums for our seniors. That is right.\n  But again, do not take my word for it. On October 13, during the \nFinance Committee health reform markup, the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, CBO, was asked whether reducing the Part D \nsubsidy would raise premiums. So chart 2 here is what Dr. Elmendorf, \nthe Director of CBO, said: ``Yes . . . [reduced subsidies] would raise \nthe costs to beneficiaries.'' So this was clear confirmation that if \nthe Medicare Commission cuts payments to Medicare drug benefits, it \nwill cause Part D premiums for seniors and the disabled to go up.\n  At a time when the country is facing record unemployment and \nAmericans are struggling to keep up with increasing prescription drug \ncosts, these provisions will make these lifesaving prescription drugs \nmore expensive for beneficiaries. These are the kinds of things that \nget buried in a 2,000-page bill. When the other side does not \nunderstand why the American people are concerned about these huge \nbills, those are some of the reasons.\n  These health reform bills also propose to cut up to $170 billion from \nMedicare Advantage. In my home State of Iowa, these cuts will cause \nabout a 25-percent cut in the amount of money going to extra benefits \nfor 63,000 seniors who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage. That means \nfewer low-income Iowans will be getting the eyeglasses, hearing aids, \nand chronic care management they have come to rely upon.\n  Some health care providers, such as hospitals, got a special deal. \nThey are exempted from the Medicare Commission's payment cuts. That \nmeans other providers and programs, such as drug benefits for seniors \nand Medicare Advantage, will be bearing the brunt of payment cuts.\n  The Medicare Commission would also become a permanent program that \nCongress would, for practical purposes, be unable to undo. By making \nthe Commission a permanent program, it becomes part of the baseline in \nthe budget over the next decade, so it just goes on forever, sort of \nlike the Energizer bunny--it will just keep cutting and cutting and \ncutting. If Congress ever wants to shut off those cuts, then it will \nhave to offset the cost when of terminating this commission. That will \nmake it effectively impossible, and the damage will have been done.\n  These Medicare cuts will also only make things worse for \nbeneficiaries in rural areas. Seniors in rural areas already face \nhealth care access problems. Medicare generally pays rural providers \nless than those in urban areas. Cuts of this magnitude will make it \nmuch harder for rural Medicare providers to care for beneficiaries.\n  But believe it or not, it only gets worse. My colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle intend to create a government-run health plan. If \nthis government plan pays providers based on already low Medicare \nrates, it is only going to make this whole situation with access and \nkeeping hospitals open much worse.\n  These Medicare cuts are achieved at the expense of health care access \nand quality. These Medicare cuts turn a blind eye to threats to health \ncare quality and access. There are no fail-safes in these bills that \nkick in automatically if these drastic cuts cause limited provider \naccess or worse quality of care. Instead, Congress will have to step \nin.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has already projected that these \nMedicare cuts keep increasing by--can you believe it?--the cuts will \nkeep increasing 10 to 15 percent each year over the next decade, so 15 \npercent even beyond the year 2019. And provisions such as these \nproductivity adjustments and the Medicare Commission would drive the \nincreased cuts to the program.\n  So this will give you an idea of the damage these bills will do to \nhealth care, particularly for seniors. This is an example of the \nchallenge Congress will face in the next decade if these bills become \nlaw. And this is just what we know about these bills we see. Who knows \nwhat is being cooked up behind closed doors right now.\n  Once again, it is time to back up this process. It is headed in the \nwrong direction. A bill of this magnitude should\n\n[[Page S11094]]\n\nbe done on a bipartisan basis with broad support. We can get it done \nright, if we work together. These bills have massive Medicare cuts. \nThey will do permanent damage to our health care system--higher \nprescription drug premiums for seniors, increased costs, jeopardized \naccess for beneficiaries. These bills are taking us in the wrong \ndirection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a couple weeks ago, I was on an airplane. \nThe passenger sitting next to me had on a pair of sweatpants and looked \npretty relaxed. I asked him where he was going. He said: I am dressed \nthis way because I am going to Thailand, then going to Singapore, and \nthen going to China. He said: I have a 24-hour flight ahead of me so I \ndressed pretty casually. I said: What are you going to do in Thailand, \nSingapore, and China? He said: I work for a company, and we have a lot \nof smaller companies that provide parts to us. We want those smaller \ncompanies to move those parts jobs to Thailand and Singapore and China \nso it costs us less to purchase parts. I am going to these three \ncountries in order to see if we can offshore these jobs from companies \nwe purchase from.\n  I was thinking about that as I sat there talking to him. I was \nthinking, there are likely hundreds of employees someplace going to \nwork today not knowing he is on an airplane going over to Asia to see \nif he can get rid of their jobs and move them to Asia so they can pay \njust a fraction of the price.\n  So it goes, day after day after day. It happened to be someone I sat \nnext to on an airplane. This is about jobs then. It is about American \njobs. I am thinking, as we are talking, we have lost 7.6 million jobs \nsince the recession began; 7.6 million people had to come home and tell \ntheir family: I have lost my job, not because I am a bad worker, I lost \nmy job because they are cutting back. Most of that is because of the \nrecession. But going into the recession and even now coming out of the \nrecession, when we still have most of those folks looking for work, we \nstill have people getting on airplanes, finding ways to move American \njobs overseas.\n  When you think about where we are and what our agenda needs to be in \nthe Congress and in the country, jobs have to be right at the top. How \ndo you put people back to work? How do you get the economic engine \nstarted? How do you stop the hemorrhaging of jobs to China, where you \ncan find somebody to work for 50 cents an hour, working 12 or 14 hours \na day, 7 days a week. The agenda has to have jobs and economic recovery \nright at the top, putting people back to work, getting the economic \nengine started.\n  Our agenda, of course, includes health care and climate change. I am \nthe first to attest to the importance of both. Health care is a very \nimportant subject. The relentless climb of increasing costs year after \nyear after year means families take a look at their bill and wonder: \nHow on Earth can I pay the bill--it is 10, 12, 14 percent higher than \nlast year--in order to provide insurance for my family? I can't drop \nthe insurance. Yet I can't afford to pay for it either. Businesses--\nsmall, medium, and large--are trying to figure out how to pay the \nincreased cost. That is certainly important.\n  Climate change and global warming are both important, no question \nabout that. We are going to have a lower carbon future, and we need to \nfind ways to address it.\n  But the most important agenda, while standing in a very deep economic \nhole, the deepest hole since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the \nmost important part of that agenda is trying to put people back to \nwork, restarting the economic engine and putting people back to work \nwith good jobs that pay well. That is what makes everything else \npossible. It is the menu and the success that has lifted so many people \nout of poverty, expanded the middle class in a manner that almost no \none else was able to do. It is the way we succeed in this country, \neconomic expansion and opportunity for the American worker.\n  While I think health care and climate change are important, my agenda \nis to put jobs right at the top, to try to understand we are in the \ndeepest recession--or have been--since the Great Depression. The third \nquarter numbers of this year suggest there has been economic growth. \nBut economic growth of GDP does not relate to people going back onto \npayrolls. For example, 263,000 people lost their jobs last month. That \nrelates to the 7.6 million people total who have lost their jobs since \nthe recession began.\n  The first priority is to start the economic engine, do the things \nthat put together the policies that begin to start this big American \neconomic engine again, get the economy back on track and create those \njobs again.\n  I have indicated often that I taught a bit of economics in college. \nWhen I would teach the supply-and-demand curve and all the other things \none teaches in economics, I used to say, by far, much more important \nthan anything else in this book is to understand the American economy \nexpands as a result of confidence. When people are confident about the \nfuture and they feel that confidence, they do the things that manifest \nconfidence. They buy a suit, a car, a house. They take a trip. In other \nwords, they are confident about their future. They are feeling good. \nThey do the things that expand the economy. That is all about \nconfidence. When they are confident and do the things that expand the \neconomy, people work. The economy begins to hum along and the country \ndoes very well.\n  When they are not confident about the future, exactly the opposite \nhappens. We have economic contraction. People don't buy the suit, the \ncar, the home. They don't take a trip. We contract the economy. \nConfidence is at the root of progress. The question is, Standing in \nthis deep economic hole, how do we restore confidence? How do we do \nthat?\n  This President has only been in office 10 months. He inherited the \nbiggest economic mess anybody has inherited since the Great Depression. \nThat is a fact. We have a lot of people who want to blame the new \nadministration for all the economic ills of the country. This President \ninherited the biggest economic mess any President has ever inherited \nsince the 1930s. What do we do to restore confidence and what do we do \nto address this issue of the economy?\n  In my judgment, we do three things. One is financial reform. It seems \nto me the financial system went completely awry, and we had a carnival \nof greed, an atmosphere of anything goes, unbelievable gambling going \non--they could have put a casino table in the lobby of some of the \nbiggest banks in the country--the development of new financial \nengineering, things such as credit default swaps and CDOs, you name it. \nThese folks steered this country's economy right into the ditch. If \nthat is the case--and I believe it is--the first step to restore \nconfidence is to reform the financial system to say this cannot happen \nagain. We will not allow it. We have to fix it.\n  Fifteen years ago, I wrote the cover story for the Washington monthly \nmagazine called Very Risky Business, in which I described even then \nthat FDIC-insured financial institutions--financial institutions \nguaranteed by the Federal Government and the taxpayer, therefore--were \ntrading on their own proprietary accounts and derivatives. I said then \nthey might as well put a keno pit in the lobby of the bank. Fifteen \nyears later, of course, the whole thing collapsed. The center poll \nbroke, and the tent collapsed over all of it. Financial reform has to \nbe the first step in developing some confidence in the American people \nthat this will not happen again.\n  We need regulations. I know regulation is a four-letter word to some. \nIt is not to me. If ever there was a demonstration that we need \nregulations, it is this carnival of greed that happened in the last \ndecade or so, where we had regulators come to town who said: I intend \nto be woefully blind. I know I will get paid by the Federal Government. \nI know I am supposed to be a regulator, but I want to boast about not \nbeing able to watch. I want the market system to be whatever it is.\n  The fact is, this should demonstrate to us we need regulators who \nwill keep a watchful eye on the market system so they can call the \nfouls. We need referees. That is what regulators are for. When someone \ncommits a foul that injures the free market system, they\n\n[[Page S11095]]\n\nneed to blow the whistle. We need effective regulatory authority. That \nis No. 1.\n  No. 2, deal with the issues we know are inappropriate. Never should \nan FDIC-insured institution be trading on unbelievably risky \ninstruments on their own proprietary accounts. It is still going on \ntoday. We have to fix that.\n  No. 3, the issue of too big to fail. Have we not learned we can't \nhave institutions that grow too big to fail without it being no-fault \ncapitalism? I hear folks come and crow about the issue of the market \nsystem and free market capitalism. The fact is, when we have \ninstitutions that grow too big to fail, it means, when they steer the \ncountry into the ditch and they are about to go belly up, the American \ntaxpayer is told: It is time for you to take some action. We intend to \nhave you be a backstop for the biggest financial institutions in the \ncountry. We know they pay big bonuses. We know there are tens and tens \nof billions of dollars of bonuses being paid for failure, but we don't \nwant you to pay attention to that, the fact that they lost a lot of \nmoney and paid big bonuses. We still want you to bail them out because \nthey are too big to be allowed to fail.\n\n  This country should no longer allow that. At the very least, we have \nto address this question of too big to fail. That is no-fault \ncapitalism, and it should not be allowed to continue to exist. \nFinancial reform is essential to restore confidence by the American \npeople. That has to lead the list.\n  Second, the issue of fiscal policy and deficits. It is not irrelevant \nto understand we are running very large budget deficits that are \nunsustainable. It is relevant for this administration to point out that \nwhen you have a steep economic downturn, the deep recession we have \nexperienced, you have a dramatic loss of revenue coming into the \nFederal Government, hundreds of billions in lost revenue. You have a \nvery substantial amount of increased expenditures because there are \neconomic stabilizers, such as unemployment compensation and other \nthings, that when times are tough, they kick in and it costs more. So \nyou have less revenue and higher cost. The fact is, this administration \ninherited this unbelievable fiscal policy of deciding let's cut taxes \nfor the highest income Americans and then we will go to war and not ask \nanybody to pay for one penny of it. We will charge it all. We will \ncharge all of it for 8 years.\n  This country is in a big hole. The fact is, we can't allow that to be \na sustainable policy. We have to change it. The President knows it, so \ndoes the Congress.\n  If we are going to restore confidence by the American people in what \nwe are doing, there needs to be a plan to address these very large \nbudget deficits. We cannot continue to provide a level of government \nthe American people are either unwilling or unable to pay for. That is \na fact. In my judgment, with respect to this agenda of No. 1, financial \nreform; No. 2, addressing fiscal policy and deficits, we must develop \ntogether a plan to tame these Federal budget deficits and get this \nfiscal policy back on track. That is a fact.\n  While I am talking about it, let me also say budget deficits are \nunsustainable, especially in the outyears. I understand you run big \ndeficits in the middle of the deepest recession. Your revenue is down, \nexpenditures are up. I am talking about in the outyears. This is \nunsustainable, and we must come together on a plan to address it.\n  The other side of the deficit issue is the trade deficit. Trade \ndeficits are unbelievable. We also have to respond to the trade \ndeficits. That relates to what I had described about the fellow on the \nairplane going to move American jobs overseas. I have talked about this \non the floor, but this chart shows the trade deficits we face. You can \nmake a case on budget deficits that that is something we want to repay \nto ourselves. You can't make that case with trade deficits. These are \nmoneys we will have to repay to other countries. Last year we had an \n$800 billion merchandise trade deficit. This is an avalanche of red ink \nthat will have to be repaid. It weakens the country. This gets worse \nevery single year.\n  The most important part of that is the trade deficit with China. \nNearly one-third of this trade deficit is with China. This deficit \nincreases year after year after year after year.\n  I have told forever on the floor--and I will again, ever so briefly--\nthe story of Huffy bicycles. The first book I wrote, I wrote \nextensively about these products: Huffy bicycles; the little red \nwagons, the Radio Flyer; the Etch A Sketch--gone to China. They are all \nmade in China. Huffy bicycles were made in Ohio.\n  All those folks who made Huffy bicycles and were proud of their jobs \nthen lost their jobs. They all got fired. This bicycle still exists. \nYou can still buy it. It is made in China. The brand is owned by the \nChinese, and from $11 an hour in Ohio that was paid to workers making \nthe bicycle--$11 an hour--this job went to China, where they have paid \nthem 30 cents an hour, and have worked them 12 to 14 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week. The question is this: Should Americans be asked to compete \nwith that? Can they compete with that? The answer is: No, of course \nnot.\n  If I might show a couple other points about what causes these trade \ndeficits. As shown on this chart, 98 percent of the cars driven in \nSouth Korea are made in South Korea. Everybody understands why that is. \nSouth Korea wants it that way. They do not want American cars in South \nKorea, so virtually all the cars in South Korea are made in South \nKorea.\n  As shown on this chart, here is our bilateral automobile trade with \nSouth Korea. Last year, they sent us 730,000 cars to be sold in the \nUnited States. We were able to sell them 4,000 cars. Think of that: \n730,000 Korean cars put on ships to be sold in the United States, and \nwe were able to get 4,200 American cars into South Korea. It is going \nto be much worse with China, by the way.\n  My point is very simply, we have these giant trade deficits growing \nand growing and growing, combined with a fiscal policy deficit that is \nrecord high, and this is unsustainable. It is unsustainable. So we have \nto deal with financial reform, and we have to deal with deficits--\nfiscal policy deficits and trade deficits.\n  Then, finally, the issue is jobs. When I talk about restoring the \neconomic strength of this country, it means talking about: How do you \nput people back to work? It is interesting to me that the Wall Street \nfirms are reporting record profits, they are going to pay record \nbonuses, and so they have healed. They are all fine. It is just those \n7.6 million people who lost their jobs. They are still out there \nlooking for work, and they ought to be plenty angry about what is going \non. So the question is, How do we create jobs and keep jobs here? I \nwant to talk about that for a moment.\n  It seems to me the issue of job creation--my colleagues Senators \nWarner and Corker have an idea that I have embraced that makes a lot of \nsense, and that is, job creation in most cases is a result of small and \nmedium-sized businesses that have an idea and are running a business \nand putting people to work on Main Streets, and yet they are the very \nones that cannot get lending. You need lending when you are in \nbusiness. You need loan funds to finance your inventory and to expand, \nand so on. The very people who cannot get business loans are the very \nones who would be creating the jobs.\n  So this Congress, without my vote, voted for $700 billion in TARP \nfunds to provide a pillow and some aspirin and some soft landing for \nsome big financial firms in the country that ran the country's economy \ninto the ditch. My colleagues suggest--and I agree--that we probably \nought to convert just a portion of that--just a portion of that--to \ncreate a mechanism by which we would have a bank of small business \nloans that would be available to small and medium-sized businesses.\n  There is no excuse not to use some of those funds for the right \npurpose. If you believe they were appropriated for the wrong purpose--\nthat is to help out the biggest firms that steered us into the ditch--\nhow about helping out Main Street businesses that would create some \njobs?\n  Second, I think we ought to finally consider--and we have talked \nabout it for a long while--creating an infrastructure investment bank, \nand over a period of 30 years float the bonds that allow you to rebuild \nthe infrastructure in this country that will put massive numbers of \npeople back to work. We can do that. If you create it the right way \nwith an infrastructure investment\n\n[[Page S11096]]\n\nbank, you are not going to blow a hole in the Federal budget deficit, \nbut you are going to put a lot of people back to work.\n  The issue that has been used previously during chronic eras of \nunemployment, which I think we should consider, is the issue of the new \njobs tax credit. We did that in 1977 and 1978. The new jobs tax credit, \nit was reported, provided up to 2.1 million new jobs in this country. I \nthink we ought to consider that.\n  Finally, we ought to end the disincentive for creating jobs by \ngetting rid of these pernicious tax breaks that say: If you fire your \nworkers and lock your plant and ship the whole thing overseas, we will \ngive you a big fat tax break. Yes, that exists in tax law today. We \ncannot get it changed. It is outrageous, in my judgment. So let's \nprovide some incentives for people to hire employees in this country \nand end the disincentives by getting rid of tax breaks for those \ncompanies that ship their jobs out of the country.\n  There is a lot to do. I have described some big issues that, for me, \nwould represent the top of the agenda. I know that is not the agenda we \nare on at the moment, and I understand that the play gets called, and \nwe all run toward the same goalposts. But the facts is, this country, \nin my judgment, will not have the kind of economic recovery we need \nunless we put at the top of the agenda, as we move forward, the issue \nof financial reform, which my colleagues are working on in the Banking \nCommittee. It is urgent we get that done. In my judgment, that should \nhave been at the front of the agenda: the issue of fiscal policy, \ndeficits and trade policy deficits and, finally, the issue of jobs.\n  I want to mention that there is one additional issue that has been \nkicked around, and that is climate change. As I said when I started \nthis presentation, I do not think climate change is irrelevant at all. \nI think it is important. For me, it would not lead the set of issues \nthat would require us first to put the economy back on track.\n  But with respect to the issue of climate change and energy, part of \nhaving confidence in the future is also having some energy security. \nEnergy security and national security, in my judgment, go together in \nmany ways. Because if tomorrow, God forbid, we had an interruption in \nthe pipeline of oil that comes to this country, our economy would be \nflat on its back. About one-fourth of the 85 million barrels of oil \nthat are taken out of this planet every day, has to come into this \ncountry. We have a prodigious appetite for energy. But the problem is, \n70 percent of our nation's oil comes from other countries. Seventy \npercent of the oil we use comes from other countries.\n  We have a real energy security issue and we need to work hard to be \nless dependent on other countries--some of who do not like us very \nmuch--for the oil we need to run this American economy.\n  We wrote a bill about 4 months ago in the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, a bill that deals with all of the energy policies \nthat would make America more energy secure and provide greater national \nsecurity as a result. The Senate Energy Committee's bill, in my \njudgment, should be on the floor of the Senate before the climate \nchange bill. It does all the things in the matter of policy, that you \nwould do to address climate change.\n  The Senate Energy Committee's legislation maximizes the use of \nrenewable energy, so you can produce electricity where the wind blows, \nand the Sun shines, and move it through a modern transmission system to \nthe load centers where the energy is needed. The Senate Energy \nCommittee's bill does the building retrofits and efficiencies, which \nare the lowest hanging fruit in energy. For the first time in history, \nit establishes a renewable electricity standard of 15 percent. It opens \nup the Eastern Gulf for offshore oil and natural gas production.\n  The Senate Energy Committee's legislation does all of the things you \nwould do to take significant steps toward addressing climate change. \nThe bill maximizes the production of renewable energy--it moves in \nexactly the right direction. Retrofitting buildings--it does exactly \nthe right thing. The increase in the renewable electricity standard is \nexactly the right policy.\n  So I would say to those who are pushing very hard that we need to \nhave climate change on the floor of the Senate. The fact is, it is much \nmore important, in terms of public policy to move this country in the \nright direction, to bring the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee's bill on the floor. The Senate Energy Committee's bill \nincludes a whole series of investments to make coal development, which \nis the most abundant resource in this country, more compatible with our \nneed to address a lower carbon future.\n  Carbon capture and sequestration from coal development is very \nimportant. Carbon capture, beneficial use all of these investments \nrequire money, and we put some of that money in the Senate Energy \nCommittee's bill so we can continue to use that resource as well.\n\n  The Senate Energy Committee's bill makes sense and, in my judgment, \nit ought to have a priority to come to the floor of the Senate after \nfinancial reform and deficits and jobs. Because all of that, I think, \nis necessary to address the very serious economic questions that face \nAmericans.\n  Let me conclude by saying, I mentioned a few moments ago that we have \nthese very large Federal budget deficits, and I think it would be \nuseful to say that while there are expenditure cuts we should make--and \nthere are plenty I have suggested; I think we should tighten our \nbelts--there are other ways to begin to reduce the Federal budget \ndeficit; and that is, to ask those who are not paying their fair share \nto pay some.\n  I want to describe that by showing a chart. This is a chart from a \ncompany that is part of their financial report. But I am doing this \nonly to say this is a just a representation of many companies. But this \none says: The United States Government is this company's largest single \ncustomer. The government operates in segments and supplies nuclear \npower systems, and so on. We are active in government-sponsored \noperations and research.\n  All right. So who is this company? This is a company that decided, in \nfiling with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to say:\n\n       [The company] is a Panamanian corporation that has earned \n     all of its income outside of Panama.\n\n  It is not really a Panamanian corporation. Well, it is legally now. \nBut it used to be an American corporation that decided to do what is \ncalled an inversion; that means disavowing your U.S. citizenship and \nsaying, as a corporation: I don't want to be an American citizen \nanymore. I want to be a citizen of Panama. So that is what this company \ndid.\n  All right. We decided some while ago, if you want to decide not to be \nan American citizen, as a company, then do not tell us you want to keep \ndoing business with the American Government. The only reason you want \nto invert and get rid of your American citizenship is to avoid paying \nU.S. taxes. So we say, if you do not want to pay U.S. taxes--do you \nknow what?--you ought not get business from the Federal Government.\n  Well, this company did not like that so much. This company has 2007 \nrevenues that were sheltered now because they inverted to Panama--2007 \nrevenues--of $2.6 billion.\n  It has taken the government a little longer than it should have to \nshut off these companies that inverted from doing business with the \nFederal Government. But now we have an understanding that one of the \nFederal agencies quietly approached the Appropriations Committee and \nasked to insert a clause in an appropriations bill which says that the \ncontracting ban, which I have described, can only be administered \nconsistent with U.S. international trade agreements. That was done \nbecause there is discussion of a trade agreement with Panama, and so \nwith respect to the trade agreement with Panama, the contracting ban \nwould be limited to not affect this company that inverted to Panama.\n  Isn't that interesting. Actually, we have people in government trying \nto help the company get Federal business once again, despite the fact \nthat this company moved away to Panama as a legal address in order to \navoid paying U.S. taxes. And it is not just this company.\n  Some long while ago, probably 2 years ago, I brought to the floor of \nthe\n\n[[Page S11097]]\n\nSenate--and many of my colleagues have since used this--this picture. \nWhen you talk about everybody paying their fair share, this is a \npicture of a little four-story building on Church Street in the Cayman \nIslands. It is called the Ugland House. This is actually the original \nchart I used about 2 years ago. There was some enterprising reporting \nby a reporter named Evans from Bloomberg. Mr. Evans from Bloomberg \nactually did the reporting on this.\n  This little white building on Church Street in the Cayman Islands was \nhome to 12,748 corporations. They are not there. That is just a legal \naddress, a figment created by lawyers, to say, if you run your mail \nthrough a mailbox in this building, you can avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n  Isn't that wonderful? I think it is unpatriotic. It is going on all \nthe time. By the way, since I first used this chart, my understanding \nis, there are now not 12,000 corporations using this address; there are \n18,000 corporations. Isn't that unbelievable?\n  My point is, when you talk about the need for fiscal policy reform--\nyes, let's cut some spending; let's tighten our belts--let's also ask \nsome interests who decided they want all the benefits that America has \nto offer but they do not want to pay taxes, let's ask them to become \ntax-paying citizens, corporate tax-paying citizens once again. There is \na lot to do, and I am convinced we can do it if we have the priorities \nstraight.\n  Yesterday, it was interesting to me to hear that Warren Buffett \npurchased the Burlington Northern Railroad.\n  Berkshire Hathaway, the company owned by Warren Buffett, purchased \nBurlington Northern Railroad. He said he is betting on America. I know \nWarren Buffett. I have known him for years. I like him. He is a good \nguy. In fact, he is one of the smartest investors perhaps in the \nhistory of our country. He is betting on America. That is probably a \npretty good bet. I don't know the details of his purchase of this \nrailroad company, but it is probably a pretty good bet to bet on this \ncountry.\n  I mentioned previously that we had Warren Buffett to speak to our \ncaucus some while ago and somebody asked him the question: What do you \nthink the economy will be like in 6 months?\n  Warren Buffett said: I don't have the foggiest idea. That is not the \nway I think. I don't know what is going to happen 6 months from now or \n16 months from now, but I will tell you this: I know what the economy \nis going to be like 6 years from now. It is going to be great.\n  He said: America always pulls itself up. Look at the couple hundred \nyears of history, at the creativeness, the inventiveness, the ambition \nof the American people. It is just innate in the soul of the American \npeople and its culture to just keep moving forward.\n  He said: This country is going to do fine. I don't know whether it is \ngoing to be 7 or 10 or 15 months or 5 years, but, he said, I believe \nthis country is going to do well.\n  So I kind of smiled yesterday when I saw that he had purchased a \nrailroad and said: I am betting on America.\n  I think this Congress should bet on America too, but America needs \nsome help from this Congress. America needs a lot of help to deal with \nthe issues I have just described. I believe we can do that, but it is \nnot going to happen unless we have some cooperation. We have gotten \ncooperation on nothing. By the way, just for interest's sake, we are \nnow in this lengthy period, and we have had to burn 30 hours \npostcloture in 2 days, ripening cloture on everything, even on \nnoncontroversial things, because there are people who don't want this \ninstitution to work. It doesn't make any sense to me. There ought not \nbe two teams here; we all ought to be pulling for the same team.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise to state my support for \nthe extension of unemployment benefits that was included in H.R. 3548. \nRecent reports on gross domestic product by the Bureau of Economic \nAnalysis indicate that we are out of the recession. However, \nunemployment is a lagging indicator, and we will need to see more GDP \ngrowth before employers start hiring again. In the meantime, families \nin Missouri and across the country are hurting. The unemployment rate \nin Missouri is 9.5 percent. American Airlines announced just last week \nthat it would close its maintenance facility in Kansas City, and 490 \nworkers are losing their jobs.\n  I believe we have a responsibility and an obligation to help good, \nhard working Americans who are struggling in these difficult times. To \nthat end, the extension of unemployment benefits will provide a vital \nlifeline to people struggling to find work through one of the most \nsevere recessions in our lifetime, and I fully support it.\n  I also strongly support inclusion in this bill of the provisions from \nthe Service Members Homeownership Tax Act, which I introduced. These \nprovisions will ensure that our troops deployed overseas this year and \nnext will not be penalized for their service when they seek to buy \ntheir first homes. You cannot shop for a house while you are hunting \nal-Qaida in Afghanistan or supporting a diplomatic mission to NATO \nAllies, so it is only fair that service members have additional time to \ntake advantage of the first-time homebuyer tax credit. This bill will \ngive members of the armed, intelligence, and foreign services who were \nstationed abroad in 2009 or 2010 an additional year to qualify. It will \nalso eliminate the ``recapture'' requirement for servicemembers. Unlike \nother recipients, they will not have to pay the credit back if they \nmove within 3 years, as long as the relocation is service-related. \nFinally, Housing Assistance Program benefits that were expanded in the \nRecovery Act will be exempt from taxation. These temporary benefits are \nhelping cushion the financial blow to military families who are forced \nto sell their homes in the current, depressed market. Families who are \nreassigned or are relocating to seek treatment for service-related \ninjuries are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the program. I would \nnote that the cost of extending the first-time homebuyer tax credit for \nservicemembers will be less than one percent of a full extension of the \ncredit, and that the cost was fully offset in the bill I introduced.\n  Unfortunately, H.R. 3548 went further than only taking care of our \nmen and women in uniform. It also contains a fiscally irresponsible \nextension and expansion of the first-time homebuyer tax credit for many \nother Americans. I do not support this extension.\n  Congress created the first-time homebuyer credit last year as a \ntimely, targeted, and temporary response to the housing crisis, \ndesigned to reduce excess housing inventories by encouraging home \npurchases. Judging from home sales over the past few months, the credit \nhas helped stabilize the housing market. However, the Treasury \nInspector General for Tax Administration has found serious instances of \nfraud within the program, and economists have suggested that extending \nthe credit is not the most effective way of addressing the remaining \nproblems in the housing market. Now that we are out of crisis, it is \ntime to let the first-time homebuyer credit expire. We simply cannot \ncontinue to expand one-time programs from the stimulus and ever expect \nto return to a state of fiscal responsibility. If we say it is a one-\ntime program, it should be a one-time program.\n  In conclusion, I applaud the important, commonsense steps we have \ntaken for Americans looking for work and for military families. I am \ndisappointed that a broad extension of the first-time homebuyer credit \nwas included in this legislation. I would not have supported an \nextension of the credit independently. However, the positive elements \nof this bill outweigh the negative, and I support the overall \nbill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to express \nmy concern about a provision included in the unemployment compensation \nbill before the Senate.\n  The provision I am concerned about deals with a reversal of a sound \ninternational tax policy reform. Back in 2004, Congress passed and \nPresident Bush signed a major bipartisan business tax reform bill. The \ncenterpiece proposal in the international tax reform area was a \nrestoration of the Finance Committee position from the 1986 Tax Reform \nAct on the treatment of interest for the purposes of the foreign tax \ncredit.\n\n[[Page S11098]]\n\n  This reform, known as World Wide Interest Apportionment, was due to \ntake effect at the beginning of 2009, but its implementation was \ndelayed for 2 years in order to pay for housing legislation enacted in \nJuly of 2008. I expressed my concerns at the time about delaying sound \ninternational tax policy in order to fund new spending priorities. \nHowever, my view lost out and the delay of this provision was used as \nan offset.\n  Now, here we are again, in need of revenue offset in order to fund \nother priorities. The proposal in the bill before us delays this \nimportant reform an additional 7 years, until December 31, 2017. I \nsupport the main provisions of the bill intended to provide relief to \nthose struggling to find work by extending unemployment benefits and to \nprovide a lift to the economy by extending the homebuyer tax credit and \nthe expanded net operating loss carryback period for small businesses.\n  My opposition to this revenue offset rests in the bad tax policy this \nproposal represents. The interest allocation reform would, if allowed \nto take effect, lower the chance of double tax that arises under \ncurrent law from the artificial overallocation of interest expense to \nforeign income, even when the debt is incurred to fund domestic \ninvestment. The current rules actually penalize domestic manufacturers \nthat compete in global markets by making it more likely they will be \ndouble-taxed on their foreign income.\n  Several companies have spoken to my staff about the negative \nramifications this delay will have on them. Some of these companies are \njust starting to grow their businesses beyond the U.S. borders. The \ndelay of this important international reform will make it more costly \nfor these companies to expand into these markets. If these companies \ncannot grow beyond the domestic economy, they will be unable to compete \nin the global marketplace.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I received from \nJohn Deere explaining their concern about delaying the implementation \nof this provision be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Deere & Company,\n\n                                     Moline, IL, October 22, 2009.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Senate Finance Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Deere and Company would like to \n     reemphasize to you the importance of worldwide interest \n     allocation and our strong desire that implementation of this \n     provision not be further delayed by using the provision as a \n     ``pay for'' for other issues. Further continued delays in \n     implementing this provision will make U.S. companies less \n     competitive with our foreign competitors.\n       We ask that you find a different offset to fund H.R. 3548, \n     the Supplemental Appropriations, and oppose using the Reid-\n     Baucus proposed delay of the interest allocation rules to \n     offset other tax policy. U.S. based employers like Deere \n     believe implementing World Wide Interest Allocation is \n     critically important international tax law.\n                                                Thomas K. Jarrett,\n                                              Vice President, Tax.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to speak in support of extending \nthe unemployment insurance program, to provide up to 20 weeks of \nadditional unemployment insurance benefits for out-of-work Americans \nand their families.\n  American workers are facing tough times. During the last recession, \nour country lost millions of good jobs--jobs that have never been \nreplaced. And the downturn of the past 2 years, brought on by the \nsubprime mortgage disaster and skyrocketing oil costs, has created a \nperfect storm leading to severe unemployment, with official \nunemployment approaching 10 percent. Today, 15.1 million Americans are \nout of work, and more than a third of them have been out of a job for 6 \nmonths or more. Unfortunately, the jobless rates jumps closer to 20 \npercent when you take into account the millions more who have given up \nlooking for work, or can only find part-time work when they need full-\ntime incomes.\n  In recent weeks we have seen signs that our economy is starting to \nturn the corner, with growth in consumer spending, improved home sales \nand expansion in some manufacturing industries. Thanks to the Recovery \nAct, we have also been able to keep teachers in the classroom, and get \nconstruction workers started on new jobs because this administration \nand this Congress made significant investments that saved or created \nthese and hundreds of thousands of other jobs. But we know that \nachieving a full economic recovery won't happen overnight. As our \neconomy gradually improves, American families will still need help to \nget by.\n  The recession has meant hardship for many thousands of families in my \nhome state. Des Moines' nine food banks have seen a significant \nincrease in demand. And organizations like the Salvation Army are also \nseeing a surge of requests for assistance with utilities, food, and \nclothing.\n  When a family member is out of work, times are particularly tough. \nOne survey found that 70 percent of families with a person out of work \nreported having cut back spending on food and groceries. That is why it \nis important that we act now to extend unemployment insurance benefits.\n  The unemployment insurance program provides a vital safety net during \ntimes of economic hardship. Workers have paid into the system through \ntheir hard work, so when they are out of a job they deserve support to \nsee them through tough times. These benefits are fundamental to helping \nfamilies meet basic necessities--to provide a roof over their heads, to \nput food on the table, or to keep the heat on. A recent survey found \nthat 90 percent of people receiving unemployment benefits used them for \njust such necessities.\n  With over one-third of unemployed Americans out of a job for more \nthan half a year, unemployment benefits have been a lifeline for these \nfamilies. The critical nature of these benefits has enabled us to pass \nprevious extensions with bipartisan support. Earlier this year we \nprovided additional weeks of unemployment assistance and a small \nincrease in workers' weekly benefits. Yet 400,000 workers ran out of \nbenefits last month and another 200,000 exhausted their unemployment by \nthe end of October. Over 30,000 Iowans have run out of State benefits \nsince June.\n  Running out of unemployment support means even tougher times for \nAmericans who are already strapped--and so I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in supporting and quickly passing this extension of \nunemployment benefits.\n  The amendment before us will provide critical help to working \nfamilies as our economy gets going again. Nationwide, it provides 14 \nadditional weeks of benefits for workers who have run out of safety net \nsupport. In States where unemployment is at or above 8.5 percent, \nworkers are eligible for 20 additional weeks of benefits. This \namendment will provide much needed help to 1.9 million people across \nthe country, including 31,000 in Iowa.\n  This help can't come too soon for hardworking men and women who are \ntrying to hang on for better times ahead; people like Kimberly Anders, \nfrom West Des Moines, IA. She writes:\n\n       As an older person, I feel lost in the face of not being \n     able to find a job, especially after I've worked hard my \n     whole life and never once relied on any state or federal aid \n     . . . now my unemployment is about to run out, and my hope \n     with it . . .\n\n  Unemployment benefits help Michelle Paulson from Huxley, IA, who is \ntrying to train for a new career while caring for her family. A mother \nof two, Michelle went back to community college after she was laid off \nby a window manufacturer last August. As the lagging economy continues \nto take its toll on Iowans, Michelle is pursuing a degree in advanced \nmanufacturing. Unemployment benefits provide Michelle the safety net to \nmeet basic needs for her family while building her own workforce \nskills.\n  The American people are counting on us to help them. It is time to \nact now.\n  Passing this amendment now will give people like Kimberly Anders and \nMichelle Paulson the immediate help they need. What's more, it will \nbenefit them and all American workers in the long run by helping to get \nour economy back on track. That is because unemployment benefits \nprovide a major, immediate boost to the economy. Economists calculate \nthat every $1 invested in the unemployment insurance safety net \ngenerates $1.63 in economic activity. Unemployed households spend these \ndollars on immediate needs--to pay the rent or a medical bill, buy \ngroceries and school supplies, or repair the family car--all economic \nactivities that quickly inject dollars into our communities.\n\n[[Page S11099]]\n\n  An extension of unemployment benefits gives workers and their \nfamilies the support they need while people continue to look for work. \nAnd it provides a needed stimulus to the rest of our economy. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment and pass it without delay.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the measure we have before us is vital to \nthe three-quarters of a million people in Michigan who are unemployed. \nIt is vital to the 15.1 million Americans who are unemployed. It will \nkeep them in their homes. It will keep their children fed and clothed.\n  It is also vital to the millions of American workers who remain \nemployed, but are plagued by fear that they too will lose their job. \nPrevious extensions of unemployment insurance benefits have played an \nunderappreciated role in helping us avoid even greater economic \ncollapse. There are businesses still open, neighborhoods still filled \nwith families instead of foreclosed homes, wheels of commerce still \nturning because of the economic fuel these extensions have provided. \nThis extension, too, means help not just for those facing a loss of \nbenefits but for entire communities.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation extends the homebuyer tax \ncredit which had been set to expire on November 30, 2009. This credit, \nwhich has helped pull the real-estate market from the depths of \ndecline, will now be available until April 30, 2010. This legislation \nexpands eligible recipients to tax payers who have owned their homes \nfor more than 5 years. The credit will also provide additional relief \nto members of the military by eliminating the recapture requirement of \nthe credit if they are forced to sell their home as a result of an \nofficial extension of duty.\n  So I am glad that we are ready to approve this legislation. I wish it \nhad come sooner. During the debate and delay here in Washington, 7,000 \nunemployed Americans each day saw their unemployment benefits expire. \nBy mid-October, 44,000 Michigan workers had exhausted their benefits, \nand that number will more than double by the end of the year if we do \nnot act. The anxiety caused by our delays has been a tremendous \nhardship for families facing the loss of their benefits hardship made \npainfully clear by the calls and letters to my office from Michiganders \ndesperate for any word on when Congress would act.\n  For a family battered by the loss of a job, fearing the loss of a \nhome, wondering if life will ever be the same, facing such uncertainty \nrequires genuine courage to hold onto hope. This extension of \nunemployment benefits is one important way we can help alleviate fear \nand help preserve that hope that is essential to persevere until times \nget better.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nafter the adoption of this unanimous consent request, all postcloture \ntime be yielded back, and the bill, as amended, be read a third time, \nthat no points of order be in order, and the Senate then proceed to \nvote on passage of H.R. 3548; that upon passage, the Senate then \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 331, the \nnomination of Tara Jeanne O'Toole; and that once the nomination is \nreported, the Senate proceed to vote on confirmation of the nomination, \nwith any statements relating to the nomination appearing at the \nappropriate place in the Record, as if read; that upon confirmation, \nthe motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; \nthat the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and \nthe Senate then resume legislative session; that on Thursday, November \n5, after a period of morning business, the Senate consider the motion \nto proceed to the motion to reconsider the vote by which cloture was \nnot invoked on the committee-reported substitute amendment to H.R. \n2847, the Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations Act; that the motion \nto proceed be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be agreed to; and \nthat prior to the vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nsubstitute amendment, there be 40 minutes of debate, equally divided \nand controlled as follows: 20 minutes under the control of Senator \nVitter and 20 minutes total for Senators Mikulski and Shelby; that upon \nthe use or yielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to vote on \nthe motion to invoke cloture on the substitute amendment; further, that \nupon disposition of H.R. 2847, the Senate then proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 106, H.R. 3082, the Military \nConstruction/Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act; that immediately \nafter the bill is reported, Senator Johnson or his designee be \nrecognized to call up the substitute amendment, which is the text of S. \n1407, the Senate committee-reported bill.\n  Mr. President, I wish to inform my colleagues that the unanimous \nconsent request I just made has been cleared by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is a moral responsibility for a \ngreat nation to help provide for its citizens when they are in dire \neconomic circumstances. There are more than 30,000 workers in West \nVirginia who have exhausted their regular unemployment benefits, and \nthousands of them have already received their final payment of \nemergency unemployment benefits. These workers and their families are \nrelying on this unemployment extension bill to survive. Later this \nyear, many more unemployed workers will be counting on the Congress to \ntake action to extend provisions contained in the stimulus bill, in \norder to be able to purchase health insurance. Congress must not fail \nthem.\n  I am very pleased that the Senate has passed this unemployment \nextension measure, which provides a lifeline for families who are \nbarely hanging on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11103-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11103-S11105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF TARA JEANNE O'TOOLE TO BE UNDER SECRETARY FOR SCIENCE AND \n                               TECHNOLOGY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Tara Jeanne O'Toole, of \nMaryland, to be Under Secretary for Science and Technology, Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand the Senate is proceeding to \nthe consideration of the nomination of Dr. Tara O'Toole to serve as \nUnder Secretary for the Science and Technology Directorate at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. This nomination has not been available \nfor consideration until now because I was waiting for Dr. O'Toole to \nanswer the nearly two dozen questions I submitted to her during the \npast month. As of Monday, she has answered each question.\n  While I continue to have concerns about this nominee failing to \ndisclose her activities as strategic director for the Alliance for \nBiosecurity, I will not hold up consideration of her nomination. A \nSeptember 8, 2009 article in the Washington Times referred to the \nAlliance as a ``lobbying group funded by the pharmaceutical industry.''\n  Specifically, the article stated, ``The alliance has spent more than \n$500,000 lobbying Congress and federal agencies--including Homeland \nSecurity--since 2005, congressional records show. However, Homeland \nSecurity officials said Dr. O'Toole need not disclose her ties to the \ngroup on her government ethics form because the alliance is not \nincorporated . . . Analysts say the lack of disclosure reflects a \npotential loophole in the policies for the Obama administration, which \nhas boasted about its efforts to make government more transparent.''\n  The article continued:\n\n       They also question lobbying laws that allow such a group to \n     spend hundreds of thousands of dollars without the public \n     knowing exactly how much money each of the companies that \n     belongs to the group contributes, though such arrangements \n     are permitted under the law . . . Ethics rules require \n     nominees to report any paid or unpaid positions held outside \n     of government, including but not limited to those of \n     ``officer, trustee, general partner, representative, employee \n     or any consultant of any corporation, firm, partnership or \n     other business enterprise.'' Dr. O'Toole signed a letter on \n     behalf of the group sent to the White House as recently as \n     March.\n\n  I put forward numerous questions to Dr. O'Toole about her ``stealth \nlobbying'' on behalf of the Alliance. She repeatedly answered that her \n``activities did not constitute lobbying.''' I also asked numerous \nquestions about her involvement in securing an earmark for the Center \nfor BioSecurity at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. She \nprovided answers to the questions and stated that although she provided \na statement for the media in support of the earmark, she did not \nprovide any assistance in lobbying Congress for the earmark.\n  Elections have consequences, and while she would not have been the \nnominee I would have chosen for this position, she is the President's \nchoice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the September 8, 2009, Washington Times \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Sept. 8, 2009]\n\n                 Obama Nominee Omitted Ties to Biotech\n\n                          (By Jim McElhatton)\n\n       President Obama's nominee at the Department of Homeland \n     Security overseeing bioterrorism defense has served as a key \n     adviser for a lobbying group funded by the pharmaceutical \n     industry that has asked the government to spend more money \n     for anthrax vaccines and biodefense research.\n       But Dr. Tara O'Toole, whose confirmation as undersecretary \n     of science and technology is pending, never reported her \n     involvement with the lobbying group called the Alliance for \n     Biosecurity in a recent government ethics filing.\n       The alliance has spent more than $500,000 lobbying Congress \n     and federal agencies--including Homeland Security--since \n     2005, congressional records show.\n       However, Homeland Security officials said Dr. O'Toole need \n     not disclose her ties to the group on her government ethics \n     form because the alliance is not incorporated: ``There's no \n     legal existence so she wouldn't have to disclose it,'' said \n     Robert Coyle, an ethics official for the Department of \n     Homeland Security.\n       Analysts say the lack of disclosure reflects a potential \n     loophole in the policies for the Obama administration, which \n     has boasted about its efforts to make government more \n     transparent. They also question lobbying laws that allow such \n     a group to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars without the \n     public knowing exactly how much money each of the companies \n     that belongs to the group contributes, though such \n     arrangements are permitted under the law.\n       ``You're not allowing the public to know the full \n     background of this nominee,'' said Judy Nadler, a senior \n     fellow at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa \n     Clara University in California. ``It shouldn't matter whether \n     it's incorporated or not.''\n       Craig Holman, legislative director of the nonpartisan \n     watchdog group Public Citizen, said the lack of disclosure \n     ``definitely and clearly runs counter to the intent of the \n     law.''\n       Ethics rules require nominees to report any paid or unpaid \n     positions held outside of government, including but not \n     limited to those of ``officer, trustee, general partner, \n     representative, employee or any consultant of any \n     corporation, firm, partnership or other business enterprise. \n     . . .'' Dr. O'Toole signed a letter on behalf of the group \n     sent to the White House as recently as March.\n       Dr. O'Toole declined to comment for this article. Her \n     office referred questions to Mr. Coyle at Homeland Security \n     and to officials for the Alliance for Biosecurity, who said \n     the group is in ``full compliance'' with lobbying rules and \n     noted that there were no financial ties between the Center \n     for Biosecurity, where Dr. O'Toole is chief executive, and \n     the lobbying group she help found.\n       In written testimony to Congress, Dr. O'Toole said the \n     alliance was ``created to protect the Center for \n     Biosecurity's status as an honest broker between the \n     biopharma companies and the U.S. government.''\n       As undersecretary of science and technology, one of Dr. \n     O'Toole's responsibilities would involve overseeing the \n     department's chemical and biological division, which is in \n     charge of making sure the nation is prepared to defend itself \n     against chemical and biological attacks.\n       Dr. O'Toole was nominated less than four years after the \n     alliance was formed in 2005. She has served as the group's \n     unpaid strategic director and has signed her name on more \n     than a dozen letters sent to Congress and federal agencies.\n       The group's letters to policymakers often seek more money \n     for research and vaccines. She signed the letters as the \n     group's strategic director, in addition to listing her full-\n     time paid job as director of the Center for Biosecurity, \n     which is affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n[[Page S11104]]\n\n       The letters, including one that Dr. O'Toole sent to House \n     Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, last fall, \n     describe the Alliance for Biosecurity as a ``collaboration'' \n     among the Center for Biosecurity of the University of \n     Pittsburgh Medical Center, pharmaceutical companies and \n     biotechnology companies ``working to develop vaccines, \n     medicines and other medical countermeasures for the nation's \n     Strategic National Stockpile.''\n       Members include companies such as Pfizer Inc., Sig \n     Technologies and PharmAthene Inc. The group discloses the \n     letters and list of members on a Web site.\n       But for all its lobbying and letters to Congress, the \n     alliance isn't incorporated, it doesn't have a bank account \n     and its day-to-day operations are overseen by the K Street \n     lobbying arm of Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP, which also \n     lobbies on behalf of the alliance, according to records and \n     interviews.\n       The alliance's legal counsel, Anita Cicero, is also a \n     Drinker Biddle lawyer who serves as a lobbyist for the group. \n     In an e-mail response to questions about the alliance, Ms. \n     Cicero said the group was formed to work ``in the public \n     interest to improve prevention and treatment of severe \n     infectious diseases--particularly those diseases that present \n     global security challenges in the 21st century.''\n       Ms. Cicero described the lobbying activities as focusing on \n     broad issues. ``The overarching advocacy issues we address \n     run across the industry, and we do not conduct lobbying \n     activities to advance the commercial interests of any \n     individual member company,'' she said.\n       Still, a review of the group's correspondence to federal \n     lawmakers along with member companies' public disclosures to \n     investors show that the lines between advocacy and commercial \n     interests aren't always clear.\n       In an Oct. 31 letter to Mrs. Pelosi signed by Dr. O'Toole \n     and two other alliance officials, the group called on \n     Congress to include more than $900 million for the ``advanced \n     development of medical countermeasures'' to be administered \n     by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development \n     Authority.\n       The letter also was signed by the chief executive officer \n     of member company PharmAthene, David Wright, who was one of \n     the two first co-chairmen for the alliance after its creation \n     in 2005.\n       Mr. Wright's company has a big financial interest in \n     securing work from the authority, according to investor \n     filings. A Securities and Exchange Commission filing last \n     summer disclosed that PharmAthene has been trying to win a \n     contract administered by the authority to supply 25 million \n     doses of an anthrax vaccine to the national stockpile, which \n     is overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n       As undersecretary, Dr. O'Toole wouldn't be directly \n     responsible for decisions on which vaccines to develop or \n     buy. Still, she would oversee the government's threat \n     assessments on the risks of bioagents.\n       Dr. O'Toole has told the Senate in written testimony that \n     she would adhere to all ethics rule on conflicts of \n     interests, but that because she has no financial interest in \n     PharmAthene, she's not aware of any recusal requirements if \n     she were to become involved in decisions concerning \n     government funding for anthrax vaccine development.\n       Ethics groups say the alliance's setup is an example of \n     what critics call ``stealth lobbying,'' in which like-minded \n     companies form a loosely knit compact and spend lots of money \n     lobbying the government. The arrangement is legal, but it \n     exposes loopholes that prevent the public from finding out \n     how much money each company pays and whether one business \n     exerts more control over the others.\n       Ms. Cicero said the group is complying with all applicable \n     federal laws and that the alliance discloses on a Web site \n     its membership list and correspondence to the White House, \n     Congress and federal agencies. She said the companies pay a \n     ``pro rata'' share to the Drinker Biddle & Reath firm.\n       ``The alliance does not generate income, does not have a \n     bank account and does not owe taxes,'' she said.\n       Ms. Cicero said the law firm ``regularly convenes consortia \n     of biopharma companies that share common goals or interests \n     and provides secretarial and legal support for the groups.'' \n     She said the alliance was formed so companies, academic \n     institutions and the government could work together to \n     ``accelerate the development of therapeutic and vaccine \n     countermeasures.''\n       Ms. Cicero said Dr. O'Toole no longer has an active role as \n     the strategic director for the alliance.\n       Another lobbying client of the firm, the International \n     Pharmaceutical Aerosol Consortium, appears structured \n     similarly. There are no records of any incorporation papers \n     for that group, either. The group has a Web site listing \n     several pharmaceutical companies as members, and Senate \n     records show it has paid more than $250,000 to Drinker, \n     Biddle & Reath since 2007.\n       Government watchdog groups acknowledge that the arrangement \n     is legal but say it seems at odds with lobbying reform laws \n     that were intended to shed more light on who bankrolls and \n     controls special interest groups.\n       ``At the end of the day, companies that form coalitions \n     like this are being able to get around having to disclose the \n     full breadth of who they are and what they're doing,'' said \n     Dave Levinthal, a spokesman for the nonpartisan Center for \n     Responsive Politics. ``Does that cut against an open and \n     transparent government? It appears that it does.\n       ``Stealth lobbying has been taking place for years and \n     despite the focus on the influence of lobbying, what's \n     happening is that organizations are finding, if not \n     loopholes, then ways around the spirit of the law,'' he said. \n     ``Companies that are lobbying Congress are not necessarily \n     disclosing the full strength of their lobbying.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the nomination of Dr. Tara \nO'Toole to be the Under Secretary for Science and Technology at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  By its nature, this position requires a disinterested scientific \napproach to issues affecting homeland security. It is a position which \nthe Department of Homeland Security and its policymakers must rely on \nfor objective advice and counsel.\n  Dr. O'Toole fell short of the strict adherence to scientific \nprinciples when she was the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for \nCivilian Biodefense Strategies. Dr. O'Toole was one of the principal \ndesigners and authors of the June 2001 Dark Winter exercise that \nsimulated a covert attack on the United States by bioterrorists.\n  The Dark Winter exercise had a deadly serious purpose: to assess the \nvulnerability of the United States to a biological weapons attack and \nour ability to deal with such an attack.\n  But many top scientists have said that the Dark Winter exercise was \nbased on faulty and exaggerated assumptions about the transmission rate \nof smallpox.\n  Dr. James Koopman of the Department of Epidemiology at the University \nof Michigan, an expert at modeling the transmission rates of infectious \ndiseases who participated in the smallpox eradication program, has said \nthat Dr. O'Toole ``has not sought balanced scientific input in her \nthinking, that she shows a lack of analytic orientation to scientific \nissues, and that she has generated hype about bioterrorism that she \nwill feel obligated to defend rather than pursue a balanced approach.''\n  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy \nand Infectious Diseases, told me that the conclusions of the Dark \nWinter exercise were ``dramatically affected'' by the assumptions that \nwere used, and that these assumptions were ``much, much worse than \nwould have been the case'' in real life.\n  Dr. Michael Lane, the former Director of the Centers For Disease \nControl Smallpox Eradication Program--who has had extensive and first-\nhand experience with the disease--found the assumptions about smallpox \ntransmission rates in the Dark Winter exercise ``improbable'' and even \n``absurd.''\n  The transmission rate of smallpox was not the only area where Dr. \nO'Toole exaggerated the facts. On February 19, 2002, she wrote that \n``Many experts believe that the smallpox virus is not confined to these \n2 official repositories [1 in the United States and 1 in Russia] and \nmay be in the possession of states or subnational groups pursuing \nactive biological weapons programs.'' This statement referenced a New \nYork Times article of June 13, 1999, for support of that very startling \nstatement about ``subnational groups.'' But the article she cited made \nno reference to any subnational or terrorist or nonstate group \npossessing active biological weapons programs.\n  Bioterrorism poses a serious threat to our national security. But it \nis one of many threats we face. All threats to our security must be \naddressed objectively and scientifically so that we spend our resources \nin the most effective way possible to address the most likely and most \ndangerous threats. Exaggerations for the purpose of influencing policy \nmakers do a disservice and result in the misallocation of limited \nresources that must be utilized wisely and objectively in order to \nenhance our security.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \ntake up and approve the nomination of Dr. Tara O'Toole to be Under \nSecretary of Science and Technology at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  When the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held \nits confirmation hearing on Dr. O'Toole's nomination I said I believed \nit was an ``inspired choice.''\n  My judgment remains unchanged and I would note that her nomination \nwas reported out of committee favorably on a bipartisan basis with just \none dissenting Democratic vote.\n\n[[Page S11105]]\n\n  I would also note that DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano has been \npleading with the Senate to confirm Dr. O'Toole. Secretary Napolitano \nhas said that Dr. O'Toole's biosecurity and epidemiology expertise are \ncritical to DHS and to her, personally. The Secretary's urgency is \nheightened because of the critical roles Dr. O'Toole will play in both \ndefending our Nation against bioterrorism and in the continuing \npreparations for the H1N1 flu pandemic.\n  Let's consider the tough job Dr. O'Toole has been asked to take on \nand then consider the qualifications she brings to it.\n  The Science and Technology Directorate is charged with managing our \nNation's investments in homeland security research and development \nprojects with the goal of providing its customers within and without \nthe DHS the kinds of state-of-the-art technologies they need to achieve \ntheir missions.\n  The S Directorate got off to a rocky start and struggled in its \nearly years to clarify and execute its primary mission. Former Under \nSecretary Jay M. Cohen resolved to build a leaner and more tightly \nmanaged organization that focused on better serving its customers and \nbeing transparent with Congress. He implemented internal controls to \nmonitor S finances and track the progress of S investments. He \nestablished a structured strategic planning process that is designed to \nproduce specific objectives and annual performance measures.\n  But despite this progress, big challenges await the new \nundersecretary, including expanding investments in innovative R for \nhomeland security--like the advanced spectroscopic portal, ASP, and the \nsecure border initiative--and insuring the reliability of the a testing \nand evaluation that DHS relies on for large acquisition programs.\n  Programs like these can be force multipliers for DHS's customers \nwithin and without the department.\n  Now let's consider the resume Dr. O'Toole brings to the job--both as \na medical professional and as a manager.\n  Let's start with Dr. O'Toole's solid and impressive educational \nbackground: a bachelor's degree from Vassar College, a medical degree \nfrom George Washington University, and a master of public health degree \nfrom Johns Hopkins University.\n  Now let's consider her management skills: From 1989 to 1993 she \nserved as a senior analyst and project director with the Congressional \nOffice of Technology Assessment; from 1993 to 1997, she served as the \nAssistant Secretary for Environment, Safety and Health at the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  From 1999 to 2003, she managed the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian \nBiodefense Strategies. For the last 6 years, she has served as the \nDirector and Chief Executive Officer of the Center for Biosecurity at \nthe University of Pittsburgh.\n  On top of all this, Dr. O'Toole is also an accomplished author.\n  She has published her research on anthrax, smallpox, the plague, \nbiological attacks, containment of contagious disease epidemics, \nbiodefense, and hospital preparedness. She is coeditor in chief of the \nJournal of Biosecurity and Bioterrorism.\n  And she took all this knowledge she has gained over these many years \nand used it to help create the 2001 bio-terror attack simulation known \nas ``Operation Dark Winter'' that helped open our eyes to our many \nvulnerabilities.\n  Dr. O'Toole is also a former chair of the board of the Federation of \nAmerican Scientists and she has participated in major studies or \nadvisory panels at the request of the National Science Foundation, the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services and \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  Besides these many qualifications, another important measure of her \nfitness for this post is the bipartisan respect she has earned across \nthe government and scientific communities that monitor homeland \nsecurity and bioterrorism challenges.\n  Among her many supporters are: Former Senators Bob Graham and Jim \nTalent, Chairman and Cochairman of the Commission on the Prevention of \nWMD Proliferation and Terrorism; former DHS Secretary Tom Ridge; former \nSenator and defense expert Sam Nunn; former National Security Adviser \nto Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, Brent Scowcroft, as \nwell as Dr. Robert P. Kadlec, former Special Assistant for Biodefense \nPolicy at the Homeland Security Council under President Bush; Dr. D.A. \nHenderson, who led the World Health Organization's efforts to rid the \nworld of smallpox, and the Federation of American Scientists.\n  Dr. O'Toole brings a remarkable breadth of experience to this job \nthat is so crucial to our nation's security and I say again she is an \ninspired choice and I urge my 3 colleagues to take up her nomination \nand confirm her to this position where our nation so desperately needs \nher talents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Tara Jeanne O'Toole, of Maryland, to be \nUnder Secretary for Science and Technology, Department of Homeland \nSecurity?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for giving me an \nopportunity to talk for a few minutes about health care as we try to \nunderstand what brings us to this point with a shred of rage, trying to \nmaintain the dignity of our society.\n  We are on the verge of fixing our health care system once and for \nall, but there is one major obstacle in our way. The obstacle I talk \nabout is the health insurance companies, their lobbyists, CEOs, and \ntheir friends on the other side of the aisle. We can call this group \nthe status quo caucus. They are spending unlimited funds on TV \ncommercials and bogus studies to kill health reform. That is their \nmission. Think about it. They define their goal, their objective, as \narticulated by our colleague from South Carolina, as saying: If we can \nstop this health care reform from continuing, it can be the end of the \nObama Presidency, it can be his Waterloo.\n  What kind of an objective is that, that we put politics at the top \nend as we ignore millions of people, over 40 million people who do not \nhave any insurance, and many of the others who do\n\n[[Page S11106]]\n\nhave insurance do not have a complete picture about what their policies \npermit or what they might lose by way of restrictions.\n  This is an outrage. The public is manifesting their concern. They are \nnot sure about what they hear, the derogatory material they see--don't \ndo this, don't do that, no public option, and let's take our country \nback. I don't know whom they are talking about. Whose country? It is \nour country. It is everybody's country. There is no monopoly here for \nparticipation in American society.\n  We hear the worst kinds of assertions about what we are trying to \ndo--turning this country into a Socialist country. What has happened \nwould be almost humorous if it were not so tragic; that is, for people \nwho are on Medicare to be concerned about government interfering with \ntheir lives. Medicare is a government program, one of the most \nsuccessful ever put into the structure of our country.\n  While this group of obstructionists goes about their business, \n``don't let it happen'' is their mission. I just told you how it is \ndemonstrated in the words of the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The insurance companies are spending millions on TV commercials and \nbogus studies to kill health care reform. Quenching their thirst for \nprofits has led to some of the worst predatory practices imaginable. \nThis is an industry that will knowingly strip children of their health \ncare coverage when a parent loses a job. This is an industry that \ndemeans women by treating pregnancy and domestic violence as \npreexisting conditions--anything to escape their obligations under \ntheir insurance policies, for which they charge a lot of money. This is \nan industry that squeezes small businesses by charging them 18 percent \nmore than they do large firms for the same health insurance policies.\n  The priority of the health industry is not patients, it is profits. \nIn the richest Nation in the world, decent health care should be a \nbasic tenet of life for everyone in our society. But that is not the \nway it is going and that is not the way the health insurance companies \nlook at it. Their single-minded drive for profits is at the expense of \ntheir policyholders--policyholders who depend on them for care when \nthey are sick or injured and when they need medical or health \nprofessional assistance.\n  We have a chart that demonstrates the massive profit increases at \nsome of our largest health insurance companies for the years 2000 to \n2008. These are the profit increases at health insurance companies. \nThis is 2000 and this is 2008. How can we forget 2008, when our country \nwas coming apart at the seams, deep in recession and terrible \nexpectations in front of us, with people losing their jobs and losing \ntheir homes by the millions. Yes, 2008 was that kind of a year. It was \na disaster year, except for the guys who were in the health insurance \nbusiness.\n  In 2000, the profit for WellPoint, one of the best-known companies, \nwas $226 million. Eight years later, their profit was $2.5 billion. \nNote this: $226 million and $2.5 billion, for a 1000-percent increase. \nFor Aetna, $127 million in 2000; in 2008, $1.4 billion. Think about \nit--$127 million to $1.4 billion, for a 990-percent increase. Humana, \nin 2000, had a $90 million profit year, but by 2008 they were up to \n$647 million, for a 619-percent increase. United Health had $736 \nmillion worth of profit in the year 2000, and in 2008 these guys made \n$3 billion, for a 340-percent increase. That is $736 million compared \nto $3 billion, for a 304-percent increase.\n  I can assure you working people were not looking at these kinds of \nincreased percentages in their incomes. As a matter of fact, their \npurchasing power declined. Even though salaries may have stayed the \nsame or have been increased by some factor, their purchasing power \ndecreased.\n  Humana, we recently learned, achieved these profits largely by \ncheating taxpayers, by taking funds that were supposed to be subsidies \nfor lower rates for their policyholders but, in fact, they went into \nthe company's profits.\n  Just like the industry's profits have risen, so has CEO compensation. \nOver the last 20 years, compensation for health insurance company CEOs \nhas grown steadily while workers' pay has barely moved. The average \ncompensation package for each of the top five health insurance company \nexecutives between 2006 and 2008 was almost $15 million a year.\n  I ran a fairly large company before I came to the Senate, and I think \nearning a profit is good. I think it is appropriate to keep your books \nhonestly, tell the company to be transparent, tell the country exactly \nwhat your profits are, how it was earned, what your expenses were, what \nyour revenues were. The company I ran is a company called ADP. I \nstarted it with two other fellows. They, like I, came from poor, \nworking-class families who worked in the mills in Paterson, NJ. We \nworked very hard. That company today has 46,000 employees in 26 \ncountries across the world. We started in Paterson, NJ, in a dumpy \nhotel building where we could rent space. So I know something about \nbalance sheets, financial statements, and profitability. I think that \nprofit is a good thing.\n  But it is one thing if you are manufacturing lawnmowers and another \nthing if you are providing health care and the squeeze on the profit \nside comes out of people's lives; comes out of creating suffering and \nfear of loss of coverage.\n  The average salary for these insurance company executives was almost \n$15 million each year--each CEO--while a year's pay for the average \nworker during that same time was about $44,000. Imagine, these people \nare working in the shops, moving things along, doing their clerical \nwork, doing what they have to do, and the top guy is earning $15 \nmillion a year, while the average person working there is earning \n$44,000, and $44,000 today doesn't carry a family very far.\n  A single health insurance CEO earns approximately 335 times the \naverage worker. It is scandalous. But it doesn't end there. At the same \ntime health insurers and CEOs have made out like bandits, the industry \nhas increased its premiums relentlessly. According to a new report from \nthe Kaiser Family Foundation, insurance premiums for families more than \ndoubled since 1999. Ten years ago, premiums averaged less than $6,000 a \nyear. Today, they have grown to an average of more than $13,000 a \nyear--the highest amount on record. These are for middle-class people \nearning very modest incomes trying to get along and watch their health \ninsurance.\n  I have had people walk up to me, people I see in positions of labor, \nsaying: Mr. Senator, please, my rent is going up, my taxes for real \nestate are going up, I can't afford more. My health care is the one \nthing that worries me so much. I can't afford to pay the premium, Mr. \nSenator. Please, help us.\n  As the following chart shows, over the past 10 years, insurance \npremiums have gone up three times faster than wage increases--in a \nperiod of just 10 years. So we see what is happening to a family's \nability to afford to cover their needs. If today's CEOs cared as much \nabout the public health as their financial wealth, our system wouldn't \nlook this way. What happens is we are trading the well-being of the \nneedy for unconscionable gains by the greedy.\n  It is so funny, the times we live in. I read there was a boat show \nthat just took place in Miami, FL, and the most active part of the \nsales of boats was for boats that were 100 feet or longer. We are \ntalking about millions of dollars for these boats. I don't begrudge \nthose people. I don't, really. But look at basic America and see what \nit is that keeps our country going.\n  The health care field is one of the great abominations. We have to \nend this poisonous prescription for management of health care companies \nand change the way these health insurance companies operate. There is \none way to do it and that is to make sure there is competition within \nthe industry that is serious. The legislation we are putting forward \nwill reshape health insurance and end the industry's choke hold on \nordinary Americans.\n  Under our proposal, it will be against the law for insurance \ncompanies to discriminate against women. It will be against the law for \nthem to deny coverage because of a preexisting condition. It will be \nagainst the law for them to end insurance coverage just because \npolicyholders become sick. That is what they are supposed to take care \nof. On top of that, we are going to stop insurance companies from \ncharging immense amounts of out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n[[Page S11107]]\n\n  We will also make it so insurance providers have to cover routine \ncheckups and preventive care, so lifesaving mammograms will no longer \nbe out of reach for millions of women. I know a world-renowned research \nclinician in New York who says mammograms are the gold standard for \ndealing with anticipation of breast cancer.\n  These changes will make health insurance companies more honest, more \ntransparent and more accountable and they will still make enough money \nto take care of the wages and the profits they seek. They may not be as \ngreat as they are, but they shouldn't be as great as they are.\n  Our Republican colleagues are chasing a different goal. They are \nlooking for political victories on the backs of the working people of \nour country. They are fixated on stopping the Congress and President \nObama no matter what the consequences are for our country and for the \npeople who work hard to keep their families together. But I want to \nremind these obstructionists that health insurance companies have shown \ntheir utter disregard for the well-being of all Americans from all \nwalks of life. They do not care if the policyholder is a Democrat, a \nRepublican or an Independent. I remind anybody who hears what we are \nsaying or looks at what we are doing that fixing health care is not a \nchoice; it is a necessity.\n  I know this on a personal basis, though I am fortunate. I have a \ngrandson who is 16 years old. He has asthma. When my daughter takes him \nto play sports--he is a good athlete--she first checks to see where the \nnearest emergency clinic is in case he starts to wheeze. I have a \ngranddaughter, 11 years old, and she has diabetes. When she was here in \nWashington on a visit, I looked at her, and I didn't like the way she \nlooked. I said to my daughter--they live in Florida--you have to find \nout what is wrong with Maddie. There is something there. It worried me. \nShe was pale, she didn't have any energy, and she looked terribly slim. \nWhen I went down to Florida 3 days later, after they left Washington, I \nwent to the hospital where she had entered and I saw her. She looked \nlike a new person because the diabetes was treated and she had insulin. \nShe looked like a new person.\n  Those things mean so much. There is nothing more important to any of \nus--and I say this about my Republican friends as well--nothing more \nimportant than our children, our grandchildren. That is what we all \nlive for. They have a right to live and be healthy. For the future of \nour children and grandchildren, every American--we have to meet our \nobligations. I plead with my friends on the other side, get out of the \nway. Don't stand there unless you are willing to come in here and say: \nI don't want people to have health insurance. I don't care whether a \nchild has health insurance. Say it out loud instead of skulking behind \nthe walls and hiding the truth about what your mission is.\n  It is my hope that history will record a moment of success, success \nfor the people of our country. We have never quite been this close to \nachieving fundamental health care reform. We may never have this \nopportunity again.\n  Once more, step forward, colleagues, Senators, sent here by people \nwho trust you, who have confidence in you. Take care of them. Be honest \nwith them. If you don't want to give them health care insurance, say \nso. Say: I don't want to give you health insurance. Or say: We don't \nwant your condition to determine whether we cover you, we want to \ndecide. This is an opportunity we have to seize.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I will.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from Oregon \nis recognized and the Senator from Michigan is recognized, under the \nexisting unanimous consent agreement I then be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from New \nJersey for his remarks, for his reminder that health care is not about \nprofits, it is not about salaries of the CEOs, it is about health care \nfor Americans so that all citizens have access to affordable and \nquality health care. That is what this debate is about.\n  One component of that debate is extending the opportunity for health \ncare to those who do not have that opportunity right now. Another part \nof this debate is about improving the way insurance works for those who \nalready have insurance. That is what I want to address tonight.\n  There are common practices in our insurance industry, our health care \nsystem, and that includes exclusion of preexisting conditions, gender \ndiscrimination, arbitrary annual spending limits or lifetime spending \nlimits, and dumping--the practice of kicking people off policies when \nthey get sick. They go against the very idea of insurance. What people \nexpect is that their health insurance will be there if they need it. \nWhat they often find is it is not there.\n  For example, many people do not realize their insurer has placed an \narbitrary limit on how much care they can get in a single year or over \nthe course of their lifetime. A person may be paying monthly premiums, \nperhaps $500 a month in premiums, every month for years, adding up to \ntens of thousands of dollars. That person may be going forth in that \nfashion, needing not so much as a checkup, but then they are struck by \na serious illness or a serious accident and they need regular and \nsometimes expensive care. Suddenly they find out that the thousands of \ndollars in premiums they have paid do not actually guarantee they will \nget the care they need.\n  I will give an example from my home State of Oregon. Alaya Wyndham-\nPrice is a healthy 27-year-old from Lake Oswego, OR. She had insurance \nbut had no reason to think she would actually need it, given that she \nwas healthy and she was young. Imagine her surprise when she was \ndiagnosed with a tumor the size of a golf ball just below her brain. \nThen imagine her further shock when she found out that her insurance \npolicy caps treatment at $20,000 a year.\n  It took $30,000 of tests--and it doesn't take a whole lot of testing \nto run up that kind of bill--to determine the best treatment for her \ntumor. The surgery to remove that tumor is going to cost $50,000, but \nbecause of Alaya's limit, she has to put off the surgery until next \nyear. That means further hardship on her, for her family--emotionally, \nphysically, and financially.\n  As she told me this story a couple of weeks ago, I kept pondering, \nwhat will that delay do to her ultimate health outcome? How much \nopportunity is that delay affording to a tumor that doesn't have her \nhealth in mind as it grows?\n  These caps are not right. It is not right to tell someone who is \ngravely ill that they can only have so much health care in a given \nyear. It is not right to ration treatments on the ability to pay. It is \nnot right to collect premiums year after year and then in the fine \nprint put in an annual cap that denies care when it is desperately \nneeded. Alaya has insurance but she has already amassed a massive \namount of debt. Hopefully, she will be able to continue paying her \nbills and not have this critical health care issue also drive her into \na critical financial situation, into bankruptcy. Indeed, that is what \nhappens to many Americans who have health insurance. Half the people \nwho declare bankruptcy do so because of medical bills, and three-\nfourths of those who declare bankruptcy because of medical bills had \ninsurance.\n  Insurance at the least is supposed to be the way to keep yourself \nfinancially solvent in the case of a disaster, but that is not what is \nhappening for millions of Americans. It is not working for many \nAmericans.\n  Insurance failed Kathryn Peper of Tigard, OR. Katherine had trouble \ngetting any insurance because she had high cholesterol, a common \ncondition but enough to allow the insurers to deny her application \nbecause of this preexisting condition. She did finally find a policy--\n$550 a month. She paid that premium and one would think insurance at \nthat price would pay some of her medical expenses, but she found out it \ndid not. Her insurer routinely refused to pay for even simple doctor \nappointments. So she was paying a huge amount for insurance and getting \nno coverage as a result, when she needed it to go to the doctor. She \nfinally canceled her policy, and she now pays out\n\n[[Page S11108]]\n\nof pocket for each visit, and she hopes she does not have a \ndebilitating condition come up or an accident.\n  There are other practices. I mentioned dumping. This is egregious. \nImagine you pay your premium year after year, month after month, \nstretching over 10, 15 years, and then you have that accident or that \ndisease that lands you in the hospital and you need a lot of care. You \nget a letter from your insurance company saying: We don't think you are \na good insurance risk anymore so we are canceling your insurance.\n  At the end of that year you are suddenly stuck with massive bills and \nno insurance coverage to pay for the ongoing treatments you need. That \nis not right.\n  We have built our health care system around private insurance and \nprivate insurance remains an integral part of health care reform. But \nthings have to change. We can't continue to have our citizens pay \nmillions to insurers and see so little in return. It is not good for \nthe health of the American people or our Nation. We need an insurance \npolicyholder bill of rights. It needs to have guaranteed issue, no \nblocks as a result of preexisting conditions, no rejection because of \npreexisting conditions. It needs to have no arbitrary annual or \nlifetime limits. It needs to say no dumping, and it needs to say no \ngender discrimination.\n  Each and every one of these concepts was debated in the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee and incorporated into the bill \nthat came out of that committee. These are principles I want to see \ncarried straight through until we put this health care reform on the \nPresident's desk.\n  It is time to act for the citizens of this Nation. It is time to have \na health care system that works for working Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Merkley, for those wonderful comments and his \npassion and commitment on this issue; also, Senator Lautenberg from New \nJersey and my friend and partner from Michigan, Senator Levin, who will \nbe speaking, and the great Senator from Rhode Island, as well, who has \nbeen a wonderful leader on this issue and so many other issues as well. \nWe all come today because we are committed. We are absolutely committed \nto seeing reforms in our insurance system so families get what they are \npaying for and we can bring costs down and we can save lives.\n  We are here because we want to share the voices and stories from \npeople in our States who have paid into a system and too often not \ngotten what they have paid for, not been able to benefit from the \nhealth care system that we have in this country.\n  It is important that insurance industry reforms be a part of health \ncare reform. We know we are still in the process of bringing a bill to \nthe floor. At this point we are talking about our goals and our \ncommitment to the common shared values and goals that we have going \nforward because we know we need to make sure this is addressed.\n  When we started this debate earlier this year, I set up an online \nhealth care people's lobby for the people of Michigan to be able to \nshare with me their thoughts, concerns, and stories as they relate to \nhealth care, not having health insurance, what is happening to their \nfamilies. My sense was we can step outside this Chamber and meet at any \nmoment with insurance company lobbyists and prescription drug lobbyists \nand others who are here representing special interests. It is very \nimportant that voices be heard from people who just want health care \nfor their families and either cannot find it, cannot afford it, or they \nhave it and the costs are going through the roof and then they find \nthat what they have paid for or what they thought they were paying for \nis not what they are actually getting for their families.\n  That is specifically what we want to talk about today, the fact that \nthere are abuses, bad practices occurring right now. People who have \ninsurance have a stake in health care reform. We are not changing their \nability to have insurance. Everyone can keep what they have. But we \nwant to make sure they are getting what they are paying for.\n  That is a very important part of health care reform. It is important \nas we look at the fact that since 2000, insurance company profits have \ngone up 428 percent. People in my State would take a quarter of that. \nWe are seeing insurance premiums during that same period go up 120 \npercent. Even though profits have gone up 428 percent, we still have \nseen premiums going up 120 percent, and now even higher. We are seeing \nmore and more announcements of premiums going up despite the high \nprofits in the industry.\n  What is most concerning is, for average people wages are either going \ndown, they are losing their job, or if they have a job their wages \ncertainly are growing much more slowly. In fact, over the 8-year period \nwe have seen wages going up about 29 percent at best, if you are \nfortunate enough to have a job in this bad economy. That means every \nday insurance companies are taking a bigger chunk out of budgets of our \nfamilies and businesses, and it is not fair.\n  The status quo is not working anymore for anybody other than those \nwho are making profits off the system. It is hurting families, it is \nhurting businesses, and it is costing us jobs. In fact, health care \nreform is about jobs. It is about saving jobs, it is about making sure \nif you lose your job you do not loose your health care. It is about \nmaking sure that small businesses that want to provide insurance for \nemployees can do that or not have to lay off people because premiums \nare going up. So it is very much about jobs.\n  It is very much about jobs, and that is why we need a health care \nreform bill now. It is time to put an end to the insurance company \nabuses. The goals we share in this process are to stop the process of \ndenying coverage because of preexisting conditions; to stop the process \nof annual and lifetime caps on benefits; to stop the process where \nsomeone can get charged more or dropped from coverage if they get sick.\n  I have seen too many situations where somebody pays in, pays in, and \npays the higher premiums and so on, and then somebody in the family \ngets sick and, based on technicalities, they are dropped or they are \nnot covered. That is wrong. We are committed to fixing that.\n  We also want to make sure on the positive end that we are focusing on \nprevention and on checkups and making sure you can do that without the \ncost of copays and deductibles. We are encouraging people to get \nhealthy, to get those early checkups, to be able to get the care on the \nfront end that they need.\n  It is also extremely important as we move forward we crack down on \ndiscrimination by insurance companies. Right now women can pay twice as \nmuch for insurance as men and, in fact, get less coverage. In eight \nStates and the District of Columbia, being a victim of domestic \nviolence can count as a preexisting condition. I was stunned when I \nfirst heard that, and then said, well, that cannot be. We doubled back \nand, yes, in fact, that is true for men and women who need help for \ngetting the insurance care they need right when they need it.\n  In many places, being pregnant, having ever been pregnant, even \nwanting to be pregnant, can be qualified as a preexisting condition. We \nhad a report in the Washington Post about insurance companies that even \ndenied coverage to men who were expectant fathers. I am not sure what \nkind of family values those are. But we need insurance reform that \naddresses some pretty basic things.\n  Right now 60 percent of the plans in the individual and small \nbusiness markets do not cover vital maternity and prenatal care for \npregnant women. That needs to change with health care reform. It is not \nan accident that we have an infant mortality rate of 29th in the world, \nbelow some Third World countries, children and babies who do not make \nit through their first year of life.\n  We look at the fact that too many insurance plans do not cover \nprenatal care and care for mom and baby during the first year of the \nbaby's life. We are committed to changing that.\n  I wish to share a story I received that goes right to the heart of \nwhy insurance reform is so important to families in Michigan and all \nacross the country. It comes from a constituent of mine in Michigan, \nLynn, from Marshall, MI.\n  A few years ago she got the kind of news that every parent fears. Her \nson\n\n[[Page S11109]]\n\nJustin was diagnosed with leukemia. To date, his medical bills have \ntotalled over $450,000. Thankfully they have insurance and his leukemia \nhas a very high cure rate.\n  Justin is 21 now and a senior in college. He is doing fine, \nthankfully, but Lynn worries about what is going to happen when he \ngraduates from college and can no longer stay on her insurance. With \nleukemia as a preexisting condition, his insurance premiums will go \nthrough the roof. And for a young man who is just starting his career, \nthose kinds of costs would simply be unaffordable.\n  If Justin wants to start his own business, which is so central to the \nAmerican dream, he would never be able to afford to pay for his own \ninsurance with that kind of preexisting condition. How many other \nJustins are out there, who would be the innovators and the \nentrepreneurs we need to revitalize our economy in America? Who would \nmake the difference if only they could afford to go out on their own \nand start their own company and know they could get affordable \ninsurance without preexisting conditions and other barriers that have \nbeen in their way from insurance companies?\n  That is why we need health care reform. We need health insurance \nreform as a part of health care reform. We are committed to that. We \nare committed to stop abuses in the health insurance industry. Those \nwho have insurance now who will be able to keep their insurance need to \nknow they are getting what they are paying for in the health care \nsystem today for their families. That is why we need reform now, and we \nare committed to getting it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it should be crystal clear to all of us why \nthe health insurance industry opposes reform so strenuously: because \nthe status quo is so profitable.\n  As my colleagues have pointed out, the massive profit announced this \nweek by Humana, Inc. illustrates this vividly. Humana's third-quarter \nprofit of $301 million was a 65-percent increase over the same period a \nyear ago. And Humana executives made no secret of the reason for this \nballooning profit. The company's president and CEO said, ``Our \ngovernment segment continued to perform well in the third quarter \nparticularly in our Medicare business.''\n  It is no coincidence that Humana is one of the biggest providers of \nMedicare Advantage plans. These plans, in which private insurers \ncontract with the government to provide coverage to Medicare \nbeneficiaries, were supposed to unleash the power of private-sector \ncompetition, lowering costs, improving service, and increasing benefits \nto our seniors.\n  It has not often worked out that way. While some Medicare Advantage \nplans have performed well, Medicare pays, on average, 14 percent more \nfor Medicare Advantage beneficiaries than for those in traditional \nMedicare, and despite this increase in payments to Medicare Advantage \nplans, the Government Accountability Office has found that seniors \noften face higher out-of-pocket costs in Medicare Advantage plans.\n  In fact, when the GAO studied the costs and performance of these \nplans, it found that in 2005, those plans spent significantly less for \nhealth care for seniors than they projected to pay. That lower spending \non medical care for seniors led directly to windfall profits, $1.1 \nbillion more in profits than the insurance companies had told the \ngovernment they expected to earn. That $1.1 billion is taxpayer money \nthat should be providing treatment to our seniors, and instead is \nboosting insurance company profits.\n  Indeed, health insurance companies need no taxpayer help in reaping \nbig profits. From 2002 to 2006, profits at publicly traded insurance \nproviders increased more than tenfold. At the same time these companies \nare making massive profits, working Americans and their employers have \nendured year after year of much higher premiums, reduced benefits, and \ndenials of treatment.\n  Our citizens need a sensible health care system. We can not afford a \nsystem in which our people are denied treatment because their benefits \nare capped. We can not afford a system in which they are denied \ncoverage because they have a preexisting condition. Our Nation can not \nafford a system in which the loss of a job means the loss of coverage \nand debilitating health costs. Our Nation can not afford a system in \nwhich even those with jobs and insurance face rapidly increasing \npremiums and out-of-pocket costs. Our nation certainly can not afford a \nsystem in which our tax dollars boost the ever-higher profits at \ninsurance companies, or in which premiums and out-of-pocket costs \nconstantly go up, while coverage constantly shrinks or disappears \nentirely.\n  The Senate needs to put the interests of the American people ahead of \nthe interests of insurers. We need to take up a health reform plan that \nmakes comprehensive, affordable health coverage available to every \nAmerican, and helps keep insurance companies honest.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the period for speakers \nbe extended for an additional 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I have joined my colleagues on the \nfloor this evening to discuss the need for health insurance reform, \nwhich is a critical component of the health care reform package that \nthe Senate will soon consider.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are fond of suggesting \nto the American people that our current health care system is \nfundamentally fine, fundamentally sound, and all it needs is some minor \ntweaks. But Rhode Islanders who have faced down their insurance \ncompanies over the denial of benefits they paid for will tell you that \nidea is dead wrong. As they and many other Americans have found to be \npainfully true, our current system of health care is all too often a \nmirage concocted by health insurance companies to extract premiums from \nconsumers while denying coverage when it is actually needed.\n  Reform of this system of delusion is needed and it is needed now. As \nsomeone said the other day: Americans have all the health care they \nneed until they need it. Then the insurance company comes and \ninterferes.\n  Those profit-driven companies focus on share price and quarterly \nearnings and other telltales of the business world and are only too \nhappy to diligently mail those premium notices and collect those \npayments when you are feeling well. But when illness strikes, they \nvanish, they disappear, hiding behind stacks of forms, automated 800 \nnumbers, with no human to be found, and weeks and weeks of delay and \ndenial.\n  The insurance company Humana pulled just such a stunt a few years \nago. In May of 2006, a Humana policyholder was diagnosed with a rare \nand advanced form of liver cancer. Without treatment, he was not \nexpected to live more than 4 years. But in September of that year, his \ndoctor, a board-certified interventional radiologist, recommended a \ncourse of treatment for the cancer involving a new technology, \nexpensive but proven to be effective.\n  The insurance company policy explicitly covered such radiological \ntreatment. At this point, it is an inspirational story, a terminally \nill patient whose persistent and caring doctor found a technological \nadvance that could extend his life. But when the insurer Humana became \ninvolved, this patient's bureaucratic nightmare began. The treatment \nrecommended by the doctor is widely accepted. It is FDA approved. It is \nreimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid, and it is covered by several large \ninsurance plans. But Humana's medical director denied coverage. He \ndenied it on the basis that it was ``experimental/investigational, not \nidentified as widely used or generally accepted.''\n  Humana decided to deny this lifesaving treatment in spite of the fact \nthat the insurance company medical director, the same fellow who made \nthat determination, later admitted in court that:\n\n\n[[Page S11110]]\n\n\n       He has never performed [the] treatment, consulted with \n     another physician about the treatment, or even read any \n     literature on the topic.\n\n  Without ever having performed this treatment, without ever having \nconsulted with another physician about this treatment, without ever \nhaving read any literature on the topic, he reached the decision that \nthis treatment was ``experimental/investigational . . . not identified \nas widely used [or] generally accepted,'' leaving this man with liver \ncancer and a doctor telling him how to cure it hanging in bureaucratic \nlimbo.\n  Since this policyholder could not pay out of pocket--it was an \nexpensive treatment--the hospital treating him said it could not \nproceed with the treatment. With time running out and nowhere to turn, \nhe hired an attorney to force Humana to stick to the terms of its \nhealth insurance policy. Thank goodness, he won.\n  In a blistering opinion, the trial judge found that the company could \nnot have possibly made a well-informed decision under the provisions of \nthe plan. Rather, the judge found, the company relied on the flimsy \npretext of an internal company guideline deeming the treatment \n``experimental.'' How good is that? You are the insurance company that \nhas the decision on whether to pay. You have a rule that says you don't \npay if it is experimental, and you create your own internal, \nindependent guideline that decides, contrary to all the rest of the \nevidence, that it is experimental. It is like being able to grade your \nown exams, except that lives hang in the balance.\n  The basis for that conclusion was two written summaries of medical \narticles by a private health insurance industry consultant. That is \nwhat they based that internal guideline on. They said it was based on \nwritten summaries of medical articles by a private health insurance \nindustry consultant. It makes you feel pretty good as a customer of the \ninsurance company to think that they are getting recommendations from \ntheir own private health insurance industry consultants, right? The \nreal problem was this: The summaries were wrong. Neither of the \narticles actually concluded that the treatment was experimental. The \nwhole thing was a big, complex, bureaucratic chase founded in \nfalsehood.\n  The court found that Humana inappropriately denied the treatment and \nordered that it immediately pay for this patient's cancer treatment. \nWhat a waste--a waste of money, a waste of time, and a waste of \nresources. Worse than all of that, what a thing for this man to have to \ngo through. Not enough that he has been diagnosed with a rare and fatal \nform of liver cancer, not enough that a doctor has told him that with \nthe right treatment, he could extend his life, maybe long enough to see \na daughter graduate, maybe long enough to see a son get married, maybe \nlong enough to arrange his affairs for his family to do well after he \nhas left them, on top of all that, he now had two battles to fight--one \nwith his illness, one with his insurance company.\n  We have heard a lot of hysterical propaganda lately about how health \nreform will put the government between you and your doctor. Indeed, the \nrecent GOP health care bill on the House side has in its opening \npassages that it will not intervene in the doctor-patient relationship, \nsuggesting that other proposals would intervene in the doctor-patient \nrelationship.\n  I submit that our colleagues on the other side are a lot less \nconcerned about intervening in the doctor-patient relationship than \nthey are about the Congress of the United States intervening in the \ninsurer-to-insured relationship. I submit they are more concerned about \nleaving American insureds at the mercy of these insurance companies--\nthe place where they actually intervene between the patient and the \ndoctor. The worry for the real American isn't that the government is \ninterfering between them and their doctor; the worry is that when they \nget sick, that insurance company intervenes between them and their \ndoctor.\n  We hear it in Rhode Island, in Colorado, the State of the Presiding \nOfficer. We hear it over and over. Indeed, one of the things they do is \ncalled rescission. Rescission is when you have paid your premiums, you \nhave been a good customer, you think you are a customer in good \nstanding, and something awful happens--an unexpected diagnosis, a \nterrible accident. Suddenly, you need to call on that insurance policy \nthat you have paid for month after month, year after year, to see you \nthrough your time of illness or injury. Then what do they do? The first \nthing they do is send somebody in their administrative offices \nsquirreling off through your file to look for something you did wrong \nwhen you filled out your form. If they can find a mistake, they yank \nthe coverage you paid for all those years.\n  During a recent study by House colleagues, committee investigators \nfound a total of 19,776 rescissions from just three large insurance \ncompanies over 5 years; 19,776 families who thought they had coverage, \nwho paid for coverage, who were good customers, but when they got sick, \nthe insurance company turned on them, and, once again, they had to \nfight two battles--one against the illness or injury and one against \nthe insurance company. The rescissions saved those three insurance \ncompanies $300 million, a third of a billion dollars. As a prosecutor \nwould say, there is motive.\n  When you look for real examples of bureaucratic interference, when \nyou look for real examples that resemble death panels, you need look no \nfurther than the kind of story about this gentleman Humana turned on \nwhen he got his diagnosis. We are here not to encourage that, not to \nhave the government do it, but to stop it, to put an end to it.\n  In stark contrast to this patient's humiliation, having to pay \nattorney's fees out of pocket to fight the insurance company, having to \ntry to cope with all this nonsense while suffering from a terminal \nillness, Humana executives and shareholders have done quite well. The \ncompany reported this week that its third-quarter profits are up 65 \npercent. Its CEO, Michael McCallister, was paid $5.2 million in 2008. \nNice pay. Too bad the work is so mean-spirited.\n  You might think the Humana story is extreme, an outlier, a rare, \ntragic case, but you would be wrong. The private health insurance \nindustry torments Americans like that patient day-in and day-out, \n17,000 of them just with the rescissions.\n  Another example: In 2005, BlueCross of California denied a patient's \nclaim for bone marrow treatment, writing only that its decision was \n``based upon the member's specific circumstances and upon peer reviewed \ncriteria including Medical Policy.'' What is that? What does that mean? \n``Based upon the member's specific circumstances and upon peer reviewed \ncriteria including Medical Policy''--what a lot of rigmarole. The State \ninsurance commissioner stepped in and penalized the company because it \ndidn't describe any reasons for its denial, nor did it cite provisions \nof the insurance policy upon which it relied, just ``based upon the \nmember's specific circumstances and upon peer reviewed criteria \nincluding Medical Policy.'' You could make that up about anything. In \nessence, the insurance company denied that claim for no reason.\n  That same year, the company denied another patient's claim for \nnutritional counseling to treat anorexia. In its notice of \ncancellation, the company wrote to its insured that ``nutritional \ncounseling is only covered when the diagnosis is diabetes. Since the \nclaim was not submitted with a diabetes diagnosis, the claim was \ndenied.'' California's insurance regulator found that the company's \nreasoning directly contradicted the benefits listed under the policy \nwhich said that dietary counseling ``is covered if it is for the \ntreatment of anorexia.'' Why do you make somebody who needs this health \ncare go chasing through the policy to find the place where it actually \nsays it is covered? Why make up a lie that it is not covered? There is \nan obvious reason: If you do that to enough people, some won't take the \ntrouble. Some will fight back. Some will figure out that it is \ninaccurate. Some will go to the regulators. But some will give up. Of \nthose who give up, you make money.\n  BlueCross of California is owned by WellPoint, whose CEO, Angela \nBraly, made $9.8 million last year.\n  Many years ago, Charles Dickens wrote a book called ``Bleak House.'' \nIn ``Bleak House,'' there are a lot of story lines, but one of them is \nabout two young people who are pursuing a case in the British courts. \nJarndyce v. Jarndyce was the name of the litigation. It is described in \n``Bleak House''\n\n[[Page S11111]]\n\nas a monster extending through the courts, through writs and clerks and \njudges. And the storyline through ``Bleak House'' is that eventually, \nthrough all this bureaucracy, through all this static, through all this \nnightmare, through all this hassle, the couple finally gets to the \npoint where they achieve the inheritance that was theirs, and that was \nthe subject of the litigation they needed to claim through this arduous \nordeal. The problem: By the time they got the inheritance, it had all \nbeen eaten up, every penny and farthing, by all that process and all \nthat delay.\n  Our current system of private health insurance too often leaves \npolicyholders feeling like that poor young couple in ``Bleak House,'' \nsurrounded by bureaucracy; surrounded by people who are out to gouge \nyou, not to help you; surrounded by people who turn their backs on you \nin your hour of need; surrounded by people who sold you all the health \ncoverage you need until you really need it. Then they are looking for \nloopholes and trying to deny you coverage.\n  We owe Americans better than that. We can build a system of health \ninsurance about which Dickens would not be tempted to write or Franz \nKafka for that matter. Let's build a system that prevents insurers from \nevading their promises--in which people can't be denied coverage for a \npreexisting condition; in which surprise annual or lifetime caps don't \npitch you into bankruptcy; in which insurers compete on customer \nservice, not on how to figure out ways to deny you coverage. That is \nthe system we in Congress are striving to enact into law this year.\n  One of the ways we will do this is by adding to the bill a public \noption. You can chase these insurance companies around until you are \nblue in the face. You can sic the regulators on them all day long. But \nthey have been doing this for years. It is a habit. It is a pattern and \npractice. It is a business model. It is not going to change without \ncompetition forcing it. That is yet another one of the reasons a public \noption is so important in this debate.\n  One of my fellow Rhode Islanders, Karen Ignagni, is actually the \nchief lobbyist for the health insurance industry. She said something \nthe other day about the public option. She said that it would reduce \npayments ``to doctors and hospitals rather than driving real reforms \nthat bring down costs and improve quality.'' I submit she has it \nexactly wrong, exactly backward.\n  First, as we have crafted a public option, it would have to compete \nand negotiate for price, just like the private insurance industry does, \nno different than the insurance companies Ms. Ignagni represents.\n\n  But more to the point, this idea that it will compete by reducing \npayments to doctors and not drive real reforms, I submit the exact \nopposite is true. It is the public option that will drive the real \nreforms. It is the public option that will pursue cost-effective \nquality improvements; that will pursue wellness and prevention for \ncustomers; that will find better ways to pay doctors for value, not for \nvolume; that will take advantage of President Obama's investment in \nhealth information technology to transform American health care for the \nbetter.\n  So I will close with that observation, and I will add one more thing. \nI have used examples from public records, but many of us here have had \nthis experience personally.\n  Someone in my family, whom I love very much--I would describe him as \nmy best friend--got a terrible diagnosis some time ago, and his family \nand everybody who loves him gathered around to help him. One of the \nthings that was recommended was that he go to the National Institutes \nof Health, where the best specialists for this terrible diagnosis he \nhad can be found.\n  So he went to the National Institutes of Health. Actually, I went \nwith him because it is just up the road in Maryland--he had to come \ndown from New York--and I wanted to be a good friend and a good family \nmember and show support and be there with him. So I know firsthand he \nwent up to NIH, and I know he spoke to that doctor, that world's best \nexpert on this terrible diagnosis, and I know firsthand what he was \ntold. I know exactly what he was told to do by that doctor.\n  He went back home to New York with this course of treatment for his \ncondition that had been given to him by the top specialist in the field \nin the country, the man recognized by the National Institutes of \nHealth, and when he began that course of treatment, guess what his \ninsurance company told him. ``I'm sorry, that's not the indicated \ntreatment.'' Oh, really? Not indicated? By whom? By some person on the \nother end of the phone who has never even examined him? By some person \non the other end of the phone who might not even have a medical degree?\n  Why is it that every single time the insurance companies get involved \nand say something is not the ``indicated treatment,'' the indicated \ntreatment is less expensive, the treatment they want is less expensive \nthan what the doctor wants? You would think that maybe once in a while, \njust to throw us off, they might say: No, no, no, wait a minute, the \nindicated treatment is actually more expensive and better than what \nyour doctor said, and we want you to have that. Has that ever happened? \nI do not think so. Every time the private health insurance industry \nsteps in between you and your doctor and says: No, we are not covering \nthat treatment, we don't care that your doctor has prescribed it--in \nthis case, we don't even care that the top specialist in the country \nprescribed it--it is always to push you to a cheaper treatment.\n  The terrible thing is that for every American like the man I love, \nfor every American like him who fought back, who said: Nuts to that, I \nhave been to the NIH, this is what they told me to do, this is what I \nam doing, some number will give up, some number will be defeated, \nalready scared by a terrible diagnosis, already bombarded at home with \nforms and bills and things they do not know how to cope with, already \ntrying to cope with issues like preparing their family for horrible \nnews. Dealing with the difficulties of treatment, some number of them \nwill give up, and they will let the insurance companies get away with \nit. For every one of them who dies a little earlier because they did \nnot get the treatment they should have--for every one of them--we in \nthis Congress need to get to work to make sure this kind of behavior is \nnever permitted again.\n  This is not a small matter. This hits home in every one of our States \nevery day. So I am proud to support our health care reform. I think we \nare going to see this legislation through to the end, and we are going \nto get it right, and after all the scare mongering and all the stories \nabout death panels and all the phony defense about the government \ngetting between you and your doctor--when what they are really \nprotecting is the right of the insurance company to step in and get \nbetween you and your doctor; that is what they are about--after all of \nthat, what people are going to find, coming out, when they actually see \nthe real results, is that, in fact, the world has changed for them. \nWhat Americans will see is that we will have changed the world for the \nbetter for people who are now in the grip of these greed-driven \ninsurance companies.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer very much, \nand I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that after the \nnext, I believe, 10 minutes expires on our time, that I be permitted to \nspeak in morning business beyond that time by, oh, say 10 minutes at \nthe most.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to also speak about health \ncare, as we have heard from some of my colleagues. I was coming in as \nSenator Whitehouse was concluding his remarks on the floor and am \ngrateful for his leadership and the leadership demonstrated by so many \nof our colleagues here on this critically important issue.\n  We have heard a great deal in the last couple of weeks about some of \nthe fundamentals of health care reform. I was speaking last week about \nchildren\n\n[[Page S11112]]\n\nand some of the progress we need to make in the final bill to protect \nour children, to make sure that especially poor children are not only \nnot worse off at the end of this debate but also that they are, in \nfact, better off because of the reforms we make. We have great programs \nto work with. The Children's Health Insurance Program, for example, has \nbeen tremendously successful in insuring the children of working \nparents. We know the kinds of early, periodic screening and diagnostic \ntesting done in Medicaid is very important to poor children and their \nfamilies. So there is much we have to do just with regard to children.\n  Our older citizens, of course, are a huge focus of this health care \nreform. We want to control costs. We want to provide better quality, \nensure prevention strategies that will not only save lives but also \nsave us a lot of money. We want to wrestle, as we have been trying to \ndo, with the cost issue, and we will continue to do that, and I think \nsuccessfully.\n  But one area I think we often, unfortunately, overlook is what \nhappens to our small businesses. We know that most of the jobs in \nAmerica--the foundation of our economy--are created by small \nbusinesses. These are the very businesses in States such as \nPennsylvania and the Presiding Officer's home State of Illinois and \nStates across the country--big States and small State--where businesses \nhave been devastated by health care costs. Over and over again, we hear \nit.\n  Just in the last couple of days, we saw this headline in the New York \nTimes: ``Small Business Faces Sharp Rise in Health Costs.'' And the \nsubheadline or the reference to the story says: ``Up 15%, On the \nAverage.'' ``Insurers Increase Rates as Congress Weighs Major \nOverhaul.'' So there are a lot of small businesses in Pennsylvania and \nacross America that are waiting to see what the House and the Senate \nwill do. What kind of bill will we send to President Obama for his \nsignature?\n  If we do nothing, there is one thing we are sure of. If we do \nnothing, if we do not pass legislation this year--as I think we will--\nbut if the Congress did nothing, we know those costs are going up all \nthe time. The New York Times reminds us of that: ``Up 15 percent, On \nthe Average.'' There is an increase in costs, if we do nothing, that \nhas been escalating for years now. We have had people in the Congress, \nhere in this Chamber, and other places saying: We have to help small \nbusinesses. We have to be conscious of what their needs are, the \ndifficulties they have had in this recession.\n  Families have had a lot of difficulties, obviously. In addition to \nthat, small businesses have. But we cannot say we really are concerned \nabout what happens to small businesses--small business owners--in \nAmerica if we do not help them on health care, if we allow this to \npersist, this spiraling, ever-increasing cost of health care for small \nbusinesses.\n  If you look at it just in terms of Pennsylvania--one way to look at \nthis is just in terms of State numbers. These numbers, we will not have \nto go through. I know some of them are small. But here is the basic \npoint: cost of health benefits to small businesses per year if there is \nno reform. This is just for Pennsylvania, as shown on this chart. If \nyou look at the year 2009: 7.43--the annual spending in billions of \ndollars in the State of Pennsylvania. Almost $7.5 billion spent by \nsmall businesses on health care. You do not need to read every number \nhere because a lot of them are small, but you can see the trajectory of \nthat graph, that blue line going up and up and up. So by the time 2018 \nrolls around, not even a decade away--9 years away--if we do nothing, \nPennsylvania's small businesses will pay more than $16 billion for \nhealth care--just in less than a decade, more than a doubling of health \ncare costs for small businesses in one State. One can just imagine. One \ndoesn't have to be an expert with numbers to extrapolate from that what \nthat means for the United States of America. Small businesses already \ncrushed in many instances by health care costs, being crushed even \nfurther. That is the cost of doing nothing. There are a lot of ways to \nmeasure that, but the cost to small business is one of them.\n\n  According to an August 2009 Small Business Majority survey of 200 \nPennsylvania small businesses, the top three concerns for small \nbusinesses in Pennsylvania--and I have no doubt this is similar to the \nrest of the country--here are the three top concerns: No. 1, \ncontrolling costs; No. 2, having insurance that covers everyone; and, \nNo. 3, ensuring at least high-quality standard benefits. So small \nbusinesses have the same concerns that many people here have: \ncontrolling costs, enhancing quality, and making sure we have broad \ncoverage.\n  Ninety percent of small businesses in Pennsylvania want to eliminate \npreexisting condition rules, and 75 percent see these rules as a \nbarrier to starting a business. So someone is making a decision, making \na determination about whether they will start a small business, and \nthey think to themselves: I may not be able to get this business off \nthe ground because of health care costs or because of preexisting \nconditions.\n  Why have we allowed this problem--not just the cost problem but the \nproblem that we point to all the time of preexisting conditions--why \nhave we allowed insurance companies to do that? Well, we have allowed \nit over many years because we haven't taken them on and defeated them \nwhen it comes to passing legislation.\n  This is the year when at long last we are going to say to insurance \ncompanies: You cannot have this kind of power over people's lives, over \npeople's business decisions by, for example--one of many examples, but \nthe most prominent, the most egregious example--denying someone \ncoverage because of a preexisting condition.\n  I know this summer, way back in the middle of July, as a member of \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, we passed our bill \nout of that committee and the first section of that bill dealt with the \npreexisting condition problem. In one sentence in that bill we set \nforth a determined effort to make it illegal to prevent someone from \ncoverage because of a preexisting condition. So this is about \nindividuals and families, as well as about small businesses. They, too, \nsuffer from the preexisting condition problem in our health care \nsystem.\n  There are a lot of other numbers I could point to in a survey. I will \nnot go through all of those, but I do wish to highlight tonight as well \nwhat we heard just yesterday, or part of what we heard yesterday in the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee where we had a number \nof witnesses. One of those witnesses was Jonathan Gruber who is an MIT \neconomist. He testified that small businesses--and I am paraphrasing \nhis testimony; it is all in the record--small businesses are \ndisproportionately hurt by the health care status quo and that health \ninsurance reform will lower--lower--premiums and save jobs in the small \nbusiness sector.\n  I am quoting from Dr. Gruber from MIT:\n\n       Small business has little to fear and much to gain from \n     health reform.\n\n  Not my words, the words of an MIT economist who has spent time not \njust analyzing health care reform over many years, he played a role in \nhelping Massachusetts develop their strategy. But he is talking about \nreform generally on health care as it relates to small businesses.\n  Professor Gruber also talked about health insurance reform breaking \ndown many of the barriers that currently are faced by small business \nowners or prospective small businesses. For example, unpredictable \npremium jumps, as we see on the chart. Whether they are predictable or \nnot, they occur all the time. But they are especially problematic when \na small business owner doesn't have any warning. Fear of starting new \nbusinesses for lack of affordable health insurance options is an \nimpediment to starting a small business. An impediment to creating jobs \nis another way of saying it, in my judgment.\n  Professor Gruber talks about other barriers to small businesses under \nour current system: higher costs and limited choices due to \nadministrative expenses and lack of bargaining power. Just imagine what \nit is like for a small business owner in a huge environment where they \ndon't have the kind of bargaining power a big company has or they don't \nhave the kind of bargaining power the Federal Government has to go into \nthe marketplace to keep costs down. So they go in virtually unarmed\n\n[[Page S11113]]\n\nor alone into that marketplace, a small business owner, who might have \n4 or 5 or 7 or 8 or 10 or 20 employees.\n  Tax credits would help small businesses who need it the most to help \nthem pay for insurance. Dr. Gruber unveiled a new analysis in his \ntestimony showing that health insurance reform will save small \nbusinesses 25 percent over the next decade. One thinks: Well, 25 \npercent, what does that mean? By his estimate, this 25 percent savings \nto small business as a result of health care reform, in his judgment, \nwould be a $65 billion-per-year savings for small business. That is Dr. \nGruber at MIT, not my words, not the words or the analysis of some \nSenator or House Member on one side of the debate or the other.\n  So the consequences of those savings would be enormous to small \nbusinesses in America. I know we need this kind of reform in \nPennsylvania.\n  Workers in small businesses would see an increase in their take-home \npay, according to Dr. Gruber, of almost $30 billion a year. That \naffects all of our lives in a very positive way. If a small business in \nour community can hire more people, can make an investment in the \ndevelopment of that small business because of health care savings as a \nresult of a health care reform bill, our communities will be stronger. \nWe will have more people working. We will have a much stronger economy \nright at the community level, not just in a macro or larger scale way.\n  Finally, on this analysis of what health care reform could mean to \nsmall businesses in terms of savings, that reform could save almost \n80,000 jobs, according to Dr. Gruber--80,000 jobs in the small business \nsector by 2019. Dr. Gruber also dispelled the myth that health \ninsurance reform will raise costs for small businesses. He said:\n\n       Objective CBO analysis shows that these claims are clearly \n     wrong. Reform will lower, not increase, nongroup insurance \n     costs.\n\n  So says MIT economist Dr. Gruber, who has lots of experience in this \narea and is lending the benefit of his experience and his insight into \nthese analyses on health insurance reform, but in particular as it \nrelates to small businesses.\n  So what we want to try to do with health care reform when it comes to \na State such as Pennsylvania is take this blue line of an exponential \nincrease in health care costs for small businesses in one State--and I \nthink this is true of the country as well, in my judgment--we want to \nmake sure this line and this exponential increase is turned the other \nway or at least begin to flatten out so that the $7 billion that small \nbusinesses are paying in Pennsylvania for health insurance reform by \nthe year 2018 might be only something a little less or a little more \nthan $7 billion.\n  We cannot say with a straight face or with any degree of integrity, \nin my judgment, that we want to lower costs for small businesses, that \nwe want small businesses to hire more people, and then in the next \nbreath say: But I don't think we should pass any health care reform. It \nis too complicated or it is too something to get it done this year. We \ncannot do that.\n  We cannot continue to say: Oh, isn't it too bad that health care \ncosts are so high? Isn't it too bad we couldn't do something about the \nhealth care costs of small businesses? This, in the end, is not simply \nabout the small business owner, it is not simply about what we are \ngoing to do for small businesses to help them get through this \nrecession. This, in the end, is about our economy. We are either going \nto change course, get control of costs, reform health care and be able \nto move our economy forward or we won't meet that challenge.\n  We are going to make the changes and institute reforms that will lead \nto lower costs, better health care outcomes, and a better bottom line \nfor small businesses and, therefore, control long-term health care \ncosts and long-term national debt. All of that comes from a good health \ncare bill in the end.\n  We cannot fail. We cannot at long last say we didn't get the job \ndone. We have to for our families, for children, for older citizens, as \nwell as for small business owners. I think we can. I think we have the \nstrategy that the American people understand fundamentally, and I think \nwe can do it this year.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, October 30, 2009, has been designated a \nnational day of remembrance for hundreds of thousands of Americans who \nserved their nation with distinction. Cold War Patriots National Day of \nRemembrance recognizes and commemorates former nuclear workers who \nbuilt and operated our Nation's nuclear infrastructure during World War \nII and the Cold War.\n  It is an honor to recognize the thousands of Ohioans--from towns and \ncities across the State--whose work helped protect our Nation during \nfive decades of ideological battles against totalitarianism. With a job \nto be done and a war to win, every day for more than 50 years laborers, \nmillers, and haulers exemplified Ohio's Midwestern values of hard work \nand patriotism.

Mr. President, I am honored to serve as the \ncongressional cochairman of National Bible Week 2009. National Bible \nWeek, which will be held from November 22 to 29, was created to \nunderscore the importance of regular Bible study and scripture reading. \nThe Bible is the word of God. I know that many of us could not face the \nchallenges, stress, and heavy burden of serving during this critical \ntime for our country, if it were not for the daily guidance God \nprovides us through scripture--and for those of us in the Catholic \nfaith, reception of the Blessed Sacrament. I believe that my colleagues \nand I need to pay special attention to the lessons the Bible teaches \nus, as we work together to make a difference for our country.\n  The enormity of what confronts us makes it is easy to become \nfrustrated, discouraged and tired. Thankfully, the Bible provides us \nwith inspiration, strength, and wisdom to motivate us. Prominently \ndisplayed in my office is a picture showing an eagle soaring high in \nthe sky. One of my favorite Bible verses, Isaiah 40:31 adorns the \nframe, it reads:\n\n       Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They \n     will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow \n     weary, they will walk and not be faint.\n\n  As I read those words so often, I am reminded that the Holy Spirit is \nalways present and willing to inspire and help us. Isaiah reminds us \nthat we can certainly try to tackle the big issues on our own, but that \nwithout the Holy Spirit by our side, the road will be long and arduous.\n  My colleagues have often heard me express my desire to address the \nballooning Federal deficit, to create an economic climate that is \nconducive to\n\n[[Page S11114]]\n\nhigher job-growth, and to improve the standard of living and quality of \nlife of our children and grandchildren--undertakings that take much \ntime and effort. Isaiah's message makes the importance and urgency of \nthese undertakings no less daunting, but does reassure us that if we \ntrust in the Holy Spirit, he will allow us to persevere.\n  I urge all Americans to celebrate National Bible Week to discover the \nlessons, inspiration and guidance that God's scripture provides for \neach of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11114-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          RECOGNIZING SIXTEENTH STREET COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to \nrecognize and congratulate the Sixteenth Street Community Health Center \non its 40th anniversary.\n  Located in the heart of Milwaukee's diverse south side, the Sixteenth \nStreet Community Health Center provides high quality health care \nservices to low income and non-English speaking residents in its \nsurrounding neighborhoods. Providing more than just basic health care, \nthe center offers a full range of social services, health education, \nand important mental health services.\n  The Sixteenth Street Community Health Center began in 1969 when a \nsmall group of residents opened the Health Contact Center with the goal \nof providing care to central city residents who may not otherwise have \naccess to medical services. Residents throughout the neighborhood came \ntogether to ensure that the health center had the resources and support \nit needed to thrive.\n  Just 10 years after it opened, the health center doubled in size. \nThroughout its history, it has partnered with the city of Milwaukee, \nlocal hospitals and clinics, and charitable organizations to continue \nits growth and expand the services it provides to patients. Today, the \nSixteenth Street Community Health Center offers prenatal care, social \nservices, environmental health education, HIV treatment and prevention \neducation, physical therapy, nutrition and wellness education, and much \nmore. In 2006, it opened its second clinic and last year it served more \nthan 27,000 patients.\n  I have a long and proud history of working with the Sixteenth Street \nCommunity Health Center. The center, widely recognized as an exemplary \nhealth organization, is a treasured vital community asset. For 40 \nyears, the staff of the center has worked diligently to fulfill its \nmission of providing care to as many people as possible regardless of \nincome or insurance status. In Milwaukee, the Sixteenth Street \nCommunity Health Center is synonymous with quality health care, \ncommunity service, and passion for all.\n  On behalf of our State and Nation, I applaud the Sixteenth Street \nCommunity Health Center on 40 years of outstanding service and wish \nthem continued success and a strong future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11114-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING RICHARD NEAL FOSTER\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nlife of one of Alaska's most dedicated public servants. Representative \nRichard Neal Foster served as a member of the Alaska House of \nRepresentatives for nearly 21 years. Since his election in 1988 he \nrepresented the residents of Nome and 28 villages with great love and \ndedication. Alaska will remember him this Friday at a memorial service \nin Anchorage.\n  A lifelong Alaskan, Representative Foster was born and raised in \nNome. He received a business administration degree from the University \nof Alaska. He managed Foster Aviation, a family-run air service started \nby his father in 1946. He was a civic leader in the community of Nome \nserving on the boards of the Bering Straits Native Corporation, the \nSitnasuak Native Corporation, Nome Eskimo Community, and the Northwest \nCampus of the University of Alaska.\n  Representative Foster will be remembered for a lifetime of public \nservice. After serving two tours in Vietnam as a captain in military \nintelligence he was awarded the Bronze Star. He received a commission \nas a second lieutenant in the Army through the University of Alaska, \nArmy ROTC program. As a man with passion for Alaska, he later served \nwith the Alaska Army National Guard in Nome.\n  During his tenure in the Alaska State legislature, he served as \nmajority whip from 1993 to 2007. Showing his commitment to address the \nchallenges of rural Alaska, he was a member of the Bush Caucus as well \nas the Alcohol and Substance Abuse Task Force Committee. And, in 2009, \nhe was honored as a University of Alaska Distinguished Alumni because \nof his dedication to public service.\n  As one of the longest serving members in the Alaska legislature, it \nsaddens me to acknowledge that Alaska has lost one of our truly great \nleaders. I had the honor of serving in the legislature with \nRepresentative Foster. He was a man with an infectious laugh and he had \na great love for the Seward Peninsula and the State of Alaska. Never \nletting divisive politics come between friendships, he was known for \nhis humility and friendliness to both Republicans and Democrats. His \n``Friday at Fosters'' events, where he hosted legislators, staff, \nadministration officials, friends, and visitors for a Friday evening \njam sessions for over 17 years, will be sorely missed.\n  Foster loved the outdoors of the Seward Peninsula, a region with a \nrich mining history. He spent his summers at Hannum Creek, working on \nhis family's mining claims. One time, he and his sister Iris and son \nNeal walked 80 miles of the historic mining trail from Quartz Creek to \nHannum Creek to experience the journey of ``Old Timers.'' In addition, \nFoster was known for his love of military history including the Civil \nWar and World War II and was a collector of military weapons.\n  He is survived by his wife Cathryn of Eatonville, WA; seven sons, \nNeal Foster of Nome, AK; James Foster of Anchorage, AK; Nathan Foster \nof Ellendale, ND; 1st Lt. Jason Weber, LCpl Richard Foster, Ramsey \nFoster, and Chandler Foster, all of Eatonville, WA; and two daughters, \nMaria Stevens of Tacoma, WA, Tiffany Sanchez of Miami, OK; and sister \nMargaret ``Iris'' Magnell of Laguna Hills, CA.\n  Foster's public service to the State of Alaska will continue to \npositively impact the lives of Alaskans for decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11114-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BLACK MEN UNITED\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nNational Association of Black Men United, NABMU, and congratulate them \nfor 10 years of dedication to advancing education.\n  The National Association of Black Men United has been instrumental in \nincreasing college students' graduation rates in my home State of \nArkansas. Their focus on graduating students at the University of \nCentral Arkansas has sparked expansion to Howard University in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Furthermore, the National Association of Black Men United was founded \non the principle that everyone who attends college should reach the \ngoal of graduation, regardless of race. The purpose is to assist black \nmen in obtaining a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or \nuniversity. The organization provides men with the tools needed to \nincrease graduation rates and improve economic advancements within the \nAfrican-American community. These tools include educational forums, \nworkshops, mentorship programs, and financial plans to guide students \nto graduation. NABMU's vision is to expand across the country, helping \nindividuals in all corners of the United States.\n  NABMU teaches a set of 10 primary responsibilities that encourage \nstudents to earn their degree. These responsibilities range from \nsitting in the front of the classroom, being diligent with their \nfinances, and being responsible for their own actions. Another vital \nfunction of the organization is to assist young men in finding careers \nin the field of their choice.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the National \nAssociation of Black Men United and especially their chapter at the \nUniversity of Central Arkansas for their outstanding work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11114-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11114-S11115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CHARLES EARLE CRAFTS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Charles Earle \nCrafts of\n\n[[Page S11115]]\n\nLivermore, ME, who is to be awarded three exceptional valor awards on \nNovember 9, 2009, for his extraordinary service to this Nation. Charles \nwill be presented with the prestigious Silver Star Medal for his heroic \nrole in combat against an overwhelming Viet Cong force at the Battle of \nBinh Gia, South Vietnam, on December 29, 1964. In addition, he will be \nawarded the Bronze Star Medal in honor of the 2 years, 1 month, and 24 \ndays he spent in brutal jungle captivity as a prisoner of war--and the \nBronze Star Medal with a ``V'' (valor) device for his outstanding \nachievement in smuggling out critical information for the United \nStates--risking further retribution--I might add. Indeed, all Americans \nowe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Charles for his inexhaustible \nservice to this country contributions that we will never forget and \nthat truly epitomize the valor of every man and woman courageous enough \nto wear our Nation's uniform.\n  In fact, a year before most Americans became aware that there was a \nviolent war being fought against the democratic government of South \nVietnam, Charles was drafted into the U.S. Army and trained as a radio \noperator. Then, in November of 1964, he was sent to Saigon and became a \nmilitary advisor to the Army of South Vietnam, ARVN, which was engaged \nin a bloody struggle against the Viet Cong insurgents.\n  That December, as Viet Cong forces attacked and held the village of \nBinh Gia which is located about 50 miles east of Saigon, Private \nCrafts, in his capacity as the radio operator for Sergeant Harold \nGeorge Bennett, accompanied the 33rd ARVN Ranger Battalion in an \nattempt to retake Binh Gia. As they approached the village, their much \nsmaller force of approximately 350 men came under heavy fire from an \nenemy force that was later estimated to be near 5,000 strong.\n  The majority of the ARVN Rangers were killed, wounded, or captured \nduring the horrific battle that followed, but despite all of the \nchallenges, Crafts successfully rebuffed attempts by the Viet Cong to \njam radio transmissions during the deadly carnage around them. And due \nto his deft and flawless operation of their portable radio, they were \nable to warn approaching American helicopter pilots not to attempt a \nrescue of them in the Viet Cong killing zone.\n  Shortly thereafter, Sergeant Bennett and Private Crafts were captured \nas prisoners of war--forced to survive disease including several bouts \nof malaria, as well as malnutrition and even terrible retribution for \nattempting to escape--being told, on myriad occasions, that, ``dying is \neasy; surviving is much more difficult.''\n  Both Crafts and Bennett would later be joined by CPT Donald G. Cook, \na U.S. Marine Corps officer who was severely wounded at Binh Gia 2 days \nafter their capture. And under the steadfast leadership of Captain \nCook, all upheld the military Code of Conduct to the utmost of their \nindividual ability while resisting frequent Viet Cong interrogation and \nindoctrination sessions--facing untold hardships on behalf of each and \nevery American. These brave men, in the face of such profound \nadversity, sustained themselves by their faith, trust in their country, \nand above all, each other.\n  And through all of the trials and tribulations, in light of the \ncountless reasons to give up hope, Charles remained resolute--and that \nunwavering determination to survive and to return home came to fruition \nas the Viet Cong political leadership decided to release two American \nPOWs, choosing Charles and Sgt Sammie Womack. A brief ceremony was held \non February 16, 1967, in the midst of the jungle, but it was after they \nboarded a Vietnamese bus, stopping at a U.S. military checkpoint, that \nthey again tasted freedom on February 23 that our Nation holds so dear. \nAnd as if all that Crafts had endured and accomplished had not been \nenough, he smuggled documents out of the jungle, providing even further \nintelligence for our country.\n  Following several months of hospitalization--growing stronger with \neach passing day--Charles was honorably discharged on May 17, 1967, \nwith the rank of specialist four class, E-4. Throughout the entire \nordeal, his parents, the late Leroy Bradford Crafts and Virginia \n(Voter) Crafts, never gave up hope for the return of their only son. \nAnd return to Maine he did to a welcoming and loving family, to a most \ngrateful community and State, and, although he didn't know it at the \ntime, his future wife Juanita during a ceremony where his high school \nalma mater dedicated their yearbook to him. Now that is fate!\n  Throughout his entire life--from his time at International Paper \nCompany to his role as a national service officer for the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans and, of course, his tireless service to this country \nwhile serving in the Army--Charles has exemplified the very best that \nthis Nation has to offer, and he is a shining example for why we \ncelebrate Veterans Day every year.\n  It goes without saying that Charles Crafts is a true American hero \nwho risked his life, time and again, so that our lives could be better. \nThere are no words to adequately thank or appropriately honor Charles \nfor all that he has done, but it gives me, and surely everyone in \nMaine, immeasurable pride that the Department of the Army has now \napproved three awards for Charles Earle Crafts: the Silver Star Medal \nfor gallantry in action during the Battle of Binh Gia, on December 29, \n1964, the Bronze Star Medal with ``V'' device for valorous achievement \nin smuggling out several documents--hiding those documents among his \nfew possessions and memorizing those which he was unable to sneak past \nthe guards--and finally, the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious service \nwhile caring for his fellow prisoners under extreme duress by his \ncaptors.\n  These awards reflect Charles' unending patriotism and boundless \nspirit that, quite literally, saved lives and made this country \nstronger. And as we laud Charles for his limitless contributions to our \nNation, I cannot help but also thank Retired Colonel Doug Moore, whose \nsterling efforts over the past decade were critical to collecting and \nproviding the necessary information to ensure this fitting recognition \nfor Charles' heroic service in Vietnam.\n  I could not be more pleased to join with Charles' friends and family \nin celebrating these phenomenal accolades and his remarkable service \nwith his wife of 15 years, Juanita; his son, Jason, and wife, Julie, of \nJay, ME; his two stepsons, Alan Levesque of Lewiston, ME, and Andy \nLevesque and fiancee Tara Averill of Poland, ME; his two sisters, \nPatricia Ridley of Wilton, ME, and Ann Crafts of North Jay, ME; as well \nas his four grandchildren, soon to be five--Sarah, Emma, Whitney and \nBailey. It goes without saying that families and loved ones are \nundeniable pillars of strength for their tireless support and \nindispensable devotion to our veterans and to our country.\n  The enduring truth is that neither a single day nor single ceremony \nis enough to honor America's veterans. We owe them and we owe Charles \nCrafts our praise and thanks on every day that we enjoy the blessings \nof liberty and benefits of security. These medals presented to Charles \nwill be a lasting testament, commemorating his unflagging spirit of \nplacing love of homeland above all else which has been the string upon \nwhich our pearls of freedom, liberty, and democracy have always been \nstrung.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11115-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11115-S11116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING MORRIS YACHTS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, four centuries ago, in my home State \nof Maine, a group of colonists settled on the mouth of the Kennebec \nRiver. There, they built the Virginia, a 30-ton pinnace that voyaged \nacross the Atlantic Ocean at least twice. By constructing the first \nEnglish-built ship in North America, these early Mainers engendered a \nrich tradition of shipbuilding that continues still today. In this time \nof economic volatility, Maine shipbuilders who carry on this lofty \npractice are some of the many small businesses that are piloting our \nNation out of this recession. I rise today to note the achievements of \none of these remarkable companies, Morris Yachts, which is \nheadquartered in the picturesque Maine village of Bass Harbor.\n  Since his business first set sail in 1972, Tom Morris has added \nimmensely to the abundant history of Down-east shipbuilding. Mr. \nMorris's passion for sailing spawned from summer vacations in Maine \nwith his family. Similarly, he instilled his zeal into his son, Cuyler, \nwho joined him at the wheel of Morris Yachts in 1995. With father and\n\n[[Page S11116]]\n\nson at the helm, the company outgrew its home of 27 years in Southwest \nHarbor a decade ago and now operates a complete yacht service company \njust down the road at its present facility.\n  During the company's near three decades in the Maine boatbuilding \narena, Morris Yachts has become a trusted and dependable name for \nhundreds of clients. Its yachts generally range from 29 to 62 feet in \nlength, and provide customers with semicustom boats of superb quality \nand beautiful woodworking. A testament to the Morris's remarkable \ncraftsmanship, there are presently over 269 Morris Yachts sailing all \nover the world. Morris Yachts also has a connection to Hollywood, as \nits Pemaquid Friendship sloop was utilized as a prop in the popular \nfilm ``The Truman Show.''\n  Most recently, Morris Yachts has been asked to build four 44-foot \nsailing vessels for the U.S. Coast Guard Academy for use in training \nprograms. With this new contract, Morris Yachts will be able to hire up \nto 20 employees, including mechanics, electricians, carpenters, and \ncomposite craftspeople this fall to work on the Coast Guard project, \nbringing the total number of Morris employees close to 100. While the \ninitial contract asks for four boats, the Coast Guard Academy hopes to \npotentially double its order.\n  Not only does the company provide a valuable service to its local \ncommunity, but with this contract, Morris Yachts will be able to serve \nthe entire Nation. Providing ships to the U.S. Coast Guard is a true \nhonor, and the firm's critical work will better equip our Nation's \nbravest men and women to protect our shores.\n  Despite the difficulty facing countless yacht manufacturers over the \npast year and a half, Morris Yachts has continued to produce sturdy and \nreliable boats. As a result, the company has been nominated for the \n2010 Boat of the Year Award by Cruising World and Sailing World \nmagazines. I congratulate everyone at Morris Yachts for this honor and \nlook forward to the announcement of the award in January.\n  The Morris family story serves as an inspiration to all who pursue \nthe American dream. I commend the Morris family for being chosen by our \nNation's military to build these watercraft and congratulate them for \ntheir well-deserved accolades. Just as the colonists on the Kennebec \nRiver did centuries ago, I am certain the Morris family will continue \nthe great tradition of Maine shipbuilding as they have for the past 37 \nyears. Their success is proof that commitment, resolve, and hard work \nstill lead to great things.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11116-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING NEW URBAN ARTS\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today I honor New Urban Arts of \nProvidence, RI, which has been honored by the White House with the 2009 \nComing Up Taller Award, the Nation's highest honor for out-of-school \narts and humanities programs. New Urban Arts is a model for what the \narts can do in the lives of our urban youth, giving them the \nopportunity to explore the limitless possibilities of their own \nimaginations and helping them apply what they discover to goals they \nset for their futures.\n  New Urban Arts was founded in 1997 as a collaboration between local \nhigh school and college students, with the support of the Swearer \nCenter for Public Service at Brown University. It has grown from those \n14 students in a loft at Grace Church in downtown Providence into an \norganization that serves over 300 high school students every year.\n  The New Urban Arts afterschool and summer programs provide these \nstudents with the opportunity to work with established local artists \nwho act as both mentors and peers, with the young people creating new \nworks of art that reflect their experiences. We know that for youth who \nare on their own after school, the hours between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. are \na danger zone, a peak time for juvenile crime and experimentation with \ndrugs and alcohol. Not only does New Urban Arts give youth in \nProvidence a place to go, it provides them with a safe space where they \ncan express themselves through many different art mediums and with \npeople who can nurture their talent. This includes members from Rhode \nIsland's acclaimed arts community, which has long understood the need \nto invest in our state's youth and arts education. And luckily for the \npeople of Rhode Island, the New Urban Arts gallery and exhibition \nspaces allow all of us to share in the joy of that new talent.\n  Our investment in the youth of Providence has paid dividends. Three-\nquarters of the students who participate in the New Urban Arts program \nare low-income and over half live in neighborhoods where the poverty \nrate is four times the national rate. Despite these challenges, over 90 \npercent of the seniors in this group graduate high school and attend \ncollege. When I was attorney general of Rhode Island, I saw what too \noften happened to students who did not know how to set goals for \nthemselves or understand the importance of education--they ended up in \nthe juvenile justice system. New Urban Arts helps students chart a \ncourse toward the future by inspiring them to create and introducing \nthem to adults who are invested in them and treat them as equals.\n  This wonderful model has attracted national attention, including this \nmost recent honor, the 2009 Coming Up Taller Award. This award \nrecognizes afterschool and out-of-school arts and humanities programs \nfor youth in traditionally underserved communities. It honors programs \nthat foster the creative and intellectual development of our Nation's \nchildren. The ideals set out by the Coming Up Taller Award are \ncertainly met by New Urban Arts, and I know that they will build on \nthis honor by helping more students.\n  I would like congratulate all of the students and mentors who make \nNew Urban Arts such a dynamic and innovative program, as well as its \nexecutive director, Jason Yoon, and the chairwoman of the New Urban \nArts Board of Directors, Myrth York. Their hard work and dedication to \nthe youth of Providence and to the arts will ensure that New Urban Arts \ncontinues to help our young people realize their potential into the \nfuture, and to serve as model for the rest of the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11116-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11116-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11116-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:28 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3157.

A bill to modify the boundary of the Minuteman Missile \nNational Historic Site in the State of South Dakota, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I introduced legislation that will \nallow the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site to move forward with \ndevelopment of a visitor center. Specifically, my legislation will \nallow 25 acres of national Forest Service land to be transferred to the \nNational Park Service where the visitor center and administrative \nfacility will be constructed.\n  The launch control facility and missile silo that make up the \nMinuteman Missile National Historic Site were preserved to illustrate \nthe history of the cold war and the role the Air Force's Minuteman II \nmissile defense system played in efforts to preserve world peace. \nConstruction of a visitor center will help tell this story and allow \nmany more to learn about this historic site. I was pleased to help \nestablish Minuteman Missile as part of the national park system in \n1999, and I am now glad to be able to follow through on fully \ndeveloping resources for visitors.\n\n[[Page S11120]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11120-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 333--DESIGNATING EACH OF SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 2009, \n  AND SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 2010, AS ``NATIONAL WOUNDED WARRIOR DAY''\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 334\n\n       Whereas Thanksgiving Day celebrates the spirit of selfless \n     giving and an appreciation for family and friends;\n       Whereas the spirit of Thanksgiving Day is a virtue upon \n     which the Nation was founded;\n       Whereas according to the Department of Agriculture, roughly \n     35,000,000 people in the United States, including 12,000,000 \n     children, continue to live in households that do not have an \n     adequate supply of food; and\n       Whereas selfless sacrifice breeds a genuine spirit of \n     thanksgiving, both affirming and restoring fundamental \n     principles in our society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates Thursday, November 19, 2009, as ``Feed \n     America Day''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to sacrifice \n     2 meals on Thursday, November 19, 2009, and to donate the \n     money that they would have spent on such food to a religious \n     or charitable organization of their choice for the purpose of \n     feeding the hungry.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak regarding an effort \nthat I have supported for a number of years and something I am very \nproud to have championed in the Senate for over 4 years. I speak, of \nFeed America Day. More than just the recognition of a single day, the \nFeed America campaign is a nationwide effort promoted by a number of \ncharitable organizations and supported by numerous communities \nthroughout the country. It is aimed at encouraging our Nation's spirit \nof selflessness and sacrifice in order to help those in need.\n  Those who participate in Feed America Day encourage all Americans to \nsacrifice two meals on the Thursday before Thanksgiving Day and to \ndonate the money they would have used for food to a charity or \nreligious organization in their community for the purpose of feeding \nthe Hungry. In a simple and practical way, this is an effort to harness \nthe generosity of the American people in the spirit of the Thanksgiving \nseason.\n  We live in the most prosperous nation on the planet. Even in the face \nof our current difficulties, that remains true. Yet, according to the \nDepartment of Agriculture's most recent numbers, roughly 35 million \nAmericans, including 12 million children, live in households that do \nnot have an adequate supply of food. I think we can all agree that it \nis a good idea to encourage the American people to do more for the \nhungry in their communities, even if we don't always agree as to what \nCongress should do on such matters.\n  Today, I have submitted a resolution that would designate Thursday, \nNovember 19, 2009, as Feed America Day. Once passed, this will be the \nfifth consecutive year that this day has been recognized by the Senate. \nI want to personally thank Senator Tom Udall from New Mexico for all \nhis efforts in supporting and promoting this resolution and we are \njoined by Senators Bennett, Crapo, Lugar, and Reed. I urge my Senate \ncolleagues and every American to join me in helping to assist those in \nneed and affirming the long-standing values that have made our Nation \ngreat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/04/senate-section/article/S11120-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 335--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 29, 2009, AS ``DRIVE SAFER \n                                SUNDAY''\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON (for himself and Mr. Chambliss) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.
