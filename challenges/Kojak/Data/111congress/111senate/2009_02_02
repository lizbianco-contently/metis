Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will \nturn to consideration of H.R. 1, the Economic Recovery Act of 2009.\n  At 3:15 p.m. today, the Senate will proceed to executive session to \nconsider the nomination of Eric Holder to be United States Attorney \nGeneral. The time until 6:15 p.m. will be equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senator Leahy and Senator Specter or their \ndesignees. At 6:15 p.m. the Senate will vote on the Holder \nconfirmation.\n  This week, Senators should expect long days with votes on numerous \namendments as the Senate considers the economic recovery legislation.\n  I am going to make a few remarks on the Attorney General nomination, \nbut let me say this. Senators Baucus and Inouye are going to be \nmanaging the bill, because it is equally divided between appropriations \nmatters and finance matters. We are going to work, starting today, with \nthem making statements--and I haven't finalized this with the \nRepublican leader yet--but I think for tonight it will be debate only, \nafter the Holder nomination, and then tomorrow we will move to \namendments.\n  We are going to have as many amendments as people feel are \nappropriate on this legislation, without any prejudgment as to what \namendments are good or bad. I have worked something out so that on \nWednesday Senator Inouye has agreed to be here at the time when we are \nat our annual retreat, which is right close to Capitol Hill. We will \ncome in about 10:30 and that will be over about 3 p.m., in the \nafternoon, but there is no reason why the Republicans can't offer \namendments on Wednesday. So we should be able to move this along quite \nwell.\n  We will try to be as understanding of everyone's schedules, \nespecially the committees, so that, if necessary, we will try to stack \nsome votes. I say to my distinguished Republican colleague that we are \nwilling to have a number of amendments pending at a given time; we just \nhave to be careful that we don't get so many pending it is \nunmanageable. But we will be happy to work on this.\n  Before I say anything about the Attorney General nomination, I wish \nto ask my friend if he has anything to say about the schedule.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend the majority leader that the two \nmanagers on this side will be Senators Cochran and Grassley, of the two \nrelevant committees.\n  I appreciate very much the thought about Wednesday. My Members are \nanxious to offer amendments, and that gives us an opportunity to do \nthat during the day on Wednesday, even though your conference is tied \nup. It would be my hope that we could vote Wednesday night and process \namendments. This is such a big week, and such an important measure, as \nwe all know, that I have told my Members--and I hope it is the case--\nthat after tonight, all bets are off in terms of working in the \nevening, and my Members are expecting that to happen. I ask my friend \nthe majority leader if it is his view that is the way we will operate \nthis week?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. We should tomorrow have a very long, hard day, and \nWednesday, even though there are a few hours that a lot of Democrats\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\nwon't be in and we won't be able to have votes, in the evening we can \nhave as many votes as we need. There is no reason we can't work into \nthe night and then come back on Thursday.\n  There are some important things going on this weekend, and the \nRepublican leader and I have talked about that. We will be as \nunderstanding as we can of everybody's schedule, but I do remind \neveryone that the Presidents Day recess is coming up. We have been here \n6 weeks, and we not only have obligations here but we have obligations \nat home. There is work we have to do at home, but we are not going to \nbe able to do that important work until we finish this economic \nrecovery legislation. So we are going to be as thoughtful and as \nconsiderate on both sides as necessary.\n  I have to say, Mr. President, as far as the managers of this \nlegislation, we are in the majority at this time, but it wasn't long \nago that Senator Cochran and Senator Grassley were chairmen of those \ncommittees. These are four of the most respected, knowledgeable, and \nexperienced managers we could have, the four people we have mentioned--\nInouye, Baucus, Specter, and Cochran. So there is no reason that these \npeople, with the experience they have, can't help us move through this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. May I ask the majority leader one other question?\n  I have a very short statement, unrelated to the Holder nomination, if \nthe majority leader wouldn't mind.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to have the Senator do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/02/senate-section/article/S1236-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

On the same subject, Mr. President, I think we all \nagree it is important to jump-start the economy, and this week we will \nhave the opportunity, as the majority leader and I have been \ndiscussing, to have full debate and many amendments on how to do that \nand how to improve on the bill passed by the House.\n  Republicans agree with President Obama that we should trim things out \nthat don't put people back to work. The standard he set for this bill \nis pretty simple and easy to understand. He wanted to incorporate good \nRepublican ideas and trim the fat that won't put people to work right \nnow. I think that is a pretty good principle. Republicans believe a \nstimulus bill must fix the main problem in the economy, which is \nhousing. We need to fix housing first.\n  Republicans also believe we must put money back into the pockets of \ntaxpayers, and we believe we must eliminate wasteful spending from this \npackage.\n  The American people have real questions about the merits of spending \ntens of millions of dollars sprucing up government buildings here in \nWashington, for example, or removing fish barriers, rather than growing \nthe economy and creating jobs. We will have an opportunity to further \ncraft this measure as it moves through the Senate. Republicans are \nanxious to offer amendments, have debate, and have votes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank the majority leader for \ndeferring to me for a moment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in the long and lurching march toward \nequality that in no small manner defines our progress as a nation, this \nmoment in history will be remembered as a golden age. The election of \nBarack Obama fulfills a dream that seemed unimaginable a generation \nago, or even a few years ago. A child born today will have every reason \nto believe the old adage that in America any boy or girl can grow up to \nbe President.\n  To join him in governing our country, President Obama has chosen a \nbrilliant, honorable, and exceptionally well qualified individual to \nserve as Attorney General of the United States. With historic \nchallenges facing the Department of Justice, I urge all my colleagues \nto support the nomination of Eric Holder.\n  What began as a one-man, part-time office to represent the United \nStates in Supreme Court trials, the Attorney General now has been \ntransformed over the years to be the lead agency to fight terrorism, \nprosecute crime, and uphold the fundamental rights of every citizen.\n  In 1957, with the civil rights movement growing and conflicts \nbubbling in all regions of our country, the Civil Rights Division of \nthe Department of Justice was established. When Congress passed the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and other \nlegislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, sex, \nhandicap, religion, or national origin, it was the Civil Rights \nDivision that ensured they would be enforced; that is, the laws passed \nwould be enforced.\n  In the fall of 1962, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy ordered U.S. \nMarshals to stand guard at the University of Mississippi so that James \nMeredith, the first African American accepted for admission, could \nenroll and attend classes peacefully amidst a violent mob of thousands.\n  In the summer of 1963, the Justice Department, led by Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Nicholas Katzenbach, confronted Governor George Wallace as he \nphysically blocked the admission of two African-American students to \nthe University of Alabama. It took the federalization of the Alabama \nNational Guard to force Governor Wallace to step aside and allow those \nstudents to enter.\n  These are only two of countless examples of the U.S. Department of \nJustice enforcing the laws of our country.\n  Although the parchment of our Constitution may be a little yellow and \nthe ink faded somewhat, as long as the Justice Department stands behind \nthe people's demands for liberty, the spirit of our Founders will never \nrecede. I have no desire to rehash the many ways the Bush \nadministration politicized and degraded the Justice Department away \nfrom its historic mission. While we must not fail to remember that sad \nchapter in our history, I am far more interested in looking toward a \nmore hopeful future.\n  With President Obama in the White House and Eric Holder leading the \nJustice Department, that brighter future begins right now. The \nexperience of this nominee is unquestioned. As a young lawyer, fresh \nout of Columbia Law School, one of the finest law schools in America, \nEric Holder accepted a job at the Justice Department. He didn't want to \nsee how much money he could make, he wanted to enter public service, \nand he did. The job he took at the Justice Department is now a \ndepartment he stands ready to lead.\n  At the time he worked there, as a young new lawyer, he was charged \nwith the unenviable task of prosecuting corrupt public officials who \nhad violated the public trust. This kind of work can be thankless and \npolitically sensitive, but from a young age Eric Holder showed the \ncourage to stand for the public interest no matter the personal or \npolitical cost.\n  In 1988, Eric Holder was appointed by President Reagan to be a judge \nin the District of Columbia Superior Court. In this capacity he \npresided over countless trials involving violent crimes and murder, \nproving himself to be a fair and tough administrator of justice.\n  In 1993, President Clinton chose Eric Holder as U.S. Attorney for the \nDistrict of Columbia, where he focused on improving some of Washington, \nDC's most crime-ridden neighborhoods by locking up wrongdoers and \ninvolving communities in law enforcement.\n  As Deputy U.S. Attorney General starting in 1997, Holder showed \nfearlessness in prosecuting crimes against children, white-collar \ncrimes, and crime in general. During his tenure as Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, Mr. Holder was also faced with the difficult decision of how \nto advise Attorney General Janet Reno on the investigation that led to \nthe impeachment of President Clinton. He chose to urge the Attorney \nGeneral to expand the investigation to ensure that all facts would come \nto light. He was harshly criticized by members of his own party for \ncausing political trouble for the President.\n  But in this decision, Eric Holder again showed the courage to uphold \nperhaps the most important principle for any Justice Department \nofficial: answering to the people first.\n\n[[Page S1237]]\n\n  There is no question that a difficult job awaits our next Attorney \nGeneral. He must strengthen the fight against terrorism, he must do \nmore to keep our streets and boardrooms safe from crime, and rebuild \nthe Justice Department to be once again a guardian of the common good. \nEric Holder has proven that he has the courage and wisdom to do justice \nto this critical job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/02/senate-section/article/S1237-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Inouye and Baucus, I \ncall up amendment 98 and ask unanimous consent that once the amendment \nis offered, no further amendments be in order during today's session of \nthe Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Inouye and Mr. \n     Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 98.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Friday, January 20, 2009, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This bill will create 4 million \nAmerican jobs, invest in the future of America by rebuilding our roads, \nbridges and schools, and will give State and local governments the \nresources they need to deal with surging demand for social services and \nfalling tax revenues.\n  Further, this measure will provide tax cuts to working families who \nare struggling every day to cope with this terrible recession.\n  Today, we face the gravest economic crisis that this Nation has seen \nsince the Great Depression. Our fourth quarter gross domestic product \nshrank by 3.8 percent, the largest drop since 1982.\n  A million jobs have been lost in the past 2 months, and this coming \nFriday we expect to learn that during the month of January, another \n600,000 jobs, at a minimum, have been lost.\n  The American people fully understand the depth and seriousness of our \neconomic problems.\n  U.S. foreclosures increased by more than 81 percent last year, a \nrecord, with over 2.3 million foreclosures. Our States are struggling \nterribly, facing the prospect of cutting off vital services, including \nschools and police.\n  Forty-four States are facing budget shortfalls totaling $90 billion \nfor fiscal year 2009 and $145 billion for fiscal year 2010.\n  In 2008, U.S. stocks lost roughly $7 trillion in value. In an \ninstant, the life savings of millions of Americans simply disappeared. \nOur banking system is in grave shape. Last year, 25 banks with $373.6 \nbillion in total assets failed in the U.S.\n  All the while, the critical needs of our Nation are going unmet. The \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers--ASCE--estimates that $2.2 trillion \nis needed over a 5-year period to bring the Nation's infrastructure to \nan adequate condition.\n  How can we grow our economy and provide opportunities for today's \nworking men and women if the basic physical infrastructure that \nunderlies every job in this country is falling apart?\n  We must invest in our future by making the necessary commitments to \nensure that our infrastructure will support our future economic growth.\n  But today, we face a much more immediate crisis. In Saturday's New \nYork Times, economist Allen Sinai stated:\n\n       My sense is that business is slashing hugely and across the \n     board. Everyone is cutting prices, people, capital spending \n     and all kinds of expenses. It is almost a herd instinct.\n\n  There is nothing more destructive to economic growth than deflation. \nIt was the defining characteristic of the Great Depression, and it is \nthe single most difficult economic condition to reverse. We cannot \nallow a deflationary spiral to develop.\n  Only one institution in the United States, the Federal Government, \nhas the capacity to step into the breach and stop the terrible spiral \nof increased layoffs leading to decreased spending, in turn leading to \nmore layoffs and so on.\n  The Federal Government must take aggressive action. We must use all \nmeans at our disposal to address this deepening crisis.\n  Some argue that this is all part of the natural business cycle, that \nthe best course of action is to stand back and let this crisis work \nitself out. I would remind those who take this position that the Great \nDepression was also a part of the natural business cycle.\n  President Hoover refused to take aggressive action, and the results \nspeak for themselves.\n  It was not until President Roosevelt took office in 1933 and \nimplemented a series of drastic policy reforms that the economy slowly \nbegan to improve, and, almost as important, gave the average American \nreason to believe that there was a light at the end of the tunnel.\n  We must act boldly, decisively, and with all possible speed, or we \nwill face dire consequences. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nis the answer. This legislation will not only create jobs now, but will \nalso begin the process of rebuilding the physical infrastructure of \nAmerica that is the key to future prosperity.\n  Based on these needs, The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nfocuses on the following goals:\n  First, creating or saving at least 4 million jobs;\n  Second, investing in America's future by rebuilding our basic \ninfrastructure.\n  Third, providing for job retraining for those workers who need to \nlearn new skills in order to compete in the global economy today, while \nat the same time, improving the education of our children and young \nadults so Americans can remain competitive tomorrow;\n  Fourth, moving toward energy independence and away from burning \nfossil fuels that leave us dependent on foreign oil;\n  Fifth, improving our healthcare system so all Americans can have \naccess to quality treatment;\n  Sixth, providing tax cuts and other means of assistance to lessen the \nimpact of this crisis on America's working families.\n  To meet these goals the Finance and Appropriations Committees \nrecommend a total of $888 billion in funding, including $365.6 billion \nin new appropriations. This is a significant amount of money, but an \namount that we believe is wholly necessary to confront the challenges \nfacing our Nation.\n  My distinguished colleague from Montana will address the tax and \nmandatory spending issues that we are recommending and I will address \nthe spending programs that were approved by the Appropriations \nCommittee by a vote of 21 to 9.\n  It would take far too long to describe in detail the hundreds of \nprograms that are included in this bill, but I would like to take a \nmoment to mention some of the more significant investments that we \nrecommend.\n  We will invest in our future by funding projects that will rebuild \nand improve our physical and cyber infrastructure. These projects, \ntotaling $142 billion, will create jobs in the near-term, and will \nprovide an improved foundation for future growth by fixing our \ncrumbling roads, bridges, and schools, improving our broadband network, \nand increasing our ability to conserve energy.\n  America's tradition of public education is second-to-none, but it has \nbeen sadly underfunded in recent years. We all know that for the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S1238]]\n\nto compete in the 21st century, Americans must be well-educated and \ncapable of adapting to an ever-changing economic environment.\n  Accordingly, we recommend investing $125 billion in education and \ntraining so that the next generation of American workers is ready and \nable to meet the challenge of global competition. In addition, \nproviding job training to recently laid-off workers in new and \nexpanding fields will help to lower the unemployment rate and will \nallow today's workers to better compete against foreign competition.\n  In the area of energy, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nprovides $49 billion in investments in areas critical to the \ndevelopment of clean, efficient, American energy, including modernizing \nenergy transmission, research and development of renewable energy \ntechnologies, and modernizing and upgrading government buildings and \nvehicles.\n  The current economic crisis has affected all Americans, but none more \nso than the most vulnerable among us. The $25 billion in spending \nproposed here will serve to lessen the blow of the current recession, \nproviding immediate relief for children, the poor, and others who may \nfind themselves struggling to put food on the table or a roof over \ntheir head.\n  The bill provides $16 billion in investments in areas critical to \nimmediate and long-term healthcare for millions of Americans. Improved \ninformation technology, research facilities, and health and wellness \nprograms will all provide a better foundation for providing quality \nhealthcare to consumers.\n  We face a critical period in our Nation's history. The next few years \nwill either see us emerge from this crisis with renewed vigor and with \nan economy that remains the leading engine of global growth, or we may \nface years of slow growth and an ongoing struggle just to maintain our \ncurrent standard of living.\n  Clearly, the goal of this package is to find ways to stimulate the \nprivate sector through public sector spending, to jump start the \nprivate sector with much needed projects that will create jobs as soon \nas possible, and that will provide meaningful improvements for our \ncommunities.\n  At the same time, we seek to ensure that the funds that are \nappropriated in this legislation are spent carefully and with \nunprecedented transparency. We include $110 million in the bill to \nincrease the resources of agency Inspectors General and the Government \nAccountability Office.\n  In addition, this measure would establish a new oversight board \nwithin the executive branch which will be charged with oversight of the \nfunding provided in this bill.\n  Such times as these are only overcome with courageous leadership and \na willingness to embrace change, listen to new ideas and take chances. \nThis bill is not perfect. But we must not let our fear of imperfection \nstop us from taking the bold steps necessary to address this crisis and \nmove America forward.\n  The time for action is now. The American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct of 2009 is the right policy at the right time, and I urge each and \nevery Member of this body to join me in support of creating jobs, \nsupporting our State and local governments, and investing in the future \nof America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I first want to commend my colleagues, \nSenator Inouye from Hawaii, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, who I think has undertaken a masterful job in helping to \ncraft, along with his counterpart, Senator Cochran from Mississippi, an \neconomic recovery package that will go a long way toward getting people \nback to work.\n  They have done half of the job; the other half was left to the \nFinance Committee. I think together we have come up with a very good \nbeginning to get Americans back to work and to invest in many of the \nprojects this country needs so desperately.\n  In 1932, President Franklin Roosevelt said:\n\n       The country needs and . . . the country demands bold, \n     persistent experimentation. . . . [A]bove all, try something. \n     The millions who are in want will not stand idly by silently \n     forever . . . .\n\n  Today, the country once again demands bold action. Our country \ndemands bold action to help rebuild a very badly damaged American \neconomy.\n  Consider the terrible blows to our economy and the problems that we \nface if we do not act.\n  Last Friday the Commerce Department reported that from October \nthrough December of last year the economy shrank at its fastest pace in \na quarter century.\n  Last year 2.6 million people lost their jobs. If we do not act, 3 to \n4 million more people will lose their jobs.\n  The decline in home prices and the stock market collapse have sharply \nreduced the net worth of American families. Net worth declined by \nroughly one-fifth between the middle of 2007 and the fourth quarter of \n2008.\n  CBO projects that the national average home price will fall by \nanother 14 percent between the third quarter of 2008 and the middle of \n2010.\n  Equity wealth has declined by $6 trillion between the end of 2007 and \nthe end of 2008.\n  The Standard and Poor's 500 stock index fell by almost 45 percent \nfrom October 2007 to December 2008.\n  And the financial crisis has spread around the world.\n  These are not just numbers. These are families who are hurting. These \nare mothers and fathers who have lost jobs. These are parents who have \nseen college savings decimated. These are couples who are struggling to \nkeep their homes.\n  We need to act. This economic recovery bill will save or create 3 to \n4 million jobs. It will position our economy to be more competitive. \nThe measure before us today provides an appropriate response to the \nconditions that we face.\n  The Senate Finance Committee worked with the President and Members of \nthe Senate and the House to put together its part of the economic \nrecovery substitute that we are considering this week. The Senate \nAppropriations Committee took the lead on its part, as well.\n  We think that the provisions in this substitute represent the best \nways to address spending slowdowns and rising unemployment.\n  And it will be effective. More than 99 percent of the Finance \nCommittee's provisions effects will come in the first 2 years of the \nbill.\n  To counteract weak consumer demand and spending slowdowns, we have \nincluded several proposals that will put more cash in the pockets of \nAmerica's taxpayers, seniors, and disabled veterans.\n  The making work pay tax credit cuts taxes for more than 95 percent of \nAmerican working families. It gives single taxpayers up to $500 and \nmarried taxpayers up to $1,000 this year and next in additional cash \nthat they can use just now.\n  People will be able to receive the benefit throughout the year \nthrough a reduction in the amount of income tax withheld from their \npaychecks.\n  Seniors, disabled veterans, other disabled workers, and SSI \nrecipients would receive a one-time payment of $300.\n  Families with children would also benefit from these proposals. The \nincome threshold to receive the refundable child tax credit would be \nreduced so that more people would be eligible. The earned income tax \ncredit would be increased for families with three or more children.\n  An amendment added in the Finance Committee will ensure that the \nalternative minimum tax will not hit any new taxpayers for 1 more year.\n  Folks struggling to pay for higher education would get relief. The \nproposal includes a partially-refundable new tax credit up to $2,500 \nfor the cost of tuition and fees, including books. Section 529 plans \nwould be enhanced by including the cost of computers as a qualifying \nexpense.\n  This measure would help homeowners who are taking advantage of the \nfirst-time homebuyer's credit enacted last year. Under current law, \nhomebuyers have to pay this credit back over 10 years. The substitute \nbefore us today would eliminate the repayment obligation, unless the \nhomebuyer sells the home within 36 months of the purchase.\n  For small businesses, we have included expanded expensing through \nsection 179. This provision helps small businesses quickly recover the \ncost of certain capital expenses.\n\n[[Page S1239]]\n\n  For businesses in general, we would increase the years that they can \ncarry back losses and general business credits. This would put cash in \nthe hands of businesses right now.\n  Businesses would also get a tax incentive through the work \nopportunity tax credit for hiring unemployed veterans and disadvantaged \nyouth.\n  The economic downturn has frozen the municipal bond market. This \nrecovery bill includes changes that would help to free up this market, \nunlocking cash for infrastructure investment.\n  Banks would be able to inject more capital into projects creating \ndemand for municipal bonds, driving down interest rates. And increasing \nthe small issuer exception would increase the range of municipalities \nfrom which banks can buy.\n  This substitute would also eliminate tax-exempt interest on private \nactivity bonds as a preference item under the alternative minimum tax. \nThis would draw new investors and help stabilize the market.\n  The legislation would also establish parity for tribal governments on \n$2 billion of tax-exempt bonds. This important change would allow \ntribal governments to issue debt for projects on equal footing with \nother government issuers.\n  And this substitute would create a new tax-credit bond option. This \nnew bond would give State and local governments a new tool to finance \ninfrastructure projects.\n  We have also included incentives for energy in this recovery package. \nThese incentives would create green jobs producing the next generation \nof renewable energy sources, wind, solar, geothermal.\n  The substitute would extend and modify the renewable energy \nproduction tax credit for qualifying facilities.\n  The substitute includes additional funding for clean renewable energy \nbonds to finance facilities that generate electricity from renewable \nresources. And the substitute includes conservation bonds for States to \nuse to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Energy experts often cite efficiency as the low-hanging fruit. \nEfficiency is the easiest way for us to reduce our energy consumption \nand greenhouse gas emissions.\n  So we have included incentives for energy efficiency. The substitute \nwould increase the value of the existing credit for energy efficient \nhomes. The substitute would eliminate the limitations on specific \nenergy-efficient property. And the substitute would extend the credits \nfor various types of energy efficient property, for both residential \nand business.\n  Two new tax credits would spur our alternative energy and production.\n  The advanced energy research and development credit would provide an \nenhanced 20 percent R credit for research expenditures incurred in \nthe fields of fuel cells, energy storage, renewable energy, energy \nconservation technology, efficient transmission and distribution of \nelectricity, and carbon capture and sequestration.\n  The second energy tax credit is an advanced energy investment credit \nfor facilities engaged in the manufacture of advanced energy property.\n  This substitute would make sound investments in health information \ntechnology, or health I.T. These investments should reduce costs, \nimprove quality, and help patients make better decisions about their \nhealth care. Expanding use of health I.T. should make our health care \nsystem more efficient, reduce errors, and help bring down costs.\n  Health I.T. would also provide a platform for standardizing and \ncollecting data to move toward paying for performance, another way to \nimprove efficiency and decrease costs.\n  Investing in health I.T. will help to put that infrastructure in \nplace, while creating thousands of high-tech jobs.\n  And reforming health care is the right way to get a handle on \nentitlement spending.\n  The economic crisis has also created significant fiscal difficulties \nfor States. At least 45 States will face budget shortfalls. Economists \nexpect those shortfalls to total more than $350 billion over the next 2 \nyears.\n  These dire circumstances have forced painful choices. Almost half the \nStates have already made or proposed cuts to their Medicaid Programs.\n  The continued rise in unemployment places a further strain on \nMedicaid. Decreased revenue coming in means less money to fund \nMedicaid. And experts warn that every percentage point increase in \nunemployment adds 1 million people to the Medicaid and CHIP rolls.\n  Economists tell us that State fiscal relief is an effective means to \nstimulate the economy. And they also advise that targeted relief to \nthose most in need, not based on circumstances of States' own making \nbut based on true measures of distress, is the best means of \ndistribution.\n  The substitute before us today would provide much-needed relief to \nevery State through a temporary increase in the Federal share of \nMedicaid funding. The substitute would also provide additional aid \ntargeted to States facing the most precarious fiscal situations, \nmeasured by an increase in unemployment.\n  These measures will keep States from having to lay off cops or \nteachers. And keeping those workers on the job will help the economy.\n  The economic recovery package also supports those who have lost \nemployment and helps them to find new jobs.\n  While almost all workers pay into the unemployment insurance program, \nonly about half of them qualify for benefits. American workers deserve \nbetter. The substitute before us would increase and extend benefits to \nthose currently looking for work.\n  The substitute before us would help States to cope with the \nincreasing number of families needing temporary assistance. And it \nwould remove the incentive for States to artificially keep their TANF \ncaseloads low.\n  In addition, the substitute would ensure that families that qualify \ncould continue to receive child support payments that are intended to \nbe spent on children. For those who receive it, child support \nconstitutes about 30 percent of poor families' income.\n  The substitute before us would also increase the incentive to become \nemployed by extending the transitional medical assistance program under \nMedicaid for 18 months. TMA allows former TANF recipients to retain \nMedicaid coverage for one year after they become employed. These \nworkers usually earn too little to afford private coverage.\n  The substitute before us would also remove barriers to getting \nMedicaid and CHIP for low-income American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  The funds directed toward these programs for vulnerable populations \nwould go into the hands of folks who need it and who will spend it \nright away. These proposals will increase economic activity, create \njobs, and shorten the amount of time that we all spend in this economic \ncrisis.\n  Another key component of our economic recovery package would help \nunemployed workers maintain their health coverage.\n  When workers lose their jobs, they lose more than their paychecks. \nThey often lose their health insurance coverage, as well.\n  To address this problem, our proposal includes help for unemployed \nworkers to pay for their health care premiums.\n  Today, most workers who lose their jobs have the right to keep their \nhealth insurance for up to 18 months under the COBRA program. But to be \neligible for COBRA health benefits, workers must pay all of the premium \ncosts, plus an additional 2 percent for administrative costs. For most \nfolks who have just lost their job, this is simply unaffordable.\n  Our plan would provide a subsidy to cover up to 65 percent of health \npremium costs, for up to 9 months.\n  This premium subsidy is shortterm. It would be available only to \nunemployed workers while they look for a new job.\n  For those workers who lose their jobs to international trade, \nPresident Kennedy established trade adjustment assistance, or TAA. I \nhave long championed TAA and worked to expand its reach and improve its \neffectiveness. Today, TAA gives workers the chance to retrain for new \njobs, get access to health care, and ultimately get back to work. And \nthat is why the substitute before us today includes a 2-year extension \nof TAA.\n  Yet in a time when Americans are doing everything they can to change, \nadapt, and be flexible in a global economy, TAA should do the same.\n  We can do more to expand who can benefit from TAA, and we can improve\n\n[[Page S1240]]\n\nhow we get them those benefits. That is why I am working with Senator \nGrassley, Chairman Rangel, and Congressman Camp on a robust expansion \nof TAA. We hope to include this improved TAA in the economic recovery \npackage before it is enacted.\n  The package that we are considering this week is our best effort to \nreach a consensus on an economic recovery bill that can pass the Senate \nand the House quickly.\n  The Nation demands action and action now. Let us act quickly to put \nour economy back on track. Let us act to restore the Nation's financial \nhealth. And let us act pass this important legislation this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, the bill now before the Senate provides \n$365 billion in new spending reported by the Appropriations Committee \nand $522 billion in tax and mandatory spending measures recommended by \nthe Finance Committee. The bill as a whole has a price tag of $887 \nbillion. When the borrowing costs associated with this spending are \nincluded, the cost of the package rises well over $1.2 trillion. The \nPresident has suggested that even more measures such as this, other \nrequests to stimulate the financial system, may be needed to \nresuscitate the housing market and reform financial regulatory \ninstitutions. We don't know what the cost of all of these measures will \nbe, but it sounds as if we may be asked to enlarge these commitments \neven further as time goes by.\n  Proponents of this bill say that the fiscal cost of inaction is also \nsubstantial. They argue that failure to enact the bill will lead to \nlower growth and diminished tax receipts. Yet there is little \ndocumentation to back up that claim. Those suggestions have not been \ndescribed in any detail by administration officials or their economic \nexperts.\n  In size alone, this measure has few precedents. We are considering \nthis bill in the absence of any formal request or documentation from \nthe executive branch. This bill has been described as President Obama's \nrecovery plan. Yet we have not had an official request from the \nadministration for these funds. I am not one who believes Congress must \nalways wait for the executive branch to lead, but with regard to this \nbill, we are giving the executive branch immense latitude in the \ndisbursement of the spending it contains. We are doing so without any \nofficial request and without any documentation that speaks to the issue \nof how this spending will stimulate the economy or what the long-term \nimplications of the spending will be. Normally, this kind of \ninformation would be contained in an administration budget or \nsupplemental request. For items that are well understood to have a \nshort-term stimulative effect, most of us will feel comfortable \ndebating their merits as part of an emergency measure. But there is a \ngreat deal of spending in this bill that is not immediately \nstimulative.\n  The majority describes it as investments in our Nation's future. We \nhave the responsibility to be deliberate and consider these items \ncarefully in the context of the President's formal budget request.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who is my \ndear friend, made a sincere effort to accommodate priorities expressed \nby Republican members of the committee and others who are not on the \ncommittee and to respond to some of their concerns. He resisted efforts \nto clutter the bill with controversial policy initiatives that might \ndetract from the focus of the legislation or slow down the progress of \nthe bill. He also insisted on a committee markup of the bill. All of \nthese actions demonstrate his unquestioned sense of fairness.\n  The fact remains, however, that the Senate is being asked by the \nadministration to take a big leap of faith that the massive spending \nproposed in this bill will, in fact, stimulate growth of the economy, \neven though much of the funding will not be spent in the next year or \ntwo.\n  We are all searching for solutions that will help the economy in the \nshort term. Yet we must consider the long-term effects of any so-called \nstimulative actions we take today. Will the jobs associated with these \nproposals be created just as the economy is recovering, causing \ninflationary pressures that may not be welcome 2 years from now? What \nwill be the impacts on Federal borrowing costs of this additional \ndeficit spending, particularly once recovery is underway and we are no \nlonger able to borrow money as cheaply as we are now? And perhaps of \ngreatest concern, is it reasonable to expect stimulus spending to cease \nafter 18 months or 2 years' time? The Federal Government's track record \nfor terminating programs is not very good.\n  Let me share some of the provisions of this specific legislation. \nThere are well over 20 new spending initiatives and programs that are \neither being authorized in this bill or being funded for the first \ntime. These programs account for over $230 billion of the appropriated \nspending in the bill.\n  The bill allocates $16 billion to build and repair local schools, \nsomething which has not before been considered the responsibility of \nthe Federal Government. That is a State and local responsibility.\n  The bill provides $9 billion to construct broadband infrastructure \nthroughout the country, even as it requires development of a plan to \nactually spend this money, and the creation of a broadband \ninfrastructure map that might inform development of that plan. Is this \nputting the cart before the horse or at least maybe putting it \nalongside the horse?\n  The bill appropriates $23 billion to create an improved health \ninformation technology system, virtually from scratch. This is not a 1- \nor 2-year project; it is an expensive, long-term program for which \nthere is barely a foundation. Yet we are putting taxpayers on the hook \nfor $23 billion.\n  The bill invests heavily in science and energy programs. Like many of \nmy colleagues in the Senate, I supported passage of the America \nCOMPETES Act during the last Congress. The goal of that legislation was \nto ensure that science education in America is of a quality that will \nsustain our economy in the 21st century. I also supported passage of \nEnergy bills in the last 5 years in the hope that they would enhance \nour Nation's energy security. Yet I did not support any of these bills \nwith the expectation that their various elements would be immediately \nfunded in their entirety or that they would be funded outside the \ncontext of our Federal budget, the regular annual process.\n  Like most Senators, I assumed we would evaluate the merits of the \nindividual programs as part of the annual budget and appropriations \nprocess. Even if this spending may be entirely appropriate, it is \nreckless to be providing it in the absence of any budgetary context and \nhaving done very little due diligence.\n  Much of the spending will have little stimulative effect. Projected \nspend-out rates are very slow. The Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice observed in a January 28 letter to the chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee:\n\n       Throughout the federal government, spending for new \n     programs has frequently been slower than expected and rarely \n     been faster.\n\n  Is our putting it in this one bill going to change that? What will be \nthe cost of these programs 5 years from now? If we control the overall \nlevel of discretionary spending in future years, what programs and \npriorities will these new initiatives displace? If the spending is \nentirely additive, what are the impacts of that spending on our \nnational debt or on future tax rates? These questions are difficult to \nanswer without supporting documentation and without having held any \nhearings.\n  It seems to me there will be time enough to consider these long-term \ninvestments in the regular order and in the context of future Federal \nbudgets.\n  As former Clinton Budget Director Alice Rivlin recently testified:\n\n       . . . a long-term investment program should not be put \n     together hastily and lumped with an anti-recession package. \n     The elements of the investment program must be carefully \n     planned and will not create many jobs right away.\n\n  Yet it is not just these new programs that should concern us. This \nbill also greatly expands a number of programs such as Head Start, Pell \ngrants, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. These are \nall programs with merit. I have supported them all, with supporters on \nboth sides of the aisle each year approving bills to extend the \nauthorizations and fund the programs. But the question is, Do they\n\n[[Page S1241]]\n\nstimulate the economy? How? Is it realistic to expect funding levels \nfor these programs to revert to today's levels once the economy \nrecovers? I think it is safe to expect just the opposite.\n  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, cochaired by former \nCongressman Bill Frenzel, my friend, and another of President Clinton's \nformer Budget Directors, Leon Panetta, another friend, recently warned \nof this danger. Speaking of stimulus recommendations like planting \ngrass on the national mall, the committee said such things are ``a \ndistraction from the bigger risks in this bill.''\n  More troubling is the number of items in the stimulus plan that are \nreally intended to be permanent new policies rather than temporary \nitems to help boost the economy.\n  They said:\n\n       While we need deficit spending now, extending out borrowing \n     beyond the economic downturn will make our already-dismal \n     fiscal picture far, far worse.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The economy simply can't handle that. There is a very real \n     risk that many of these items will become a permanent part of \n     the budget and unless Congress suddenly shows an \n     uncharacteristic willingness to pay for the new items, the \n     deficit will deteriorate even further.\n\n  The committee they chaired went on to say:\n\n       Many of these items may be worthwhile, but an emergency \n     measure is the wrong way to push through permanent changes to \n     the budget. If politicians want to enact long-term spending \n     or tax policies, they should be enacted through the normal \n     legislative process.\n\n  I think that is very well put. I think we ought to pay attention to \nwhat people like that are saying.\n  The President's Chief of Staff recently said--probably in jest, maybe \nin jest--\n\n       You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\n\n  Well, clearly we are seeing the efforts by some--and I am not saying \nthe President's Chief of Staff--to use this stimulus bill to achieve \nlong-term objectives that go beyond addressing our short-term economic \npolicies and problems.\n  But we agree--I think all Senators agree--the economy is under severe \npressure and Congress should take quick but sharply focused action to \ndo those things we are confident will have an immediate stimulative \nimpact on the economy and improve economic prospects. We should address \nthe housing problem that seems to be the central problem in this \ncrisis. We should not, however, rush headlong into fiscal commitments \nthat may haunt us for years to come.\n  If Federal spending on infrastructure and other programs is truly \nstimulative, is it not unfortunate Congress has failed to enact 9 of \nthe 12 regular appropriations bills for this fiscal year? These bills \naccount for almost half of all discretionary spending. Yet the agencies \nand programs supported by those bills have essentially been idling for \n4 months under a continuing resolution. This is funding at last year's \napproved levels of spending; whereas, if enactment had taken place in a \ntimely fashion by this Congress--this Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives working together--we would have much of this money that \nhas previously been budgeted and approved by committees, approved by \nthe Congress.\n  Funding contained in those bills is for projects such as roads, \nbridges, water projects, Federal buildings, and other activities that \nmight provide jobs now, and they have been held in abeyance under the \nterms of a continuing resolution, which is continuing this fiscal year \nto spend at the levels appropriated for spending during the last fiscal \nyear.\n  That is not something that can be laid at the feet of President Bush. \nThat is the Congress. We hear a lot of criticism of the former \nPresident, such as he is the reason for all this. We need to look at \nourselves. Congress did not even try to enact the bills. The bicameral \nleadership made a conscious decision not to engage the former President \non spending issues or Outer Continental Shelf oil-and-gas leasing--\nanother example of something that could be labeled ``stimulative.''\n  Had we enacted those appropriations bills last fall, agencies would \nalready be contracting, hiring, and spending their funding allocations. \nThis week we would be having a debate probably about the merits of \nsupplementing some of those allocations of Federal funds. Instead, we \nare considering a bill that supplements many existing programs without \nMembers even knowing what the regular appropriations bills contain for \nthose same programs.\n  In closing, I express my heartfelt thanks and appreciation to the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii, the chairman of our Appropriations \nCommittee, for his distinguished leadership and congratulate him on the \nway he has undertaken to respond to these emergency requests that have \nbeen submitted to the committee. He has handled it all in a fair and \nthoughtful way. It is a pleasure working with him and the other members \nof our Committee on Appropriations in the Senate.\n  We, I know, stand ready to continue to work to improve this bill, to \nlisten to suggestions of Senators for changes. It has been an open \nprocess, an open, public markup of the bill, an effort to invite \nsuggestions from any member of the committee, and now it is open for \namendment. This is no effort to railroad something through here without \ngiving individual Senators the opportunity to carefully consider \neverything in here, to ask questions of those who maybe were \nresponsible for the inclusion of certain provisions and the like. We \nare ready to take on these suggestions and consider them carefully to \nimprove this bill over the coming days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, as the Senate turns to the economic \nrecovery bill I believe there is a message coming to the Senate from \nOregon and every corner of our country. The message is that Americans \ndo not want a bailout. They do not want a handout. What they want is \nlegislation that provides a path out of these very difficult economic \ntimes.\n  I believe that, working together this week, Democrats and Republicans \ncan start building that path. I want to stress that I am especially \ninterested in working with colleagues on the other side of the aisle on \nthis critical legislation.\n  I serve on the Senate Finance Committee, led by Chairman Baucus, and \none of the best additions to this bill has been the relief that it \nprovides from the crushing alternative minimum tax. This is a killer \ntax for middle-class folks. It is something, in my view, that we ought \nto get rid of permanently and I have proposed doing that as part of \ncomprehensive tax reform. Well, as a result of the bipartisan work on \nthis legislation in the Finance Committee, there is going to be relief \nfrom the AMT for hard-hit, middle-class families.\n  There has also been important bipartisan work on the legislation's \napproach to infrastructure financing. A member of the Senate Republican \nleadership, Senator Thune of South Dakota, has worked with me to craft \nlegislation called Build America Bonds, which uses a tax credit \napproach to bonds to wring more value from every dollar that's made \navailable for infrastructure. The economic recovery bill includes a tax \ncredit bond provision that is similar to our legislation, although not \nquite the same, and I will continue to push to improve it.\n  I believe there are other ideas we are going to focus on, on the \nfloor of the Senate, that will bring Democrats and Republicans \ntogether. A number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nstressed the need to expand the legislation's support for homeowners \nand home buyers, to help make sure that people who want to stay in \ntheir homes and who are trying to buy a home can get additional relief. \nI am very pleased that colleagues on both sides of the aisle have come \ntogether to work on these kinds of ideas.\n  For this week, I think there are several key principles that we ought \nto focus on. One that I feel especially strongly about is rewarding \nsuccess. Instead of subsidizing failure, this legislation takes an \napproach that, in fact, rewards success.\n  A prime example is the extension, for 3 years, of the renewable \nenergy production tax credit. To get this tax credit, energy companies \nactually have to produce energy. As a result, American taxpayers will \nget something back for their hard-earned money. That is the kind of \naccountability that I think\n\n[[Page S1242]]\n\nthe American people have a right to expect.\n  I think the legislation rewards enterprise, and I am very pleased \nabout the bill's provision to provide enhanced writeoffs under section \n179 for small businesses that invest in plants and equipment.\n  Ultimately, what it comes down to is providing relief for middle-\nclass folks so they can get assistance during these difficult times.\n  For example, there has been discussion of the bill's supports for \nhealth information technology. One big reason that middle-class folks \ncannot get ahead is that their medical costs gobble up their paychecks \nand one of the reasons that medical costs have skyrocketed is that \nthere are so many errors in the health care system--errors and \ninefficiencies, such as duplicative tests. It seems to me that by \ninvesting in health information technology, you make a downpayment on a \nlong-term strategy for holding down medical costs and that is \nextraordinarily important to middle-class folks. So we will be talking \nabout this issue more.\n  I note the presence of the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. One of the reasons I am confident we can \napproach this issue in a bipartisan way is because that is how the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee has always worked. That has \nalso been the case with Senator Cochran, Chairman Baucus, and Senator \nGrassley.\n  We are open to the best possible ideas. That is why President Obama, \nto his credit, has been reaching out. As far as I can tell, he has that \nphone practically attached to his ear talking to colleagues and saying: \nBring us your best ideas. We have tried in the Senate Finance \nCommittee, as Chairman Inouye has done in the Appropriations Committee, \nto start incorporating good ideas, whether they come from the \nRepublican side of the aisle or the Democratic side.\n  I think we can improve this bill even more. But because it rewards \nsuccess, because it rewards enterprise, because there are already good \nideas that both parties support, I would urge colleagues to use this \nweek, working with our chairs and with the Obama administration, to \ncome together--because my view is, as I articulated, that the public \ndoes want a path out of these terrible economic times. We have a chance \nto make it clear that this is not a bailout, that it is not a handout, \nbut rather the start of a path out of this tough economic period.\n  I hope our colleagues will use this week, under the leadership of the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Chairman Baucus of the \nFinance Committee, and the ranking minority members, to make sure that \nby the end of this week we have shown the American people that this \nimportant legislation on recovery and investment is moving forward--to \ndeal with the critical needs of those we represent at home.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, as we begin the process of our \ndiscussions and debate on legislation to revitalize our Nation's \neconomy, I want to take this opportunity to underscore the points I \nmade on Tuesday of last week as we undertook the markup of the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Plan.\n  As I indicated, it is my belief that we all support the central goals \nof the legislation, which include the creation of jobs, the rebuilding \nof America's infrastructure, improving our children's education, moving \ntoward energy independence, improving our health care system, and \nlessening the burden that this crisis has brought to the most \nvulnerable among us.\n  As you well know, beginning in 1987, I served for 19 years as the \nchairman and vice chairman of the Senate's Committee on Indian \nAffairs--and in that capacity I came to know a group of American \ncitizens who have clearly been the most vulnerable amongst us--the \nindigenous, native people of the United States--American Indians, \nAlaska Natives and Native Hawaiians.\n  President Obama projects that in the near term, the nationwide \nunemployment rate could reach 10 percent. But for many of our Nation's \nFirst Americans, an unemployment rate of 10 percent in their \ncommunities would signal a giant step forward--given average \nunemployment rates in Indian country that range from 50 to 90 percent.\n  The infrastructure on many Indian reservations is not only in need of \nrebuilding--in most parts of Indian country, infrastructure is so \nsorely lacking or simply nonexistent, that it must be built for the \nfirst time. Members of Congress have come to this realization time and \nagain, as we have enacted scores of settlements of Indian land and \nwater claims over the years, and ratified agreements between State and \ntribal governments--only to find that there is none of the necessary \ninfrastructure that would enable the delivery of water to tribal lands, \nnor the jobs associated with the establishment of businesses on tribal \nlands.\n  In Indian country, another goal that this bill seeks to accomplish--\nstimulating the private sector through public sector spending--Federal \nfunding has rarely been able to achieve. And that phenomenon is also \nfundamentally a function of the lack of infrastructure--adequate roads, \nsafe water supplies, access to commercial and transportation corridors, \ngood schools and access to quality health care. These are the critical \ncomponents if we are ever to successfully encourage private sector \ninvestment in Native America through public funding.\n  There are vast natural resources that remain untapped in Indian \ncountry--wind energy, hydropower, solar energy, and other sources of \nclean, renewable energy--undeveloped in large part because of the lack \nof infrastructure and lack of access to electric transmission lines The \nsame is true for those things most Americans have come to take for \ngranted--basic connections to the outside world, such telephone \nservice, access to the Internet and broadband services, public health \nand safety broadcast systems. A transition to digital television isn't \na challenge to those who have no electricity.\n  Safe and affordable housing, running water, potable water, a source \nof heat--these aren't givens in Indian country as they are elsewhere in \nAmerica.\n  So tribal governments have taken matters into their own hands--they \nhave sought to restore their federally recognized status, to reacquire \nthe lands that were lost through the opening of Indian reservations to \nhomesteading and the treaty-making process, and to reconsolidate their \ntraditional tribal land bases, so that in turn, they can develop a \ngeographic base upon which to build and sustain economic growth and the \nmeans to effectively serve--through tribal government programs and \nservices--all of those who reside on tribal lands--not just the \ncitizens of their governments.\n  But our Federal bureaucracies--as well intentioned and well meaning \nas they may have been--have stood in the way of the tribal governments' \nefforts to achieve this economic growth and development of Native \ncommunities and those communities which surround them, and I believe \nthat the scope of this bill must be inclusive enough to embrace \ninitiatives that are designed to remedy not only centuries-old problems \nbut to fulfill the commitments that we have made in a host of land and \nwater claims settlements, in agreements involving State and tribal \ngovernments, and most importantly in our treaties with the Indian \nnations.\n  Accordingly I will look forward to working with my colleagues to \nassure that this bill does not inadvertently place obstacles in the \npaths of those who seek to become self-sufficient and self-sustaining--\nthose who have faithfully served our country and placed themselves in \nharm's way in the defense of our country in larger proportions than any \nother group of Americans--this Nation's First Americans, the Native \npeople of the United States of America.\n  Madam President, I want to inform the Senate that neither S. 336 as \nreported to the Senate nor division A of the Inouye-Baucus substitute \namendment to H.R. 1, Senate amendment numbered 98, contains any \ncongressional directed spending items as defined in rule XLIV of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate. I can also inform the Senate that \ndivision B of the amendment, prepared by the Committee on Finance, \ncontains no limited tax benefit, limited tariff benefits, or \ncongressional directed spending items as defined in rule XLIV.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1243]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/02/senate-section/article/S1243-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1243-S1266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       NOMINATION OF ERIC H. HOLDER, JR., TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Eric H. \nHolder, Jr., of the District of Columbia, to be Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 3 \nhours of debate equally divided and controlled between the Senator from \nVermont and the Senator from Pennsylvania or their designees.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer and appreciate her being here. We are starting a minute or so \nlate. It is my fault. When I saw my friend from Pennsylvania, the \ndistinguished ranking member, come out, we had to have some discussion \nof last night's Super Bowl game. It was one of the most spectacular \nones. He feels even more spectacular than Senators from some other \nStates--any other State--because his State won.\n  I think it is also a spectacular day because the Senate is \nconsidering President Obama's historic nomination of Eric Holder to be \nAttorney General of the United States.\n  The Judiciary Committee voted last week to report Mr. Holder's \nnomination to the Senate for consideration. That strong, bipartisan 17 \nto 2 vote in favor was a statement that members from both sides of the \naisle recognize that Mr. Holder has the character, integrity and \nindependence to be Attorney General. It is a statement that we all want \nto restore the integrity and competence of the Justice Department and \nto restore another critical component--the American people's confidence \nin Federal law enforcement. The broad support Mr. Holder's nomination \nhas from law enforcement, from advocates for crime victims, from civil \nrights organizations and from across the political spectrum comes as no \nsurprise to those of us that have known of Eric Holder during his \ndecades of dedicated public service.\n  After more than 2 months of scrutiny and consideration, I was pleased \nto see Mr. Holder's nomination gain the support of such a large \nmajority from the Judiciary Committee. I thank all the Democratic \nmembers for their thorough consideration of this nomination. In \nparticular, I thank our newly assigned members for following the \nhearings and participating in our deliberations without missing a step. \nI thank the Republican members, as well. I had said that Senators could \nvote for or against the nomination and two Senators determined to vote \nno, as is their right. With respect to the six Republican members who \nended up supporting the nomination, I note that Senator Hatch, a former \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, did so early on. Then, in the last \ndays the ranking Republican member of the committee, another former \ncommittee chairman, as well as Senator Grassley, Senator Sessions, a \nformer U.S. attorney and State attorney general, Senator Kyl, the \nRepublican whip, and Senator Graham came to support the Holder \nnomination. In my three and a half decades in the Senate, I have never \nseen a nominee as qualified as Eric Holder to serve as the Nation's top \nlaw enforcement officer.\n  The need for new leadership at the Department of Justice is as \ncritical today as it has ever been. Over the last few years, political \nmanipulation from the White House has undercut the Justice Department \nin its mission, and shaken public confidence in our Federal justice \nsystem.\n  The Judiciary Committee expended a good deal of effort over the last \n2 years to uncover scandals at the Department of Justice. Former \nAttorney General Gonzales and virtually every top-ranking Department \nofficial resigned during our inquiry. Likewise, Karl Rove and his White \nHouse political deputies resigned.\n  Before the November election, I coauthored an article with our \nranking Republican member. We wrote that the next Attorney General \n``must be someone who deeply appreciates and respects the work and \ncommitment of the thousands of men and women who work in the branches \nand divisions of the Justice Department, day in and day out, without \nregard to politics or ideology, doing their best to enforce the law and \npromote justice.'' I have every confidence that Eric Holder is such a \nperson.\n  Mr. Holder's designation was greeted with delight by the career \nprofessionals at the Justice Department because they know him well. \nThey know he is the right person to restore the Department. They know \nhim from his 12 years at the Public Integrity Section, from his time as \nthe U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, from his tenure on the \nbench, and from his years as the Deputy Attorney General, the second-\nhighest ranking official at the Department. His confirmation will do a \ngreat deal to restore morale and purpose throughout the Department.\n  It is important that the Department also have the rest of its senior \nleadership in place without delay. This week, we will hold a hearing \nfor the Deputy Attorney General nominee, and I will soon notice \nhearings for the other members of the Justice Department leadership \nteam.\n  I wished we could have moved even more quickly to put the new \nleadership in place at the Department at a time when we face serious \nchallenges and threats. When President Bush nominated Michael Mukasey \nin 2007 to the Attorney General's seat vacated by the resignation of \nAlberto Gonzales, Senator Jon Kyl said:\n\n       Since the Carter administration, attorney general nominees \n     have been confirmed, on average, in approximately three \n     weeks, with some being confirmed even more quickly. The \n     Senate should immediately move to consider Judge Mukasey's \n     nomination and ensure he is confirmed before Congress \n     recesses for Columbus Day.\n\n  Well, it has been more than twice that long since Mr. Holder's \ndesignation and three times that long since reports of his impending \nnomination. Our consideration was delayed because I accommodated \nrequests from the ranking Republican member and committee Republicans \nand postponed the hearing until January 15 and then they postponed \nconsideration another week through procedural objections.\n  Mr. Holder spent more than nine hours testifying before the Judiciary \nCommittee at his hearing 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago, answering every question any \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, Republicans and Democrats, chose to \nask him. All Senators were accorded such time as they needed in three \nextended rounds of questioning to ask whatever they chose.\n  Despite that extended hearing and a second day of hearings with \npublic witnesses that I convened at the request of our Republican \nmembers, in the week after the hearings 12 Senators sent Mr. Holder 125 \npages of extensive follow up questions. He has answered these \nquestions--more than 400 of them--as well.\n\n  I asked for the cooperation of all members to debate and vote on Mr. \nHolder's nomination on the day after the President's inauguration but \ninstead, as is his right, the ranking Republican member held over the \nnomination for another week. I was, as I said, extremely disappointed. \nI did not schedule that markup until I had consulted with the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania first. Indeed, he had assured me that he would not \nhold the matter over. Yet he joined with the Republican members of this \ncommittee in a unanimous request to hold over the nomination. Senator \nMcCain was right last week when he said about the President's Cabinet \nnominations:\n\n       We shouldn't delay. . . . We had an election, and we also \n     had a remarkable and historic [inauguration], and this nation \n     has come together as it has not for some time.''\n\n  He concluded that he understood that ``the message that the American \npeople are sending us now is they want us to work together and get to \nwork.''\n  Regrettably the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee did not\n\n[[Page S1244]]\n\nhear or act on that message 2 weeks ago. I am glad that they changed \ncourse last week and that so many of them have come to support the \nnomination.\n  Yet even after receiving strong bipartisan support in the committee, \na handful of Senate Republicans chose to delay yet again confirming \nthis well-qualified nominee to his vital post. We could and should have \ndebated Mr. Holder's nomination and confirmed him last week, but some \nSenators on the other side of the aisle seem unable to resist \ncontinuing their partisan tactics of obstruction and delay.\n  President Obama in his inaugural address spoke about the real \nchallenges facing the country and the American people. He urged that we \nall work for the common good and ``proclaim an end to the petty \ngrievances'' and ``recriminations'' and that we ``set aside childish \nthings.''\n  President Obama is right. There is work to be done. There are real \nthreats. There are abuses to be undone and rights that need to be \nrestored. We need to get on with the task of remaking America.\n  Eric Holder is a good man, a decent man, a public servant committed \nto the rule of law. He will be a good Attorney General. Republicans \nknow this. They heard from him at his hearing. They have heard the \nendorsements of former FBI Director Louis Freeh, President Bush's \nhomeland security adviser Fran Townsend, Senator Warner of Virginia, \nSenator Hatch, Senator Martinez, and the many Reagan and Bush \nadministration officials who have endorsed his nomination. They have \nseen the endorsements from the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the Fraternal Order of Police and the entire law \nenforcement community.\n  I would like to put into the Record a list of the more than 130 law \nenforcement and criminal justice organizations, civil rights \norganizations, victims' advocates, legal practitioners, bar \nassociations, and current and former public officials that support \nSenate confirmation of Mr. Holder's nomination. These letters from \nnearly every part of the political spectrum are in the committee's \nhearing record and available for any Senator to read.\n  Judge Louis Freeh, a former Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation who testified before the committee in support of Mr. \nHolder, said that Mr. Holder ``has the highest legal competence, total \nintegrity, leadership, and, most importantly, the political \nindependence to discharge faithfully the immense trust this Nation \nreposes in its Attorney General.'' Judge Freeh was ``honored to give \nhim my very highest personal and professional recommendation.'' Former \nAttorney General William Barr and nine Republican lawyers and former \nofficials wrote to the committee in support of Mr. Holder's nomination. \nThey noted ``that not only is Eric superbly qualified to be Attorney \nGeneral, but he is truly a good man.'' They further urged ``his rapid \nconfirmation as our next Attorney General of the United States.'' James \nComey, the Deputy Attorney General under President George W. Bush and \nbefore that prosecutor in charge of the Marc Rich case and the criminal \ninvestigation into the Marc Rich pardon, described Mr. Holder as ``a \nsmart, decent, humble man, who knows and loves the Department and has \ndemonstrated his commitment to the rule of law across an entire \ncareer,'' and urged his confirmation.\n  The endorsement from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and a \nnumber of civil rights organizations expressed ``strong support for the \nhistoric nomination of Eric Holder to the position of Attorney General \nof the United States,'' citing Holder as ``among the most qualified \nnominees for Attorney General in the last fifty years and . . . \nuniquely suited to lead the Department at this moment in time.'' The \nendorsement noted that: ``The nation urgently needs an Attorney General \ndedicated to restoring the independence and integrity of the \nDepartment, with an unquestionable commitment to the Constitution and \nthe rule of law. Eric Holder is the right person for this job.''\n  Nearly every major law enforcement organization has expressed support \nfor Mr. Holder, including the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, NAPO, and the Fraternal Order of Police, FOP. The \nNational Sheriffs' Association highlighted Mr. Holder's ``outstanding \nrecord of public service in his role as a federal prosecutor, a trial \njudge, the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia and the \nDeputy Attorney General for the Department of Justice.'' The National \nTroopers Coalition urged Mr. Holder's ``speedy confirmation to the \noffice of Attorney General'' and wrote that he ``presents a \ndistinguished career as a prosecutor, Superior Court Justice and Deputy \nAttorney General. This unmatched experience will prove to be invaluable \nin directing our law enforcement efforts at this difficult time in \nhistory.''\n  Chuck Canterbury, the national president of the FOP, testified in \nsupport of Mr. Holder's nomination, saying that Mr. Holder is ``not \nonly well qualified but possessing in excess the requisite character, \nknowledge, and skills to do this job and be an extremely effective \nleader for the Department.''\n  Fran Townsend, President Bush's homeland security adviser, also \ntestified and said:\n\n       I am not here because I believe that, if confirmed as \n     Attorney General, Eric Holder will decide legal issues \n     necessarily in the same way that I would. On the contrary, I \n     expect that there would often be times where this is not the \n     case. I am here because I believe Eric is competent, capable, \n     and a fair-minded lawyer who will not hesitate to uphold and \n     defend the laws and the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  Ms. Townsend also pointed to the dangers of delay in confirming Mr. \nHolder as Attorney General. She testified:\n\n       The Attorney General position must be filled quickly. We \n     remain a nation at war and a nation that faces the continuous \n     threat of terrorist attack. We cannot afford for the Attorney \n     General position to sit vacant or for there to be a \n     needlessly protracted period where the leadership of the \n     department is in question.\n\n  I do not know why Republican Senators who supported the confirmation \nof Alberto Gonzales without any reservation slowed the consideration of \nthe nomination of Eric Holder. He meets and exceeds any fair standard \nfor confirmation. And at this time in our history, with the challenges \nwe face, we need to move forward and confirm the new Attorney General \nand the leadership team at the Justice Department.\n  Mr. Holder has demonstrated that he is committed to restoring the \nrule of law, and, as President Obama said, ``to reject as false the \nchoice between our safety and our ideals.'' I am more convinced than \never that Eric Holder is a person who will reinvigorate the Department \nof Justice and serve ably as a key member of the President's national \nsecurity team. He will pursue the Justice Department's vital missions \nwith skill, integrity, independence and a commitment to the rule of \nlaw.\n  I remember when the senior Senator from Pennsylvania took the \noccasion of the confirmation hearing for John Ashcroft to be Attorney \nGeneral to apologize to Judge Ronnie White of Missouri for the manner \nin which his nomination to the Federal court had been rejected in a \nparty-line vote of Senate Republicans.\n  I remember when the senior Senator from Utah and I had to labor for \nweeks to overcome the anonymous Republican hold on the Senate floor of \nMr. Holder's nomination to be the Deputy Attorney General in 1997. \nRegrettably, after celebrating the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday and \nthe inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United \nStates, the Judiciary Committee treated Mr. Holder's nomination to be \nAttorney General to the tactics of the past--more delay, more \nobstruction, more partisan muscle flexing. I am pleased that this week \nthose who sought to delay and were considering opposing had second \nthoughts. Perhaps the unifying spirit of President Obama's inauguration \nhad a delayed effect, perhaps it was the overwhelming support for the \nnomination, perhaps it was the qualities and qualifications of the \nnominee himself. Whatever the reason, I am glad to see so many Senators \nheed President Obama's call and perhaps heard the echo of President \nLincoln's first inaugural address and were ``touched . . . by the \nbetter angels of [their] nature.''\n  I questioned Mr. Holder at his hearing and he gave his commitment to \nrespect the second amendment right to bear arms as an individual right \nguaranteed by our Bill of Rights. I asked him to work with me on a \nmedia shield\n\n[[Page S1245]]\n\nlaw, and he said that he would do so. I asked him about revitalizing \nthe Freedom of Information Act, and he was agreeable. President Obama \ntook action on that score in his first full day in office, and once \nconfirmed, Attorney General Holder can bring that policy to fruition so \nthat the Federal Government is more open to the American people.\n\n  I asked about anticrime initiatives, strengthening the Violence \nAgainst Women Act and defending the Voting Rights Act. On all these \nmatters he was straightforward and supportive. I look forward to \nworking with him to provide greater Federal assistance to State and \nlocal law enforcement and to aggressively target fraud and public \ncorruption. He said that his priorities will be the safety and security \nof the American people and reinvigorating the traditional work of the \nJustice Department in protecting the rights of Americans.\n  Mr. Holder has had a long and distinguished career in public service. \nHis willingness to leave a lucrative private law practice and forego \nextensive earnings in order to return to public service at a time when \njudges are leaving the Federal bench because of their salary \nconstraints, is commendable.\n  We need an Attorney General, as Robert H. Jackson said 68 years ago, \n``who serves the law and not factional purposes, and who approaches his \ntask with humility.'' That is the kind of man Eric Holder is, the kind \nof prosecutor Eric Holder always was, the kind of Attorney General he \nwill be, and the kind of family person he is. I met his wife and his \nfamily and his wonderful children, and they show what a person he is. \nThe next Attorney General will understand our moral and legal \nobligation to protect the fundamental rights of all Americans and to \nrespect the human rights of all people.\n  It is important that the Justice Department have its senior \nleadership in place without delay. The Attorney General is the top law \nenforcement officer in the country and a key member of the national \nsecurity team. With the Bush administration having devoted billions to \nbailouts in the last few months, we need to ensure that those resources \nare not diverted by fraud or deceit. We need the Justice Department to \nbe at its best.\n  The responsibilities of the Attorney General of the United States are \ntoo important to have had this appointment delayed by partisan \nbickering. We have known and worked with Mr. Holder for more than 20 \nyears. He has been nominated by a Republican President and by a \nDemocratic President and confirmed three times by the Senate to \nimportant positions over the last 20 years. His record of public \nservice, his integrity, his experience and his commitment to the rule \nof law merit our respect and deserve our support.\n  Republicans over the last months sought to make comparisons to other \nconfirmation hearings at other times, and even to those for lifetime \nappointments to the Supreme Court. These comparisons are inappropriate. \nFor example, the circumstances of the Ashcroft nomination were very \ndifferent. The country at that time was deeply divided, and those \ndivisions had been inflamed by the manner by which the Supreme Court \nhad intervened to stop the counting of ballots in Florida and decide \nthe outcome. Just before Christmas, President-elect Bush had further \naccentuated the divide by his polarizing designation of John Ashcroft \nto be Attorney General. By contrast, we have just experienced the \nhistoric election of Barack Obama. President Obama has made numerous \nefforts already to be inclusive and to reach across the political \naisle.\n  His selection of Eric Holder 2 months ago was greeted by nearly \nuniversal acclaim. The domestic and economic challenges to our country \nin recent years have been the most serious since the Great Depression. \nIn recognition of those circumstances, Democrats expedited \nconsideration of President Bush's nomination of Michael Mukasey to be \nAttorney General. Democrats scheduled a hearing quickly and did not \nhold the nomination over when it was scheduled for consideration. Those \nof us who were troubled by his unwillingness to acknowledge that \nwaterboarding is torture voted no, but we were not dilatory. We did not \nplay partisan political games.\n  My fundamental concern with President Bush's nomination of his White \nHouse counsel Alberto Gonzales was that he would not be independent of \nthe White House. I did not oppose that nomination in a kneejerk, \npartisan reflex. Indeed, I initially hoped that he would be an \nimprovement over the Ashcroft years. I met with Mr. Gonzales, raised \nthe issue in my initial statement at his confirmation hearings and gave \nhim opportunity after opportunity to demonstrate that he understood the \nrole of the Attorney General. He did not. Ultimately I opposed that \nnomination. History proved me right. At the time, not a single \nRepublican Senator was concerned. They all voted in favor of the \nGonzales nomination. If that nomination met their standard for \nconsideration, all of them must support Mr. Holder's nomination.\n  Unlike Mr. Gonzales, Eric Holder understands the responsibilities of \nthe Attorney General of the United States, and the need to uphold the \nlaw and act in the interests of the American people, and not just the \nPresident. Unlike Mr. Ashcroft, he admitted past errors and has learned \nfrom his mistakes. Unlike Judge Mukasey, he recognizes that \nwaterboarding is torture and that the legal opinions of the Bush era \nneed to be reviewed and revised where they are found to be wrong. If an \nAmerican were waterboarded by some government or terrorist anywhere in \nthe world, it would be torture and illegal. It would not ``depend on \nthe circumstances'' as the Bush Attorneys General maintained.\n  I recall the incident that Jane Mayer wrote about in her book ``The \nDark Side.'' During a meeting of top White House officials like Vice \nPresident Cheney, National Security Adviser Rice, the CIA Director and \nthe Attorney General, in which they were hearing the details of what \nthe Bush administration liked to call ``enhanced interrogation \ntechniques,'' Attorney General Ashcroft is quoted as warning: ``History \nwill not judge us kindly.''\n  The Senate should proceed to confirm President Obama's nomination of \nEric Holder without further delay. We must have leadership in place at \nthe Justice Department to begin the vital work that must be done to \ncarry out the Executive orders signed by President Obama last week that \nwill finally put an end some of the Bush administration's most damaging \nnational security policies. These orders call for the Attorney General \nto coordinate comprehensive interagency reviews of the Guantanamo Bay \nDetention Facility by the State Department, Director of National \nIntelligence, Homeland Security Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff \nand to chair task forces with the DNI and Department of Defense \nreviewing interrogation and detention policies. We need Mr. Holder in \nplace as Attorney General to carry out these orders and put the \ngovernment's detainee policies on a solid legal footing for the first \ntime in many years.\n  I do not want another Attorney General who sits in the room while \nothers in our Government approve the secret wiretapping of Americans in \nviolation of our laws, or approve torture.\n  I want an Attorney General who stands up for the rule of law and our \nlong-cherished American values. I believe Eric Holder will be that kind \nof Attorney General.\n  The rationales for holding up and opposing this nomination have \nshifted over time, since Karl Rove called for partisan opposition. Now \nit seems that some Republican Senators want the Nation's chief \nprosecutor to agree that he will turn a blind eye to possible \nlawbreaking before investigating whether it occurred. Senator \nWhitehouse is quite right that what Senator Cornyn and others are now \nasking for is a pledge no prosecutor should give. No Senator should \ndemand such a bargain for his vote. Senators can vote in favor or they \ncan ignore the needs of the country and the qualifications of the \nnominee and vote against, but no one should be seeking to trade a vote \nfor such a pledge.\n  When he designated Mr. Holder, President Obama said:\n\n       The Attorney General serves the American people. And I have \n     every expectation that Eric will protect our people, uphold \n     the public trust, and adhere to our Constitution.\n\n  I have no doubt that Mr. Holder understands the serious \nresponsibilities of the Attorney General of the United\n\n[[Page S1246]]\n\nStates and that his experience and integrity will serve him and the \nAmerican people well.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the list of 130 \nsupporters of the nomination of Eric Holder that I mentioned earlier \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Letters of Support for the Nomination of Eric Holder To Be Attorney \n                      General of the United States\n\n\n                   current & former public officials\n\n       Asa Hutchinson, former U.S. Attorney, Republican \n     Congressman, Undersecretary for Homeland Security in Bush \n     Administration; Bob Barr, Former Congressman; Carla Hills, \n     former Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, former \n     U.S. Trade Representative; Carol Lamm, former President of \n     the District of Columbia Bar; Charles La Bella, former US \n     Attorney; Chris Wray, former Assistant Attorney General, \n     Criminal Division; Dan Bryant, former Assistant Attorney \n     General, Office of Legal Policy and Office of Legislative \n     Affairs; Congressional Black Caucus; Craig S.

I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I begin today as I began my opening \nstatement on the confirmation hearing of Mr. Holder as Attorney \nGeneral-designate. I begin today with the statement that I wish to be \nhelpful to President Obama in his new administration and to reach \nacross in a bipartisan fashion to help the President restructure the \nDepartment of Justice. In so doing, the beginning point of reference is \nthe Constitution, which places upon the Senate the responsibility to \nconfirm. That involves, under the principles of checks and balances, \ninquiry into the nominee, which has been undertaken in the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  There is a sharp distinction between the Attorney General and other \nCabinet officers. Other Cabinet officers carry out the President's \nprograms and his policies. But the Attorney General has an independent \nresponsibility to\n\n[[Page S1247]]\n\nthe people to uphold the rule of law. That is a very important quality. \nWe have seen, historically, some Attorneys General who have succeeded \nadmirably in that responsibility. Elliot Richardson, for example, \nrefused to fire Archibald Cox at the direction of President Nixon on \nthe infamous Saturday Night Massacre. Richardson himself resigned. \nGriffin Bell, Attorney General for President Carter, stood up to the \nPresident, who wanted him to initiate a certain criminal prosecution \nthat Attorney General Bell thought was inappropriate, and he laid down \nthe marker: If the President wanted that prosecution brought, he would \nhave to find himself a new Attorney General.\n  Other Attorneys General have not fared so well. Attorney General \nDaugherty of the Teapot Dome fame was sharply criticized in that \nscandal, although later he was personally exonerated. Attorney General \nHomer Cummings in the Roosevelt administration, author of the so-called \ncourt-packing plan, did not display the kind of independence that was \nrequisite. And I expressed my own concerns about Mr. Holder on a series \nof matters he handled as Deputy Attorney General.\n  Beyond any question, Mr. Holder brings an extraordinary resume to \nthis position, an excellent academic record, including Columbia for his \nundergraduate degree and law school; he served as U.S. attorney for the \nDistrict of Columbia; he was a District of Columbia Superior Court \njudge; he served as a Deputy Attorney General and as a partner in a \nprestigious law firm handling many important matters.\n  One recommendation in favor of his nomination I found particularly \nweighty was the recommendation of former FBI Director Louis Freeh. I \nhave a very high regard for former Director Freeh. I knew him and \nworked closely with him on the Judiciary Committee on FBI matters and \nespecially closely during the 104th Congress when I chaired the \nIntelligence Committee. Director Freeh was sharply critical of Mr. \nHolder on a number of items that were concerns of mine. Notwithstanding \nthat, Director Freeh recommended Mr. Holder for the job.\n  There is the infamous case of the Marc Rich pardon. He was a man who \nwas a fugitive from justice, a man who had violated the Federal law, \nselling arms to Iran. Yet he was given a pardon out of the ordinary, \nwithout going through regular channels. That was a pardon to be \nrejected by any standard, in my opinion. Mr. Freeh characterized the \npardon as corrupt. I cannot be any stronger than that. The corrupt act \nwas in granting the pardon, not in Mr. Holder's recommendation of \n``neutral, leaning favorable.'' But that was beyond the realm of what \nwould ordinarily be considered prudent and independent.\n  Mr. Freeh was also critical of Mr. Holder on the FALN terrorist \ncommutation of sentences. The FALN terrorists robbed banks and \ncommitted murders and were released from jail on the recommendation of \nMr. Holder. There again, Mr. Freeh was very critical. Nonetheless, he \nrecommended Mr. Holder for Attorney General.\n  The failure to appoint independent counsel in the investigation into \nVice President Gore for an alleged violation of campaign finance laws, \nraising money from the White House--Director Freeh characterized it as \none of the strongest possible grounds for appointing independent \ncounsel, and the Department of Justice, with Mr. Holder's \nparticipation, declined to do so. Still, Mr. Freeh recommended the \nconfirmation of Mr. Holder.\n  Also, there is the strong recommendation of former Deputy Attorney \nGeneral James Comey, a man whom I also worked with in the Department of \nJustice, which was weighty, as was the strong recommendation of former \nSecretary of Transportation William Coleman.\n  So with all of those factors considered, it seemed to me that Mr. \nHolder was entitled to the benefit of the doubt and President Obama's \nnominee ought to be confirmed. It was for that reason that I voted aye \nin recommending Mr. Holder for action by the full Senate.\n  I think, too, at the beginning of an administration it is significant \nto have bipartisan support. I commented at the committee level that \nwhen Senator Leahy or his ranking member supported the confirmation of \nChief Justice Roberts, that was a signal of bipartisan support, which \nwas important and another factor that weighed in my consideration.\n  I had discussed with Mr. Holder the issue of how to handle possible \nprosecutions against individuals who may have been engaged in \nwaterboarding, where that question has been raised in some quarters. \nMr. Holder went about as far as he could, saying that if there is a \nvalid legal opinion and there is action within the confines of the \nopinion, that would weigh heavily against prosecution. Obviously, all \nof these matters are very much fact-determinative. I think those \nassurances go about as far as one can go.\n  I also questioned Mr. Holder about the recognition of the differences \nin interrogation techniques of the Army Field Manual, contrasted with \nthat of the FBI, which is stronger, and then again contrasted with the \nCIA, which may be a little stronger yet, and that all of those factors \nhad to be considered in evaluating the interrogation tactics, depending \nupon the rule and the circumstances.\n  I expressed my concerns to Mr. Holder about the Department of Justice \npolicy on extracting really what amounts to coercion of a waiver of the \nattorney-client privilege, where the Department goes in and deals with \nthe corporation and secures a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, \nsubjecting employees to losing their privilege, in the context where \nthe Department threatens more severe charges or stronger recommendation \non sentencing. This practice began with the Holder Memo in 1999 and was \ncarried through in the so-called Thompson Memo and then the McNulty \nMemo, and legislation is pending which would change that.\n  In my view, there are two very basic principles involved. One is the \nobligation of the commonwealth government to prove its case beyond a \nreasonable doubt and, secondly, the right to counsel. An indispensable \ningredient of right to counsel is a privilege, to be able to \ncommunicate freely to an attorney. When I was district attorney of \nPhiladelphia, handling very complex, tough prosecutions, many involving \ngovernmental corruption, I would never have dreamed of trying to prove \nmy case out of the mouth of the defendant. I believe Mr. Holder will \nlook at this with a conciliatory attitude as we work on that \nlegislation through the Congress.\n  I also talked to Mr. Holder about the issue of reporters' privilege. \nJudith Miller of the New York Times spent 85 days in jail--I visited \nher in a jail in Virginia--for failing to disclose confidential \ninformants when the source of the information was known. Mr. Holder \nalso acknowledged the extensive authority of the Congress under \nstandards defined in the congressional research memorandum, which I \nprovided to him, and gave assurances that he would be available to talk \nto the minority as well as to the majority on matters of concern.\n  For all these reasons, I am pleased to move ahead at this time to \nlend my support to the confirmation of Attorney General-designate Eric \nHolder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I was about to yield--we do our normal \nback and forth--to the Senator from Illinois. I understand the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma has a time constraint, if the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwould like to yield time off his side to him.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, I am prepared to yield time. Senator Cornyn is next \non the list. How much time would the Senator from Oklahoma like?\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, short of 15 minutes; probably 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield that time to Senator Coburn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I thank the chairman for his \ngraciousness, and I thank the ranking member.\n  Last week in the Judiciary Committee, I voted against the nomination \nof Eric Holder. I was not, because of time constraints, offered the \nopportunity to express my reasoning and logic for that opposition. \nToday, I rise to explain my opposition and to urge others to share my \nconcerns to do the same.\n\n[[Page S1248]]\n\n  I have high praise for Eric Holder as an individual and as a lawyer. \nI believe certain aspects, however, of his record disqualify him as \nserving as Attorney General. I plan on outlining those in this talk \nbefore the Senate today, specifically, his facilitation of the Marc \nRich pardon, his defense as reasonable of the FALN terrorists' \ncommutations, in addition to his views on the first amendment and \nsecond amendment, specifically his answers with respect to the fairness \ndoctrine.\n  Eric Holder has spent most of his distinguished career as a public \nservant. By all accounts, he is a brilliant lawyer. His nomination was \nmet with high praise from both sides of the aisle. His intellect and \nability have been noted throughout his career, and they were duly noted \nin his appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Moreover, I believe him to be a man of good character. The long line \nof individuals who have voiced support for his nomination speaks to the \nhigh regard in which he is clearly held. In our private meeting, I \nfound him to be personable and kind. He is undoubtedly a good man.\n  These good qualities, however, are not enough to overcome the \nconcerns I have with this nomination. In particular, four issues have \ncaused me to conclude that Eric Holder should not be given the \nassignment as the next Attorney General of the United States. I believe \nthese matters suggest he lacks judgment, that he lacks independence, \nand my concern is that he now, from his testimony, lacks candor for \nsuch an important job.\n  Eric Holder's role in facilitating the controversial pardon of \nfugitive financier Marc Rich is perhaps the most notorious blight on \nhis record. Even now, 10 years later, the condemnation of that pardon \nis strong. Indeed, not even Mr. Holder will defend his actions, telling \nthe committee it was a naive mistake.\n  Eric Holder's involvement in this unconscionable pardon suggests he \nhas dangerously poor judgment or he has an inability to say no to \npowerful political pressure. As Deputy Attorney General, he \norchestrated an end run around the Justice Department, ignoring the \nadvice of prosecutors and career professionals who opposed clemency for \nMarc Rich. Although pardoning a fugitive was extremely rare, the \ncandidate appeared to have no qualms with the proposition.\n  While he acknowledges his role in this pardon as a mistake, Mr. \nHolder offers a curious explanation for the error. He told the \ncommittee he was not familiar with Rich's record at the time of the \npardon. First of all, I find this to be unbelievable, as the facts \nsuggest otherwise.\n  Just a few years before the pardon, when Holder was U.S. attorney for \nthe District of Columbia, his office sued one of Rich's companies after \nan extensive investigation into contract fraud. The complaint that was \nfiled in that case and comments that were made to the press make it \nalmost impossible to believe Eric Holder was unfamiliar with Rich at \nthe time of the pardon.\n  Moreover, given that Rich had been featured as one of the FBI's top \n10 most wanted fugitives, it is even harder to believe Mr. Holder did \nnot become familiar with the man in the 15 months that passed between \nthe time he was first contacted by Rich's lawyer and the day clemency \nwas issued.\n  To say that this pardon was a mistake is an understatement of the \nworst kind. As others have pointed out, the best thing Eric Holder \ncould have done for himself and his boss would have been to oppose the \npardon and convince President Clinton not to issue it.\n  While I readily acknowledge mistakes are inevitably made by us all, I \nfind the excuse for this one implausible. Eric Holder is a bright and \ncontentious lawyer. At the time of the Rich pardon, he had served for 3 \nyears as Deputy Attorney General. In short, he should have known \nbetter. Because he allowed his good judgment to be overridden by \npolitical influence, I believe this act alone should suffice to \ndisqualify him from higher office.\n  Although the Marc Rich pardon may have been the best known act of \ncontroversial clemency in Eric Holder's record, the commutation of \nsentences for 16 FALN terrorists became an issue of equal, if not \ngreater, concern throughout the hearing. The FALN organization had been \nlinked to 150 bombings, threats, kidnappings, and other events which \nresulted in the deaths of at least six Americans and the injury of many \nmore between 1974 and 1983. It is not hard to understand why these \ncommutations were strongly opposed by the U.S. attorney, the FBI, the \npardon attorney at the Department of Justice, as well as the victims' \nfamilies. What is hard to understand is why Eric Holder chose to ignore \nthose opinions and instead facilitate clemency for these convicted \nterrorists.\n  New information discovered just before the hearing revealed that Eric \nHolder played an active role in securing these commutations. According \nto the L.A. Times, ``Holder instructed his staff at Justice's Office of \nthe Pardon Attorney to effectively replace the department's original \nreport recommending against any commutations, which had been sent to \nthe White House in 1996, with one that favored clemency for at least \nhalf the prisoners.''\n  Unlike the Rich pardon, Holder has embraced his role in endorsing \nthese commutations. He told Senator Sessions during our committee \nhearings that the decision was reasonable and has stood \nunapologetically by that statement, even when it was proven that he \nknew very little about the terrorists or their crimes at the time of \nthe commutations.\n  Perhaps no one is as angry about Holder's role in this incident, or \nabout his elevation to this distinguished office, as Joseph Connor, \nwhose 33-year-old father was murdered when the FALN bombed the New York \nCity restaurant where he was eating lunch. Mr. Connor was 9 years old. \nHe has written numerous editorials and gave compelling testimony at our \nhearing about how devastating and indefensible these commutations were. \nI quote him:\n\n       We Americans have to make clear that we will not tolerate \n     officials who would put our lives in jeopardy by releasing \n     terrorists. It is a disrespectful affront to all Americans, \n     particularly to those of us who have come face to face with \n     their violence.\n\n  Mr. Connor's testimony struck a chord with me due to my own \nexperiences with domestic terrorism. Having dealt with the shock and \nthe aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, which happened prior to the \nFALN commutations, I can relate to the grief and anger felt by the \nfamily member of a victim murdered senselessly by terrorists. I have \nseen the devastation these acts of violence inflict on a community and \nespecially on the families they most directly impact. I have heard from \nthe many law enforcement officers who work the scene, gather the \nevidence, and tend to the victims. I have witnessed the long and \ndifficult process of prosecution, conviction, and sentencing. I know \nthat bringing perpetrators to justice is a crucial part for these \nfamilies' healing process.\n  I cannot imagine how all those things would come undone if justice \nwere undermined, as it was in the FALN case.\n  The danger of commuting the sentences of terrorists responsible for \nthe murder of American citizens and intent on killing even more is \nobvious. I will not recount those concerns here, but to help give a \nvoice to Joe Connor and to the many other surviving family members of \nterrorist victims, I ask that our colleagues consider the effect these \ndecisions had on them. We are accountable to each and every one.\n  Eric Holder also raises another concern with me and that is his \nhostility to the second amendment. I heard our chairman speak earlier \nabout how he said he would uphold the second amendment, but when \nqueried directly and specifically about components of the second \namendment, the answers were not forthcoming.\n  As Deputy Attorney General, he advocated restrictive gun control \nlegislation, such as waiting periods, an age limit, that a soldier \ncoming back from Iraq could not own a shotgun because he wasn't 21 yet, \na registration for every gun in this country, the elimination for me to \nbe able to give my shotgun to my grandson when it is time to teach him \nto go hunting. All those things he has espoused limiting the second \namendment.\n  While he has advanced those restrictions as a member of the Clinton \nadministration, working under Attorney General Janet Reno, he remained \nactive in anti-gun advocacy after he entered the private sector. After \nthe attacks of September 11, he authored an\n\n[[Page S1249]]\n\nop-ed for the Washington Post, entitled ``Keeping Guns Away from \nTerrorists.''\n  I will not go through the details of that piece, but the details of \nwhat he purports to support would have a devastating impact on the \nsecond amendment in this country.\n  Perhaps the most telling and unsettling aspect of Mr. Holder's anti-\ngun record is the signing of an amicus brief in the Supreme Court's \nseminal second amendment case, in which he argued that the Constitution \ndid not protect an individual's right to bear arms. I believe he \nactually believes that--that we don't have the right. He now tells us \nthat is settled with the Heller case. But on further query, we get \ntremendously nervous about his support for the second amendment. The \nSupreme Court rejected his view on the second amendment unanimously.\n  His statement in our hearing that he respects Heller as the law of \nthe land does not provide enough assurance on his commitment to defend \nthe second amendment. It is neither controversial nor instructive to \nmake such a statement. What matters are his views on specific proposals \nfor gun control legislation and regulation.\n  At his hearing, I used the vast amount of my time in three rounds of \nquestioning to try and extract opinions from Eric Holder on the second \namendment. In his testimony, he advocated a permanent ban on so-called \nassault weapons, an age restriction on handgun possession--again, many \nof our troops returning home and out of the military after 2 years \nwould not be able to have a handgun because they are not 21--and \nclosing the gun show loophole. What that means is I cannot sell a gun \nto one of my neighbors without a background check on my neighbor. I \ncannot actually sell a piece of material I have to someone without \ngoing through a gun check, or I cannot even sell it to my brother.\n  He refused to commit to defending State right-to-carry laws. There \nare more than 40 States that have these laws. He was questioned over \nand over and would not answer affirmatively that he would use the power \nof the attorney to uphold the second amendment.\n  He repeatedly testified that gun regulation was not a priority for \neither he or the administration. Consistently, Mr. Holder has \nunapologetically embraced his anti-gun views. Yet at his confirmation \nhearing, he would not tell us what those views were.\n  He has been a vocal gun control advocate in the past, both in his \nofficial and individual capacities. He was not candid on the second \namendment issue, an issue he has followed for years, as he was on \ninterrogation techniques, an issue which he could not possibly have \nenough information to prejudge.\n  After an extensive review of his record and his testimony, I have \nconcluded that Eric Holder as Attorney General will not defend--not \nadequately defend--the second amendment.\n  Finally, I have serious doubts as to whether Eric Holder is committed \nto defending the first amendment against threats such as the so-called \nfairness doctrine. This policy existed for decades before being \nabolished in 1987 and rightly so. Today, the concept has been revived \nand the threat of Government censorship over the airwaves is again a \nreal possibility.\n  At our hearing, Eric Holder was asked about his thoughts on this \nproposal. Specifically, he was asked whether, as a matter of public \npolicy, the fairness doctrine should be reinstated, to which he \nreplied:\n\n       [T]hat's a toughie. I've not given an awful lot of thought \n     to [it].\n\n  It is hard to accept that Eric Holder, a former Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, somehow missed the debate over this prominent issue in our \nsociety. It is even harder to accept his answer when reviewing his past \nstatements about media bias.\n  This not-so-thinly-veiled attack targets the very media outlets that \nadvocates of the fairness doctrine hope to cripple. While this may be \nan acceptable position for a private advocate, there is no room for \nthis kind of bias in the Department of Justice. Unfortunately, Mr. \nHolder said nothing to ease concerns about his predisposition on this \nissue. In written responses to further questions from the committee he \nsaid this: If a law or regulation is enacted that seeks to implement \nsome version of the fairness doctrine, I will work with other agencies \nin the new administration and in the Department's Office of Legal \nCounsel to reach a considered view about the constitutionality of the \nspecific law or regulation under consideration.\n  Remarkably, although Mr. Holder was given an opportunity to distance \nhimself from the inflammatory comments he made in the 2004 speech, the \nbest he could offer was a commitment to give a ``considered view'' of \nany such legislation.\n  What I expected from a prospective Attorney General was, first and \nforemost, a clear and strong commitment to uphold and defend the first \namendment. What Eric Holder said fell far short of my expectation.\n  The so-called ``Fairness Doctrine'' is not a ``toughie'' issue, as it \nwas described by the presumptive Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Okay.\n  Mr. COBURN. As former FCC Chairman James Quello argued shortly after \nthe policy was repealed,\n\n       The fairness doctrine doesn't belong in a country that is \n     dedicated to freedom of the press and freedom of speech.\n\n  I agree and am disturbed that our likely next Attorney General \napparently does not.\n  In conclusion, after listening carefully to Eric Holder's testimony, \nespecially regarding each of the issues I raised today, I am forced to \nconclude that he lacks the judgment, independence, and candor necessary \nto be Attorney General. I did not reach this conclusion without careful \nconsideration.\n  When I first came to the Senate, one of the first votes I had to make \nwas on the nomination--to consent and advise--on Attorney General \nAlberto Gonzalez. I had a catch in my spirit on that nomination. I \nshould not have cast a vote for him. I was the first Republican to \nsuggest that he should resign because he did not display the \nindependence, the candor, or the support for the rule of law. Although \nhindsight is always 20/20, I reserve my right to do the right thing on \nthis nomination. There is no difference between the lack of \nindependence that has been demonstrated by the testimony of Eric Holder \nand his past and what we saw in the lack of independence of previous \nAttorneys General.\n  Oftentimes, nominees come to the Senate with nearly a blank slate. \nThis was not the case with Eric Holder. His time in public service, \nspecifically his stint as Deputy Attorney General for President \nClinton, served as an audition for this position. His role in the \npardon and commutations is very troubling. I believe, in summary, \nindependence is lacking, candor is lacking, and judgment is lacking. \nPresident Obama deserves some degree of deference in his choices, but \nno President is entitled to a Cabinet member who will neglect the \nConstitution and his own sound judgment to facilitate a bad political \ndecision.\n  I regret I cannot, in good conscience, support his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I know we proposed going with two on the \nRepublican side and with two on the Democratic side. We will next go \nwith Senator Burris and then Senator Dorgan.\n  I would note in this debate--and I apologize for my voice; I am \nrecovering from laryngitis--that, one, the Justice Department is not \nthe Department that handles the fairness doctrine. Out of fairness to \nMr. Holder, that is not a matter that comes before the Attorney \nGeneral.\n  Secondly, I asked Mr. Holder specifically a question about his views \non the Second Amendment--because we do not have in Vermont the \nrestrictive gun laws that the people in Oklahoma have supported or the \nrestrictive gun laws the people of Texas or Pennsylvania have \nsupported. We have less restrictive gun laws than any State in the \nUnion. I own many firearms myself. I asked Mr. Holder specifically if \nhe would, in a State without restrictive gun laws, such as Vermont, \nseek to replace those State laws with more restrictive Federal gun laws \nsimilar to those of the many other States represented on the Judiciary \nCommittee, and he said no.\n\n[[Page S1250]]\n\n  Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, if I could have the attention of the \nchairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I wish to yield 20 minutes to Senator Cornyn at the \nconclusion, but do we have an idea as to how long, or when that will \nbe?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Next will be Senator Burris and then Senator Dorgan. I ask \nthe Senator from North Dakota, Madam President, approximately how much \ntime he wants.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would seek to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois and 10 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota, and then \nyield back time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Then I would give 20 minutes to Senator Cornyn.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to that effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, with humility for an honor neither \nsought nor expected, I rise for the first time as a U.S. Senator.\n  At a time of great consequence for our country's long march toward \njustice--and the moral compass we call the Constitution that guides our \npath--I rise to strongly support President Barack Obama's nominee for \nthe office of U.S. Attorney General, Eric Holder.\n  As we look toward the future, I begin with a few words about the \npast. Back in the 1950s, there was a place in my hometown of Centralia, \nIL, called the pig wobble, and it wasn't hard to figure out why: Pig \nwobble was the place where the horses, the cows, and, yes, the pigs, \nfrom all nearby farms came to drink water. It was also the place where \nAfrican-American children came to swim in the summertime.\n  My friends and I swam in the pig wobble until the summer of my 16th \nbirthday, in 1953, when, after previous efforts to integrate the park \nswimming pool where only white children swam had failed. My dad finally \nhad enough of his children swimming with the farm animals while the \nWhite children went off to the nice clean neighborhood pool. My dad and \nhis minister, who ran the local chapter of the NAACP, determined that \nthe time had come for Black children to swim in the community pool. \nThey decided they would need an attorney to represent us. There were no \nBlack lawyers in Centralia, so my father traveled to Chicago seeking \nlegal assistance, but no lawyer was interested in representing us. He \nreturned home, and the following day went to East St. Louis, IL, and \nretained a Black attorney to represent us.\n  When the pool opened on Memorial Day, my brother and I, along with \nthree brothers from another family, swam and integrated the pool \nwithout incident. Later, we were home celebrating our accomplishments, \nbut when my dad returned home he was very upset. We questioned why, and \nhe explained that the lawyer he had hired did not show up. My father \nthen said these words:\n\n       If we as a race of people are going to get anywhere in our \n     society, we need lawyers and elected officials who are \n     responsible and responsive.\n\n  From that conversation with my father when I was 16, I set a goal for \nmyself that I would try in my life and career to be responsible and \nresponsive to the cause of justice.\n  When President Obama nominated Eric Holder to be Attorney General of \nthe United States, my father's words came to mind. Eric Holder is the \nembodiment of what my father envisioned on that day. Mr. Holder has \nbeen responsible and responsive his entire career. He has been a leader \nin the long march toward justice, not just for African Americans but \nfor all Americans who treasure our Nation's founding principles of \nfreedom, equality, and personal liberty. Once confirmed, he will open \nthe gates of justice once again to the public interest, not the special \ninterests, and to those who are concerned not with the expansion of \npower but with the use of power for the common good.\n\n  The mission of the Department of Justice is to enforce the law, to \nensure the public safety, to prevent crime, and to seek fair, impartial \njustice for all Americans. Sadly, for the past 8 years, the Department \nhas not lived up to the promise of that sacred mission. Americans, \nparticularly those of us in the legal community, have seen the Justice \nDepartment sink further into corruption, cronyism, and gross \nmismanagement.\n  I have watched with particular despair as the Federal initiatives to \nfight violent crimes against women, a program similar to the one I \nenacted as Attorney General in my State of Illinois, was underfunded, \npoliticized, and largely abandoned. We have the chance today to turn \nthe page by confirming Eric Holder.\n  At a time when the Department of Justice has lost dozens of \ncompetent, effective career attorneys, it is long past time for an \nAttorney General to put competence first. At a time when the Civil \nRights Division, long known as the crown jewel of the Justice \nDepartment, has seen its mission undermined and misdirected, it is time \nfor an Attorney General who will keep justice blind and put our \nConstitution first. At a time when our moral authority in the world is \nthreatened by the immoral acts that were sanctioned from the top, we \nneed an Attorney General who will put civil liberties first. At a time \nwhen the threat of terrorism continues to haunt us, we need an Attorney \nGeneral who will put public safety first. At a time when the crimes of \na Wall Street few have spoiled an economy for the Main Street many, we \nneed an Attorney General who will put people first.\n  We can be certain that Eric Holder will do these things because he \nhas spent his entire career building and broadening a deep well of \npublic trust.\n  After graduating from Columbia Law School, Eric came to the Justice \nDepartment in 1976 to serve in the Attorney General's Honors Program, \nwhere his focus was prosecuting corrupt officials at the local, State, \nand Federal levels. In 1988, he was appointed by President Reagan as an \nassociate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, \nwhere he presided over countless trials of homicides and other violent \ncrimes.\n  In 1993, President Clinton nominated Eric to become the U.S. Attorney \nfor the District of Columbia, the first African American to hold that \npost. In that role, he created a domestic violence unit, went after \nperpetrators of crime with an unmatched intensity, and worked hand in \nhand with the community to give the people a voice in law enforcement. \nIn 1997, President Clinton promoted Eric Holder to the position of \nDeputy Attorney General, where he went after crimes against children \nand cracked down on white-collar crimes.\n  At every step along the way, Eric Holder has proven there is no \nconflict between fighting crime and upholding civil liberties; that \nmaking America safe and more just must go hand in hand. That is exactly \nwhat he will do as U.S. Attorney General.\n  It is the honor of a lifetime to rise from the desk that previously \nbelonged to our President Barack Obama, and before that to another \nlegend from the land of Lincoln, Senator Paul Simon. As long as this \ndesk is in my care, I will try to honor those who served before me and \nwork to brighten the lives of every citizen of Illinois.\n  If you look back further through the years, this desk belonged to \nSenator Robert F. Kennedy, who as U.S. Attorney General breathed life \ninto the flames of justice. I know Eric Holder will do the same in our \ntime. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this outstanding \nnominee.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and my colleagues for the opportunity \nto share my thoughts in supporting the nomination of Eric Holder for \nAttorney General of the United States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \nexcellent statement. I was touched by the fact that the Senator from \nIllinois mentioned he is at the desk once occupied by both Senator Paul \nSimon and Senator Barack Obama. I had the privilege of serving with \nboth Senators from Illinois, both great people. I know it is safe to \nsay that Senator Obama, now President Obama, will appreciate the \nstatement made by Senator Burris today.\n  Having known Senator Paul Simon, I think it safe to say he also would \nhave\n\n[[Page S1251]]\n\nbeen proud of the statement. Somewhere he is looking down and seeing \nthis.\n  Last, it was my privilege as a young law student to be recruited by \nthen-Attorney General Robert Kennedy, who made it very clear that the \nJustice Department was for all Americans and nobody, not even his \nbrother, the President, would be allowed to interfere with criminal or \ncivil rights prosecutions. I knew he meant it. I know the Senator from \nIllinois shares my feelings in that.\n  I welcome him to this body, and I thank him for his statement.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me thank my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Vermont, the chairman of the committee, for his work on the \nJudiciary Committee. I do not serve on that committee, but I come to \ntalk just a bit about the nomination of the new Attorney General and \nabout the Department of Justice.\n  The reason I say I appreciate the Senator from Vermont is because he \nwaged a relentless struggle at a time when the Justice Department was \ninvolved in the long shadow of scandal, at a time when words from the \nJustice Department, from the Attorney General at that point, seemed to \nsuggest torture was OK. It was a time when the Department of Justice \nseemed to say that people could be detained on the streets of America \nand held incommunicado without a right to an attorney. These were \nthings that I believed were far afield from what we expect as basic \nrights in our country and the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee waged \na long and brave battle against them. And, I want to thank him for \nthat.\n  But, let me talk about Eric Holder in the context of what I just \ndescribed and why I think this nomination is so important. You have \nheard a lot about how highly qualified Eric Holder is--about his \nlifetime of impressive public service, about his history as an \nindependent, tough-as-nails prosecutor, about the long list of \norganizations that support him as very qualified, and about the many \nprominent Democrats and Republicans that support him.\n  But, I want to talk about Eric Holder as a key part of restoring \njustice to the Department of Justice.\n  We have been through a long period of difficulty at the Justice \nDepartment. I am not talking now about the stewardship of Mr. Mukasey. \nI am talking about specifically a period when Attorney General Gonzales \nwas in charge.\n  The Attorney General is the senior person in our country responsible \nfor ensuring that justice is done. That means many things. It means, \ncertainly, evenhandedness; it means justice under the law; it means \noccasionally saying no to those who want to do the wrong thing, no \nmatter how powerful or important they might be. It means everyone, from \nthe lowest to the highest, gets treated equally and fairly under the \nlaw in this country.\n  The Attorney General is the senior most Government official \nresponsible for justice. That is the person who has to stand for, and \nstand up for, our country as a nation of laws. That is the person who \nneeds to be the defender of human rights, who must believe in America \nas a beacon of hope in the world, a beacon that shines from America \ninto the darkest places at the darkest times.\n  The Attorney General, as the head of the Justice Department, is the \none who is involved in that kind of activity and sends that message \nfrom our country. An Attorney General should be someone who can say \ntorture is un-American because it is. No splitting hairs, no fancy \nwords, no legal distinctions--just these simple words: Torture is \nwrong.\n  Mr. Holder has said that to us in his nomination hearings. He said, \n``Torture is wrong'' and ``No one is above the law.'' Those are very \nsimple and straightforward words from this nominee, but I think they \nare timeless principles, timeless truths that America has exhibited now \nfor nearly 200 years.\n  Why is that important for us? The most powerful weapon in our country \nis what we stand for. That has always been the most powerful weapon in \nAmerica.\n  We had a long struggle in the Cold War against the Soviet Union and \ntotalitarianism. The Cold War occasionally flared up to a hot war with \nbombs and bullets. But, it was not the bombs and bullets that won the \nCold War with the Soviet Union. It was American values that won that \nCold War.\n  That is why we prevailed. We must never forget that American values \nwere so strong that they shined the light of hope into the darkest \ncells of the gulag prisons in the outermost reaches of the Soviet \nUnion. Many of those prisoners died in their cells, but some survived \nand talked about how inspired they were by the ideas and values of what \nwas America. Our country gave them hope. The idea of America, as I \nsaid, reached to the farthest and darkest places on this Earth and \noffered hope to people--people struggling, people in grave difficulty.\n  There was a very clear and distinct difference between us and the \nSoviet Union during that Cold War, and everyone knew what it was. It \nwasn't our military might or the comparison of our military \ncapabilities. It wasn't our bombs or bullets. It was what each country \nstood for. When the people of the Soviet Union and their client states \nfinally had a choice, they chose democracy and freedom and liberty. \nThat is how powerful the idea of America has become.\n  This moral ground has always been our country's strength. We must \ninsist on keeping that high moral ground--not only because it is \neffective, but because it is right and because it is our birthright as \nAmericans.\n  From the very beginning our country has held itself to a higher \nstandard, as in the story of George Washington and the fight to found \nAmerica. He led the Continental Army in the war for independence. It is \na pretty interesting story, if you go back and read it.\n  Madam President, 5,000 were in the Continental Army that George \nWashington commanded, 5,000--but not trained soldiers. They were \nshopkeepers, farmers and tradesmen going up against a 50,000-man \ntrained army of British soldiers. We know the result, but we don't \nalways remember the battles along the way, military battles and, yes, \nbattles over values and ideals.\n  There were many difficult periods during that war, and there were \nsome very dark days. During one very difficult period, at a time when a \nlarge number of his troops were captured, Gen. Washington and his \ntroops saw the Hessian mercenaries, who at that point were fighting \nalong with the British, slaughtering unarmed prisoners. Washington, \nwhen he captured Hessian prisoners, refused to do the same. Washington \ninsisted we were different; we were going to treat people the way they \nshould be treated not the way they treated us.\n  That was George Washington's notion about who we are and why we are \ndifferent. That has been America's birthright since the beginning of \nour country.\n  It is why this issue of torture is so important. It is why the \ndiscussions about detainee treatment and enemy combatants and habeas \ncorpus are so important. These issues are about who we are as a \ncountry, as a people, and who we want to be.\n  I remember reading one day that a man was picked up at a New York \nCity airport and then sent away, not to be heard from for a long while \nby his family or by anybody. It turns out he was sent to Syria where he \nwas tortured for 8 to 9 months, kept underground in concrete cells in \nisolation. It turns out it was a huge mistake. This person was not who \nhe was thought to be; he was not a terrorist.\n  Yet, on American soil, he was detained and then sent away to be \ntortured. He was a Canadian. The Government of Canada, by the way, has \napologized to that citizen for that situation. But it describes why it \nis so important that the rule of law always be applied.\n  So this discussion about the Attorney General, about this nomination, \nabout the Department of Justice, is about much more than just \nnominating someone for a Cabinet position. It is about what do we \naspire to for our country and ourselves. What kind of Government do we \nwant? What kind of Government will we allow? What kind of country do we \nwant?\n  I go back again, as I said, to the long, dark shadow that was cast \nfor a period of time over the Justice Department, when it was engaged \nin scandals and\n\n[[Page S1252]]\n\nscandalous conduct. There were very important questions about what was \nhappening at the Department of Justice. Frankly, there were grave \nquestions of what was happening to justice at the Department of \nJustice.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee was relentless in trying to understand \nit and hold hearings and get answers. Very few answers, frankly, were \nforthcoming. Thankfully, those days are over.\n  We now have the nomination of Eric Holder. The Judiciary Committee \nvoted 17 to 2 to support his nomination. Like them, I believe Eric \nHolder represents an opportunity for our country to have someone at the \nJustice Department who does understand what the Department of Justice \nstands for and where it fits in our value system. I am pleased to come \nto the floor of the Senate today to say, when we discuss these issues \nwe must discuss what are the values, the ideals, that this country \nstands for and how those whom we intend to put in very high places--how \ndo they comport to those standards and values? How will they conduct \nthe office for which they are nominated?\n  I believe strongly in the nomination of Eric Holder. As you have \nheard, he is highly qualified in experience, skills and temperament. As \nimportant, he understands the values of our country and the importance \nof justice. I have no doubt that Eric Holder will be an excellent \nAttorney General, will restore justice to the Department of Justice, \nand will uphold and further the historic values and ideals of our \ncountry, which will again be a bright shining light for justice and \nhope throughout the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam Chairman, I have decided to support Mr. Holder's \nnomination to be the next Attorney General of the United States. \nHowever, I want to make clear that just because I am voting to support \nMr. Holder, this nominee does have a few issues that give me some \nconcern.\n  For example, I am concerned about Mr. Holder's overly restrictive \nviews of the second amendment. In last year's challenge to the District \nof Columbia's gun ban in the U.S. Supreme Court case District of \nColumbia v. Heller, Mr. Holder joined an amicus brief arguing that the \nsecond amendment does not provide an individual right for citizens to \nown firearms. However, a majority of the Supreme Court held that the \nsecond amendment does indeed guarantee an individual right to keep and \nbear arms. I am a strong supporter of the second amendment, so I am \nconcerned that Mr. Holder's views may be too limited. I am also \nconcerned about Mr. Holder's reluctance to expand programs that enforce \ncurrent gun laws, such as ``Project Exile.'' This highly effective \ninitiative started in the 1990s, but was only implemented in a few \ntargeted cities. I don't understand why Mr. Holder is willing to \nconsider the need for new gun laws and regulations, when we could be \nembracing a nationwide expansion of a proven, successful program \nenforcing existing gun laws. In my opinion, Mr. Holder should \nreconsider this position.\n  I find Mr. Holder's involvement with the FALN clemencies to be \ntroubling. Mr. Holder played a pivotal role in obtaining clemencies for \nthe FALN terrorists. He fired pardon attorney Margaret Love who had \nissued a report in 1996 against clemency, and instructed the new pardon \nattorney Roger Adams to issue an ``options'' memo keeping clemency on \nthe table, even though the pardon attorney, U.S. prosecutors, Bureau of \nPrisons and FBI were all very much against clemency. Mr. Holder met \nwith a number of groups and politicians who supported the clemencies, \nbut never met with the victims. Mr. Holder testified that his \nrecommendation to support the FALN clemencies was ``reasonable'' and \n``appropriate.'' This is remarkable, especially since the FALN pardons \nwere criticized by the public and condemned by Congress.\n  Mr. Holder's handling of the Marc Rich pardon is also problematic. He \nrecommended Mr. Rich's pardon to President Clinton as ``neutral, \nleaning favorable,'' even though Mr. Rich was the biggest tax cheat in \nU.S. history, a fugitive of the law, and an individual who traded with \nthe enemy. Mr. Holder did not provide the Judiciary Committee with a \ngood explanation--legal, political or factual--for why he was \n``neutral, leaning favorable'' on the pardon. Mr. Holder assisted Jack \nQuinn--President Clinton's former White House counsel--in bypassing the \nU.S. prosecutors and other DOJ officials who opposed the pardon, and \nadvised Mr. Quinn on how to deal with the media and other logistics \nafter the pardon was issued. Although Mr. Holder did acknowledge that \nhe made a mistake with respect to the Rich pardon, I am troubled by Mr. \nHolder's deliberate maneuvering around the established Justice \nDepartment pardon processes. Also, I believe that Mr. Holder made \nstatements to the Senate Judiciary Committee about his involvement in \nthe Rich pardon that appear to be at odds with the facts as recorded in \ndocuments written at the time and testimony provided by other \nwitnesses. Mr. Holder has indicated that he will be responsive and \ncandid with Judiciary Committee requests, and that he will respect DOJ \ninternal processes and exercise better judgment with respect to DOJ \nmatters. I am hopeful that Mr. Holder will meet that commitment.\n  The U.S. Constitution requires Senators to fully vet the \nqualifications and fitness of presidential nominees and to exercise \ntheir independent judgment when they decide whether to ultimately \nconsent to them. This has been a difficult decision for me--\nparticularly because of the concerns that I have just outlined. \nHowever, Mr. Holder is an experienced individual with extensive \ncredentials. He has very good qualifications. Mr. Holder's a good \nlawyer. He has a lot of support in the law enforcement community. \nMoreover, Mr. Holder has acknowledged some of the mistakes he made--\neven though I believe he could have done a lot more. We had a \nproductive meeting when he came in to talk about his nomination last \nyear, and he seemed to be responsive to the issues that I raised with \nhim. He has committed to work with me on a number of matters that are \nimportant to me, such as the False Claims Act. He has pledged to \ncooperate with my oversight efforts and to be responsive to my document \nrequests. He has pledged to cooperate with Judiciary Committee \ninvestigations and requests for information. So I will support Mr. \nHolder's nomination. But I plan to hold Mr. Holder's feet to the fire \nto make sure that he leads the Justice Department in the right \ndirection and keeps Americans safe from criminals and terrorists.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, today I wish to support the nomination \nof Eric Holder to be Attorney General of the United States. This is an \nhistoric nomination--Eric Holder is the first African-American to be \nnominated to serve as the country's chief law enforcement officer. This \nis a much needed nomination. The Department of Justice, DOJ, is on life \nsupport, plagued with politics and partisanship. Under the previous \nadministration the Department of Justice authored torture memos, fired \nU.S. Attorneys for their political beliefs, funded pet projects, and \nspent taxpayer dollars on lavish conferences.\n  This country needs an Attorney General who will restore confidence \nand integrity to the Justice Department. We need an independent thinker \nwho is not influenced by politics or fear and who is dedicated to rule \nof law--not rule of ideology. We need a leader to hold the Department \naccountable--one who will provide fiscal accountability and stewardship \nof taxpayer dollars and stand sentry against waste, fraud, and abuse. \nNo more $5 Swedish meatballs.\n  I have three criteria for nominees to the executive branch: first, \nthe nominee must possess competence; second, the nominee must have a \ncommitment to the mission of the agency; and finally, the nominee must \nhave the highest integrity. Eric Holder passes all of these tests with \nflying colors.\n  First, his competence cannot be questioned. He was the No. 2 at the \nDepartment of Justice under the Clinton administration; he was U.S. \nattorney for the District of Columbia; he was nominated by President \nReagan and confirmed by the Senate to serve as a Superior Court judge \nfor the District of Columbia; and he was a career prosecutor in DOJ's \nPublic Integrity Section.\n  Second, he has shown an unwavering commitment to the Justice \nDepartment's mission to uphold the Constitution, fight corruption, \nprosecute criminals, and protect victims. He has fought throughout his \ncareer to make\n\n[[Page S1253]]\n\nsure our Nation's laws are applied fairly and that everyone gets a fair \nshake.\n  Third, Eric Holder possesses strong integrity. He has a history of \nfighting to root out corruption and prosecute criminals. He is the son \nof immigrants and has worked hard to get to where he is.\n  As chairwoman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the \nJustice Department, I want to make sure that the Department has what it \nneeds to protect this country from predatory attacks by terrorists and \npredatory attacks in our neighborhood. I have fought to put dollars in \nthe Federal checkbook to support the agency's efforts to combat \nterrorism and violent crime. I have fought to make sure that hard-\nworking, dedicated individuals who are responsible for carrying out \nthat mission have the resources they need.\n  The Justice Department needs an Attorney General who supports \nenforcing our country's laws, will protect the vulnerable, and will \nrestore morale and confidence. I believe Eric Holder is just the right \nman for the job. For the past 8 years, the previous administration has \nignored the Constitution, supported torture, denied basic access to \ncourts for detainees, slashed funding for cops on the beat, and spied \non innocent Americans. We need an Attorney General who will restore the \nrule of law and demand accountability for wrongdoing. We need an \nindependent thinker--not a rubber stamp for the President.\n  Eric Holder is a heavyweight lawyer. He has vigorously prosecuted \ncorrupt public officials from both parties. He put a mob boss behind \nbars for trying to bribe a juror. He is willing to take on the strong \nand powerful because he believes no one is above the law.\n  Yet the Department of Justice is not only responsible for upholding \nthe Constitution. Part of its core mission is to protect the most \nvulnerable. As a social worker, I have seen firsthand the despicable \ncrimes committed against children and know how important it is to hold \nthese abusers accountable in order to keep our children safe. Now, new \ntechnology puts children at even greater risk. There are sophisticated \ncyber-predators posing as children on the Internet and are harder to \ncatch. Eric Holder is a career prosecutor who has dedicated his life to \nprotecting the public and getting criminals off the street. As the U.S. \nAttorney for D.C., Holder created the Domestic Violence Unit, which was \na dedicated, one-stop shop for domestic violence survivors; he also \nspearheaded initiatives to protect children from abuse, sexual \npredators and cyber stalkers. I am confident that as Attorney General, \nthe country's chief of police, he will protect our children and our \nneighborhoods from violent and heinous crimes.\n  Not only does the country need Holder, the Department of Justice \ndoes. A recent DOJ Inspector General report found one of the top ten \nmanagement challenges at the Justice Department is to restore \nconfidence at the Department. The mission of the Justice Department has \nbeen sidelined and politics--not evidence--has driven hiring and firing \ndecisions. The prosecution of civil rights violations had dramatically \ndropped, while claims of workplace discrimination are on the rise. We \nneed a leader to put the Department back on track and restore integrity \nand independent thinking. It is time to get back to doing business that \nis free from politics and ideology. Time to enforce our civil rights \nlaws, prosecute financial corruption and cronyism, bolster local law \nenforcement to fight crime and protect the vulnerable. Eric Holder has \nserved as the Deputy Attorney General at Justice and has experience \nmanaging and leading. He knows the challenges the Department faces. He \nwill work with President Obama to restore the Department's reputation.\n  In conclusion, Eric Holder has spent his legal career protecting the \npublic from dirty public officials, violent criminals and predators, \nscheming corporate greed. I know as Attorney General, Eric Holder will \nmake sure the Justice Department is working for the American people--\nnot some political agenda. This is why I will vote to confirm Eric \nHolder to be the next Attorney General of the United States.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I am pleased to support the nomination \nof Eric Holder as Attorney General. I am convinced that he understands \nthe threat to our Nation posed by terrorism. In the Judiciary \nCommittee's hearing on the nomination, Mr. Holder agreed with me that \nthe United States is undoubtedly at war with a vicious and shadowy \nenemy, and that the war began before the attacks of September 11, 2001. \nFurther, Mr. Holder and I agreed that the battlefield in the war on \nterror is the entire globe--not only the combat zones of Afghanistan \nand Iraq but also the financial system through which terrorist networks \nare funded and the Internet through which terrorists communicate and \nspread their message of violence and hatred. Indeed, the tragic events \nof 9/11 proved that the battlefield even extends within our Nation's \nown borders. The question of how best to win the war on terror is the \nmost profound issue facing the next Attorney General. Mr. Holder \nunderstands the nature of this enemy and this conflict.\n  There are some in this body who will argue that Mr. Holder's previous \nmistakes should bar him from serving as Attorney General. In expressing \nmy support for Mr. Holder, I do not mean to minimize those \nmisjudgments. Indeed, Mr. Holder faces his past mistakes fully--\nadmitting them, learning from them, and promising to exercise better \njudgment in the future. While I understand concern with Mr. Holder's \npast errors, it would be a mistake in its own right to reject on that \nbasis this qualified nominee who so comprehends the challenge our \nNation faces in defeating terrorism.\n  I look forward to working with President Obama and Mr. Holder to \nfashion a system of detention for the war on terror involving all three \nbranches of government and of which all Americans can be proud. Mr. \nHolder and I agree that in order to maintain the moral high ground in \nthis war, which is critical, we must treat detainees fairly, with more \nprocess than they would necessarily provide us. We also agree that we \nmust not release dangerous warriors back to the fight against our \nNation. Criminalizing this war would be a terrible mistake, and Mr. \nHolder understands that.\n  Four years ago, President Obama, then Senator Obama, stated on the \nfloor of this chamber that the test of a nominee for Attorney General \nis, ``whether that person is ready to put the Constitution of the \npeople before the political agenda of the President.'' I am confident \nthat Eric Holder meets that test, and I ask my colleagues to support \nhis nomination.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this is a momentous day for the \nSenate. We are about to confirm a nominee for Attorney General of the \nUnited States who with two short declarative sentences uttered at his \nconfirmation hearing--without caveats, without parsing words, without \nequivocation--signaled a new direction for the Department of Justice \nand a turning of the page in the constitutional history of this \ncountry.\n  ``Waterboarding is torture.''\n  ``No one is above the law.''\n  With these simple words, Eric Holder reassured the Nation that the \nDepartment of Justice will be run by someone who believes in the rule \nof law and in impartial justice. It is sad, of course, that this is \nsomething remarkable. But that is where the last 8 years have left us.\n  The election of 2008 had many consequences. But none is more \nimportant than a chance to restore the rule of law and repair the \ndamage to the Department of Justice that has been done by the past \nadministration. Eric Holder is well equipped to take on this important \nand difficult task for three reasons.\n  First, he has spent over 25 years pursuing justice in public service, \nas a trial attorney in the Public Integrity Section of the Department, \nas a DC Superior Court judge, as U.S. attorney for the District of \nColumbia, and as Deputy Attorney General. He knows the Department of \nJustice as well as any person alive, he respects its history, and he \nhas the respect and support of career lawyers in the Department and \nformer Attorneys General and Deputy Attorneys General from both \nparties.\n  Second, he appears to have the independence and strength of character \nneeded to fulfill the special role that the Attorney General has in the \nPresident's Cabinet. He prosecuted powerful members of his own party \nwhen working in the Public Integrity Section and\n\n[[Page S1254]]\n\nas U.S. attorney. He recommended expanding the scope of Ken Starr's \ninvestigation of President Clinton. This record indicates that Mr. \nHolder understands the difference between being the people's lawyer and \nbeing the President's lawyer.\n  Third, he understands the need to revitalize the traditional missions \nof the Department--fighting crime, protecting civil rights, preserving \nthe environment, and ensuring the fairness of the marketplace--while at \nthe same time devoting himself to protecting the American people from a \nterrorist attack. I am optimistic that he will fight for the resources \nand the policies needed to do justice. Similarly, he understands that \nsecurity and liberty shouldn't be balanced or traded off against each \nother. They must be twin goals, both achievable, together, with hard \nwork and dedication to our national values. I was struck by words from \na speech Mr. Holder made in 2005, after he had left the Government:\n\n       Those who tell us that we must engage in warrantless \n     domestic surveillance, ``enhanced interrogation'' or \n     ``extraordinary rendition'' or we cripple ourselves in \n     combating terrorism offer a false choice. There is simply no \n     tension between an effective fight against those who have \n     sworn to harm us and a respect for our most honored civil \n     liberties traditions.\n\n  I could not agree more. I am very pleased that a person who so \nstrongly and unapologetically believes in the promise of our \nConstitution, now more than ever, will soon be the Attorney General of \nthe United States.\n  Let me say just a word about the Marc Rich pardon controversy, which \nis one of the areas on which opponents of Mr. Holder's nomination have \nfocused. I thought that pardon was a misuse of the President's power, \nand I said so at the time. Mr. Holder did not exercise his role in the \npardon process with the care or diligence he should have, and I \nappreciate the concerns that have been expressed about his involvement \nin this matter. But it is significant that, starting shortly after the \npardon and continuing to this day, Eric Holder actually stood up and \nadmitted that he made mistakes.\n  We have seen far too little of that in the past 8 years from the \nleadership at the Department of Justice and from the Bush \nadministration as a whole for that matter. Months and months of work on \nthe Judiciary Committee was needed, essentially, because Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales insisted that nothing he did in connection with the \nU.S. attorney firings was a mistake. Our country cannot afford \nleadership like that at the Department any more. The problems we face \nare too grave and too complicated for our leaders to insist on \ndefending indefensible conduct or continuing with policies that aren't \nworking simply because they don't want to admit they were wrong.\n  Madam President, just a little under 8 years ago, I voted for the \nnomination of John Ashcroft to be President Bush's first Attorney \nGeneral. I did so because despite significant policy differences, and \nnot insignificant criticism of some of his actions as a Senator, I \nbelieved that he was qualified for the job, and, most important, \nbecause I believed that a President is due great deference in filling \nhis Cabinet. I still believe that today. I am pleased that many of my \ncolleagues on the Republican side have decided to show that same \ndeference to President Obama. Eric Holder is highly qualified for this \nposition, his overall record and testimony suggest he will exercise his \nresponsibilities with care and judgment, and he is the President's \nchoice. He should be confirmed.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise to discuss my support for Eric \nHolder's nomination. When Mr. Holder was first nominated I had serious \nconcerns--concerns about his stance on the second amendment, which is \nimportant to me and so many Georgians I represent, concerns about the \npotential prosecution of those who interrogated detainees in accordance \nwith legal opinions issued by the Department of Justice's Office of \nLegal Counsel, and concerns about his role as Deputy Attorney General \nin some of President Clinton's pardons.\n  I had a long discussion with Mr. Holder last week and we talked \nextensively about the concerns that I had and that I know many of my \nconstituents have. After our conversation, I was convinced that he will \ncompetently serve as our next Attorney General, and will keep the best \ninterests of the American people in mind.\n  With respect to the second amendment, Mr. Holder recognizes the \ndecision of the U.S. Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller, \nholding the second amendment to be an individual right, to be the law \nof the land. With respect to former interrogators, he recognized that \nit does not make sense to prosecute those clearly acting under the \nauthority of the Office of Legal Counsel. Finally, with respect to his \nrole in President Clinton's pardoning of Marc Rich, Mr. Holder fully \nrecognized his mistakes and stated if he had to do it again, he would \nhave done things differently. I believe he will take that learning \nexperience with him into his role as Attorney General.\n  Finally, Mr. Holder has been unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate \non three separate occasions. He was praised by a Georgian and former \nAttorney General, Griffin Bell, who recently passed away and for whom I \nhad the utmost respect. President Obama deserves great deference in \nfilling out his Cabinet positions, and because of the very candid \nconversation I had with Mr. Holder, and my belief that he is up for the \ntask before him, I am pleased to support his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand the Senator from Texas has a \nrequest to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I understand under the previous order I \nhave been recognized for the next 20 minutes on this side, but I have \nbeen asked on this side to ask unanimous consent that the following \nRepublican Senators be recognized in this order during the remaining \ntime, going back and forth, as the distinguished chairman knows: \nFollowing my remarks, Senator Hatch for 10 minutes, Senator Bunning for \n5 minutes, Senator Sessions for 5 minutes, Senator Bond for 10 minutes, \nand Senator Hutchison for 5 minutes. I ask Republican speakers be \nrecognized in that order on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nnot intend to object, but has the distinguished Senator from Texas left \ntime for the ranking member if he wants it?\n  Mr. CORNYN. It is my understanding we have reserved sufficient time \nfor the ranking member to close.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I see a nod of affirmation from the staff. Being one who \nunderstands that we Senators are merely constitutional necessities to \nthe staff, Madam President, I have no objection to this with the \nunderstanding that we follow the usual comity of going from side to \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nrequest is agreed to. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I come to the floor more with regret \nthan anything else to say I oppose the nomination and confirmation of \nEric Holder to be the next United States Attorney General. I say this \nto my colleagues because I have approached this nomination with an open \nmind and actually a predisposition to vote for his confirmation. But, \nof course, we Senators have a constitutional duty--in providing advice \nand consent to the executive branch's executive nominations like this \none--to ask hard questions and to get the answers to those questions so \nour advice and consent may be an informed consent.\n  While I approached this nomination with an open mind and a \npredisposition to vote for Mr. Holder's confirmation, I ultimately \nconcluded that, as a result of the reasons I will detail momentarily, I \ncould not vote for his confirmation in good conscience.\n  Mr. Holder's experience in many ways uniquely qualifies him for this \npromotion as Attorney General, but it is that very same experience when \nhe served as Deputy Attorney General that calls into question his \nindependence and judgment, particularly when the President of the \nUnited States at the time, President Bill Clinton, basically wanted \nsomething out of the Department of Justice. This had to do specifically \nwith two clemency petitions, one for the FALN terrorists and the other \nfor the notorious Marc Rich. These two actions--where President Clinton \ncommuted the sentence of 16\n\n[[Page S1255]]\n\nPuerto Rican terrorists and the recommendation to pardon the \nbillionaire fugitive, Marc Rich--raised serious questions about Mr. \nHolder's independence and judgment.\n  When Mr. Holder came to my office, I asked him: Is there any reason \nyou would resign rather than carry out the orders of a President if you \nwere Attorney General?\n  He quickly said: Of course. If the President asked me to do something \nillegal or unethical, then I would resign rather than carry out those \ninstructions.\n  Well, no one is suggesting that what Mr. Holder did was illegal, \ngiven the fact that the President of the United States solely had the \nprerogative whether to grant these commutations, but I think any \nfairminded consideration of Mr. Holder's conduct under these \ncommutations raises some serious questions whether he could hold \nhimself to the very same standard that he articulated in my office.\n  Two other aspects of Mr. Holder's record concern me. One is his \ndemonstrated lack of seriousness regarding the profound threat posed by \nradical Islamic terrorism; secondly, as some Senators on my side of the \naisle have already pointed out, his apparent hostility to the second \namendment, the right to keep and bear arms, under our Constitution.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, on which I am proud to serve, Mr. Holder \nfailed to answer my questions and the questions of my colleagues in a \nway that alleviated these concerns. In fact, I found many of his \nresponses to be simply evasive.\n  As I said earlier, I have four reasons for opposing this nomination: \none, Mr. Holder's role in the FALN and Los Macheteros commutations, his \nrole in the Marc Rich pardon, his misjudgments and shifting opinions on \nthe war on terrorism, and his record of hostility to the individual \nright to keep and bear arms.\n  I think it is important to point out the facts of the commutations \nbecause they really are alarming, and many of our memories may have \nbeen dimmed because many of these events occurred long in the past.\n  In August 1999, President Clinton offered clemency to 16 members of \ntwo Puerto Rican separatist terrorist organizations, the FALN and Los \nMacheteros. Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder made the recommendation \nthat he should do so.\n  The FALN, in case people do not recall, was a clandestine terrorist \ngroup devoted to bringing about the independence of Puerto Rico through \nviolent means. Its members waged open war on America, with more than \n150 bombings, arsons, kidnappings, prison escapes, and threats and \nintimidation, all of which resulted in the deaths of at least 6 people \nand injuries to many more between 1974 and 1983.\n  The most gruesome of these attacks occurred in 1975 at a bombing in \nLower Manhattan. Timed to explode during lunchtime, the bomb \ndecapitated 1 of the 4 people killed and injured another 60. It is hard \nfor us to imagine what it would be like today if this were to occur, \nbut that, in fact, is what the FALN was found guilty of.\n  In another attack in Puerto Rico, Los Macheteros terrorists opened \nfire on a bus full of U.S. sailors, killing two, wounding nine.\n  Fortunately, much of the leadership of these terrorist groups was \ncaptured and brought to justice in the 1970s and 1980s. But by the mid-\n1980s, thankfully, the worst of their reign of terror was over.\n  In the early 1990s, sympathetic activists petitioned for clemency on \nbehalf of members of these groups. It was an easy call for the Pardon \nAttorney. That is the title of the individual whose responsibility it \nis to screen requests for clemency. These unrepentant terrorists had \nnot even bothered to petition for clemency themselves. So Pardon \nAttorney Margaret Love, who worked for then-Deputy Attorney General \nJamie Gorelick, recommended against clemency for any of these \nprisoners, and her recommendation was transmitted to the President. But \nafter Eric Holder became Deputy Attorney General, he rescinded that \nrecommendation opposing clemency and he recommended that President \nClinton grant clemency to these unrepentant terrorists.\n  Strangely, and really inexplicably, from my perspective, Mr. Holder \nnow continues to stand by these recommendations as ``reasonable.'' But \nI do not think the reasons he gives are persuasive.\n  Mr. Holder, first of all, claims these individuals are not ``linked \nto violence.'' That is clearly false. These men were active members of \nterrorist groups that committed dozens of violent crimes, as I \ndescribed a moment ago. It is true that they individually were not \nprosecuted for the worst of those crimes, but by that standard, anyone \nwho conspires to commit violence and murder is not linked to violence, \nonly those who actually execute the orders of the higher ups.\n  These commutations were, at the time, widely believed to be \npolitically linked. Indeed, the Clinton White House discussed how the \nclemencies would affect then-Vice President Gore's aspirations for \nhigher office, particularly among the Puerto Rican community. For this \nreason, I believe a full accounting of the individuals Mr. Holder met \nwith, what they discussed, and what went into his decisions in \nrecommending these commutations is in order.\n  But there is another reason these questions should be answered; that \nis, it is only fair and just that the victims of the violence of these \ntwo terrorist groups be provided answers.\n  I would encourage all of my colleagues before voting to review the \ntestimony of Joseph Connor, whose father was killed in the bombing in \nLower Manhattan. Mr. Connor testified that Mr. Holder did not consult \nwith him, did not contact him or his family or other victims before \nrecommending that the FALN terrorists go free. I cannot vote for Mr. \nHolder's nomination until I can explain my vote to Joseph Connor.\n  Less than 2 years after the controversial recommendation for \ncommuting the sentences of these FALN terrorists and Los Macheteros \nterrorists, on the very last night of the Clinton administration, Mr. \nHolder made a very similar error in judgment when he recommended that \nPresident Clinton pardon the notorious fugitive Marc Rich. At the time, \nMr. Rich was No. 6 on the FBI's Most Wanted list.\n  In 1983, then-U.S. attorney Rudy Giuliani got an indictment of \ninternational commodities trader Marc Rich and his business partner \nPincus Green. The indictment charged 65 counts of tax evasion, \nracketeering, and trading with the enemy. Specific charges include \nillegally trading with the Ayatollah Khamenei's Iranian terrorist \nregime, in violation of U.S. energy laws and the trade embargo against \nIran. Indeed, Mr. Rich made a fortune trading with the Ayatollah's \nregime at the same time that 52 American diplomats were being held \nhostage in Tehran. Mr. Rich profited by trading with Cuba, Libya, and \nSouth Africa during apartheid, all despite U.S. embargoes.\n  Rather than face the charges, Mr. Rich fled to Switzerland, where he \nremained a fugitive for 17 years. Law enforcement, including CIA, the \nNSA, and other Federal agencies, expended substantial resources in \ntrying to apprehend Mr. Rich. These efforts included extradition \nrequests and attempts by U.S. marshals to seize him abroad.\n  Mr. Rich refused to return to the United States despite an offer by \nprosecutors that they would actually drop the racketeering charges in \nexchange for his return. In a final effort to avoid extradition, Mr. \nRich went so far as to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He tried to \nbecome a citizen of Bolivia.\n  It is hard for me to imagine anyone less deserving of clemency by the \nPresident of the United States than a fugitive from justice accused of \ntrading with the enemy. Mr. Rich's own lawyer told him that he ``spit \non the American flag'' by avoiding the jurisdiction of our courts.\n  On the last evening of the Clinton administration, White House \nCounsel called Mr. Holder to solicit his views on the Rich pardon. As \nDeputy Attorney General, Holder was effectively speaking for the entire \nDepartment during this crucial call. Strongly disregarding the views of \nthe hundreds of DOJ prosecutors and FBI agents who had worked nearly \ntwo decades to bring Mr. Rich to justice, Holder told White House \nCounsel Beth Nolan that he was ``neutral, leaning favorable.''\n\n[[Page S1256]]\n\nWith this recommendation from the Deputy Attorney General in hand, \nPresident Clinton granted the Rich pardon, in one of his last and most \ninexplicable actions.\n  Senator Specter, the distinguished ranking member from Pennsylvania, \ncorrectly recounted what former FBI Director Louis Freeh said about \nthat pardon. He called it a ``corrupt act.'' Now, Mr. Holder has, \nduring hearings, accepted fault and admitted that he made a mistake. I \ndo not know how he can do any differently. But never in a full day of \nhearings and written questions did Mr. Holder offer a good reason for \nsupporting the pardon in the first place. He defends himself by saying \nhe was naive. He admits it was a mistake and promises he will not make \nthe same mistake again. But this is difficult to square with the fact \nthat 2 years earlier, Mr. Holder agreed that the FALN commutations were \na reasonable act. It appears to be something of a trend here.\n  The other area I am very concerned about, as I mentioned earlier, is \nthe questions I asked Mr. Holder about the war on terrorism. Of course, \nit is hard for us now to recount the horrors of 9/11 when al-Qaida \ncommandeered airplanes and hit here in Washington, DC, and New York, \nkilling 3,000 Americans. It was in the wake of that that, of course, \nthe Congress authorized the use of military force against al-Qaida in \nAfghanistan and against the Taliban. It is in the wake of that that \nCongress passed the PATRIOT Act to provide enhanced tools to our law \nenforcement agencies and our intelligence agencies to try to make sure \n9/11 never, ever happened again.\n  The Department of Justice, particularly in the Office of Legal \nCounsel, was struggling with new efforts to try to figure out how to \nprotect Americans from future attacks. I believe they struggled in good \nfaith to try to come up with legal guidance for our President, his \nadministration, and the intelligence authorities to make sure they were \noperating within the limits of the law, which, of course, prohibits \ntorture. But I want to recount what Mr. Holder said in January 2002, \nwhich is at stark odds with what he has said now in 2008. He said in \nJanuary 2002 that captured al-Qaida terrorists ``are not, in fact, \npeople entitled to the protection of the Geneva Conventions. They are \nnot prisoners of war.'' He went on to endorse indefinite detention of \nterrorists at Guantanamo Bay and argued that such prisoners should not \nbe afforded Geneva Convention protections so that they could be \ninterrogated and provide actionable intelligence that could prevent \nfuture attacks. But more recently, taking perhaps a more political or \nideological bent, he chastised the Bush administration for policies he \nnow seems to believe defy the law.\n  I want to quote at length from an Associated Press article entitled \n``Obama AG pick defended Guantanamo policy,'' dated November 22, 2008. \nAccording to this article, when asked whether terrorism suspects could \nbe held forever, Holder responded:\n\n       It seems to me you can think of these people as combatants \n     and we are in the middle of a war.\n\n  Holder said in a CNN interview in January 2002:\n\n       And it seems to me that you could probably say, looking at \n     precedent, that you are going to detain these people until \n     the war is over, if that is ultimately what we wanted to do.\n\n  Just weeks later, this article goes on to say, Holder told CNN he did \nnot believe al-Qaida suspects qualified as prisoners of war under the \nGeneva Conventions.\n  He said:\n\n       One of the things we clearly want to do with these \n     prisoners is to have an ability to interrogate them and find \n     out what their future plans might be, where other cells may \n     be located. Under the Geneva Conventions, you are really \n     limited in the amount of information that you can elicit from \n     people.\n\n  Holder said it was important to treat detainees humanely, but he said \nthey ``are not, in fact, people entitled to the protection of the \nGeneva Convention. They are not prisoners of war.''\n  In this article, he also downplayed criticism that these detainees \nwere being mistreated. Now, these were essentially the same arguments \nbeing made by the Bush administration in the wake of 9/11. Since then, \nthose arguments, as we all know, have been criticized by human rights \ngroups, leading Democrats, and, surprisingly enough, Mr. Holder \nhimself.\n  He gave a speech to the American Constitution Society in June of 2008 \nwhere he said, ``We must close our detention center at Guantanamo \nBay.''\n  He said:\n\n       A great nation should not detain people, military or \n     civilian, in dark places beyond the reach of law. Guantanamo \n     Bay is an international embarrassment.\n\n  He added that he never thought he would see the day where ``The \nSupreme Court would have to order the President of the United States to \ntreat detainees in accordance with the Geneva Convention.''\n  Those sharply contrasting positions from 2002 to 2008 make me wonder \nif this is the same person, the same Eric Holder. Moreover, it makes me \nwonder what it is he truly believes. In 2008, Mr. Holder, in a speech \nbefore the American Constitution Society, attacked many of the \npositions he once held as ``making a mockery of the rule of law.'' In \nthat speech he called for ``a reckoning'' over the Bush \nadministration's ``unlawful practices in the war on terror.'' He also \naccused the Bush administration of ``act[ing] in direct defiance of \nFederal law'' and railed against counterterrorism policies that he \nclaimed ``violate international law and the United States \nConstitution.'' It is one thing to change your mind; it is another \nthing to change your mind and attack the very position you once held as \none that could only be held in bad faith. It is cynical to characterize \na position you once held later as ``making a mockery of the rule of \nlaw.''\n  The recent attacks in Mumbai have reminded Americans of the \npossibility of another attack, literally anywhere in the world by \ncommitted terrorists. On November 26, 2008, Mumbai was ravaged by a \ngang of terrorists. More than 170 people died as a result of bombings \nand gunfire, including 6 Americans. If an American city were targeted \nin the same manner as Mumbai, or worse--let's say these terrorists had \na biological, chemical, or nuclear device--it is critical that our laws \ngive law enforcement personnel, intelligence personnel, the President \nof the United States the very intelligence they need in order to detect \nand defeat those attacks. Our intelligence officials and those who act \nconsistent with interpretations of the law from the Office of Legal \nCounsel at the Department of Justice need to know the law is not going \nto change after they act consistent with what they understand the law \nto be in order to protect American citizens from future attacks.\n  I worry about Mr. Holder's shifting opinions on what the law provides \nfor and what it does not. I worry about the chilling effect it will \nhave on future intelligence officials who may decide rather than risk \nprosecution by shifting opinions on what the law provides or does not, \nrather than risking everything I have worked a lifetime for, including \nwhat I have provided for my family, I am going to play it safe. From \nwhat we learned on 9/11, according to the 9/11 Commission, when we \ntreat it safe, when we treat terrorism as a criminal act alone, we \ninvite future attacks against our country.\n  For all these reasons, I oppose the nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from a number of hunting \ngroups, anglers, landowners, and conservation groups in my State be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 2, 2009.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Cornyn and Hutchison: The organizations \n     listed above represent hunters, anglers, landowners, \n     conservationists, natural resource professionals and many law \n     abiding gun owners in Texas. These groups and individuals \n     share a strong interest in sustaining and protecting our \n     current and future conservation initiatives, our long \n     standing hunting heritage, and ensuring our success to \n     effectively manage Texas' fish and wildlife resources. The \n     listed groups want to express their strong opposition to the \n     approval of Eric Holder's nomination as Attorney General of \n     the United States.\n       Mr. Holder has consistently demonstrated opposition to our \n     Second Amendment Rights and has argued against the individual \n     right to keep and bear arms, as determined by the\n\n[[Page S1257]]\n\n     U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. vs Heller. He has \n     advocated for what we consider extreme gun restrictions. We \n     believe that Mr. Holder, as a preeminent legal expert and \n     outspoken advocate on stricter gun laws, would be in a \n     particularly powerful position to implement bureaucratic \n     measures and create procedural mischief that would erode gun \n     ownership rights.\n       We are forced to logically contend that increased gun \n     control will result in a direct reduction in sales of \n     firearms and ammunition leading to a reduction in Federal Aid \n     funds available through the Sport Fish and Wildlife \n     Restoration Act. This will mean a reduction in funding to \n     financially support state fish and game agencies across the \n     nation and specifically the Texas Parks and Wildlife \n     Department in Texas, thus reducing our ability to conserve \n     our fish, wildlife and natural resources. This is a critical \n     issue for the hunter, angler and conservation community.\n       While there seems to be a sense that President Obama is \n     still in a ``honeymoon period'' with his appointments that \n     are being reviewed by the Senate, this nomination clearly \n     must be thoroughly vetted and Mr. Holder's positions clearly \n     exposed and challenged. A lopsided vote without direct \n     confrontation over these extreme gun control positions would \n     send the wrong message and certainly erode progress that has \n     been made on Second Amendment issues and the individual right \n     to keep and bear arms.\n       Thank you in advance for at the least speaking out and \n     highlighting these concerns during the upcoming vote.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I know the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Minnesota, the distinguished only Senator from Minnesota, seeks \nrecognition, the newest member of the Judiciary Committee, an \nextraordinarily valued addition to the committee. We are especially \nhappy whenever we have a former prosecutor come on the committee.\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  I rise today in support of Eric Holder to be the next Attorney \nGeneral of the United States.\n  The next Attorney General will need to hit the ground running, from \nbeefing up civil rights and antitrust enforcement to addressing white-\ncollar crime and drug-related violence, to helping keep our country \nsafe from terrorist attacks. As I told the Judiciary Committee last \nweek when I voted in favor of his nomination, Eric Holder is the right \nman to do the job. He is the right man to lead the Department of \nJustice at this critical time. And most importantly, coming from a \nState that had our own share of problems with a political appointee put \nin place as U.S. Attorney, he is the right man to get the Department \nback on course, to put the law first, when it comes to the Department \nof Justice.\n  First, as I look at the reasons why I am supporting his confirmation, \nat a key time in our Nation's history, where we deal with terrorist \nacts not contemplated in simpler times--from cyber battlefields to \nsophisticated crimes, from market manipulation to financial fraud--Eric \nHolder has a clear command of the legal issues confronting our country. \nThat was apparent in the discussions that took place during the \nnomination hearing. There were a number of Senators, particularly those \non the other side of the aisle, who had some very good questions. When \nyou listened to the discussion Eric Holder had with Senator Kyl \nregarding some of the ongoing foreign intelligence issues, from \nmultipoint wiretap authority to lone-wolf surveillance authority, it \nwas obvious that Eric Holder knew what he was talking about. He was \nconvincing to Senator Kyl as they discussed this. The discussions he \nhad with Senators Hatch and Feingold regarding executive power and \ncongressional authority and the important back and forth with Senators \nSessions, Graham, and Feinstein regarding terrorism cases, regarding \nthe unique nature of those cases, regarding the issues facing our \nagents and soldiers in the field and the prosecution of detainees, \ndespite what we recently heard from my colleague from Texas, it is no \nsurprise to me that after hearing Eric Holder's command of the law and \nthe issues facing the country, the vote on the committee was \noverwhelming. The vote was 17 to 2. So many of my Republican colleagues \nwho earlier had expressed concerns about Eric Holder ended up \nsupporting him and voting for him and asking that he be the next \nAttorney General.\n  The second reason I am glad to support Eric Holder is he is committed \nto the bread-and-butter work of the Justice Department. As Chairman \nLeahy noted, before I came to the Senate I was a prosecutor for 8 \nyears. I ran an office of 400 people. I had some sense of the \nimportance of going after not only the big crimes but also the little \ncrimes. Eric Holder was a pioneer in this area when he was U.S. \nattorney and established a community prosecution initiative. It is \nbuilt on the idea of community policing. It goes back to the basics. \nThe idea is instead of a prosecutor sitting in the office looking at a \nbunch of files, none with any relation to the neighborhood we are \nsupposed to protect, the prosecutor is assigned to a certain area to \nwork with the same police, to work with the same neighborhood groups. \nWhile there may be some crimes committed in the government centers in \nthis country, for the most part they are not. This idea of community \nprosecution connects what goes on in those four walls of the government \ncenters, in those four squares of the centers to the neighborhoods out \nin the field, to the people out in the field. When we did this in \nHennepin County by assigning prosecutors by geographic area to work \ndirectly with a set group of police and neighborhood groups, we got \nbetter results for liveability crimes. We got stronger sentences, and \nwe saw a 120-percent reduction in crime. Again, Eric Holder, when he \nwas U.S. Attorney in the District of Columbia, which involves not just \ndoing U.S. attorney type prosecution but also the bread-and-butter work \nof prosecutions in the District because of its unique nature, he was \none of the pioneers for community prosecution. It shows his command and \nexplains why he has so much support from law enforcement.\n  I remember actually during this time we had a visit--this is way \nback, years ago--from a Presidential candidate to one of our suburban \nareas. I said to one of the police officers: Do you want to meet this \nperson? He said: Well, not really. I want to know if Terry Froling is \nhere. She was our community prosecutor we had assigned to that suburb \nof Bloomington, MN, whom he had gotten to know and respect. It brought \nhome to me again how important this program was. You can see the faith \nthat law enforcement has put on Eric Holder by the number of bipartisan \nendorsements he has received. You also see the endorsements of \nRepublican-appointed prosecutors such as my law school classmate Jim \nComey. That means a lot to me, and it should mean a lot to Members of \nthe Senate.\n  Third, Eric Holder is a humble person who is willing to admit \nmistakes. From my brief 2 years here, we need a little bit more of that \nin Washington. As a former prosecutor, I am not a big fan of pardons. I \ntold this to Mr. Holder. But anyone who has worked in the criminal \njustice system, whether as a police officer or prosecutor or a public \ndefender or a judge, anyone who has worked in the system for any length \nof time knows that people make mistakes. For 8 years, when I managed \nour office, I saw the gut-wrenching decisions--and I had to make some \nmyself--that the people have to make on the frontline.\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\nFrom the momentary decisions that police officers need to make at a \nfast-moving crime scene, whether to shoot, whether to knock down a \ndoor, to the decisions prosecutors need to make about whether to call a \ncertain witness or whether to plea down a case when the case is falling \napart and they know their own hope to get someone off the street they \nconsider dangerous is to accept that plea--those are the tough \ndecisions that may not make good television, but they are the true \ndecisions that prosecutors need to make every day.\n  If you want someone with experience for this job, they are going to \nhave made some decisions you don't like or that I don't like. There is \nabsolutely no doubt about it. People who are in this field have to make \nliterally dozens of decisions a day. They are going to make some \ndecisions you don't like. They will have made some mistakes. I am glad \nthey were discussed and brought up at the nomination hearing and glad \nthat so many of my committee colleagues actually took the time to \nlisten to the nominee. He explained that one thing was a mistake, that \nhe wouldn't have made that decision if he had more information. He \nadmitted that, and we were able to question him at length. He explained \nsome things that he still supported that they didn't agree with or that \nthe times had changed and they had more information and there is reason \nthey didn't agree with it now. Those discussions were had and he was \ncandid.\n  What we have learned from that committee hearing is that in the end, \nso many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle looked at this man \nas a whole, and they decided that as a whole his experience, while \nthere may have been flaws in his experience, led them to support him \nfor this job, which leads to my last reason.\n  Eric Holder's background is, first, as a prosecutor in the field. But \njust as importantly, it is also as a sound, solid, competent manager \nwho is guided by justice, someone who will lead quietly but firmly, \nsomeone who will work to build the morale of a department that has \nsuffered for too long. As I mentioned, I saw it in my own State when \none bad decision made up on high, when the Attorney General was Alberto \nGonzales, putting an inexperienced political appointee into the top \nspot of a gem of a U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota, created \nabsolute havoc in our State and in that office. I had worked with that \noffice for years. I know the people who work there. I know how high \nquality they are. That one decision wreaked havoc in that office. \nThanks to General Mukasey, that office is now steady. I appreciate how \nhe consulted with me about the replacement for that job. I also \nappreciate how our State's acting U.S. Attorney Frank Magill has \nskillfully guided the office through a difficult time and restored \nmorale. But that experience with the U.S. Attorney's Office in my State \nhas brought home to me the importance of having an Attorney General who \nputs the law and not politics at the helm of the Department of Justice. \nAs former Attorney General Dick Thornburg said, Attorney General for \nPresidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush:\n\n       The next Attorney General will need to restore the image of \n     the Department of Justice as a nonpartisan organization \n     dedicated to the rule of law.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. We need to put justice and the law at the \nhelm. I support the Holder nomination to be Attorney General because I \nbelieve Eric Holder can steer this big ship and get it back on course \nand put justice at the helm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I need about 7 or 8 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, point of inquiry. I certainly don't want to \ninterfere with the Senator from Kentucky, but I think Senator Cornyn \nhad locked in a specific amount of time for the Senator from Kentucky; \nam I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BUNNING. All right. I will not argue with the Senator from \nVermont.\n  I rise today to discuss the nomination of Eric Holder to be U.S. \nAttorney General. Unfortunately, I cannot support his nomination to \nthis post.\n  While Mr. Holder certainly has the experience and credentials that \none would want to see as head of the Department of Justice, his \njudgment is lacking. As a Deputy Attorney General in the Clinton \nadministration, Mr. Holder approved several controversial pardons.\n  First, I wish to mention the case of Marc Rich. At the close of the \nClinton administration, a pardon was issued for this infamous fugitive \nfinancier. Mr. Rich was charged in the early 1980s with 51 counts of \ntax fraud for evading more than $48 million in taxes.\n  He was also indicted for conducting illegal oil deals with the \nIranian Government at the time Iran was holding 52 U.S. citizens \nhostage. Mr. Rich then fled the country and allegedly renounced his \nU.S. citizenship to avoid extradition. This was enough to land him on \nthe FBI's ``Ten Most Wanted List.''\n  Mr. Holder's recommendation on this pardon of Mr. Rich was ``neutral, \nleaning favorable.'' Accounts indicate he did this without consulting \nthe prosecutors handling the Rich case in the Southern District of New \nYork. His willingness to push this pardon ahead is troubling, to say \nthe least.\n  The second questionable pardon involving Mr. Holder concerns 16 \nmembers of the terrorist group, the Armed Forces of National \nLiberation, better known as FALN. This radical group supports Puerto \nRican independence and was labeled as a terrorist group by the FBI. \nBetween 1974 and 1983, FALN claimed responsibility for more than 120 \nbombings in the United States. These bombings killed six people and \ninjured many more.\n  Mr. Holder overturned previous denials of clemency for these \nterrorists. The pardons were also opposed by two U.S. attorneys who \nprosecuted FALN cases, and by the FBI. According to the Los Angeles \nTimes, Mr. Holder even overruled the Office of the Pardon Attorney at \nthe Department of Justice. In fact, Mr. Holder never reached out to \nopponents of this clemency or one family of the victims. The son of a \nman killed in an FALN bombing first learned about the pardons from \nreading the newspaper.\n  I am also very concerned about Mr. Holder's views on second amendment \nrights. During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, he was consistently vague and would not answer directly on \nquestions regarding the second amendment.\n  I find this to be unsettling and unsatisfactory. However, past \nstatements and actions indicate a nominee who has shown hostility \ntoward the right of Americans to keep and bear arms. The Supreme Court \ndecision last year in the Heller case reaffirmed that the second \namendment is an individual right, and Mr. Holder opposes this decision. \nHe seems to hold the view that gun possession is not a right, as the \nHeller case confirmed, but more a privilege or hobby that needs to be \nstrictly regulated.\n  Mr. Holder is supportive of old ideas for gun control that have never \nproven to make people safer at the expense of taking away their rights. \nHe has indicated he will favor licensing and registering all gun \nowners, a policy I do not think will sit well with Americans.\n  Lastly, the Attorney General of the United States is the Nation's top \nlaw enforcement official. He cannot pick and choose which of our rights \nhe will defend and which ones he will overrun. His views on the second \namendment make me very wary of his confirmation to this great position \nhe is being considered to be confirmed to. Coupled with his handling of \nthe Clinton era pardons, I think this nomination is very worrisome. It \nis unfortunate, but I cannot support this nominee. I will be voting \nagainst his confirmation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, seeing the Senator from California on the \nfloor, how much time would the Senator wish to have?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I do not believe I will use it, but if \nI might have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom California 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S1259]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully strongly disagree with the \ndistinguished Senator.\n  In my 16 years on the Judiciary Committee, I have never seen a more \nqualified nominee. Mr. Holder has been a prosecutor in the Public \nIntegrity Section of the Department of Justice; a Superior Court judge \nfor the District of Columbia; the U.S. attorney for the District of \nColumbia; an attorney in private practice; and the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, the No. 2 position in the Department. I \ndo not think you can beat these credentials.\n  Now, people find one two decisions out of a multiplicity of decisions \nMr. Holder has made with which they disagree--and they are welcome to \ndisagree--but that does not destroy his value or his worth as Attorney \nGeneral.\n  President Reagan first appointed Holder to be a Superior Court judge, \nand President Clinton then named him U.S. attorney and Deputy Attorney \nGeneral. On all three occasions, he was unanimously confirmed by the \nSenate.\n  Today, his nomination is being broadly supported by Members of both \nparties. We have received letters from people such as the former FBI \nDirector, Louis Freeh; former Deputy Attorneys General Jim Comey, Paul \nMcNulty, and Larry Thompson; former Solicitor General and Republican \nTed Olsen; and President George H.W. Bush's Attorney General, William \nBarr.\n  Virtually every single law enforcement agency in the country has come \nout to endorse him: the Fraternal Order of Police, the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, the Attorneys General of over 30 \nStates, the National Criminal Justice Association, and on and on.\n  He has unified support among the civil rights community: the NAACP, \nthe Asian-American Justice Center, the Mexican-American Legal Defense \nand Educational Fund, and the Human Rights Campaign.\n  It is rare to see such bipartisan support for a candidate. In Mr. \nHolder's case, I believe it is very well deserved. He is a man of \nintegrity, intelligence, humility, and heart.\n  I remember our prior Attorney General, Mr. Gonzales, making the \nstatement that he wore two hats. At the time he said it, I did not \nrealize what the implication was. He stated, and on the record, that he \nrepresented the President of the United States and he represented the \npeople of this Nation.\n  Well, we saw in spades what a double-hatted Attorney General can do. \nWe saw the politicization of that Department. We saw the top people in \nthe Department acting politically with appointments. We saw the \ndiminution of the Civil Rights Division. We saw at least 9 U.S. \nattorneys terminated because the administration did not agree with the \ndecision they either refused to make or made. That is not the way the \nAttorney General should run what is a very large Department.\n  This is a $25 billion agency. It has over 100,000 employees. It is \ncharged with fighting terrorism, stopping violent crime, upholding our \ncivil rights laws, and enforcing our civil liberties. As those of us on \nthe Judiciary Committee know well, the Department is badly in need of \nrepair.\n  In January of 2007--as a matter of fact, I remember it well--I came \nto the floor, and I said someone, a Republican, had called me and said \nthat on a given day in December, seven U.S. attorneys had been fired. \nWell, I checked, and in fact that was correct. On December 7, seven \nU.S. attorneys had been fired. What he also told me: It was all for the \nwrong reasons. And he said: Look into it.\n\n  Under the leadership of the chairman of the committee, Pat Leahy, we \ndid look into it. What we found was a trend in the middle of the term \nto essentially take certain U.S. attorneys and terminate them for one \nreason or another: some, I believe, because they would not bring a \ncertain prosecution and some, I believe to this day, because they did \nbring a certain prosecution.\n  Last year, Inspector General Glenn Fine released four separate \nreports documenting violations of civil service laws and politicized \nhiring throughout the Department. Well, there is a big job to do, and \nit is going to be Mr. Holder's duty to turn this Department around, to \nrestore its credibility.\n  This is a proud Department, and I believe Mr. Holder gave every one \nof us on the committee confidence last month when he stated this:\n\n       [T]he notion that the Justice Department would ever take \n     into account a person's political affiliation or political \n     beliefs in making [career] hiring decisions is antithetical \n     to everything that the Department stands for. Now, that is a \n     substantial commitment, and those of us on the Judiciary \n     Committee will be watching him carry it out. So I am \n     delighted this new Attorney General--I believe will be \n     confirmed at 6:15 tonight--will restore the integrity and the \n     professionalism of this great Department.\n\n  In my view, despite differences on certain judgments, there is no \none--no one--more qualified to become Attorney General of the United \nStates than Eric Holder, and I will proudly cast my vote for him.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \nRepublican side, and how much time is remaining on the Democratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic side has 31 minutes 40 seconds, \nand the Republican side has 31 minutes 5 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer. I do not see any Republicans in the Chamber, although it would \nbe their turn to speak next on this confirmation. While we are waiting, \nI will mention a couple things, and do this on the Democratic time.\n  There has been a lot of criticism of pardons and clemencies that \nformer President Clinton granted. I would note that it was not Eric \nHolder who granted any of these clemencies or pardons. It was President \nClinton.\n  Now, I know for the last 8 years, certainly while the Republicans \nwere in charge, we would have one hearing, one investigation after \nanother about the Clinton years, and it seemed to be kind of on \nautomatic pilot. I heard a lot of outrage on the Republican side about \npardons granted by President Clinton, and I shared my disappointment in \nsome of those. I have heard them say people should have spoken out \nimmediately. Well, many of us did.\n  But I was not able to find a single one who spoke out showing any \noutrage a few months ago when Republican President Bush gave a pass to \nScooter Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's former Chief of Staff, who \ncommuted his prison sentence a very short time before he was about to \nbegin that sentence. That was an extraordinarily serious case that \ninvolved leaking the name of a covert CIA operative for a political \npurpose, and the decision to communicate that leak was made by \nPresident Bush, despite objections from the prosecutor, despite \nobjections from the victim, and despite objections from the public. I \ndo not recall any Republicans objecting to President Bush's decision.\n  Now, they say they are objecting to something President Clinton did. \nI do not want to suggest in any way that the objections are partisan, \nbut they certainly are not consistent.\n  I know Republicans set the standard as to who should be Attorney \nGeneral. They voted unanimously for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. \nAfterwards, many quietly talked to the White House about getting rid of \nAttorney General Gonzales because he was not up to par, but they were \nnot going to vote against him. Now we have somebody far more qualified, \nand the Republicans talk about voting against him.\n  On the subject of the FALN, I should not that we have already had \nmany hearings on this issue. I, for one, was critical of the \ncommutations made by President Clinton, but let's look at the record \nand let's look at the facts. As Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Holder had \nno final decision-making power to grant clemency or pardons. Mr. \nHolder's memo to the White House made no recommendation on clemency for \nthe prisoners. It simply provided the analysis that is expected to be \nprovided to the White House with multiple options for each prisoner. \nNone of the FALN members offered clemency by President Clinton were \npresent when individuals were killed or injured. The prisoners who were \noffered clemency were released under strict supervision by Federal \nprobation authorities. None have caused any future harm. The only ones \nwho were given clemency were\n\n[[Page S1260]]\n\nthose who announced their willingness to renounce violence and had \nalready served from 17 to 19 years. This was not a get-out-of-jail free \ncard.\n  The clemency provided by President Clinton was supported by various \nMembers of Congress; numerous religious, human rights, labor, Hispanic, \ncivic and community groups; as well as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and \nother Nobel prize recipients. I would note that many of the law \nenforcement agencies and law enforcement officials who were critical of \nthe FALN clemencies given by former President Clinton are the same \nprosecutors who had prosecuted those cases and who came forward and \nstrongly and unequivocally endorsed Eric Holder to be Attorney General \nof the United States.\n  So we can talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and set \nup double standards. The fact is, the people most knowledgeable about \nwhat happened argued in favor of Eric Holder as Attorney General.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of \nEric Holder for the position of Attorney General of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized under \nthe previous order for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  My decision to support Mr. Holder's nomination does not come easily. \nCertainly, Mr. Holder has an outstanding reputation as a career \nprosecutor and an effective litigator, and he has received strong \nsupport from prominent government and former government officials on \nboth sides of the aisle. However, I have been concerned about a number \nof aspects of Mr. Holder's nomination.\n  First, I have been deeply troubled by Mr. Holder's poor \ndecisionmaking in the case of the pardon of Mr. Rich and the FALN \nmembers. Also, I have been concerned about his past comments regarding \nthe second amendment, even after the Supreme Court rendered its pro-\nindividual rights decision earlier this year. Most notably, I have been \nconcerned about some of the comments related to intelligence activities \nthat Mr. Holder made in past public speeches and during his recent \nconfirmation hearing.\n  As vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I want to ensure that \nthe intelligence community has the tools it needs to protect the \ncountry, and I want to make sure we will have an Attorney General in \nplace who will help keep America safe.\n  In an effort to gain some clarity on Mr. Holder's current thinking on \nthese issues and concerns, he met with me privately to discuss them. We \ndiscussed, for example, the President's Terrorist Surveillance Program, \nthe FISA Amendments Act, the intelligence community's Detention and \nInterrogation Program, Guantanamo Bay, various interrogation \nlegislative proposals, the applicability of the writ of habeas corpus \nto terrorists, renditions, and media leak investigations. A few days \nlater we had a second meeting to discuss further the issues of great \nconcern to me and my position on the Intelligence Committee, notably, \nthe carrier liability provisions in the FISA Amendments Act and the \npropriety of investigating intelligence officials who acted in good \nfaith and with proper authorization in the conduct of intelligence \ninterrogations.\n  There have been some confusing press reports about my meetings with \nMr. Holder as well as statements from Senators who were not in \nattendance at those meetings about it. So now is probably a good time \nto set the record straight.\n  First, it should go without saying that neither Mr. Holder nor I made \nany pledges or promises with respect to his nomination. We met, rather, \nso that we could share our perspectives on these very important issues. \nIn those meetings, Mr. Holder provided me some additional insight that \nassures me he and the Department of Justice will be looking forward to \nkeeping the Nation safe.\n  I invite my colleagues' attention to the following written assurance \ngiven by Mr. Holder to Senator Kyl about a week ago concerning the \ninvestigation of intelligence officials conducting interrogation \nactivities. He said:\n\n       Prosecutorial and investigative judgments must depend on \n     the facts and no one is above the law. But where it is clear \n     that a government agent has acted in responsible and good \n     faith reliance on Justice Department legal opinions' \n     authoritatively permitting his conduct, I would find it \n     difficult to justify commencing a full blown criminal \n     investigation, let alone a prosecution.\n\n  During our meeting, Mr. Holder expanded on these remarks and \nexplained why he had reached that conclusion--a conclusion with which I \nhappen to agree.\n  While his public answer to Senator Kyl and my main emphasis during \nour meetings focused on the intelligence officials who followed DOJ \nlegal guidance and not on those who either wrote that legal advice or \nauthorized the intelligence activities based upon such advice, I told \nhim--and I believe he understood--that trying to prosecute these \nlawyers or political leaders would generate a political firestorm.\n  Besides interrogation, we focused during both meetings on the issue \nof carrier liability protection under the FISA Amendments Act. During \nMr. Holder's confirmation hearing, Senator Hatch asked him whether he \nwould honor the carrier liability certifications issued by Attorney \nGeneral Mukasey. Mr. Holder answered that he believed he would honor \nthose certifications unless circumstances changed.\n  I have asked Mr. Holder if he could explain the ``changed \ncircumstances'' which would cause him to withdraw the existing \ncertifications, noting that it would be difficult for circumstances to \nchange since all this happened in the past, was considered by the \nSenate and the House, we wrote a bill, and under which the Attorney \nGeneral made a judgment based on those circumstances. Mr. Holder didn't \ngive any specific examples of changed circumstances, but he planned to \nreview the certifications to which he has not had access if confirmed. \nGiven that those certifications are based upon relatively simple, \nclassified facts, I am certain he will reach the same legal conclusion \nas Attorney General Mukasey, and I am comfortable with his thinking on \nthe matter as he described it to me.\n\n  I cannot stress enough to my colleagues and the American people the \nimportance of the carrier liability protection provisions in the FISA \nAmendments Act. These provisions not only put an end to the frivolous \nlawsuits brought against the carriers alleged to have participated in \nthe terrorist surveillance program, they also increase the likelihood \nof future cooperation with the intelligence community by the carriers \nas the community strives to keep us safe within the bounds of law. I \nalso stressed the fact that Mr. Holder is not read-in--or given \naccess--either to the terrorist surveillance program or the \ninterrogation program, so it would not be advisable to make any \ndefinitive statements about either program without the pertinent facts, \nand he agreed with me on this point.\n  I enjoyed my meetings with Mr. Holder. While we did not agree on \nevery issue, I appreciated his stated willingness to keep an open mind \nuntil he has had a chance to review the classified facts involved in \nmost of these intelligence issues.\n  I found Mr. Holder to be a good listener, which is an important \nprerequisite for any good leader. I believe him when he says he is \nwilling to take good ideas from wherever they come. As his predecessor, \nGeneral Mukasey, he will, I believe, be an Attorney General more \ninterested in justice than in politics.\n  Now, I understand a number of my colleagues will not support Mr. \nHolder's nomination. I respect their legitimate concerns about his \nunsatisfactory performance in the Rich and FALN pardons. I, too, have \nreal problems in these matters. Pardoning Marc Rich--an international \nfugitive from justice--was certainly a stain on the Presidency and Mr. \nHolder's record. Mr. Holder told me, as he said publicly, that his role \nwas a mistake he regrets. I believe he genuinely knows what he did was \nwrong and would not do such a thing again. Similarly, I suppressed my \nconcerns to Mr. Holder regarding his role with the Puerto Rican FALN \ngroup. I disagree with him that granting clemency to such people even \nafter the time they served could ever be appropriate, but he has told \nme that regardless of whether we agree that it was acceptable in a pre-\n9/11 world; he would not view similar future requests in the\n\n[[Page S1261]]\n\nsame manner in our post-9/11 world. In that respect, I believe Mr. \nHolder fully supports an aggressive stand against terrorists today. I \nam hopeful he has learned important lessons from these events.\n  When confirmed, Mr. Holder will be taking over the Department of \nJustice that is stacked with legal talent. I wish to take a moment to \nnote that the Nation owes a great debt of gratitude to the Department \nof Justice. During the past several years, we have worked very closely \nwith the Department on many important pieces of national security \nlegislation, including the PATRIOT Act, the Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Act, the 9/11 Recommendations Implementation Act, \nthe USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act, the Protect \nAmerica Act, and of course, the FISA Amendments Act. I am very grateful \nfor the dedicated efforts of the National Security Division, the Office \nof Legal Policy, the Office of Legal Counsel, and the FBI in assisting \nus with these various legislative matters. I also commend those on the \nfrontline for their untiring service and efforts to keep us safe from \nthe many and diverse threats against our national security while \nensuring that our civil liberties are protected. I expect that Mr. \nHolder and the Department of Justice will continue this tradition, and \nI look forward to working with Mr. Holder closely on PATRIOT Act sunset \nissues and other important national security matters during this \nCongress to protect our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the \ndistinguished vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee for his \nwords. It is a pleasure to work with him on the committee. I think we \nare both looking forward to a new relationship with the Department of \nJustice under a new Attorney General.\n  I see my friend and colleague, Senator Sessions, here waiting to \nspeak, so I just wanted to make two quick points. The first is that \nthis is a man of really exceptional experience. Our distinguished \nPresiding Officer--who I don't think can be seen on the television \nright now--is the distinguished Senator Udall from New Mexico who was \nan Attorney General himself. He understands the value of experience in \nthese jobs. This is a man who has been a U.S. attorney, who has been a \nFederal judge, who has been the Deputy Attorney General of the United \nStates--the No. 2 position in this Department, and who, by all \nstandards, has acquitted himself with remarkable distinction during the \ncourse of his tenure in those three positions.\n  It is also noteworthy that the Department of Justice has fallen on \nvery hard times recently. People from both sides of the aisle from \nrecent and distant administrations have come forward to try to be \nhelpful to express their concern and their dismay about what was \nallowed to happen to this great Department. From all of my experience \nwith the--I guess you could call them group of friends at the \nDepartment of Justice, people who served there and who have great \naffection for that Department, they view Eric Holder as a special \nperson who has a unique capacity to fight for the principles the \nDepartment has long prided itself on: independence, talent, pure legal \nanalysis, and courage. I think it is going to be very reassuring for \nthe friends and family of the Department of Justice who have been so \nconcerned about what has happened to it in the last few months to have \nthis man now in charge. There will be a huge sigh of relief. I \ncompliment my colleagues on the bipartisan way in which this has gone \nforward. Clearly, there were concerns early on and they were addressed \nfairly. This is a nomination that passed out of the Judiciary Committee \n17 to 2, which, in a highly partisan environment in Washington, is as \nclose to a perfect score as I think you are going to get. It continues \nto receive broad support from both sides of the aisle on the floor. I \nknow many people who are significant in the history of the Department \nof Justice have spoken in support of Eric Holder, including former \nAttorneys General Barr and Jim Comer, two of the most distinguished \npeople who have done so.\n\n  Without further ado, I will yield the floor so my friend, Senator \nSessions, can speak. I think this is a great moment of opportunity for \nthe country and the Department of Justice. I hope we can confirm Eric \nHolder to be Attorney General with a very strong number when we get to \nthe vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlabama is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask to be notified when I have used 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Whitehouse and I both served as \nU.S. attorneys. Eric Holder also served as a Federal judge supervising \nprosecutions and tried cases in the District of Columbia as a U.S. \nattorney. He served 4 years as Deputy Attorney General and did many \ngood things during that time. He also made several serious errors, \nwhich I think and believe he has understood. He has committed not to \nmake them again. He was influenced by the President, President Clinton, \nto do the pardons, and he should not have been influenced. I note that \nhe moved away from that area of judge, prosecutor, and was active in \nthe Kerry and Obama presidential campaigns. I have talked to him, and I \nbelieve he will be a responsible legal officer and not a politician as \nthe Attorney General. I intend to support him.\n  I want to take a minute to express a growing concern I have about my \nbeloved Department of Justice, where I spent 15 years as a prosecutor. \nIt is something I respect highly. We do need to eliminate politics from \nthat office. Some of the nominees coming up disturb me, and the pattern \nof them is disturbing. One is Elena Kagan, nominated for the Solicitor \nGeneral. While dean of the Harvard Law School, she barred the U.S. \nmilitary from coming on campus as long as she could successfully get \naway with it. She actually filed a brief in the Supreme Court when the \nCongress got so fed up with the idea that American universities would \nnot allow the U.S. military to come on campus to ask students if they \nwould like to be a part of the American military. She led the fight \nwith an appeal all the way to the Supreme Court to reverse the Solomon \namendment, which would require colleges and universities to either \nallow the military on campus or get no Federal funds. She led that \nbattle. It was voted down in the Supreme Court 8 to 0, as well it \nshould have been.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that 3 minutes \nhas elapsed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. On the Republican time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Dawn Johnsen, nominated to be assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Office of Legal Counsel, was the legal director for \nNARAL, the National Abortion Rights Action League, one of the most \naggressive--probably the most aggressive--pro-abortion group in the \ncountry.\n  David Ogden, nominated for Deputy Attorney General, represented the \nmurder defendants in Roper v. Simmons, which led to the unprincipled \ndecision about defendants and the death penalty.\n  Thomas Perrelli, who represented Michael Schiavo in the Terry Schiavo \ncase, is nominated for Associate Attorney General, third in command.\n  D. Anthony West, who is nominated for Assistant Attorney General for \nCivil Division, represented John Walker Lindh, the American Taliban who \nhas been prosecuted and convicted.\n  We are heading into problems on some other nominations. We do not \nneed the Department of Justice to become a liberal bastion. It needs to \nbe the cornerstone of defending Americans and our safety.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for up to 2 \nminutes of the Republican time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I will vote today for Eric Holder. I want \nto\n\n[[Page S1262]]\n\ntell this body why. When he was first nominated, I had concerns--second \namendment concerns and Guantanamo interrogation concerns, and about \nsome of the releases that had taken place while he was a deputy U.S. \nattorney. There are three main reasons I am going to support this \nnomination. One, when I called him, he was the most forthright, most \ncandid of all the people who have been appointed by the President, and \nI appreciate very much the time he took.\n  On the second amendment, he may have had interpretations more strict \nthan mine, but he interpreted the Supreme Court to be the law of the \nland, and he would enforce the Supreme Court, which has clearly \ndetermined that the second amendment is an individual right.\n  Secondly, on Guantanamo, he acknowledged that those who had done \ninterrogations had done so under the authority of the Department of \nJustice, and the Department of Justice could not undo what it had done. \nI respected that.\n  Third, a great U.S. attorney general from Georgia by the name of \nGriffin Bell, who died 2 weeks ago, under Jimmy Carter, sang Eric \nHolder's praises. Also, Larry Thompson of Georgia, deputy U.S. attorney \nunder John Ashcroft--when I called him to ask about Holder, he said he \nwas as good a lawyer and as fine and forthright a man as he knew. With \nthose endorsements and his candid answers to my questions, I will vote \nfor his confirmation in the Senate.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia, and I appreciate his support. I understood there were going to \nbe other Senators from this side coming to speak. I note that the time \nis running, and they will lose their time if they do not come to speak \nsoon. I also add, while we are waiting, that I have had a special and \nsignificant interest in the Department of Justice from the time I was a \nlaw student. I watched so many attorneys general who have served at the \nJustice Department, some have been very good, but many have not. There \nis nobody--certainly, since I have been old enough to vote--who has \nbeen Attorney General with the potential to be as great an Attorney \nGeneral as Eric Holder.\n  Like others in the Senate, I supported him when President Reagan \nnominated him for a judgeship, and he was unanimously confirmed. With \nmany others in the Senate, I supported him when he was nominated to be \na U.S. Attorney. He was unanimously confirmed. I also supported him \nwhen he was nominated to be Deputy Attorney General and for weeks he \nwas held up on the floor by an anonymous hold. For some reason, there \nwas an anonymous hold against Eric Holder. When that hold was finally \nlifted, lo and behold, nobody voted against him. He was again \nunanimously confirmed.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Maryland, one of the most \nvaluable members of the Judiciary Committee, on the floor of the \nSenate. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. CARDIN. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Vermont, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his work regarding the \nEric Holder nomination. I think the confirmation process has been very \nfair. I must point out that when then-President-elect Obama indicated \nthat his choice for Attorney General would be Eric Holder, I was very \nexcited and supportive of his selection.\n  The confirmation process of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nhas been conducted in a very fair and open manner. It has only made my \nsupport for Eric Holder more strong. The documents made available to \nthe committee and the letters we have received from interested \nparties--many from those who have served in the Department of Justice \nunder Republican administrations--have all strongly endorsed Eric \nHolder to be the next Attorney General of the United States.\n  I am convinced he is the right person at the right time for many \nreasons. First, his experience; he brings a wealth of experience to the \nposition of Attorney General. He was a former judge and a former U.S. \nattorney. He has been in the Office of the Attorney General in the \nDepartment of Justice, and he has been a private attorney. He brings a \nsense of independence that we need in the Office of the Attorney \nGeneral. He must be the Attorney General for the people of this \ncountry. He doesn't serve one person or just the President; he serves \nall Americans. We need an Attorney General who is going to be \nindependent and willing to stand for what is right; stand up to a \nCabinet Secretary or even the President with independent advice as to \nwhat the law states.\n  We are a nation of laws. The rule of law is extremely important. Eric \nHolder, throughout his career, has demonstrated that independence. I \nwill give you one example. When Ken Starr, who was investigating former \nPresident Bill Clinton, wanted to expand his investigation of the \nPresident, it was up to Eric Holder to make that recommendation, and he \nmade that recommendation in favor of the Independent Counsel. So he has \nshown his ability to do what is right, even if it is not popular to the \nperson who appointed him, the President.\n  Secondly, I believe Eric Holder will restore the right priorities for \nthe good of justice. When asked about torture, without any equivocation \nhe said torture is illegal and cannot be accepted under any situation. \nHe didn't equivocate. We know when we need to restore the strength of \nthe Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice, he said he \nwould do that. He clearly will restore to the Department of Justice the \npriorities that are most important for the Department of Justice.\n  Let me point out, in short, Eric Holder will restore the reputation \nof the Department of Justice, and he will retain and recruit the very \nbest legal minds to represent the interests of all of the people of our \nNation. I strongly endorse his confirmation and urge my colleagues to \ndo that. With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of \nEric Holder for the position of Attorney General of the United States. \nWe place enormous trust in the nominee for this position to not only \nenforce the laws of our land but also to advise the President on legal \nand constitutional matters. One of the important freedoms that we have \nin the Constitution is the right to keep and bear arms, guaranteed to \nus in the second amendment of the Constitution. Many jurisdictions \naround our country do not have the ability to own a gun, and there are \nrestrictions in jurisdictions all over our country for the use of a \ngun. Nowhere is it more strict than in Washington, DC.\n  In 1976, in Washington, DC, the City Council passed the toughest gun \ncontrol laws in the Nation, banning handguns and requiring rifles and \nshotguns to be registered, stored unloaded, and either locked or \ndisassembled. These were the most restrictive laws in our Nation \nregarding gun ownership. I thought they were not only incomprehensible \nbut certainly unconstitutional.\n  I introduced a bill with a number of my colleagues to repeal these \nprohibitive measures.\n  This prohibition, however, was challenged in court before my bill \ncould get through Congress, and the DC Circuit Court of Appeals agreed \nthat the District's ban was unconstitutional.\n  When the District appealed to the Supreme Court, I filed an amicus \nbrief with our colleague Jon Tester that was supported by 53 Senators \nand 250 Members of the House of Representatives. This was on the \ninterpretation of the second amendment as preserving an individual \nright to keep and bear firearms. Our brief contained the most \ncongressional signatures on any amicus brief ever in the history of our \ncountry.\n  In another amicus brief in this same district court opinion that was \nappealed to the Supreme Court, the nominee before us, Mr. Holder, along \nwith 12 other former Justice Department officials, argued in favor of \nthe gun ban in Washington, DC. His brief stated:\n\n       The second amendment does not protect firearms possession \n     or use that is unrelated to participation in a well-regulated \n     militia.\n\n\n[[Page S1263]]\n\n\n  Fortunately, on June 2, 2008, the Supreme Court affirmed the intent \nof the Founders: that the right to bear arms is an individual right \nprotected by the Constitution. This was a major ruling on the second \namendment because local governments that seek gun control measures have \nmade the argument that Mr. Holder made in his brief. That is the basis \nfor gun control ordinances and laws around our country.\n  The ruling in the DC case was a victory for the rights of all \nAmericans to protect themselves and their families. The Supreme Court \nsent a clear message that the law of the land, the individual right to \nkeep and bear arms, cannot be unreasonably infringed.\n  The Founding Fathers knew what they were doing when they put the \nright to keep and bear arms in the Constitution. They knew from their \nexperience in the Revolutionary War that a free people must have the \nright to possess and bear arms. In 1775, the American Revolution \nstarted because ordinary farmers decided to fight back against foreign \ntyranny. Many in George Washington's regiments used their own guns.\n  I was alarmed to learn that while serving as Deputy Attorney General \nin the Clinton administration, Mr. Holder said in an appearance on \nABC's ``This Week'' that the second amendment ``talks about bearing \nguns in a well-regulated militia. And I don't think anywhere it talks \nabout an individual.''\n  This interpretation, while interesting in academic circles, is not \nmainstream, nor is it reflective of public opinion. Indeed, in our \nbrief that we filed, we cited every congressional action that has \nhappened throughout the history of our country that affirmed that \nCongress believes the second amendment is an individual right.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have no objection, but it will have to \ncome from the Republican side, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Framers did not intend for this \nright to be collective. If that was their purpose, it would have been \nsatisfied with article I, section 8 of the Constitution, which gives \nCongress the power ``to provide for calling forth the Militia to \nexecute the Laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel \nInvasions.''\n  The Framers went further than that. They wanted to ensure that gun \nownership was recognized by posterity as an individual right. They put \nit in the Bill of Rights for that purpose. It is a compilation of \nindividual rights of free speech, freedom of religion, a fair trial, \nand the right to keep and bear arms.\n  The Framers looked at the governments of Europe. James Madison said:\n\n       The governments of Europe are afraid to trust the people \n     with arms. If they did, the people would surely shake off the \n     yoke of tyranny, as America did.\n\n  Later on, President Madison explained:\n\n       The Constitution preserves the advantage of being armed, \n     which Americans possess over the people of almost every other \n     nation where the governments are afraid to trust the people \n     with arms.\n\n  The right to bear arms should not be an issue in the United States. \nThe Constitution is clear, and the Supreme Court has spoken. Our Second \nAmendment right ensures that our people have the ability to secure all \nof our rights and defend them, if necessary, from government \nsuppression. It is this right that a government of the people, by the \npeople, and for the people must never extinguish.\n  I believe that Eric Holder, from everything I have read, is an \nintelligent, experienced, and thoughtful candidate to be the U.S. \nAttorney General. But after examination of Mr. Holder's public \nstatements and positions on gun rights, I cannot in good conscience \nsupport his nomination for the office of Attorney General, and I, \ntherefore, will vote no.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I support the nominee. I have known him for \na long time. We differ on many issues, but he is a qualified person, \nand he is a good man. He has the necessary professional qualifications \nto do this job. I personally believe we ought to support the President \nand his choice of Cabinet officials if there are no other disqualifying \nfactors, such as ethics or criminal activity or something serious. I \nhave a friendship with the nominee.\n  In fulfilling my responsibility in the confirmation process, I try to \napply the right standard to the whole record about a nominee. The right \nstandard comes from the Constitution, which gives the appointment power \nto the President, not to the Senate.\n  Elections have consequences, and Presidents must be given significant \nlatitude when choosing members of their own Cabinet. Differences on \nissues or whether I would have nominated the individual are not alone \nenough to overcome that latitude. I have always argued for this \nstandard no matter which party controlled either the Senate or the \nexecutive branch. The Senate checks the President's appointment power, \nbut it may not highjack it.\n  I realize that my friends on the other side of the aisle have at \ntimes applied a different standard, a much more partisan standard, when \na Republican was in the White House. They got in the habit of putting \npartisan politics before the process principles the Constitution \nrequires. I am not going to do that. I am going to apply the same \nstandard to President Obama's nominees that I argued should have been \napplied to President Bush's nominees. In doing that, I believe the \nright standard must be applied to the whole record.\n  The record includes the fact that Mr. Holder has been nominated three \ntimes before, by both Republican and Democratic Presidents, and he has \nbeen confirmed three times before, by both Republican and Democratic \nSenates. Those confirmations were by voice vote, by unanimous consent, \nand by a rollcall vote of 100 to 0. Not one member of this body voted \nagainst Mr. Holder as he was appointed to be a judge on District of \nColumbia Superior Court, U.S. Attorney for the District, and Deputy \nAttorney General.\n  I think it also matters that the Judiciary Committee last week voted \n17 to 2 to approve Mr. Holder's current nomination.\n  Another part of the record is the breadth of support Mr. Holder has \nreceived. This includes the entire law enforcement community. The cops \non the beat and the chiefs of police, the troopers and the sheriffs, \nthe district attorneys, the Federal prosecutors, and the State \nattorneys general, all of these and more support Mr. Holder. Advocates \nfor crime victims also support Mr. Holder. These include my friend John \nWalsh, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the National Center for Missing & \nExploited Children, and the National Association for Victims of Crime. \nThis really matters to me.\n  These organizations examined Mr. Holder's qualifications, his record \nof public service, and concluded that he would make a good Attorney \nGeneral. Does that mean we should, therefore, set aside our own review \nand automatically support him? Of course not, but it is part of the \nwhole record and, I believe, an important part.\n  I have served in this body and on the Judiciary Committee for more \nthan 32 years and do not remember when the law enforcement and victims \ncommunities have been this united in support of an Attorney General \nnominee.\n  And the record also includes support for Mr. Holder from many legal \nexperts and past Justice Department officials with high standing in \nconservative and Republican circles.\n  Former Solicitor General Ted Olson says that Mr. Holder will be a \nstrong, courageous leader who is both a good manager and a good \nlistener.\n  Former Acting Attorney General Stuart Gerson and Former Deputy \nAttorney General George Terwilliger write that Mr. Holder is an \nextraordinary lawyer and an even better person.\n  Former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson says that Mr. Holder \nwill be principled, pragmatic, fair, and tough.\n\n[[Page S1264]]\n\n  Former Congressman and Federal prosecutor Asa Hatchinson writes that \nMr. Holder will be the kind of Attorney General who puts the law first \nand political considerations second.\n  And recent Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Wainstein, who headed \nthe Justice Department's National Security Division, says that Mr. \nHolder is a man of integrity, a strong proponent of law and order, and \nmore concerned with justice than with politics.\n  That is high praise from very good company.\n  This does not mean that I have no concerns about Mr. Holder or do not \nintend to be vigilant about what the Justice Department will be doing \nin the months and years ahead. I hope, for example, that Mr. Holder \nwill continue some critical initiatives begun in the last several \nyears, such as the protection of religious liberty and the prosecution \nof human trafficking. These initiatives were part of the work of the \nCivil Rights Division, which was led at the end of the Bush \nadministration by Grace Chung Becker, who earlier served on my \nJudiciary Committee staff.\n  Religious liberty is the first freedom protected by the first \namendment. Human trafficking is, to put it bluntly, modern-day slavery. \nUpholding human dignity and freedom requires both protecting the one \nand prosecuting the other.\n  I also am concerned that enforcement of Federal laws regarding child \npornography and adult obscenity will suffer and the exploitation and \ncorrosion that this material causes for individuals, families, and \ncommunities will worsen. This is a completely nonpartisan issue for me. \nI was no fan of the Bush administration's enforcement of the obscenity \nlaws and said so in both confirmation and oversight hearings.\n  The record of the Clinton administration, in which Mr. Holder served, \nwas even worse. On November 4, 1993, this body voted 100 to 0 to \ncondemn the Justice Department's attempt to adopt a novel, weak \ninterpretation of the Federal child pornography statute. The Justice \nDepartment had used this distortion of the law to ask the U.S. Court of \nAppeals to overturn a child pornographer's conviction. This body rarely \nvotes 100 to 0 on anything, but we voted to condemn the Justice \nDepartment's action.\n  I know that was in the first Clinton term, and Mr. Holder did not \nserve as Deputy Attorney General until the second term. But that is the \nrecord of the Justice Department in which he previously served, and I \nhope that the record of the Justice Department he will now lead will be \nmuch different.\n  Another significant issue which I raised at Hr. Holder's confirmation \nhearing is the right to keep and bear arms, guaranteed by the second \namendment to the Constitution. It continues to baffle me how people can \nclaim to see unwritten rights in our written Constitution but refuse to \nfully acknowledge those that are right there in plain sight. Mr. Holder \nhas argued that the second amendment protects only a collective right \nrelated to service in an organized militia rather than an individual \nright of citizens. He took this position as Deputy Attorney General \nduring the Clinton administration and since then as a private citizen, \nmost recently before the Supreme Court in the case titled District of \nColumbia v. Heller.\n  I believe Mr. Holder is wrong and the Supreme Court rejected Mr. \nHolder's position in Heller, ruling definitively that the second \namendment protects an individual right.\n  Mr. Holder has also in the past advocated some restrictive gun \ncontrol proposals that I oppose and which I believe would likely be \nunconstitutional under Heller.\n  I asked Mr. Holder about the second amendment and gun control during \nhis hearing and in follow-up written questions. He acknowledged his \nduty to enforce the Constitution as interpreted in Heller. He said he \nwould respect the right to keep and bear arms as articulated by the \nSupreme Court in Heller, that is, as an individual constitutional \nright.\n  I note that the Senate voted 100 to 0 in July 1997 to allow Mr. \nHolder to serve as deputy to an Attorney General who was no friend of \nthe second amendment. That was before the Supreme Court ruled that the \nright to keep and bear arms is an individual right, a ruling Mr. Holder \nhas a duty to follow.\n  If confirmed, Mr. Holder will take an oath before God to support and \ndefend the Constitution. So while I disagree with his past positions on \nthe second amendment and gun control, I believe and expect that he will \ntake his duty and his oath seriously.\n  I am also troubled by Mr. Holder's role, while he served as Deputy \nAttorney General, in the process resulting in President Clinton's \nclemency for Puerto Rican terrorists and his pardon for international \nfugitive Marc Rich. In 1999, I joined 94 other Senators in voting to \ndeplore the clemency for the FALN terrorists. Needless to say, I \ndisagree with Mr. Holder's statement at his hearing that he still \nbelieves his support of that clemency was reasonable.\n  I agree with former FBI Director Louis Freeh who said at Mr. Holder's \nconfirmation hearing on January 16 that the pardon of Marc Rich, which \nhappened after avoiding the Justice Department's evaluation process \naltogether, was a corrupt act. Mr. Holder, however, made neither of \nthose decisions. President Clinton did.\n  Mr. Holder has acknowledged mistakes and said he has learned from \nthem.\n  I believe that his actions and decisions in the process leading to \nthose decisions reflect bad judgment but not corrupt character. This \nconfirmation process has certainly focused even more attention on those \npast mistakes and, I hope, will make Mr. Holder even more diligent in \nhis duties ahead.\n  I know Eric Holder. My own experience and knowledge of his record and \nthe testimony of so many others whose judgment I respect confirms that \nhe is a man of ability, experience, and integrity.\n  The issues and concerns I have raised, while not enough to overcome \nthe deference the Constitution requires, do identify areas for work in \nthe future and I hope, when confirmed, Mr. Holder will work with both \nRepublicans and Democrats on these important issues.\n  Applying the right standard to the whole record leads me to support \nEric Holder to become the next Attorney General of the United States.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). Who yields time? If no side \nyields time, the time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was withholding saying anything because I \nthought there were other Republicans coming to speak. I see none.\n  During the three different times I have been chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, I have presided over the confirmations of three \nAttorneys General. In my 35 years in the Senate, I have voted on many \nmore. No nomination for Attorney General has filled me with greater \npride than this one, and it is time for the Senate to complete its \nconsideration of President Obama's historic nomination of Eric Holder \nto be Attorney General of the United States.\n  In an article I co-authored with the Judiciary Committee ranking \nmember, Senator Specter, before last November's election, we wrote--and \nwe were writing to whomever would be President:\n\n       The Attorney General's duty is to uphold the Constitution \n     and the rule of law, not to circumvent them.\n\n  We wrote further:\n\n       The President and the American people are best served by an \n     Attorney General who gives sound advice and takes responsible \n     action, rather than one who develops legalistic loopholes to \n     serve the partisan ends of a particular administration.\n\n  We could not have made that job description better for anyone than \nEric Holder. That is what kind of an Attorney General he will be.\n  It was seven score and four years ago that this Nation answered the \nfundamental question President Lincoln posed in his Gettysburg Address, \nand the world learned that liberty, equality, and democracy could serve \nas the foundation for this great and united Nation.\n  The American people have had cause and occasion to reflect during the \npast several weeks about our great country. The inauguration of our new \nPresident was two weeks ago tomorrow, and two\n\n[[Page S1265]]\n\nweeks ago today was the holiday our country has set aside to celebrate \nand rededicate ourselves to the cause of freedom and equality.\n  Three and a half weeks ago, the day of Mr. Holder's hearing, was the \n80th anniversary of the birthday of the extraordinary man for whom that \nholiday is named. With this confirmation, we take another step up the \npath toward the time Dr. King foresaw when people are judged by the \ncontent of their character. Eric Holder has the character to serve as \nthe Attorney General of the United States. He passes any fair \nconfirmation standard.\n\n  America's diversity when drawn together is the source of our Nation's \nstrength and resilience. Americans have to be able to trust their \nJustice Department. That trust must not be squandered or taken for \ngranted. We need leaders who are prepared to take up the laboring oars \nof a Justice Department whose dedicated law enforcement professionals \nhave been misused and even demoralized. Eric Holder is such a leader.\n  With this confirmation, we mark the distance from when an Attorney \nGeneral of the United States did not believe that the Constitution of \nthe United States allowed an African American to be considered a \ncitizen of the United States to an Attorney General who knows that the \nConstitution is our country's great charter of freedom and equality for \nall people.\n  It was former Attorney General, Roger Taney, who wrote the Supreme \nCourt's Dred Scott decision denying the humanity of slaves, former \nslaves, and free people. It is perhaps the worst legal opinion ever \nrendered in this country. That is not what the Constitution said, and \nit is not the promise of America.\n  Today, each one of us, acting pursuant to our constitutional \nresponsibilities as U.S. Senators, can, by our votes and by the \noverwhelming endorsement of this institution for this nomination, \ndemonstrate how far we have come as a nation.\n  The election of Barack Obama and Joe Biden and the President's \nnomination of Eric Holder to be Attorney General of the United States \nprovide an historic opportunity for the country to move beyond the \npartisanship of the past decades. We can make a real difference if we \ncome together to solve the Nation's problems, protect against serious \nthreats, and meet the challenge of our time.\n  Let us honor the wishes of the American people who in November broke \nthrough debilitating divisions to join together in record numbers. Let \nus acknowledge that our inspirational new President has moved forward \npromptly to assemble an extraordinarily well-qualified and diverse \ngroup of Cabinet officers and advisers. And let us move away from petty \npartisanship in order to serve the greater good.\n  Of course, any Senator is free to oppose a nomination and vote \nagainst confirmation. In this instance, I think they will be on the \nwrong side of history. I believe that when we take a step back and look \nat the big picture and the best interests of the country, Eric Holder \nis someone who deserves our support and merits our votes. In order to \nserve effectively as Attorney General he will also need our help. The \nchallenges are too great not to join together to confirm Mr. Holder and \nproceed promptly to consider the entire Justice Department leadership \nteam that President Obama has selected.\n  I urge all Senators to join together to do what is right and approve \nthis extraordinary public servant to the critical post for which \nPresident Obama has nominated him. Go on the right side of history and \nvote for Eric H. Holder, Jr. to be the 82nd Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are due to vote at 6:15. I believe \neverybody has spoken for Mr. Holder who chooses, so I ask unanimous \nconsent to be permitted to use the remaining time to talk about the \nstimulus package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the Senator \nwants to use the rest of the Republican time; is that what you meant?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, unless--\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time remains on both sides, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 1 minute 45 seconds; the \nmajority has 8 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                            Stimulus Package\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, later this evening, we are going to be \nmoving ahead to discuss the stimulus package, and I want to use a few \nmoments now to express my views on the subject. There is no doubt about \nthe need for stimulating the U.S. economy. January figures show 7.2 \npercent unemployed, 2.8 million jobs lost last year, more layoffs all \nthe time, and more foreclosures. It is my hope that there will be a \nvery strong stimulus package which is directed at putting people to \nwork.\n  The proposals which have come from the House bill are laudable and in \nmany respects are measures which I have long supported. But on \nanalysis, it seems to me they belong more directly in a budget program \nwhere we have targets for spending--discretionary spending--making an \nevaluation of priorities and moving in that direction. But when the \nAmerican people are being asked to support a stimulus program of more \nthan $800 billion, which is deficit financing, the programs ought to be \ndirected at job opportunities.\n  Mr. President, I ask my distinguished colleague, the chairman, if \nnobody wants his time, if I might use 5 minutes of it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I intend to use the rest of my time. If you want another \nminute or two, I will give you two minutes of my time, but then I \nintend to use the rest of it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time remains for the Republicans?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator like 2 minutes of my remaining time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, 2 minutes won't do me any good. The \nchairman wants his time; he has it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have a feeling we are all going to be \nspending hours talking about the stimulus package. Right now, I am more \nconcerned to talk about the Holder nomination.\n  I have heard a great deal about the second amendment. I couldn't help \nbut think during the hearing, when he was asked about the second \namendment and how he would support the rights of those who are gun \nowners, and I looked down at some of those asking from the different \nStates. I looked at the States that are represented on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee--Wisconsin, California, New York, Illinois, \nMaryland, Rhode Island, Oregon, Minnesota, Delaware, Pennsylvania, \nUtah, Iowa, Arizona, Alabama, South Carolina, Texas, and Oklahoma, as \nwell as the State of Vermont. There is only one of those States that \ndoes not have restrictive gun laws--the State of Vermont. We do not \nhave any gun laws in effect, except during hunting season. We limit the \nnumber of rounds you might have in your semiautomatic during deer \nseason. It is supposed to give the deer a chance. Anyone who wanted to \ncarry a loaded concealed weapon without a permit in the State of \nVermont, the distinguished Senator from Virginia or anyone else, could.\n  I mention that only because several of the Senators who have come \nfrom States with very restrictive gun laws went after Eric Holder on \ngun laws. So I asked him: ``Would you, as Attorney General, support \nlegislation that would require Vermont to change its gun laws?'' And \nthus make Vermont as restrictive as these Senators who were giving him \ngrief on his support of the second amendment. He said: Absolutely not. \nI asked him if there was any question whether he would steadfastly \nprotect the second amendment rights of law-abiding Americans to \npurchase, transport, and use guns. He said he would. I asked if he \nwould follow the law, including the Supreme Court decision in the \nrecent case in the District of Columbia versus Heller. He said, of \ncourse he would follow the law.\n\n[[Page S1266]]\n\n  I mention that because I put into the Record already 130 or more \norganizations. Every single law enforcement organization of any \nsignificance in this country is supporting Eric Holder. Civil rights \ngroups are supporting Eric Holder. Past prosecutors, including those of \nthe Bush and Reagan administrations, have supported Eric Holder. \nCurrent prosecutors, the members of the immediate past President, \nPresident Bush's administration, have endorsed him.\n  I say this because I think we are seeing straw men put up here--straw \nmen who are saying they do not want Eric Holder as Attorney General; \nyet these same people voted unanimously for Alberto Gonzalez, an \nAttorney General who left in disgrace.\n  This man restores the lustre of the Department of Justice. This man \nwill be as independent as the Attorney General I talked with in his \noffice when I was a young law student and we were talking about what it \nwould be like to come to the Department of Justice. I asked that \nAttorney General if he would allow anybody in the White House, up to \nand including the President, to interfere with any criminal prosecution \nor civil rights prosecution. He said absolutely not, and I have told \nthe President that. That Attorney General I was talking with was Robert \nF. Kennedy. He was talking about his brother John F. Kennedy. And when \nit came time to prosecute a man who had been critical to his brother's \nelection as President of the United States, Robert Kennedy prosecuted \nhim.\n  I left as a young law student, tempted to stay in Washington, but my \nwife Marcelle and I went back to Vermont, where we were both born and \nwhere we wanted to be. But I have never forgotten that discussion with \nAttorney General Kennedy. That has been the touchstone for me. I don't \nwant another Attorney General who sits in the room while others in our \ngovernment approve secretly wiretapping Americans in violation of our \nlaw, or engaging in torture. I want an attorney who stands up for the \nrule of law and our long cherished American values.\n  That is the kind of Attorney General Eric Holder would be. Come on \nthe right side of history. Come on the right side of history. Reject \nwhat we saw in the past. Vote for Eric Holder.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Eric H. Holder, Jr., of the District of \nColumbia, to be Attorney General? On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Begich) and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nAlaska (Mr. Begich) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Florida (Mr. Martinez).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is a good sign for the \nDepartment of Justice. And this former prosecutor is very happy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nreconsider is considered made and tabled. The President shall be \nnotified of the Senate's action and the Senate will return to \nlegislative session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/02/senate-section/article/S1266-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1266-S1273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are on the economic stimulus package. We \nare going to start on that early in the morning, 10 o'clock. The first \namendment we are going to offer, I have already told the Republican \nleader, is going to be an amendment offered by Senators Murray, \nFeinstein, and others dealing with infrastructure.\n  We look forward to the next amendment. If the Republicans are ready, \nthen they should be ready to offer their amendment. We will try to move \nthrough the process as quickly and as fairly as we can.\n  This is an extremely important piece of legislation. The problems we \nhave economically in the country today are not the problems of \nDemocrats or Republicans, they are problems that American people have. \nWe together have to try to work through this bill. I hope we can have \ncooperation. There are many things that people have different \nresponsibilities for. We have had a longstanding partial-day conference \nwe are going to have, but we are going to have opportunities during the \ntime we are there listening to Secretary Chu and Secretary Salazar and \nothers to offer amendments here.\n  There will be a significant number of votes. We hope if the \namendments are offered tomorrow and Wednesday, we will have a number of \nvotes all day tomorrow. Starting about 3 o'clock Wednesday afternoon we \ncan do the amendments that have been offered that day. So we have lots \nof work to do, and it is important we do it as quickly, I repeat, and \nas fairly as we can.\n  I ask unanimous consent the following be recognized for the time \nspecified: Udall of New Mexico, 15 minutes; Brownback, 10 minutes; \nCasey, 15 minutes; Snowe, 20 minutes, Kaufman, 15 minutes. This request \nis for these Senators to speak this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, as I rise to give this maiden \nspeech in our Chamber, we all know we are living in very difficult \ntimes. Our current economic crisis has only accelerated problems that \nhave been growing for years. America's manufacturing sector was \ndeclining before this crisis, and when this crisis has passed, we will \nstill need a blueprint for creating high-paying jobs and growing the \nmiddle class.\n  Meanwhile, our energy policies pose a threat to the economic, \nenvironmental, and national security of our Nation and the world. I \nbelieve these two problems, our economic stagnation and our energy \nirresponsibility, demand a common solution. We must put Americans to \nwork building the energy economy of the future, and we must do so now.\n  I often say our energy policies have produced a perfect storm, a \ncombination of three extraordinary challenges\n\n[[Page S1267]]\n\nthat collectively threaten our future. First, America's dependence on \nfossil fuels threatens our economy. As natural gas provides a growing \nshare of America's electricity, the price of gas has more than tripled \nsince 1995, and growing demand promises to make matters worse.\n  Second, America's energy policies threaten our security. America has \n3 percent of the world's natural gas reserves, but we consume 25 \npercent of the world's supply. That increasingly means sending American \ndollars to Russia and Iran, two countries that sit on more than 43 \npercent of the world's gas reserves and two countries that have shown \ntheir willingness to use energy as an instrument of coercion.\n  Finally, humans have managed to overwhelm the Earth's carbon cycle. \nThe balance that sustained life on Earth for millennia has been \nradically altered. In New Mexico, this means fewer farms and more \nforest fires, more thirst and less water, the end of a unique and \ntreasured way of life.\n  Some people say the world's demand for fossil fuels has not yet begun \nto outstrip supply, or that the climate is not changing back that \nquickly. I look at it this way. We are driving toward the cliff. I do \nnot want to spend a lot of time arguing about how far off the cliff is. \nI want to stop accelerating.\n  So what do we do? In the short term, we need to do it all. We need to \ndrill responsibly for domestic energy, we should promote conservation, \nand nuclear power has to be part of the mix.\n  But we also need reforms to prepare us for the future. When I was in \nthe other body, I fought for and we passed a renewable electricity \nstandard, an RES. This plan would demand that large utilities generate \na portion of their energy from renewable sources and conservation. \nThanks in large part to my colleague who is on the floor today, the \nsenior Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, the Senate has passed \nthis proposal three times. Similar policies have succeeded at the State \nlevel. In fact, 28 States have renewable standards, including my home \nState of New Mexico. But a national RES has never become the law of the \nland. It is time for Congress to make it so.\n  There are many reasons to support this plan. To start, it is good for \nconsumers. With a 20-percent standard, utility customers could save \n$31.8 billion. It will strengthen rural communities and provide new \nincome for farmers and ranchers. This plan will make America safer. The \nbillions of dollars it would generate are dollars that will stay in \nAmerica and cannot be used to hold our foreign policy hostage. But most \nimportantly, a national renewable standard will create hundreds of \nthousands of high-paying jobs, jobs that cannot be outsourced. Study \nafter study shows that shifting capital to renewable energy increases \njob creation.\n  Not only will this plan stimulate job creation today, it will put us \non a path toward dominance in the industries of the future. These \nbenefits will come from the actions of private businesses making the \nRES a distinctly American solution to a global problem. That is why it \nwill succeed. As one writer has put it, the only thing stronger than \nMother Nature is ``father profit.''\n  Because it works with the private sector, an RES is more than a \ngovernment program. It is an appeal to the spirit of innovation. I know \nwe have enough of that innovative spirit to tackle any challenge we \nface. I see it in the people of New Mexico. I see it in the scientists \nchasing new ideas, in entrepreneurs betting their time and capital on \nthe hope of a better world, in engineers searching blueprint sketches \nfor the submerged outline of a revolution. My constituents are eager to \ntackle the problems that face our country. I know yours are too. But \nthese citizens have been poorly served by their Government. Just last \nmonth, a renewable energy company from my State was forced to lay off \nmost of its workforce. After investing in a new technology, the company \ncould not afford to begin manufacturing. As a result, the progress of \ntheir innovations has been delayed, and the dreams of their workers \nhave been deferred.\n  It did not have to be this way. Countries that have done more to \nshape their energy markets have created driving green energy \nindustries. With a population roughly a quarter as large as America's, \nGermany has twice as many workers developing wind energy technologies. \nSpain has almost 5 times as many workers in the solar thermal industry \nas America, and China has more than 300 times.\n  Today our markets do not accurately price the social cost of burning \nfossil fuels. As a result, the private sector is effectively being told \nto send American dollars overseas, to ignore the coming decline in \nfossil fuel supplies, and to radically alter the world's climate. It is \na credit to America's energy companies that so many of them have \ninvested in alternative fuels and conservation. But individual acts of \nresponsibility cannot compensate for a market that encourages \nirresponsibility. If we are going to make the changes we need, \nconservation cannot be an act of personal virtue, and renewable fuels \ncannot be luxury alternatives. An RES would structure the marketplace \nso those decisions that are best for the American people are also the \nbest for the bottom line. This approach will make the market a powerful \nforce for progress because Government cannot tackle this problem alone.\n  New Mexico contains two of America's preeminent national labs. We \nknow these public institutions have an incredible innovative capacity, \nbut we also know Government needs private sector partners to achieve \nits goals. From 1970 to 1996, Los Alamos National Lab, the institution \nthat harnessed the power of the atom and launched America's national \nlab system, developed a technique for cleanly and efficiently using the \nEarth's heat to generate energy. Estimates indicated that the technique \ncould eventually power the Earth for hundreds of years. But without \nmarket incentives to encourage continued development, progress \nstagnated.\n  Only recently have American businesses rediscovered the geothermal \ntechnologies this country pioneered. Because our markets do not \nappropriately value renewable energy, we lost more than a decade while \nthe world raced ahead. America cannot afford to let another country \nbecome the world's green energy leader. Someday soon, green energy will \nno longer be an alternative; it will be the standard. The CEO of GE \nEnergy recently testified before Congress that wind and solar energy \nare likely to be among the largest sources of new manufacturing jobs \nworldwide during the 21st century. The question is whether these jobs \nwill be in America. That is what I want, and that is what we need to \ndo.\n  America has always succeeded by being one step ahead. We mass \nproduced the car, and American manufacturing built the middle class. We \nsparked the IT revolution, and our high-tech industry fueled American \nprosperity for years. Today being one step ahead means developing the \ngreen energy economy of the future before anybody else does. The \nchallenge is huge but so is the payoff if we succeed--a stronger \neconomy, a more secure future, and a chance to reclaim the mantle of \nworld leadership by the force of our example and the unmatched capacity \nof our people. It is clear these are difficult times. I devoted this \nspeech to a proposal I believe will allow us to meet these difficulties \nhead on and to emerge a safer, stronger, more prosperous Nation. I \nbelieve the American people are ready for change, and they are ready \nfor the change this plan represents. It is up to us to rise to the \nchallenge.\n  Should we do so--and I am confident we will--we will remember today \nas a time when America again turned a global threat into a national \nopportunity. We will remember the day when our Government set free the \npower of American industry to tackle one of the world's toughest \nproblems, and we will celebrate the time when American businesses and \nAmerican workers rose and together rebuilt a newer world, a clean \nenergy world.\n  I also wish to thank today a number of my colleagues and friends: My \ncousin, Mark Udall, from the great State of Colorado; Senator Bingaman, \nwhom I mentioned, who has been a leader on these renewable technologies \nand has gotten this proposal that I talked about today through the \nSenate three times. I see Jeanne Shaheen, who is also in my class; Jeff \nMerkley, Debbie Stabenow, Sherrod Brown, Bob Casey, many Members who \nare here. I am grateful.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1268]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senator from \nKansas is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I welcome my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Udall, \na great name in U.S. politics. I am sure he will do a great job in this \nbody, and I appreciate his comments talking about green expansion and \nwhat we can do to create jobs and opportunities. We certainly need to \ndo that, and I welcome him.\n  I rise to speak on the stimulus bill in front of us. Our economy is \ncertainly in great difficulty. The American people are suffering. Look \nat the numbers. They don't tell what is in people's hearts or what is \nhappening to their pocketbooks, but it does paint a bleak picture. Real \ngross domestic product declined 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter this \npast year. Consumer spending, which is nearly 70 percent of the \neconomy, was down 3.5 percent. We had weak consumer spending, weak \nexports, weak investment. That translates into a bad job market. I \ndon't think anybody questions but that we are in difficult economic \ntimes.\n  For the past 12 months, the economy has lost nearly 2.6 million \npayroll jobs. From Friday's forecast, the estimates ahead are looking \nat another 500,000-plus jobs lost during the month of January. Ouch. \nThat is bad. It is hard. It is difficult. The economy is in very \ndifficult shape, and people are suffering.\n  I wish to see President Obama succeed in helping to move the economy \nforward. I wish to see Congress be a constructive part of the process. \nI believe we can do both. If we could slow down a little bit and work \ntogether, we could come up with an economic stimulus package that could \nget 80 votes out of this body. Unfortunately, the bill in front of us \nis neither prudent nor responsible. I don't think it is going to get us \nout of the hole we are in. It just digs the hole deeper. There is an \nold saying that if you are in a hole, stop digging. Unfortunately, the \nbill we are considering resembles too much the one that passed the \nHouse of Representatives, ignores that advice, and supplies bigger \nshovels to dig the hole deeper and faster. That is not the way we \nshould go.\n\n  My hope and prayer for this week is that we will work as a body; if \nwe can't work as a body and work together to fashion something on a \nbipartisan basis that actually stimulates the economy, that we simply \nsend this back to the committee to start over again. I am on the \nAppropriations Committee. We got the bill on our side 24 hours ahead of \nvoting on it in committee. The committee held no hearings on this bill \nwhatsoever. We voted within 1 hour 40 minutes to appropriate and spend \n$350 billion, basically creating another fiscal year between 2009 and \n2010 and then pouring a wad of money into a number of different \nsegments without rhyme or reason for how it would stimulate the \neconomy. That is what gets everybody so upset about this bill. It is \nspending a lot of money, and it is not going to stimulate the economy.\n  This notion about what we want to do is just get a lot of money out \nthe door or maybe use a crisis to spend money in places that people \nwanted to do for some time may be more of what is at stake. The White \nHouse Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, stated:\n\n       You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. What I mean \n     by that is an opportunity to do things that you think you \n     could not do before.\n\n  Unfortunately, what I think is in this package is too much of that \nidea, that we have a crisis, let's use this crisis to put a lot of \nmoney into different places that we wanted to all along to get it out \nthe door and get it passed. You can do it that way, but that doesn't \nstimulate the economy. That stimulates the Government and Government \nspending and expands the Government to the point that some economists \nare looking at the Federal Government becoming 30 percent of the \neconomy, where normally we run at about 20 percent of the economy. You \nare looking at doing that on a permanent basis. We cannot afford that. \nWe particularly cannot afford that, given the first wave of the baby \nboomers who retire in large measure by 2012. Three years from now, you \nstart hitting that big pool of retirees getting Medicare and Social \nSecurity instead of paying into it. At the same time, you have \nratcheted up your size of Government under this crisis mode to the \npoint that you could get a mammoth sized Federal Government that cannot \nbe sustained on the backs of taxpayers, under the idea of you don't \nwant to waste a good crisis, you want to use it to spend in areas that \nyou wish you could have all along.\n  What these packages deliver, unfortunately, is an increasing amount \nof debt and a plethora of big Government spending increases \nmasquerading as a fiscal stimulus. It is a grab bag of different \nspending programs with the hope that it would somehow chase the \nrecession away. Instead, it adds to the debt. This bill will cost \nAmerican taxpayers close to $900 billion. That is on top of an already \nprojected deficit of $1.2 trillion.\n  It is also interesting that when President Clinton came into office, \nhe put forward an economic stimulus package that was defeated as being \ntoo big and too costly and that one was priced at $16 billion. We are \nlooking at $900 billion. That was $16 billion. It was too much and too \nexpensive. It added to the debt too much at a time that we had a \ndifficult economy as well.\n  Here, it appears, billions of dollars are being spent on all kinds of \nprograms that should be addressed in the normal appropriations process. \nWe have a process, and we can use that, but now we are putting in \nmoney, and people have heard this litany: $400 million for the \nprevention of sexually transmitted diseases, $6 billion for clean water \nrevolving funds, $6 billion to convert Federal buildings to ``green \nbuildings,'' $1 billion for the 2010 census, $400 million to replace \nthe Social Security Administration's National Computer Center. Now, all \nthis may be fine--$600 million for new vehicles for the Government, $50 \nmillion for the National Endowment for the Arts--all of it may be fine, \nbut that is not a stimulus package. That is a spending package. That is \nan appropriations bill that should go through in the normal process.\n  Economists and members of the President's economic team have stressed \nthe need for funds to be targeted, timely, and temporary. However, over \n$250 billion of the spending in this bill is for income-transfer \npayments that will put the Federal Government on the hook for long-term \nspending as far as the eye can see--and just when the baby boomers \nstart to retire in 2012 in large numbers. That is not wise.\n  We will also hear some rhetoric about how spending is a more \neffective means of stimulating the economy than tax reductions. I do \nnot agree with that. I do not believe that. I do not think economic \ntheory nor the practice of what we have seen in the past supports it.\n  Research by the President's own Chairman of the Council of Economic \nAdvisors suggests $3 of economic activity per $1 reduction in taxes. \nThe economy needs some gas in the tank, not sugar. We should focus on \ncreating an environment and incentives for businesses and individuals \nto invest and create real jobs, not illusory jobs created by a big \nGovernment handout that will not be permanent in a competitive global \neconomy and will load too much burden on future generations by debt and \ntaxes. We should provide real and permanent tax reduction accompanied \nby truly timely, targeted, and temporary spending. I could support an \nexpansion for roads and bridges because we need the roads and bridges. \nThat is not what is in this grab bag.\n  I would like to list another example of a tax cut that we could do \nthat could put as much and would probably put as much as $545 billion \ninto the U.S. economy--$545 billion. This is from an article written by \nAlan Sinai last week. It is something we have done in the past, where \nwe have lowered the taxes on repatriation of foreign-earned dollars. \nThe last time we did that, we reduced the corporate tax rate of 5.25 \npercent for 1 year. We brought back into the United States nearly $360 \nbillion of money.\n  That is money that is earned by companies such as Hill's pet food in \nTopeka, KS, which has pet food plants in Europe and Asia. They make \nmoney there, but they cannot bring it home because they are subject to \nthis 5.25 corporate tax rate. So they leave it there. But for a 1-year \ntime period, you could take that down to 1 percent, or a low number, \nand they will say: I am going to bring it home. Then it puts gas in the \ntank and not sugar in the\n\n[[Page S1269]]\n\ntank. That is a tax cut that will help us. This is capital our economy \nneeds and needs badly. I cannot see a single rational reason why we \nwould not take action to encourage American companies to bring capital \nhome.\n  Let me close by saying there are a number of worthwhile spending \nprograms that need to be addressed but not under the guise of fiscal \nstimulus. We do need to address infrastructure issues, and I could \nsupport a substantial amount of infrastructure spending, but the lag \ntime on these is difficult and it is long. On the other hand, there is \ndefense spending that could take place even now and the pipeline is not \nas long and, importantly, that is money we are already scheduled to \nspend. It simply would be advancing the timetable, not expanding the \namount.\n  My point is, as I started off, if we would spend a little more time \nhere and in committee and work together, we could get 80 votes for this \nbill. If this bill is forced through this week and we end up with the \nsize of Government of 30 percent of GDP, then this will be mostly on a \npartisan-line vote. That is not the way we should start. It is not the \nway we should go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CASEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak as well on the challenge we \nhave ahead of us with regard to the legislation we are debating this \nweek. We will be considering a lot of amendments to that legislation; \nthat is, the Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n  I want to speak, first of all, in a broad way about the challenge \nahead of us. I sent a letter toward the end of last year to both our \nmajority leader Senator Reid, as well as to Senator McConnell, \noutlining priorities, as I saw them, from the vantage point of \nPennsylvania's challenges as well as the country's.\n  I used a phrase that we have heard often, the last word of which \nmight be a little different than we have heard. We have heard summaries \nof this strategy where the priorities of any kind of recovery bill \nshould be focused on being timely, targeted, and transformative. I \nbelieve all three are essential: Timely, meaning we cannot sit on this \nfor too long; we have to act. I think that is essential; targeted, in \nthe sense we cannot have broad spending. We have to make sure we target \nthe dollars to strategies that work; transformative, in the sense that \nas we are making investments in infrastructure or in people to get them \nthrough the recession, and also to generate spending, we also have a \nchance to be transformative, to change our economy for the better and \nto transform people's lives.\n  In Pennsylvania--and it is true of virtually any State in the \ncountry; we just saw the data that unemployment went up in every single \nState in the month of December, and I know the Presiding Officer \nunderstands this from his work as a Governor and now as a Senator--in a \nState like ours in Pennsylvania--whether it is the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania or the Commonwealth of Virginia--we are seeing challenges \nall around. We have had record job loss. Even foreclosure rates, which \nhave been a lot lower than the rest of the country, are now spiking up. \nFamilies have been hit with a kind of economic trauma we have not seen \nin more than a generation. The same is true of businesses. Their bottom \nlines have been decimated by the downturn in this economy, principally \nbecause businesses and families have not had access to credit to borrow \nmoney for a small business or to borrow money for student loans or for \nthe purchase of an automobile or something that a family wants to spend \nmoney on but cannot do it without credit.\n  So we know the trauma that has been visited upon the American people. \nWe also know that just as that has been happening, there has also been \na real crisis of confidence, some of this emanating from the way the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program, the so-called TARP, was implemented by \nthe Treasury Department in the prior administration.\n  One of the obligations we have in the Senate in this debate, but even \nbeyond this debate, is to do everything we can to restore that \nconfidence. You could express it as confidence, you could express it as \ntrust. However you describe it, a good bit of that--too much of that--\nwas lost in the last couple months. As people were feeling the trauma \nof this economy on their own lives or on their own families or on their \nown communities, there was also a loss of trust and confidence in what \nthe Federal Government did or did not do and what the Federal \nGovernment can do going forward. So as we consider this legislation, \nthis is not just about a program and dollars and whether the strategy \nwill work. This will be a test of the Senate, a test of the Congress \nand the administration, in terms of our ability to restore some of that \nconfidence and literally to restore trust in our Government.\n  One of the ways we can begin to repair that relationship between the \nAmerican people and the Congress, between the people who pay the taxes \nand the Government that spends those dollars, is to work on a couple of \nareas of oversight. It is not the whole answer, but it goes a long way \nto helping. So I have two amendments I will be offering this week on \noversight.\n  The first amendment will allow for a comprehensive assessment through \nthe creation of a joint select committee on economic recovery \noversight. This oversight committee will be made up of Members of the \nHouse and the Senate and will be required to submit reports to every \nMember of the House and the Senate but, more importantly, to the \nAmerican people every 3 months. The reports will focus on, first, the \nsuccess of this act in creating jobs and the details behind that; and, \nno. 2, any instances of waste, fraud, and abuse in programs funded by \nthis act.\n  Membership on the panel will break down as follows: 10 Members of the \nSenate, including the chairmen and ranking members of the Committees on \nFinance and Appropriations, 4 Members appointed from the majority party \nby the majority leader of the Senate, and 2 Members from the minority \nparty appointed by the minority party itself; secondly, 10 Members of \nthe House, including the chairmen and ranking members of the Committee \non Ways and Means and the Committee on Appropriations; and it goes on \nfrom there in the same way as the Senate.\n  While I recognize the administration has pushed for and the bill \nbefore us includes a new Recovery Act Accountability and Transparency \nBoard, I want to make sure the legislative branch is in a position to \ncarry out our oversight responsibilities. Congress has not always done \na good job on that, and we have to ensure that a good job is done in \nthis instance for this kind of oversight.\n  The second amendment I have would direct the Government \nAccountability Office, known by the acronym GAO, to compile reports of \nthe Offices of the Inspectors General in each of the Federal \nDepartments or agencies that expend or obligate funds under the \nRecovery Act. The GAO would in turn submit reports to Congress that \nwould contain the following: No. 1, a summary of oversight activities \nof the Offices of Inspectors General relating to expenditure of \nrecovery funds; and, No. 2, an evaluation of the effectiveness of this \nact. So you have the GAO, an independent entity, reviewing what has \nbeen happening under this legislation.\n  The aim of these GAO reports would be to assess which provisions of \nthe act have been effective at creating jobs. The whole intent of this \nlegislation is to create jobs. We better make sure that happens. The \nreports would be submitted no later than 120 days from enactment of the \nact, with followup reports submitted at 180 days after enactment as \nwell as 240 days, again, after enactment.\n  Both of these amendments are focused on oversight. That is the \nlanguage we use to make sure the bill and to make sure the Government \nis doing its job to carry out the purposes of this recovery and \nreinvestment act.\n  But we have to do more than that. This effort with the two amendments \nis a way to very specifically begin to rebuild the confidence the \nAmerican people must have in what the Congress does and to recover and \nreinvigorate some of that trust we should have in our Government, \nespecially at this time. No piece of legislation can do that on its \nown. No Senator or Member of the House can do that on his or her\n\n[[Page S1270]]\n\nown. But we have to try collectively to do all we can to rebuild \nconfidence because if we do not have that kind of confidence going \nforward for the effectiveness of this legislation, then we cannot \nexpect the American people to support this legislation and the programs \ninfused with capital by this legislation over a long period of time. So \nwe have much work to do to strengthen oversight, and by doing that to \nbegin to increase the confidence the American people have in our \nGovernment and in this legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Maine is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, at this most consequential of \ntimes, and as a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, to speak to \nthe issue of the economic stimulus we have begun to consider here in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  We are deliberating on this legislation because the gravity of our \neconomic circumstances is the most dire we have witnessed since the \nGreat Depression, and in just three months, this recession will \nofficially become the longest and quite possibly the deepest since the \n1930s. We lost 2.6 million jobs last year, the most since 1945. The \nU.S. Department of Labor has reported the number of Americans receiving \nunemployment benefits has reached 4.8 million, an all-time high since \nrecord-keeping began in 1967--and that doesn't include the nearly 1.7 \nmillion getting benefits through an extension last summer.\n  Mark Zandi--chief economist for Moody's Economy.com, who has advised \nboth Senator McCain and President Obama--has stated, ``without \nstimulus, unemployment will rise well into the double digits by this \ntime next year.'' And then we learned last Friday that the economy \nshrank at its fastest pace in nearly 27 years in the fourth quarter of \n2008. Our gross national product dropped at a 3.8-percent annual rate, \nworst since 1982.\n  So, indisputably, the grave nature of the current landscape dictates \nthe urgency of passing a substantial and comprehensive economic \nstimulus package. I want to support a stimulus package. But I cannot \nsupport just any package. This Chamber cannot support just any package.\n  We have a responsibility--an obligation--to apply a rigorous standard \nto determine whether this approach will help extricate our Nation from \nthis crisis.\n  And yet, even the best economic minds are not in agreement or accord \non what is the optimal stimulus to pursue--and what it would achieve. \nBusiness Week, in its January 28 issue, asks ``how much does boosting \ngovernment spending or cutting taxes help the private sector? Can \nmassive fiscal stimulus . . . create lobs and increase economic \noutput?''\n  David Leonhardt, economics columnist for The New York Times, \nstipulated in an article on January 29, 2009, that such a ``bill should \nhelp the economy in both the near term and the long term. But the \ngovernment doesn't go out and spend about $800 billion every day. The \ndetails matter.'' He is absolutely right--the details do matter--and \nthat is why this amendment process is so fundamental. Current CBO \nDirector Douglas Elmendorf testified before the House Budget Committee \non January 27, 2009, and said, ``stimulative policies, if well \ndesigned, could hasten the economy's recovery and reduce the overall \nloss of output during the recession.'' That is precisely the test of \nhow effective a fiscal stimulus is--does it help bring us out of \nrecession?\n  In that light, we must not confuse stimulus with omnibus. For those \nwho say we cannot burden this bill with provisions that are not within \nthe strictures of economic stimulus, I couldn't agree more. And to do \notherwise would only compromise the credibility of any package that may \nultimately be enacted.\n  This is a multidimensional crisis that requires a multidimensional \napproach, and it is critical we get this right. Already Congress passed \nthe Troubled Asset Relief Program, which as we all know has had its own \nsignificant problems. Already the Federal Reserve has essentially \nexhausted its options to improve the economy through monetary policy, \nhaving reduced interest rates to zero--something else that hasn't \nhappened since the 1930s--and lent more than $1 trillion to stabilize \nthe financial and credit markets. So as I said during the mark-up of \nthe Senate Finance Committee's portion of this package, we ought to \nremember that for us, in crafting fiscal policy to meet this historic \nchallenge, there are no ``do-overs.'' We only have so many arrows in \nour fiscal quiver.\n  And so this debate shouldn't be about how much we label as ``tax \nrelief'' and how much we label as ``spending.'' We must not retreat \ninto our ideological corners or comfort zones. Rather, it should be \nabout the merits of the individual measures in this legislation and \nwhether the totality of the package can--in the timely, temporary, and \ntargeted fashion we have employed on stimulus measures in the past--\ndeliver job creation and assistance to people in need--who also will \nspend funds quickly, further bolstering economic recovery. We must ask, \ndoes this package fit the times--because in the words of an editorial \nin the Lewiston Sun-Journal in my home State of Maine: ``right now, \nthere's a country, an economy and a basic way of life that needs \nrescuing. Most of all, though, the country needs a program that works . \n. .''\n  I ask unanimous consent the entire editorial be printed in the \nRecord.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                   Senators, Bring Sense to Stimulus\n\n       In economic stimulus, numbers have ceased to matter. The \n     current package before Congress is $819 billion, but it could \n     be a quadrillion, for all it matters. What's been proposed is \n     stimulus at any cost, because continued lagging of American \n     economic output is a failure beyond comfortable calculation.\n       Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins are center stage this \n     debate, by virtue of their center-right leanings. Their \n     lobbies are filled with lobbyists and their ears are filled \n     with pleas, suggestions and threats, perhaps, of what their \n     vote on the stimulus means, either way.\n       Stakes are high. So are the costs. But Maine's senators \n     must ignore both of those, we think, in favor of the simplest \n     approach, to evaluating the merits of the stimulus: Prove to \n     us it is going to work, they should say, and soon. \n     Shortcomings or delays need not apply.\n       Praise and damnation for the stimulus from the right and \n     left are both steeped in truth. The country does need \n     targeted programs to strengthen safety nets, help states stem \n     red ink and put people to work through infrastructure and \n     other investments,\n       But It doesn't need a wish list, the rush to fulfill an \n     ideological agenda that's been stewing for eight years under \n     the former administration. There's time for that later. Right \n     now, there's a country, an economy and a basic way of life \n     that needs rescuing.\n       Most of all, though, the country needs a program that \n     works. Fast. This is where Snowe and Collins can hold sway, \n     by bringing common sense to the stimulus legislation through \n     the application of basic, pragmatic principles.\n       The country has already spent in haste. The 2007 stimulus \n     cut checks to every American, which felt great, but flopped. \n     The 2008 rescue for banks on their eves of destruction is \n     looking like the money was thrown into a gaping maw, never to \n     be seen again.\n       That Congress is now pressuring banks to lend their bailout \n     funds, instead of hoarding them, is testimony to the \n     contradictory nature of that bailout/rescue/stimulus. The \n     $700 billion was meant to stabilize the economy, not those \n     institutions that acted so recklessly to destroy it.\n       So here we are, as Americans, burned twice by major \n     spending packages that haven't spurred the desired effect--\n     staunching our economic bleeding and injecting fiscal \n     penicillin to kill the diseases spreading through our \n     markets. Two strikes. We can't afford a third.\n       President Barack Obama has presented the most thoughtful \n     package to date. There's little question that expertise and \n     intellect replaced emotion and paranoia as the sentiments \n     driving its creation. The questions that remain are basic: \n     Does it work, and how soon?\n       These are what Senators Collins and Snowe should have \n     answered to their satisfaction before deciding which way to \n     vote. The numbers and stakes are high, obviously.\n       What matters is that this stimulus package makes sense, and \n     that it works. Quickly.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Moreover, we must calibrate even more carefully the \nimperative for speed against the ironclad necessity of getting this \nlegislation right--given this bill in its current\n\n[[Page S1271]]\n\nform would add nearly $900 billion to our national debt--and that is \nbefore any interest payments--on top of the $10.6 trillion debt that \nexists. And that means, we cannot open the door to permanent spending \nthat exceeds the life and purpose of what is before us today.\n  In fact, Alice Rivlin, former Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget in the Clinton administration, offered the following fiscal \nreality-check in her testimony before the House Budget Committee last \nweek, ``because we're doing this outside the budget process, it means \nno one has to talk about what the long-term effects of any of this \nmight be.'' Well, let us talk about the long term effects here and now.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, CBO has projected a staggering $3.1 \ntrillion budget deficit over the next 10 years, and that's before we \npass this bill that will add $900 billion to that total. And as we all \nknow, CBO assumes that any additional funding levels added for Federal \nspending will be added to the budget baseline and extended in \nperpetuity with an inflation adjustment. In other words, this bill may \nexist entirely outside the normal budget process, but it will now be in \nCBO's baseline--meaning any future reductions will be considered by \nsome to be ``cuts.''\n  Therefore, we must ensure that programs that may well be great policy \nbut not economic stimulus are not considered in this package and \ninstead are vetted through the regular budget and legislative process. \nAnd that spending authorized in this bill ends when its emergency, \nstimulative function ends--with any continuation again only considered \nin the future through the normal process. As the Concord Coalition \namong others has called for, we must have an exit strategy to ensure \nthat we don't create unintended consequences down the road that will \ncause additional economic hardship and harm.\n  On that note, I believe that we deserve from the proponents of this \nbill a breakdown in each of the different titles of this legislation \nsuch as what are the job-creation expectations for each, or how \nprecisely will they assist those displaced by the current recession and \nwill that assistance itself also bolster our economy in the near term? \nFurther, I am working on an amendment that will require the new \nRecovery Accountability and Transparency Board created in this \nlegislation to include, in its quarterly reports, a specific listing of \nthe numbers of jobs being created by each title in this act. But most \ncritically, the amendment will direct the Board to recommend for \nrescission the unobligated balances of any program in the Act that are \nnot currently creating--or cannot be reasonably expected to create--\njobs or help those displaced by the current recession. These provisions \nwill hopefully shine a spotlight on the efficacy of the new law in \ncreating badly needed jobs.\n  Again, the bottom line question for us must not be exclusively \nwhether a particular proposal in this package is a good idea. The \nbottom line question is, as I conveyed to Vice President Biden in a \nconversation between us recently, will this package work in terms of \njump-starting the economy?\n  Columnist Robert Samuelson spoke directly to that challenge when he \nwrote in The Washington Post today, ``...the immediate need is for the \nstimulus package to stimulate--now. It needs to be frontloaded.'' I do \nthink it is positive that the legislation contains some measures to \nmove money out quickly and effectively, such as shortening the normal \ndeadline for Federal agencies to commit funds, and setting deadlines on \nFederal awarding of formula grants, among others, so States, \ncommunities, or agencies are not sitting on the money. They will be \nrequired to expend it within a given period of time in order to impact \nthe economy.\n  In addition, as we heard last year from CBO, extending unemployment \nbenefits is a preeminent stimulus tool, as it concluded its cost-\neffectiveness is ``large'' . . . the length of time for impact is \n``short'' . . . and the uncertainty about the policy's effects is \n``small.'' Now we have Moody's Economy.com estimating that every dollar \nspent on unemployment benefits generates $1.63 in near term GDP. So I \nam pleased the finance package I supported in committee included about \n$39 billion to extend unemployment insurance. And I thank the Finance \nCommittee Chair Baucus for including my measure to exclude the first \n$2,400 of unemployment benefits from taxation, to further maximize the \nprovision's stimulative effect.\n  On the tax side, the Finance package also includes a payroll tax \ncredit, known as the making work pay tax credit for more than 95 \npercent of working families in the United States--which Mark Zandi has \nsaid will be ``particularly effective, as the benefit will go to lower \nincome households...that are much more likely to spend any tax benefit \nthey receive.''\n  I am also pleased that Senator Grassley was able to insert an \nabsolutely vital provision to middle-income taxpayers in America that \naddresses the alternative minimum tax, which is an egregious and \nonerous tax on so many millions of taxpayers across this country, and, \nif left applied, would make the tax credit of $500 and $1,000 less \neffective. I am very pleased that was included to add another $70 \nbillion worth of tax relief to middle-income America.\n  The finance portion also includes increasing eligibility for the \nrefundable portion of the child tax credit that Senator Lincoln and I \nhave advocated and championed over the years. We have included this \nchild tax credit going back to 2001 in the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act. This incentive would reach low-income \nfamilies earning between $6,000 and $12,667 a year.\n  I have heard arguments before about refundability, and people will \nsay we should not provide funding to those families who don't have a \nFederal income tax liability. I would point out that although these \npeople may not earn enough to have a Federal income tax liability, they \ndo work and contribute to local taxes and payroll taxes and, the \nrefundable child credit will get additional money into the pockets of \nthose most likely to spend it.\n  After all, I don't think that anybody would deny that low-income \nfamilies earning between $6,000 and $12,667 on an annual basis should \nhave some benefits under this legislation. I don't think anybody can \ndeny that they will not be spending that money and that it will not be \nstimulative in the final analysis. I do believe they deserve to be part \nof this stimulus plan.\n  I also believe that preserving and creating jobs over the short term \nthat will also endure for the long term are not mutually exclusive \ngoals. To the contrary. As ranking member of the Small Business \nCommittee, I am very pleased the Finance Committee package included tax \nprovisions to assist small businesses to sustain operations and \nemployees. In particular, we extend small business expensing to \n$250,000 to promote investment. After all, small businesses are going \nto be the lifeline to job creation, as they have been in the past. In \nfact, small businesses create two-thirds of all net new jobs in \nAmerica. They will be the lifeblood of this economic recovery. It is \nimportant to extend the expensing provision of $250,000, as well as \nprovide a 5-year net operating loss carryback to firms, giving them an \nimmediate tax refund they can use to sustain operations and hire new \nemployees, among other priorities.\n  But above all--and I underscore this point--those receiving Federal \nmoney under the rescue plan under TARP will not have access or be \nallowed to take advantage of these additional taxpayer resources.\n  In addition, we must neither neglect nor forget our Nation's \ndistressed and rural communities. Our bill recognizes that imperative \nby including an additional $1.5 billion in 2008 and 2009 allocation \nauthority for the New Markets Tax Credit. I am told that the community \ndevelopment financial institutions fund, which administers the \nincentive, can allocate this 2008 credit authority within 60 days, \nwhich will create 11,000 permanent jobs and 35,000 construction jobs.\n  Since the only thing we don't want to be temporary in this package is \nthe jobs it creates, this legislation will place Americans on the \nvanguard of the jobs of the future with the extension of the renewable \nenergy tax credit to promote green technology, which will be absolutely \ncrucial as nations compete to emerge from this global economic \ndownturn. In fact, if we had not dithered last year and opted to\n\n[[Page S1272]]\n\npass the extension of the renewable tax credits at the beginning of \n2008, we would have already been on the road to creating 100,000 new \njobs.\n  I have heard a lot of arguments against renewable energy tax credits, \nsaying they are not stimulative. We are in the midst of a global \ndownturn, and every country on Earth is going to be competing for jobs \nin the 21st century. Determining what is the best path to creating \nthose jobs and investments in green technology is on the forefront of \njob creation. I want to be sure this country is in the vanguard when it \ncomes to creating jobs of the future.\n  Certainly making investments in renewable energy sources is going to \nbe so critical and so essential to job creation and to competing with \nother nations as they attempt to emerge as well from this global \ndownturn.\n  In fact, these renewable tax credits will create more than 89,000 \nmore jobs by giving certainty to companies that can start now on \nprojects and count on these important incentives to take risks and \ngrow. In fact, there are a number of projects in my own State of Maine \nthat have been postponed and placed on hold because they cannot receive \nthe benefits from the tax credits or financial institutions have \nsuspended their loans and their lending opportunities. That has \nprevented these companies from moving forward on projects that they \nhave wanted to pursue over the last few months. These are major \nprojects that will create thousands of jobs in my State, and the same \nis true in so many States across the country. That is why this \ninvestment in renewables is going to be essential to job creation.\n  Considering the entirety of the stimulus package, both tax and \nspending, and its ability to have an immediate impact, CBO has now \nreported that of the current $884 billion size of the bill, $694 \nbillion, or 78 percent, spends out in 2009 and 2010. That is a \nsignificant portion of this stimulus plan. Yet on the purely \nappropriations side, the spendout over the next 2 years is only 49 \npercent, and I believe we can and must do better.\n  Furthermore, I must say that there are allocations that simply do not \nbelong in the stimulus package. Do we need to include $575 million for \nrenovation and research at the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology in this legislation? Or $2 billion for advanced battery \nmanufacturing? Or $135 million for the management of lands and \nresources?\n  Again, there are many more examples in this legislation that \ncertainly should be identified as ones that should go through the \nnormal budgetary process.\n  There are other provisions that are unequivocally worthy of strong \nsupport. But again, we have to identify them as to whether this is the \nappropriate vehicle for their consideration, and I would say not.\n  I am hopeful in the final analysis that we can further address this \npivotal matter of nonstimulative provisions through the amendment \nprocess over the coming days. As the New York Times columnist David \nBrooks recently wrote, the package, as currently constituted, ``is part \ntemporary and part permanent, part timely and part untimely, part \ntargeted and part untargeted.'' And he also deftly pointed out, \n``leadership involves prioritizing.'' I think we will have to work in \nthe days ahead on both sides of the political aisle to offer amendments \nto bring accountability to this process, to bring both sides together, \nand to develop the kind of consensus that is going to restore the \nintegrity and confidence in the package we ultimately pass.\n  Mr. President, finally, as ranking member of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business, I am pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee \nalso included multiple small business lending provisions that I think \nare critical to the overall objective of this legislation which, of \ncourse, is to create jobs.\n  Let me also address one provision that I think is critical and that \nhas been part of the finance package--and that is expanding the \nMedicaid Program to assist States all across this country. I have heard \nthat many have suggested that somehow this is not stimulative, and that \nit is not appropriate to include additional funding for Medicaid \nassistance to the States.\n  There are 45 States that are facing significant budget shortfalls \nwith a combined budgetary gap of $350 billion. Are we suggesting it \nwould not have a profound impact on our national economy if all 45 \nStates, which are going to have to make some drastic decisions under \nany circumstances, had to make even more difficult choices if we did \nnot provide the $87 billion that is included in the Finance Committee \npackage to assist them?\n  In fact, I think it is going to be critically important that we do so \nbecause otherwise they will have to raise taxes and cut spending \ndramatically, which obviously will have a tremendous and consequential \nimpact on the state of the economy, leading to more job losses and a \nmore severe downturn.\n  As we know, States are required by their constitutions to balance \ntheir budgets. So, obviously, they will have to resort to raising taxes \nor reducing spending. I think we have an obligation to be a strong \nFederal partner and provide assistance when it comes to Medicaid \nbecause, after all, not only are States having difficulty with their \nexisting caseloads and increases in cost, but they are also facing a \nburgeoning caseload due to job losses. In fact, for every 1 percent \nincrease in unemployment, an additional 1 million Americans will \nqualify for Medicaid or the children's health insurance program under \nthe current enrollment criteria.\n  All that said, I also think we should impose some conditions on the \nStates. First, they should not be able to expand their current \nbenefits. They should maintain their existing benefits coverage. \nSecond, we should require prompt payment, so that states cannot sit on \npayments, but rather within a timely fashion of 30 days have to \nreimburse providers for care because delays in payments to providers \nultimately threaten their operations, limit their ability to make \ninvestments to take care of their patients, or put them at risk of \nultimately having to cut back substantially, which will have a \ntremendous impact on the overall economy.\n  Time is of the essence and so is the obligation to get this right to \nthe best of our ability. Hopefully, we can achieve a bipartisan bill, \none that is going to achieve the legitimate objectives of job creation, \nof stimulus and assisting those who have been displaced as a result of \nthe downturn in this economy. These goals are not mutually exclusive. \nIn fact, I think they are ones that could easily be accomplished as we \ngo through this process, if we all agree in the final analysis that we \nneed to move forward with a package that will meet the times and to \naccommodate the enormity of the challenge we are facing in this country \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I am fortunate to have heard the remarks \nof the Senator from Maine. They are excellent, and I find so much of it \nI agree with.\n  I am a brandnew Senator, but I have been around the Senate for 36 \nyears. I think in those 36 years, this is truly one of the historic \nmoments in all the years I have been following the Senate. We are about \nto embark on a task that will test this institution, as we begin the \ndebate on the response to the profound economic crisis we face.\n  Last Monday, as my first full week as a U.S. Senator began, thousands \nof American workers lost their jobs. In a single day, tens of thousands \nof families lost their breadwinners, men and women lost the dignity \nthat comes with work, and States and cities across the country lost the \nproductive labor and the tax revenues those workers have provided.\n  This was just a single bad day. But over the last couple years, the \nnews from our economy has been increasingly disturbing. American \npayrolls shrank by over 2.5 million jobs last year, including 524,000 \nin December alone, touching every corner of this country. The \naccelerating pace of unemployment tells us there is more bad news to \ncome. Along with laid-off workers, we have unused productivity \ncapacity. Thirty percent of our manufacturing strength is idle.\n  It is no wonder that Americans are cautious about spending. But their \ncaution, as we know, is reinforcing the slowdown.\n\n[[Page S1273]]\n\n  With that decline in consumer spending, our retailers are shutting \ntheir doors, laying off sales staff and management. With declining \nsales, manufacturers are laying off workers and shutting down assembly \nlines. Responses that are perfectly rational for individuals making \ntheir own decisions only add to our problems, making us all worse off.\n  Our jobs, our savings, our homes, our credit--all are under siege. \nLeft alone, we know things will only get worse. We have to break that \nvicious cycle.\n  I remind my colleagues of these troubling trends because as bad as \nthings are, they can get worse. Because we have failed to revive \nemployment, consumer spending--the key to today's economy--and consumer \nconfidence--the key to tomorrow's economy--remain in a slump. Because \nwe failed to restore stability in home prices, foreclosures continue to \nspread. Because we have failed so far to clean up our banking system, \nlending and borrowing are drying up.\n  That is the real urgency behind the task of building an effective \neconomic recovery plan because if we fail to act, we can be sure that \nwe will lose more jobs, lose more homes, and reduce the value of our \neconomy.\n  Because so much has gone wrong, our recovery plan must tackle many \ndifferent problems at the same time. Because so much of our economic \nvalue has been lost, the scale of our response must be equal to that \nchallenge. Because of the risk of further decline, our response must be \nrapid.\n\n  That is why the Senate is beginning debate today on a historic \neconomic recovery investment program for America. We must do something \ndramatic to turn our economy around. At the same time, the American \npeople will rightly judge whether we have used this moment wisely, \nwhether we have invested these hundreds of billions of dollars of their \nhard-earned dollars in ways that will improve their lives.\n  Job creation and job preservation must be our goal. Jobs, jobs, jobs. \nEvery job lost is another blow to our economy, losing productive work, \nspending power, and the revenue that supports the education, health \ncare, roads, water, police, and fire protection provided by our State \nand local governments. Every job lost is truly a human tragedy, for the \nman and woman who loses the dignity of work, and the families thrown \ninto turmoil.\n  One important way to create jobs is make more investments that will \nmake our economy more productive--clearly, roads, bridges, clean water. \nA smart power grid, as we discussed with former Vice President Al Gore \nlast week in the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, could become to \nour economy what the railroads were in the 19th century, what the \nhighways were to postwar America, and what the Internet has meant to \nour digital age. And as we discussed last week in the Judiciary \nCommittee, we can revolutionize health care records and at the same \ntime save billions of dollars while digitizing paper records, making \nsure we have appropriate privacy safeguards. We can improve health \ncare, save money, help protect our patients, and create jobs. We will \nneed to install new computers, routers, and software and educate and \ntrain the people with the skills to make the system work.\n  Listen, as jobs are created, consumers will be able to spend, \nhomeowners will be able to keep up with their mortgages, families will \nbe able to keep their kids in college. That is what economic recovery \nmeans, and that is what we have to do.\n  Finally, just as important as the jobs we create will be jobs \npreserved by keeping State and local governments able to provide the \nschools, the health care, the police and fire protection that we cannot \ndo without. They will need teachers, nurses, firemen, policemen, and \nhealth inspectors on the job. Just today our congressional delegation \nfrom Delaware met with the Governor of Delaware. This crisis, just in \nDelaware alone, has slashed our revenue projections by $.5 billion in \njust 6 months. We face a $600 million deficit, which will require \nshutting down services and laying off workers. This will add to the \neconomic slowdown and reduce the services on which our citizens depend.\n  Support directly to State and local governments will get out to where \nit is needed. We know that because we know those governments are now \nforced to cut back in the face of declining economic activity and \nrevenues. They need the money and they will use it. We have to get it \nto them.\n  This crisis has knocked a big hole in our economy, and it is \nessential we fill it quickly. Because of the size and speed of this \ntask, we must also have extraordinary oversight and transparency to \nassure Americans that we are doing this right and that we are doing it \nopenly. We must have additional resources and people dedicated to the \nsole purpose of auditing and investigating economic recovery spending. \nWe must have transparency. We must make public all of the grants, \ncontracts, and the oversight activities themselves. This is a historic \nundertaking, and we must have a historic level of transparency and \noversight.\n  During my years of experience with the Senate, I have developed a \ndeep respect for this very unique institution. I have seen it tested in \nwar and peace, in good times and bad. The debate on our economic \nrecovery plan this week is precisely the task for which this body, the \nSenate, was created. This is a moment that will test this institution. \nWe must deliberate, we must debate, we must decide. There are no easy \nchoices this week. There will be no easy votes. But I am convinced the \nSenate will meet this test, just as I am convinced our country will \nmeet the test of these extraordinary times.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/02/senate-section/article/S1273-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \naccomplishments of the Grayson County DECA from my home State of \nKentucky and their efforts of promoting entrepreneurship through \neducation and community awareness.\n  DECA is a high school association of marketing students which \npromotes the development of professionalism especially with regards to \nentrepreneurship and is the high school equivalent to the college \nassociation of Delta Epsilon Chi.\n  The Grayson County chapter works under the advisement of Cynthia \nSmith and Diane Horne, and comprised of dedicated young men and women, \nincluding two juniors from Grayson County High School, Tyler Lewis and \nAlex Henderson, who recently participated in the Entrepreneurship \nPromotion Project for organization.\n  The project has integrated its ideals into the local Grayson County \nschools with ventures such as developing different business ideas and \ncreating sales presentations. They have reached out to the community \nwith public service announcements on the radio and editorials in the \nlocal newspaper.\n  The Entrepreneurship Promotion Project earned the group a sixth place \nhonors in their category at the spring 2008 International DECA \ncompetition.\n  In addition to the promotion of entrepreneurship, DECA requires that \nits members participate in many hours of community service.\n  Recently, DECA has organized a job shadowing program for the senior \nadvanced marketing class at Grayson County High School. The program \nallows students to explore a career of their choice and gain \nprofessional experience by pairing them with local businesspeople.\n  The students explored careers at the Grayson County News Gazette, the \nGrayson County Sheriff's Department, the Leitchfield Police Department, \nthe County Courthouse, CPA firms, law offices and the Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  The members of DECA have worked to raise awareness and have \nsuccessfully obtained a proclamation from Grayson County Judge \nExecutive Gary Logsdon and Governor Steve Beshear designating the last \nweek in February as Entrepreneurship Week in the Commonwealth of \nKentucky and in Grayson County. The group was also honored with a \ncitation from the Kentucky House of Representatives.\n  DECA is a wonderful example of students striving for excellence both \nin\n\n[[Page S1274]]\n\neducation and community. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join \nwith me in recognizing Grayson County DECA's hard work and dedication \nto education, community, and Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/02/senate-section/article/S1274-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LARRY TREMBLAY\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a \nresolution acknowledging the outstanding achievement of an \nextraordinary high school athletic coach. On January 21 this year, \nLarry Tremblay achieved his 500th career victory as coach of the \nwrestling team at Winchester High School in Winchester, MA. After 29 \nyears of success, Coach Tremblay's outstanding career reached that \nmilestone, with his victory over Carver High School.\n  Mr. Tremblay is one of only three Massachusetts coaches who have ever \naccomplished this feat. Coming off two back-to-back State championship \nyears, and his induction to the National High School Wrestling Coaches \nHall of Fame, the Winchester High Wrestling team is riding high under \nthe remarkable leadership of Coach Tremblay. Appropriately the nickname \nof the school's beloved coach is ``Larry legend'' for his latest \nincredible milestone, and I commend Coach Tremblay for his skill and \ndedication and hard work throughout his years as Winchester High \nWrestling Coach. A recent article will be of interest to all my \ncolleagues in the Senate, and I ask unanimous consent that it may be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       ``Larry Legend'' Lives On\n\n               [From the Winchester Star, Jan. 22, 2009]\n\n       Winchester, MA--Winchester High wrestling Coach Larry \n     Tremblay entered Wednesday night's home match against Carver \n     with 499 career victories.\n       Sachem alumni, fans and friends packed the gym to witness \n     Tremblay achieve a feat only two other Massachusetts high \n     school wrestling coaches have accomplished--500.\n       His 2008-09 squad made sure he left with the elusive, \n     impressive and historic number.\n       With five scheduled matches remaining on the night, Sachem \n     152-pound grappler Mike Greco pinned Carver's Mike Babbin in \n     the second period. That win sealed up not only a convincing \n     53-6 victory for the Sachems, but it also gave Tremblay the \n     milestone.\n       ``You don't get into to coaching to win 500 matches or \n     games,'' said Tremblay. ``But one day I looked up and I had \n     100 wins, and then I looked up another day and it was 300. \n     I've had a lot of fun coaching here.''\n       Despite being undermanned, Tremblay credited Carver--a \n     program that won the New England championship in 1994--with \n     wrestling a strong match.\n       ``My hat goes off to them,'' said the coach. ``They made \n     the long trip up here, and they wrestled hard.''\n       The 160-pound, 171, 112 and heavyweight classes were all \n     ruled ``no contests.''\n       Tremblay began coaching wrestling at North Reading 29 years \n     ago. He spent one season there before moving on to \n     Winchester, where he has been ever since.\n       ``When I started coaching I had curly brown hair,'' joked \n     Tremblay. ``Now look at me. They call me the `silver fox.'''\n       Tremblay's passion and knowledge of the sport of wrestling, \n     as well as coaching in general, makes him stand out and \n     places him into an elite group.\n       ``He has such a love for the sport,'' said Tremblay's son \n     Travis, who grappled for his father for four years before \n     graduating in 2005. ``It's all he talks about. He loves it.''\n       The night began at 103, where, despite putting up a big \n     fight, Nick Cashion was pinned by Carver's Paul Walsh.\n       Although it would have been hard for anyone to steal \n     Tremblay's thunder on this night, Sachem 119-pound grappler \n     Connor Gregory managed to receive some well-deserved \n     recognition as well. Gregory earned a 14-3 major over \n     Carver's Matt Walsh, giving him 100 career victories.\n       Mike Barber (125) pinned Carver's Steve Mayne; Winchester's \n     Fernando Monroy (130) pinned James Blankship.\n       Ryan Connolly (135) earned a first-period pin over Carver's \n     Brandon English, and Winchester grappler Dan O'Connell (140) \n     earned a 14-4 major decision by defeating Steve Scampoli.\n       Sachem John Williams (145) pinned Carver's Mike Cabral in \n     the second period, and at 189, Winchester's Greg Kelley \n     pinned Corey Ellis at 1:06 of the first period.\n       The match officially concluded when Andrew Moranian pinned \n     Carver's Sean Mahoney in 1:31.\n       ``These are special kids, and considering what the previous \n     two teams did there is a lot of pressure on them,'' said \n     Tremblay. ``They're trying to build their own niche. They \n     wrestle to the best of their ability. Not only have they done \n     a good job on the mat, but they've done a good job \n     representing the town of Winchester.''\n       After the match, Tremblay received recognition for his \n     accomplishment on the place he knows best--the wrestling mat.\n       ``This really isn't a glamorous sport, but the whole \n     wrestling community is like a family,'' said Tremblay. It's a \n     special thing. Tonight, when I saw all the parents and the \n     alumni in the stands, I got a little emotional. This has been \n     a great ride.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/02/senate-section/article/S1274-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1274-S1276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       As a small business owner, the price of gas is close to \n     putting me out of work. The economy is a little slow right \n     now but only because of the price of fuel. If fuel prices \n     were to drop a buck a gallon, the country would see a huge \n     increase in spending. At this moment, I am unsure if I will \n     be able to even pay my bills this month to keep my business \n     open or a roof over my head. The burden of fuel prices and \n     the lack of work for me have begun to put a huge stress on my \n     relationship at home. She will now have to cover my share of \n     the bills and will leave us both to figure out how to feed \n     the kids, pay bills and buy fuel.\n       I am 41 years old and have been in the same profession for \n     over 17 years. The thought of having to start over and train \n     for a new job is very tough. I have looked for part-time work \n     in hopes something will be done about fuel prices allowing me \n     to save my business. There is very little work out there, and \n     the work that is there pays so little it would cost more in \n     fuel to get to work then you would make at work. This country \n     is in need of something to be done about fuel prices, if they \n     continue to rise we are going to see a lot of people \n     homeless, stealing, or worse to just get by. It is time for \n     this government to take charge and save its people before it \n     is too late.\n     Ken, Kuna.\n                                  ____\n\n       I work at the border of Idaho and Canada. Eastport, Idaho \n     to be exact. This is 33 miles from Bonners Ferry. Many of us \n     work here, at Customs and at the brokerages as well as a hand \n     full of other businesses. Some of us carpool when we can.\n       I want to ask you to help us get public transportation in \n     this northernmost area of Idaho. We need it. It will help all \n     of us through this crippling gas price debacle as well as \n     create a needed resource for everyone in Boundary and Bonner \n     County. If I take time to write out a plan, will you \n     seriously look at it and help us with grants and resources if \n     feasible? The plan would be an idea of course, as I am not a \n     grant writer, but I am banking on you to have that kind of \n     resource.\n       I think it is feasible and needs to be. We should all have \n     a focus on the future instead of cowering in fear because we \n     do not know how to move ahead, simply because we cannot \n     afford to live as we did, driving the biggest most powerful \n     cars and trucks, without regard to the future, instead of \n     conserving and investing in alternatives. It is not too late.\n       First things first. We all need to get to work and I think \n     public transportation would be something people would pay \n     taxes for in these parts.\n       I am including an email sent to me about alternative \n     ``air'' cars. It seems other countries have found solutions \n     in alternative means for transportation public and private. \n     Why is it that our country does not ``approve'' these \n     vehicles that run on ``air''? It does not make any sense, \n     other than the government is protecting the profits of \n     corporations.\n\n\n                            AMAZING AIR CAR\n\n       The Compressed Air Car developed by Motor Development \n     International (MDI) Founder Guy Negre might be the best thing \n     to have happened to the motor engine in years.\n       The $12,700 CityCAT, one of the planned Air Car models, can \n     hit 68 mph and has a range of 125 miles. It will take only a \n     few minutes for the CityCAT to refuel at gas stations \n     equipped with custom air compressor\n\n[[Page S1275]]\n\n     units. MDI says it should cost only around $2 to fill the car \n     up with 340 liters of air.\n       The Air Car will be starting production relatively soon, \n     thanks to India's TATA Motors. Forget corn! There is fuel, \n     there is renewable fuel, and then there is user-renewable \n     fuel! What can be better than air?\n       I am not sure, I would like to think our government had \n     what is good for all, not just the rich.\n       I would buy one of these ``air'' cars in a minute. I \n     commute 33 miles each way to the Idaho/Canadian border \n     everyday. It is a struggle as I am a single mom and every \n     penny is spent to keep body and soul together in my family. \n     Nothing is left as it is; it just galls me to see my local \n     gas stations (seems like) daily gas price hike. One gas \n     station even got an digital sign, I assume because he had to \n     go out there so often to change the numbers; now he just \n     presses buttons from his office to make the price go up.\n       I am afraid of what is to come, if our government does not \n     really focus on alternatives. Why go after oil reserves in \n     our country when that is not a long-term solution? Why not \n     really hit hard and support alternatives that are \n     sustainable? I get no security out of new oil finds. It is a \n     short-term solution. I would think we should think about \n     future generations, our own children, and their children. \n     What will they do? We need to solve it now, not put off the \n     inevitable.\n     Leah.\n                                  ____\n\n       How this Idaho family deals with high energy prices:\n       We drive less and slower. We have changed out incandescent \n     bulbs for compact florescent bulbs, and turn them off when \n     not in the room. We focused on increasing the energy \n     efficiency of our house this winter.\n       Nothing this Congress, or any Congress since the 70s has \n     done or appears to be planning helps us with the costs of \n     energy. Quit promoting legislation helping big oil. Poking a \n     few more holes in obscure, sensitive or scenic areas will not \n     provide immediate or long term relief. Pandering to the \n     automobile lobby will not improve automobile fuel efficiency \n     needed by the average person. Get in front of the quickly \n     forming parade of common people advocating real solutions.\n       As usual, if I get any reply to this, it will be a form \n     letter that completely ignores the fact that there are \n     opinions in Idaho that do not match yours.\n     Michael.\n                                  ____\n\n       First, I would like to express my thanks for your seeking \n     comments on the energy mess. These are my thoughts:\n       There should be a windfall tax on oil that is produced from \n     older domestic wells. These wells have been producing--say \n     over 10 years and the cost of production has been recouped. I \n     own stock in several oil companies; yet, I feel it is \n     important that the profits from these wells are put to better \n     use than dividends to me. The windfall profit should go to \n     help fund alternative fuels, hydrogen infrastructure, and \n     public transportation. You are correct when you say that \n     people in the west will suffer more from the high cost of \n     gasoline because of distance and the need to drive more.\n       I am new to the nuclear industry and my personal experience \n     has opened my eyes to this untapped resource. I believe \n     congress should support nuclear and help educate the public \n     to how much energy is produced by nuclear, the safety record \n     of the industry, and the progress in managing the waste. \n     Power plants that use natural gas and other hydrocarbon based \n     fuels should be the first to be replaced with nuclear. \n     Politically, it would be wise to incorporate wind and solar \n     with the nuclear effort to help offset some to the negative \n     press. The negative press needs to be offset with an \n     educational program to help change the paradigms of the \n     public when it comes to nuclear power.\n       Reinstate the rebates on hybrid vehicles.\n       Allow tax incentives for renewable forms of energy.\n       As for me, my expenditures for fuel have gone from $200 a \n     month to $400 a month. Combine this with increased food \n     costs, increases in my housing expenses, and other oil-\n     related costs and my personal life style has changed \n     dramatically. Fortunately, I live in a community that is very \n     close to the recreational activities that I enjoy.\n     Steven.\n                                  ____\n\n       It became apparent to me on vacation this year that many of \n     the world's hard-to-reach locations (i.e. most islands such \n     as Hawaii) are diesel-powered. The thought of powering an \n     entire island or island chain on diesel power alone is \n     sickening, and this is just one of the many hydrocarbon \n     dependent locations. My recommendation is to get nuclear \n     power off the cutting room floor and get the U.S. government \n     to build an infrastructure of power-supplying plants across \n     the nation. With a large nuclear energy source we would be \n     able to implement electromagnetic ``bullet trains'' between \n     major U.S. cities cutting down on highway and sky-way travel \n     making business commutes shorter and less carbon dependent.\n       This endeavor would be 1,000 times larger and more \n     expensive than the U.S. interstate program but it is \n     important to streamline this country rather than go down the \n     path that we have been going for years.\n       I have many more ideas but would like to keep things short. \n     Thanks for your time and for asking for citizen input.\n     Reese.\n                                  ____\n\n       Please get us off of oil dependency. That is what \n     alternative energy is all about. How stupid can we be to only \n     have 1-2% alternative energy?\n     Gary.\n                                  ____\n\n       Everyone is affected by the high prices of fuel; even \n     people that do not drive cars are affected by this. Costs for \n     shipping, because of fuel prices, have risen dramatically and \n     that cost is passed to the consumer.\n       The short-term solution to our oil dependence is to drill \n     here, offshore and ANWR, until a long-term alternative is \n     provided.\n     Angie.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you very much for taking the time to seek input from \n     Idaho citizens on the current energy crisis.\n       I live with my wife and three children in Meridian but work \n     at the Air Force Base in Mountain Home. Even though I drive a \n     fuel-efficient car, my weekly commute cost has risen by over \n     $100 a month. With the associated rise in grocery costs, it \n     has become necessary for me to take a second job just to \n     afford transportation to work and put food on my family's \n     table. I know that this has become a serious quality of life \n     issue, not just for my family but for many Idahoans.\n       I realize that even if drilling were begun immediately it \n     would not have that great of an effect on current prices and \n     that it could take several years for an impact to be felt in \n     homes across America, but it makes much more sense than \n     waiting even longer. Oil is not an infinite resource but by \n     expanding drilling we can help to give ourselves a buffer to \n     make the transition to other energy sources easier and more \n     economical.\n       Again, thank you for your efforts on our behalf.\n     James, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do not even know how to begin with what this has done to \n     our family. I will start by letting you know that we are a \n     single income family. My husband works a commission-based job \n     at RC Willey, and I stay home and raise our two children, \n     ages 7 and 4. Since the prices of gas and groceries have gone \n     up, people have reduced their spending considerably. The last \n     thing anyone is going to do is go into RC Willey and spend \n     money on home furnishings or electronics. Since my husband \n     installs home theater systems, and services furniture \n     repairs, this directly affects him, and with him being \n     commission, our paychecks has shrunk considerably. We went \n     from being able to pay all of our bills, and have a couple of \n     extra hundred dollars left over to now wondering how we are \n     going to pay the house payment on the first, much less any of \n     the other bills. We have to decide what is more important to \n     pay. The stimulus package was spent on paying our bills, to \n     keep us afloat. It did not go back into the economy.\n       One possibility we are looking at is for me to go back to \n     work. Two problems with that, we are not okay with someone \n     else raising our kids and we should not have to be forced \n     into that, and second we would probably spend more on gas \n     than I would make in an income so now it is not worth it. Now \n     we look at the possibility of my husband taking a second job, \n     which now means even less time with his family. Forget about \n     the financial suffering this is bringing on most people, but \n     let us take a look at what it is doing to the family unit. It \n     is hurting most families emotionally, and time wise, which \n     means the kids suffer. Why should my children or anyone \n     else's suffer because the oil companies want to get richer.\n       Oil company's report record profits, and are giving their \n     retiring CEOs outrageous severance packages (Lee Raymond \n     chairman of Exxon given $400 million), while the rest of us \n     suffer horrible at their hands. Please explain to me why \n     someone needs that kind of money to retire on and my kids \n     face the possibility of losing their home? And to add insult \n     to injury, they have the nerve to make the statement that \n     they are only making pennies on every dollar. It is not just \n     the gas either, because it is affecting everyone (other than \n     the super rich) now other companies are forced to raise their \n     prices just to maintain a minimal profit, which further hurts \n     the general public, and now everything has become \n     unaffordable, not just gas.\n       We try to do our best at buying cheap, and we buy the off-\n     brands, and we shop sales ads, and we limit how much we \n     drive. But again you run into problems there. When you buy \n     cheap you get exactly that--cheap. Stuff breaks, groceries \n     are going bad quicker (we bought a head of lettuce on Friday, \n     and by Monday it was rotted, along with the onions we bought, \n     and the bagels. The cheap brand of ziplock baggies we bought \n     did not even close, so we have had to use a whole box of \n     baggies that did not zip close.), and over all the quality is \n     just poor. Prices keep going up, but the quality keeps going \n     down, which in the end costs you even more money. I stay home \n     90 percent of the time, and when I do go out I drive my car \n     which is a Chevy Malibu Maxx, and it still costs me $50 to \n     $60 to fill up. My husband drives his motorcycle every single \n     day to work to save on gas, and we are still sinking \n     financially, and we do not have a lot of bills. Where is the \n     fairness in the super rich getting even richer at the \n     detriment of the middle class, to poor class families? That \n     is not the America I was raised and taught about.\n       If the powers to be that are supposed to be running this \n     country would do their job, we would not be in this position. \n     Stop ignoring the United States Constitution. It was put in\n\n[[Page S1276]]\n\n     place for a reason, and I am sick and tired of it being \n     violated. The Constitution is the foundation of this country, \n     and anyone with common sense will tell you, that when you \n     chip away at the very foundation of something, then the \n     entire structure will crumble. That is what is happing to the \n     USA. Stop letting the environmentalist run and control \n     everything. If it were not for them, and the idiots running \n     this country we would have already drilled in ANWR Alaska. Or \n     better yet our own, gulf instead of China/Cuba/India. By the \n     way, these are two suggestions for you to use.\n       Let us make this country back into what it was meant to be, \n     a great place to live, and raise your children in. Stop \n     selling out the United States of America.\n     Nick and Kasey, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I hope you do not mind, but I am an avid Glenn Beck \n     listener, and I heard on his show yesterday that one of \n     Senator Orrin Hatch's secretaries or spokespeople told one of \n     his constituents that he would not support offshore drilling. \n     The constituent was calling because he wanted to tell Senator \n     Hatch that he supported it.\n       I am glad to see you asking directly for people's opinion \n     and actually using some of the stories on your site.\n       Let me just say that right now my wife, our baby, and I do \n     not have a car. Well, not one in working condition. See, I \n     have a '94 Geo Metro, but it threw a rod earlier in the year \n     and we just do not have the money to get a new car. I did \n     find an engine for my Geo, though, so everything should work \n     out once we get our economic stimulus check, except for the \n     whole skyrocketing gas prices thing.\n       Right now we have to borrow my parents' truck if we need a \n     car, which is very frequently. We are trying to get my wife \n     into school to become a paramedic, but without \n     transportation, we cannot do anything. Back when gas prices \n     were cheaper, I had less of a problem borrowing people's \n     vehicles, but these days I cannot stand to borrow somebody's \n     car because a lot of the time I do not have the cash to put \n     gas back into it.\n       Luckily I live really close to where I work, so I walk \n     every day. My wife mostly just stays home with our baby, and \n     both sets of our parents live close by. The only thing is, \n     just the short distances that our parents have to drive to \n     pick us up or take us to the store or whatever they do is too \n     much. Even having smaller vehicles, like my Geo, does not \n     seem to help that much. Before the thing broke down I was \n     putting $40-50 in to fill the thing, and it only has an 8-\n     gallon tank.\n       Let me be frank. I like that you have asked people's \n     opinions on this subject. High gas prices affect everything, \n     as you can probably see. Food prices are going up because of \n     the money it takes to transport. Anything that is made with \n     petroleum (which is something that people rarely think about) \n     like paint products and plastics are going up. Everything is \n     going up because everybody uses gas to get from point A to B, \n     so businesses let customers make up the difference by raising \n     prices.\n       It is a pretty simple economic concept, but something that \n     should be even simpler is supply and demand. I do not know \n     why anybody at this point is against offshore drilling. And, \n     I do not know why anybody is against nuclear energy. Sure, \n     plenty of environmentalists are all bonkers about nuclear \n     meltdowns and all that, but how many times in history has \n     that ever happened? Nuclear waste from reactors is even \n     becoming less of a factor.\n       The long and short of it is really that I support Senators \n     that listen to the people. I think that you should try to get \n     on the news yourself and let people know that you want their \n     opinion.\n     Phil, Boise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/02/senate-section/article/S1276-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             140TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST. MARK'S A.M.E. CHURCH\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I wish to honor St. Mark's A.M.E. \nChurch, which has been a part of Milwaukee's faith community for 140 \nyears and serves as a shining example for the entire State of \nWisconsin.\n  In 1869, eight eager Christian men and women envisioned a ``Church of \nAllen.'' This church would uphold the ideals of Richard Allen, a freed \nslave who became the first free African to be ordained in the Methodist \nChurch. The church's eight founders were led by Ezekiel Gillespie, a \nprominent figure involved in the Underground Railroad and the fight for \nsuffrage for African-Americans in Wisconsin. The founding members \nbecame an official congregation on April 5, 1869, but the church was \nstill missing a building to call home.\n  Within 2 months, a plot of land was purchased and the church embraced \nits new house of worship. Unfortunately, expenses mounted for nearly a \ndecade and the founders were forced to sell a portion of their land in \norder to cover the debt. After a city condemnation required the razing \nof St. Mark's original church, both the clergy and laity insisted that \na new edifice be erected in its place. In 1887, they began construction \nof a church which would last into the 20th century.\n  As the city of Milwaukee continued to grow and thrive, so too did the \nmembership of St. Mark's. The increase in size prompted the creation of \nnew churches in 1914 and again in 1953. After the Milwaukee \nRedevelopment Program of the 1960s, the construction of a highway \nushered in the demolition of their 1953 structure. The congregation \ngrew only stronger and its current church truly represents its lasting \nsuccess.\n  Given the moniker, ``The Friendly Church,'' St. Mark's has \ncontinually proven both its friendliness and its faith within \nMilwaukee. St. Mark's A.M.E. Church holds a special place in our \nState's history as Wisconsin's oldest African-American chartered \nchurch. St. Mark's leaders and parishioners have stalwartly defended \ntheir home and shared their devotion with our Milwaukee community, and \nthis historic church will continue to thrive in the future. On this \noccasion of St. Mark's 140th anniversary, I want to offer my heartfelt \ncongratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/02/senate-section/article/S1276-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. \n             Conrad):\n       S. 363.

A bill to make determinations by the United States Trade \nRepresentative under title III of the Trade Act of 1974 reviewable by \nthe Court of International Trade and to ensure that the United States \nTrade Representative considers petitions to enforce United States trade \nrights, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the devastating job losses we are currently \nseeing across our economy have reaffirmed my conviction that Congress \nmust redirect U.S. international trade policy toward preserving \nAmerican jobs through stringent enforcement of\n\n[[Page S1277]]\n\nU.S. trade rights, rather than endlessly pursuing new free trade \nagreements. Shifting the focus of U.S. trade strategy to job \npreservation is particularly essential in the manufacturing sector, \nwhich since 1994--the year NAFTA came into effect--has lost over 4.2 \nmillion jobs. The economic downturn over the past year has further \ndecimated U.S. manufacturers, which have shed over 600,000 jobs in 2008 \nalone.\n  It is no coincidence that this withering of our country's once-\nunparalleled manufacturing base took place during a decade-and-a-half \nof record trade liberalization and increases in imports from large, \noften poorly regulated low-cost producers like China and India. In \nMaine, my constituents have seen this down-side of trade, with over \n20,000 manufacturing jobs lost since 2000, mainly in paper and wood-\nworking industries that have suffered from unfair competition from \nAsian imports.\n  To stem the outflow of American manufacturing jobs due to trade \ncompetition with countries that manipulate their currencies, exploit \ntheir workers or wantonly degrade their environment, it is essential \nthat we decisively enforce the trade agreements we already have in \nplace. Yet our Government has often failed to take this basic but \ncrucial step when confronted with egregiously unfair trade practices. \nWhile foreign governments engage in market-distorting currency \nmanipulation, refuse to protect intellectual property rights and turn a \nblind eye to labor exploitation--each a violation of trade obligations \nto the United States--ours all too frequently demurs with communiques \nand consultations, rather than formal enforcement action. What makes \nthis abdication of duty to defend the U.S. economy from unfair foreign \npractices especially troubling is that the tools to do so already exist \nin the dispute resolution provisions of various trade agreements.\n  The distressing reality is that U.S. industry and labor groups are \noften rebuffed in attempts to petition the United States Trade \nRepresentative to initiate a formal investigation or bring a dispute \nresolution action under the relevant multilateral or bilateral trade \nagreement, as there seems to be considerable institutional momentum \namong senior officials at USTR and elsewhere in the bureaucracy against \nbringing formal enforcement action against key trade partners. Indeed, \nit is a troubling fact that every single one of the petitions brought \nby business or labor groups in the last 8 years under Section 301 of \nthe Trade Act of 1974--the statute setting forth the process by which \nmembers of the public can request that the government enforce of U.S. \ntrade rights--has been rejected by USTR, in some instances on the same \nday they were filed!\n  It is to prevent further disregard for U.S. businesses and workers \nseeking a fair and consequential hearing of their concerns with foreign \ntrade practices that Senators Rockefeller and Conrad and I today \nintroduce the Trade Complaint and Litigation Accountability Improvement \nMeasures Act, or the Trade CLAIM Act.\n  The Trade CLAIM Act would amend the Section 301 process to require \nthe United States Trade Representative to act upon an interested \nparty's petition to take formal action in cases where a U.S. trade \nright has been violated, except in instances where: the matter has \nalready been addressed by the relevant trade dispute settlement body; \nthe foreign country is taking imminent steps to end or ameliorate the \neffects of the practice; taking action would do more harm than good to \nthe U.S. economy; or taking action would cause serious harm to the \nnational security of the United States.\n  The bill would also grant the U.S. Court of International Trade \njurisdiction to review de novo USTR's denials of Section 301 industry \npetitions to investigate and take enforcement action against unfair \nforeign trade laws or practices. Such jurisdiction would include the \nability to review USTR determinations that U.S. trade rights have not \nbeen violated as alleged in industry petitions, and the sufficiency of \nformal actions taken by USTR in response to foreign trade laws or \npractices determined to violate U.S. trade rights.\n  The Trade CLAIM Act would thus give U.S. businesses and workers a \ngreater say in whether, when and how U.S. trade rights should be \nenforced. As Ranking Member of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I believe this bill would also be particularly \nbeneficial to small businesses, which--like other petitioners in \nSection 301 cases--currently have no avenue to formally challenge the \nmerits of USTR's decisions, and are often drowned out by large business \ninterests in industry-wide Section 301 actions initiated by USTR.\n  By providing for judicial review of USTR decisions not to enforce \nU.S. trade rights, the bill provides for impartial third party \noversight by a specialty court not subject to political and diplomatic \npressures. In de-linking discreet trade disputes from the mercurial \nmachinations of USTR's trade liberalization agenda, this Act would end \nthe sacrifice of individual industries on the negotiating table, and \nallow trade enforcement claims to be decided on their merits. We owe no \nless to the millions of American workers whose jobs depend on the level \ninternational playing field that can only be guaranteed by their \nGovernment consistently standing up for them against unfair foreign \ntrade practices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/02/senate-section/article/S1277-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 99.
