Mr. President, when millions of Americans lost their jobs, \nthey did not just lose a place to go to work in the morning; they lost \ntheir incomes, their savings, and their retirement security. They lost \ntheir tuition payments. Many lost their homes. They lost their gas \nmoney, their grocery money, and many other things--all of this through \nno fault of their own.\n  I am not talking about a handful of people in isolated corners of \nthis country. I am talking about millions of Americans from every one \nof our States. To so many of them, unemployment is not just a temporary \ninconvenience. For far too many, it is an unending emergency.\n  As the front page of today's New York Times reports--and it is the \nsame in newspapers all over the nation--40 percent of the unemployed in \nthis country have been out of work for 6 months or longer. They are \ntrying to understand why at this pressing moment--when jobs are harder \nto come by\n\n[[Page S5978]]\n\nthan at any other time in recent history--Congress cannot get its act \ntogether to extend emergency insurance, as we have always done with \nbipartisan backing for decades.\n  Well, part of the reason is that many on the other side do not see \nthis as an emergency. They look at a crisis for families' budgets and \nsee an opportunity for their political fortunes. They think when \nunemployment goes up, so do their poll numbers.\n  Some even think that the unemployed enjoy being out of work. That is \nwhy one of the top Republicans in the Senate called unemployment \nassistance a ``disincentive for them to seek new work'' and voted three \ntimes in recent weeks against extending it.\n  Another senior Republican Senator said these Americans--people who \nwant nothing more than to find a new job--``don't want to go look for \nwork.'' And then he, too, voted ``no'' three times.\n  A third senior Republican Senator, who, like his colleagues, has time \nand again stood in the way of addressing this emergency, justified it \nby saying--listen to this quote--``We should not be giving cash to \npeople who basically are just going to blow it on drugs.'' That is a \ndirect quote.\n\n  My constituents take offense at these absurd allegations, and they \nhave let me know about it time and time again. They have written or \ncalled, sent me e-mails. They have pulled me aside when I have been \nhome to talk to me about this.\n  One of these e-mails came to me last week from Las Vegas, where \nunemployment is now 14.5 percent. Statewide it is 14.2 percent. This \nman's name is Scott Headrick. He wrote me, and you can hear in the e-\nmail his anger. It is sad. He is one of 2.5 million Americans who, \nbecause of Republicans' objections, is no longer getting the \nunemployment help he needs. This is what Scott Headrick wrote to me:\n\n       I've been unemployed since July 2008 and have not been able \n     to obtain a position at a supermarket packing groceries. I've \n     been religiously seeking, searching and applying for work \n     without any luck. I have since left my family in Las Vegas, a \n     wife and five children, to look for work in other states and \n     again, without any luck.\n\n  Scott mentioned the Senators making these outrageous claims and \ndemanded that they, in his words:\n\n     apologize to those Americans truthfully looking for work to \n     support their families. . . . I and my family have already \n     lost everything but each other.\n\n  Scott is right. The twisted logic we have seen in the unemployment \ndebate is not just appalling or heartless, though it is certainly both \nof those things. It is also factually wrong.\n  First, there is only one open job in America for every five Americans \ndesperate to fill it. So no one should be so crass as to accuse anyone \nof being unemployed by choice--especially not those same lawmakers \nwhose irresponsible policies over the past decade created the very \ncrisis that collapsed the job market in the first place.\n  Second, unemployment insurance works. It helps our economy recover. \nMark Zandi, who was John McCain's economic adviser when he ran for \nPresident, calculated that every time $1 goes out in unemployment \nbenefits, $1.61 comes back into the economy. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has estimated that number could actually be as high as $2, \nmeaning we double our investment in helping the unemployed.\n  If you think about it, it makes sense. Nobody is getting rich off the \n$300 unemployment check they get each week. And nobody keeps those \nchecks under his mattress. These Americans turn around and spend the \nmoney. They immediately pay their bills, go to the store, keep up with \ntheir mortgage payments, which stimulates the economy. They spend it on \nthe basics and bare necessities while they look for work. The money \ngoes right back into the economy, which strengthens it, fuels growth, \nand ultimately lets businesses create the very jobs the unemployed have \nbeen looking for, for so long.\n  The people we are trying to help want to find work. They are trying \nto find work, and they would much rather get a paycheck than an \nunemployment check.\n  Nevadans such as Scott Headrick, who lost his job 2 years ago this \nmonth, and who has tried tirelessly to find a new one, is just one of \nmillions who needs our help. Democrats are not going to turn our backs \non him. He sends out resumes and goes to job interviews, but for months \nand months he has heard nothing but ``no.'' What a shame it is that he \nis hearing the same from the Republicans in the Senate on this issue.\n  Mr. President, will the Chair announce the business for the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/19/senate-section/article/S5978-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 460, H.R. 2765.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Securing the Protection of \n     our Enduring and Established Constitutional Heritage Act'' or \n     the ``SPEECH Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The freedom of speech and the press is enshrined in the \n     first amendment to the Constitution, and is necessary to \n     promote the vigorous dialogue necessary to shape public \n     policy in a representative democracy.\n       (2) Some persons are obstructing the free expression rights \n     of United States authors and publishers, and in turn chilling \n     the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States \n     interest of the citizenry in receiving information on matters \n     of importance, by seeking out foreign jurisdictions that do \n     not provide the full extent of free-speech protections to \n     authors and publishers that are available in the United \n     States, and suing a United States author or publisher in that \n     foreign jurisdiction.\n       (3) These foreign defamation lawsuits not only suppress the \n     free speech rights of the defendants to the suit, but inhibit \n     other written speech that might otherwise have been written \n     or published but for the fear of a foreign lawsuit.\n       (4) The threat of the libel laws of some foreign countries \n     is so dramatic that the United Nations Human Rights Committee \n     examined the issue and indicated that in some instances the \n     law of libel has served to discourage critical media \n     reporting on matters of serious public interest, adversely \n     affecting the ability of scholars and journalists to publish \n     their work. The advent of the internet and the international \n     distribution of foreign media also create the danger that one \n     country's unduly restrictive libel law will affect freedom of \n     expression worldwide on matters of valid public interest.\n       (5) Governments and courts of foreign countries scattered \n     around the world have failed to curtail this practice of \n     permitting libel lawsuits against United States persons \n     within their courts, and foreign libel judgments inconsistent \n     with United States first amendment protections are \n     increasingly common.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported substitute amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements \nrelated to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The bill (H.R. 2765), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate has passed important \nbipartisan legislation to reduce the chilling effect that foreign libel \nlawsuits are having on Americans' first amendment rights.\n  I am the son of printers and I consider this a matter of great \nimportance. My parents told me from the time I was a child: Believe in \nand uphold the first amendment. It is the basis of our democracy. It \nguarantees us the right to practice any religion we want or none if we \nwant. And it protects the right of free speech. Those protections \nguarantee diversity. If you have a constitution that guarantees \ndiversity, you guarantee a democracy.\n  That is what this does. I wish to thank Senator Sessions, the ranking \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for working with me on this \nbill.\n  Let me speak a little bit about what the bill does. The Securing the \nProtection of our Enduring and Established Constitutional Heritage Act \nor, as we call it, the SPEECH Act, will ensure that American courts \nwill not enforce foreign libel judgments from countries where free \nspeech protections are lower than what our Constitution affords against \nAmerican journalists, authors, and publishers.\n  Too frequently, foreign plaintiffs bring libel suits against American \nwriters and publishers in countries where the plaintiff or the \npublication lacks any significant connection to the foreign forum. The \nlawsuit is brought there because of that foreign country's weaker \nplaintiff-friendly libel laws. This is known colloquially as libel \ntourism.\n  In other words, if somebody in the United States writes a book, \nprobably\n\n[[Page S5980]]\n\nvery accurate, about some despot or some leader of a country who has \ndone criminal acts, has stolen the property of that country or any one \nof a number of things--it could be very accurate and, in our country, \ntruth is a defense--what they will do is maybe order online a couple \ncopies of the books and deliver them to another country with weak libel \nlaws and then seek judgments against the author, against the publisher, \nagainst newspapers that may have published excerpts of it; everything \nto chill any criticism of those who have either breached human rights \nor stolen from their own country and on and on.\n  On a broad scale, libel tourism results in a race to the bottom. It \ncauses America to defer to a country with the most chilling and \nrestrictive free speech standard determining what they can write or \npublish. This undermines our first amendment. The first amendment, as I \nsaid earlier, guarantees the diversity of thought and opinion in this \ncountry which actually allows and determines and guarantees that \ndemocracy.\n  The freedoms of speech and the press are cornerstones of our \ndemocracy. They enable vigorous debate, and an exchange of ideas that \nshapes our political process. Reporters, authors and publishers are \namong the primary sources of these ideas, and their ability to \ndisseminate them through their writings is critical to our democracy. \nThe broad dissemination of materials through the Internet, as well as \nthe increased number of worldwide newspapers and periodicals, has \ncompounded the threat of libel tourism.\n  This problem is well documented. Two years ago, the United Nations' \nHuman Rights Committee observed that one country's libel laws \n``discourage[d] critical media reporting on matters of serious public \ninterest, adversely affect[ed] the ability of scholars and journalists \nto publish their work,'' and ``affect[ed] freedom of expression \nworldwide on matters of valid public interest.''\n  Several States, to their credit, have enacted legislation to combat \nthis problem, but we need a national response. While we can't legislate \nchanges to foreign laws that are chilling protected speech in our \ncountry, what we can do to uphold the right of free speech in our own \ncountry is assure that our courts do not become a tool to uphold \nforeign libel judgments that undermine American first amendment or due \nprocess rights. The SPEECH Act is an important step toward reducing \nthis chilling of American free speech\n  The SPEECH Act is an important step toward reducing this chilling of \nAmerican free speech. Americans have a great gift in their right of \nfree speech. Every single Senator, Republican and Democratic, should \njoin, as we have in this case, to protect America's rights.\n  The SPEECH Act is the product of hard work and extensive negotiations \non both sides of the aisle, and the process is certainly mindful about \nprinciples of international comity. Many supporters would not have \nwritten this bill in this exact way, but all recognize that a \nbipartisan compromise is an important step in confronting the libel \ntourism issue. Without it, we could not pass this bill.\n  Among the supporters are the Vermont Library Association, former \nAttorney General Michael Mukasey, the former Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, James Woolsey, the American Library Association, \nthe Association of American Publishers, the Reporters Committee for \nFreedom of the Press, the American Civil Liberties Union, Net \nCoalition, and renowned first amendment lawyer, Floyd Abrams.\n  I would also like to recognize Dr. Rachel Ehrenfeld, Director of the \nAmerican Center for Democracy, who herself has been the victim of a \nlibel suit in the United Kingdom, and has been a tremendous advocate \nfor Congressional action in this area.\n  I wish to thank Senators Specter, Schumer, and Lieberman for their \nwork in raising this important issue in the Senate and Representative \nCohen for his hard work on libel tourism legislation in the other body. \nI am pleased the Senate has adopted this bipartisan legislation. I look \nforward to its prompt consideration and adoption by the House and to \nthe President signing it into law.\n  Mr. President, I do not see anybody else seeking recognition, so I \nwill suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Kagan Nomination\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak on a very serious issue \nrelating to the confirmation of Solicitor General Elena Kagan for the \nSupreme Court of the United States. As I was preparing for her \nhearings, I noted what struck me as a disturbing decision she had made \nas Solicitor General shortly after taking that position, in a case \ncalled Witt v. Department of the Air Force. In that case, a former \nmember of an Air Force Reserve unit in Washington State sued the \ngovernment to challenge the ``don't ask, don't tell'' law, which \nessentially says openly homosexual persons may not serve in the U.S. \nmilitary. The case was dismissed by the district court, and the \nmilitary was allowed to proceed with its policy. But when it was \nappealed to the Ninth Circuit, that very liberal court of appeals \noverturned the district court and said the case should go to trial and \nannounced an unworkable legal test that the lower court must apply and \nthat the government would have to meet for the ``don't ask, don't \ntell'' statute to survive constitutional challenge.\n  After that unprecedented ruling, the Solicitor General's Office, then \nmanned by the Bush administration personnel, immediately authorized an \nappeal to the full Ninth Circuit, en banc, and the government asked the \nfull court to take a look at it and overturn the three-judge panel. The \nfull court of appeals declined to do so, over strong objections from \nseveral judges on the Ninth Circuit who thought their colleagues had \nclearly gotten the case wrong. In fact, the First Circuit in the \nNortheast had already reached a different conclusion in a very similar \ncase, and had upheld the statute.\n  At that point, the government could have appealed the Ninth Circuit \ndecision to the Supreme Court, as I think the Solicitor General's \nOffice clearly was on track to do. First, they sought en banc review, \nand then they would seek interlocutory appeal to the Supreme Court. But \nas it happened, by\n\n[[Page S5981]]\n\nthe time the case was ripe for appeal, the Obama administration had \ncome into office and Ms. Kagan had become Solicitor General. She was \nnow head of the office that makes this decision on whether to take \ncases to the courts of appeals or, if necessary, to the Supreme Court; \nthe office that is charged with the great responsibility of defending \nbefore the Supreme Court the statutes passed by the United States \nCongress. Of course, don't ask, don't tell is a congressional statute, \nnot a policy of the military. So it fell to her to decide whether to \ntake the case to the Supreme Court. She refused.\n  I practiced law for 20 years--15 as part of the Department of \nJustice, as a U.S. attorney for 12 years--and I think I can make some \ncommonsense evaluation of the judgments the lawyers made in this \nlitigation. Ms. Kagan, at the time she made this decision, had only \nbeen Solicitor General--had only served in the Department of Justice--\nfor 6 weeks or so.\n  As I analyzed what I think happened, I asked some serious questions \nabout why this Solicitor General failed to follow through on what \nappeared to be the direction of her predecessor. And I was struck by \nthe distinct possibility that Ms. Kagan did not fulfill this \nfundamental responsibility of her office, which is to defend the \nstatutes of the United States regardless of her personal policy views. \nSo at the time of her confirmation hearing, just a couple of weeks ago, \nI asked her about this case and the facts that led up to it. I asked \nher to explain the decision, and I deliberately intended to give her \ntime to explain it. Well, she took time, using notes for about the only \ntime I saw in the hearing, and talked uninterrupted for about 10 \nminutes to explain how it was that she made the decision.\n  At the end of it, I thanked her for her answer and noted that I was \ngoing to have to review this because what she had done did not make \ngood sense to me. I have to make a judgment. I am a Senator. I have to \nknow whether the person who is being considered to sit on the highest \nCourt of the land with a lifetime appointment--could serve 30, maybe 40 \nyears on the Court--whether they understand that officeholders have \nduties and responsibilities that they cannot just fail to discharge, \nthat they must do?\n  So I have conducted an examination, and I must say I am very troubled \nby what I have found about this case. I think the record shows that Ms. \nKagan did not, in fact, fulfill her responsibilities in a good way and \nin a faithful way as Solicitor General and that she, in effect, \nviolated a specific promise she made to the Judiciary Committee when \nshe testified under oath during the hearing on her nomination a year or \nso ago to be Solicitor General. She had to be confirmed then and came \nbefore the committee.\n\n  Before I go further, I wish to provide some background. It is widely \nknown by many that Ms. Kagan is personally opposed to don't ask, don't \ntell. She has been opposed to it for some time. While she was dean at \nHarvard, she blocked the military recruiters from the campus career \nservices office because of her opposition to don't ask, don't tell. She \ncalled don't ask, don't tell ``a moral injustice of the first order.'' \nShe spoke at a protest of students who protested while a military \nrecruiter was in the next building, and she changed the Harvard policy \nfrom admitting recruiters to the career services office to denying them \nadmittance, without legal authority, contrary to the law Congress \npassed and on which I worked, to force universities to treat our \nmilitary men and women who come to recruit on their campus with the \nsame dignity and respect as they would treat anyone else from some law \nfirm who makes millions of dollars. At the recent hearing she openly \nadmitted to me that her views remain the same about this statute.\n  When she came before the committee for the position of Solicitor \nGeneral, she was specifically asked about this in written questions, in \nlight of her strong opposition to this law. Congress passed three or \nfour versions of the Solomon Amendment to finally require that colleges \nand universities treat our military on an equal basis, and some were \nforced to do so or lose Federal funding. She was specifically asked, in \nlight of her strong opposition to this law, whether she would be able \nto defend it as the job of Solicitor General would require. This was \nnot a mystery. We knew this matter was coming up through the courts of \nappeals and would be coming before the Solicitor General.\n  She was flatly asked: If you are going to take this job, as you have \nbeen opposed to this statute, will you defend it as you are lawfully \nrequired to do? Only the Solicitor General can represent the U.S. in \nthe Supreme Court. If the Solicitor General does not defend an act of \nCongress, who will? There is no one else. So it was a good question.\n  She promised the committee under oath that she would, and she said \nthat her ``role as Solicitor General would be to advance not my own \nviews but the interests of the United States.'' Correctly stated.\n  She went on to say that she was fully convinced that she could \n``represent all these interests with vigor, even when they conflict \nwith my own opinions.'' She said her general approach to suits \nchallenging a Federal law would be to make any ``reasonable arguments \nthat could be made in its defense,'' and this would include \n``challenges to the statute involving the don't ask, don't tell \npolicy.''\n  A pretty specific promise. It was an important promise. I am sure had \nshe not made that promise, even more people would not have voted for \nher confirmation.\n  She went on to say that she would ``apply the usual strong \npresumption of constitutionality to that law as reinforced by the \ndoctrine of judicial deference to legislation involving military \nmatters.''\n  As I mentioned earlier, it just so happened that immediately after \nshe was confirmed it fell her lot to defend this very statute that she \npersonally strongly opposed but that she had promised she would \nvigorously defend. She was given the opportunity to appeal to the \nSupreme Court from that terrible decision out of the Ninth Circuit, \nwhich refused to uphold don't ask, don't tell, and which ordered the \nmilitary to go to trial in the middle of a war to justify the law under \na newly-invented legal standard.\n  Faced with that choice, Ms. Kagan refused to appeal, decided to let \nthe Ninth Circuit decision stand, and allowed this case to be sent back \ndown to go through a trial. Clearly, to me, the military's interest was \nto have the issue decided as a matter of law--that this is a lawful \npolicy and that they were empowered to carry it out in a lawful manner.\n  When I asked Ms. Kagan at her Supreme Court hearings recently why she \nblocked the Supreme Court review of the Witt case, she gave three \nreasons in her long answer. Some may have thought she gave a brilliant \ndissertation. She had notes, and she went through a long discussion.\n  First, she said she concluded, after conferring with her colleagues, \nthat it would be better to wait to appeal to the Supreme Court until \nafter the trial, because a trial would build a better factual record of \nthe case. She said once the facts were better developed, the government \nmight be in a better position before the Supreme Court.\n  Second, she said that allowing the case to go back to the district \ncourt would help the government in a future appeal because it would be \nable to show the Supreme Court just how invasive and ``strange'' were \nthe demands of the Ninth Circuit that were being placed on the \ngovernment in defense of the law.\n  I will say one thing: The Ninth Circuit demands were, indeed, strange \nand were utterly unworkable, as I will show.\n  Third, she said an appeal in the Witt case would have been \n``interlocutory;'' that is, an appeal before the case had come to an \nend and before a final judgment had been rendered in the case. The \nSupreme Court prefers not to hear these kinds of appeals.\n  None of these explanations are credible. It is true that appellate \ncourts, including the Supreme Court, prefer to hear appeals at the end \nof the case rather than in the middle, but that is a decision the Court \ncan make for itself. It is not something the Solicitor General has to \ndecide on the Court's behalf. And that consideration was clearly \noutweighed in this case.\n  I will note parenthetically that when the Third Circuit ruled on the \nSolomon Amendment, which required Harvard\n\n[[Page S5982]]\n\nand other law schools to allow the military equal access to recruit on \ncampus, they took that as an interlocutory appeal and reversed the \nThird Circuit. That is exactly what should have been done here. The \ngovernment had asked for an interlocutory appeal to the Supreme Court \nfrom the Third Circuit ruling that affected Harvard, and the Supreme \nCourt agreed. It was a legal question, ripe for decision, and they \ndecided the case. That is what should have happened.\n  Here we already had a split among the courts of appeals on this \nquestion. The First Circuit had already ruled as a matter of law for \nthe government. The Ninth Circuit ruling squarely conflicted with the \nFirst Circuit, and it was also at odds with decisions from four other \ncircuits on similar principles. Here we also had an opinion from the \nNinth Circuit that presented clean questions of law--an opinion that \nhad dramatically altered the legal landscape in 40 percent of the \nUnited States, because the Ninth Circuit encompasses 40 percent of the \nUnited States, and that was proposing to subject the military to an \ninvasive trial process, while fighting a war, to defend the application \nof a nationwide military policy to an individual person.\n  Ms. Kagan's second explanation--that letting the case go to trial \nwould allow the government to show just how painful a trial would be--\ncannot be given serious consideration. The Ninth Circuit opinion was \nvery clear about what the government would have to show in order for \nthe don't ask, don't tell law to survive this lawsuit. In other words, \none didn't have to go through all these steps at the lower court and \nshow how dramatically disruptive it would be. The Court had set forth \nexplicitly what would happen. It is easy to show the Supreme Court why \nthis is not a workable approach.\n  The Ninth Circuit made it very clear in their opinion that the \ngovernment was going to have to justify the application of don't ask, \ndon't tell to this specific plaintiff--not justify the law in general \nbut to justify its application to this specific plaintiff--to prove \nthat this specific plaintiff was going to harm the military if she were \nallowed to remain in the Air Force. It was also clear that such a trial \nwas going to be disruptive to the military and that it would harm the \nunit cohesion Congress had set out to protect when it passed the don't \nask, don't tell law in 1994.\n  I am not alone in reaching this conclusion. Her predecessors in the \nDepartment of Justice and in the Solicitor General's Office, the office \nshe took over, also knew the court orders did not make sense. That is \nwhy they immediately asked the full Ninth Circuit to reconsider en banc \nthe three-judge panel's ruling when it first came down in 2008.\n  They said in their brief that the Ninth Circuit decision ``creates an \ninter-circuit split.'' That means the First Circuit had held \ndifferently. The Ninth Circuit held a different way. We had a split of \ncircuits which is something the Supreme Court considers when they \ndecide to take a case.\n\n  They went on to say it created ``a conflict with Supreme Court \nprecedent, and an unworkable rule that cannot be implemented without \ndisrupting the military.''\n  The Ninth Circuit's decision, they went on to say, made the \nconstitutionality of a Federal law setting military policy for the \nentire Nation ``depend on case-by-case surveys, taken by lawyers, of \nthe troops in a particular plaintiff's unit.'' They went on to say that \nimmediate review was ``needed now to prevent this unprecedented and \ndisruptive process.'' That is exactly correct. The lawyers who made \nthat argument were clearly correct.\n  Most importantly, Ms. Kagan's decision to send this case back for \ntrial and not appeal doesn't make any sense because she knew a trial \nwas going to be massively disruptive to the military. I have studied \nthe record of the case on remand to the district court, and I have seen \nwhat has been going on since it was sent back to be tried on an \nindividual plaintiff basis. The lawyers for the government are \nstruggling to defend the law under these difficult circumstances. From \nthe very first hearing before the district court, these lawyers, career \nlawyers, professionals in the Department of Justice, are asking the \ncourt not to allow discovery, not to allow the plaintiff to depose the \nsoldiers and plow through all these issues in the military unit.\n  Here is what the career attorney for the Department of Justice said \nat the first hearing before the district judge after the case went back \ndown for this trial:\n\n       If we commence with discovery into the specific facts of \n     this case by looking at what unit members think, we are \n     threatening--we are jeopardizing the unit morale and cohesion \n     . . . that the Ninth Circuit said the government--the \n     military--has an important government interest in.\n       So the military is in a bit of a catch-22. By proceeding to \n     discovery, we may well have to sacrifice our important \n     government interest.\n\n  Remember, Ms. Kagan told the Judiciary Committee--she told us just a \nfew weeks ago--that ``building a factual record'' would be good for the \ngovernment's case. Remember? I just went through that. That is what she \nsaid--it would be good. We would have a better prospect on appeal \nsomehow. Here, the career lawyers trying to defend the military are \nsaying that building a factual record is bad for the government because \nthe discovery process will threaten the military's interest in unit \ncohesion.\n  As a matter of fact, I will say as an aside that I think it is quite \nclear that if the Ninth Circuit theory of law were to be upheld, the \n``don't ask, don't tell'' policy would be put in the situation where it \nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce because everybody \ndismissed under that policy would then be able to have a big trial. It \ncould go on, as this one has, for months, and they would be able to \ncall all the unit members to ask their opinion about what they thought \nabout this, that, and the other, even about their personal sexual \nactivities, perhaps. This is not a practical solution. It is bad for \nthe government. How Ms. Kagan could now say it would be good for the \ncase, I do not know.\n  So clearly the career lawyer is right. The plaintiff in this case, \nwho is represented by lawyers from the ACLU, has asked for and received \naccess to the personnel records of the plaintiff's military unit. So \nnow the ACLU has the personnel records of the entire unit, it appears. \nThey have demanded depositions with other soldiers who served with the \nplaintiff before she was separated from the military. They have \ndemanded the right to interview soldiers about their private lives, \ntheir personal views of their former colleague, and their private \nthoughts about sexuality.\n  The district court has wrongly, I believe--well, I will just say it \nthis way: The district court has allowed it at every turn because the \ndistrict court says this is the only way to answer the questions the \nNinth Circuit ordered them to answer before a person could be dismissed \nunder this provision of law.\n  But this is not just a case of bad--astonishingly bad--legal \njudgment. I do not think Ms. Kagan accidentally sent her client, the \nU.S. Air Force, into a litigator's lion's den. I do not think it was an \naccident. I believe she understood this was going to happen and, for \nsome reason, she wanted it to happen.\n  In the very first hearing the district judge held after Ms. Kagan \nrefused to appeal to the Supreme Court and the case was sent back for \ntrial, the plaintiff's lawyers argued they needed to get all this \ndiscovery in the case, and they made a very interesting statement to \nthe district judge. They said this:\n\n       [T]he government just doesn't want any discovery. I have \n     heard that message from the government clearly--loud and \n     clear. [We] were asked to meet with the Solicitor General of \n     the United States in April, and we heard that message loud \n     and clear that discovery is a big problem; but we never heard \n     any specifics as to why, and it boils down to they don't like \n     the Ninth Circuit's decision.\n\n  So apparently back in April 2009, Ms. Kagan acknowledged what I think \nis indisputable: that discovery of this kind, where soldiers are \ndeposed and asked about their personal views and activities, would be \ndisruptive to the military and bad for her client, the Air Force. That \nis just undisputable. She was the Solicitor General then and \nacknowledged that.\n  Her decision to block an appeal to the Supreme Court was finalized in \nMay of 2009. So before she made that decision, it does appear Ms. Kagan \nmet with the opposing counsel in the case--the ACLU lawyers--and told \nthem that ``discovery is a big problem.'' In other words, she told \nthese ACLU lawyers for\n\n[[Page S5983]]\n\nthe other side, who were trying to attack the military policy, that \ndeveloping a factual record in this case would be bad for the \ngovernment. But she told us at the committee that she thought it was \ngoing to be good for the government.\n  She knew in April of 2009 that a trial would be harmful to the \ninterests of her client, but she made sure the case went back for a \ntrial anyway. She knew that discovery would be harmful to the \ngovernment's interests, but she told the Judiciary Committee, just 2 \nweeks ago, under oath, that she decided not to allow an appeal to the \nSupreme Court because she thought ``it would be better to go to the \nSupreme Court with a fuller record'' that would be developed at trial.\n  I do not know how to reconcile her testimony with the record in the \ncase. I do not think it can be reconciled.\n  During this nomination process, I have expressed my concern about Ms. \nKagan's record as a political lawyer--someone who has advanced a \nspecific agenda as an adviser in the White House and someone who says \nshe was ``channeling'' the Justice she clerked for on the Supreme Court \nwhen she encouraged him not to hear certain cases because she did not \nthink a majority of the Court would rule the way she and her boss would \nlike. But I do think this big decision she made as Solicitor General \nis, in many ways, more concrete proof--and from just a few months ago--\nof the reason for our concerns that this nominee will have \ndifficulties, and maybe find it impossible, to set aside her political \nviews and decide cases objectively and fairly.\n  Faced with the hard task and the solemn responsibility of defending \nthe laws of the United States--after having promised the Judiciary \nCommittee under oath that she would be able to uphold that \nresponsibility, even as to this specific law she personally opposes--I \nam forced to conclude that Ms. Kagan did not live up to that promise \nand did not fulfill a solemn duty of the Solicitor General of the \nUnited States.\n  This is not a statute, in my view, that is likely to be overturned by \nthe Supreme Court. In fact, we know the law's opponents, in another \ncase, did not want to see their case be appealed to the Supreme Court. \nWhy? They felt they would lose, in my opinion.\n  Let me talk about duty. Maybe that is a bit old-fashioned today. But \nMs. Kagan should not have had to make a promise before the committee \nthat she would defend this law. It is a duty of every Solicitor General \nto defend the laws of the United States, whether they like them or not, \nwhether they think it is a good idea or not. Who cares what they think? \nThey have a responsibility. They are confirmed to a position high in \nthe Department of Justice--the position that empowers her to appear \nbefore the Supreme Court and state the position of the United States. \nIndeed, the Solicitor General's job has often been called the greatest \nlawyer job in the world. Why? Because the Solicitor General has the \nhonor to stand before those Justices and say: I represent the United \nStates of America. What greater honor can someone have than that, to \nrepresent this great Nation before the Nation's highest Court? Much is \nexpected of them.\n  So I say she did not have to make a promise to defend this statute. \nIt was her duty, whether she liked it or not. And it does appear--I do \nnot see how we can draw any other conclusion--that she did not like \nthis law and that her strategy in the case was to not get a definitive \nSupreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the statute and to \nallow these proceedings to be dragged out in lower court and to maybe \ninfluence Congress as to whether it repeals this act. I do not know. \nCertainly, she despised this law. She opposed it. She wrote briefs at \nHarvard attacking the Solomon amendment that said that Harvard Law \nSchool had to give the military equal treatment on campus and that \naccess could not be denied simply because she did not agree with don't \nask, don't tell, which is what she was doing at Harvard.\n  The result of her decision showed she was willing to allow the ACLU \nto prowl through the our airmen and soldiers in units throughout the \nNinth Circuit--covering over 40 percent of America--turning those units \nupside down, harming the discipline and order of those units and \ndamaging to the military. I do not see how it can be considered \notherwise.\n  I think it was an abdication of her duty. We are Senators here. We \nare elected. We have one vote. And I know our nominee was articulate \nand had good humor and many thought she did very well with her \ntestimony. I was not so impressed. But I do believe you have to fulfill \nyour duty and your responsibility, particularly after you have \nexplicitly promised to do so with regard to this specific case, and \ndefend the law even when it runs contrary to one's own personal views.\n  What if the person is now confirmed to the bench for 30, 35 years? If \nshe were to serve as long as the judge she is replacing, I think she \nwould serve 38 years on the Supreme Court. We have to know before they \nare launched forth on the Court that the nominee has the ability and \nthe character and the integrity to defend the legal system in a proper \nand effective way.\n  This nomination is further complicated by the fact that our nominee \nhas no experience in the real practice of law. Our nominee has never \ntried a case, never stood before a jury, to my knowledge, never cross-\nexamined a witness in a trial. She never had to deal with a judge who \nis not feeling good, maybe irritable one day, or dealing with lawyers \non the other side who are clever and tough. That is something you \nlearn. She has never been a judge. Well, they say, that is not \nnecessary; some great judges haven't been judges. Of course, that is \ntrue, but she has never been a judge or a real lawyer. That bothers me. \nThen when I see the kinds of things I am seeing here, it makes me \npause, frankly. I hope all of my colleagues will look at this and take \nit seriously.\n\n  There are other examples of positions taken by this nominee as \nSolicitor General and at Harvard that are very troubling. I think the \nevidence shows a lack of a clear understanding of the importance of the \nrule of law in our country. President Obama has said he wants judges \nwith empathy. I don't know what he means by empathy. That is not a \nlegal standard. It is something other than law. It is more akin to \npolitics or bias than law. He has said he wants a nominee who will \ndemonstrate that they, in the course of their duties, will have a \nbroader vision for what America should be. Does that mean a judge gets \nto manipulate the meanings of words in statutes and in our Constitution \nto promote this vision that they have? Were they elected to promote any \nvision? I don't think so. I think a judge should be a neutral umpire \nwho puts on that robe to evidence a commitment to impartiality and call \nthe facts of the case as they see them, faithfully following the law \nand faithfully finding the facts of the case. That is what a judge is \nall about.\n  I am very concerned that our nominee, whose background has been more \npolitical. Her testimony to me was too much akin to White House spin \nthan to a clear and intellectually honest explanation of what the law \nand facts are in complicated situations. I didn't feel good about it. \nMaybe others did, but I did not.\n  So those are concerns I have. I hope my colleagues will specifically \nlook at the don't ask, don't tell matter. I think it raises questions \nabout whether the nominee should be confirmed.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Unemployment Insurance Benefits\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are seeing over the last 12 months a slow \nrecovery in our job market. In the last 6 months, we have seen that \naccelerate but not sufficiently to reduce unemployment to anything \ncomparable to a full employment economy. This year, so far, however, we \nhave generated 600,000 jobs in the private sector. That is in sharp \ncontrast to January of 2009 when President Obama took office and when \nwe were losing 700,000 jobs a month. But despite this improvement in \nthe job market, we have a long way to go.\n  It is particularly troubling to be, once again, anticipating the vote \ntomorrow on the extension of unemployment benefits. These benefits \nlapsed\n\n[[Page S5984]]\n\nweeks ago. Meanwhile, millions of Americans are without access to \nunemployment funds--the insurance funds they paid each week out of \ntheir daily wages for the time they hoped would never come but has \ncome--that they could rely upon for some support as they look for work.\n  In Rhode Island, the unemployment rate is 12 percent--absolutely \nhorrendous. We are seeing more and more of this unemployment being long \nterm, not a temporary situation. Nearly half--45.5 percent--of those \nunemployed have been out of work for more than 6 months, and in those 6 \nmonths, the excess savings one might have, the ability to cut a few \ncorners to make it week by week, are less and less effective in simply \nkeeping the lights on and keeping the family together. Then when you \ntake away the unemployment compensation, people are, frankly, becoming \ndesperate.\n  Yet many on the other side are completely indifferent to this. They \nsay it is not their problem. Well, it is their problem. It is our \nproblem. If we cannot do this, then we are failing in a basic function \nwhich is to provide support for Americans in crisis, and that is what \nwe must do. People are looking for work. The average individual has \nbeen looking for work for 35 weeks. That is almost a year, or a big \npart of a year. Yet, in the midst of this economic downturn--with 14.6 \nmillion unemployed Americans--my colleagues on the other side have \nforced us to go through procedural hoops to get a vote on an \nunemployment compensation extension.\n  The Senate has failed on three occasions to pass this extension. It \nis not because there is not a majority of Senators who want to, but \nbecause procedurally, we need 60 votes to end debate and vote on the \nmeasure. We have let this program lapse for short periods and now it \nhas been lapsed since June 2, and that is unacceptable. There is no \nother word for it other than obstruction--stopping something that has \nbeen done routinely on a bipartisan basis in every major job recession \nin this country in our lifetime. This should be a simple bipartisan \nendeavor.\n  George W. Bush had a period of time where we had a recession in the \njob market and we, on a bipartisan basis, extended unemployment \ninsurance. There were no repeated delays, stretching it out, only 2-\nmonth extensions or 3-month extensions to be considered. It was done \nbecause we had to help Americans who needed the help and who had \ncontributed to the fund through their unemployment compensation \ninsurance. We have never failed to extend unemployment compensation \nwhile the unemployment rate was at least 7.4 percent. Today, if your \nState has 7.4 percent, you are in recovery. You are in great shape. We \nhave 12 percent in Rhode Island. If I go around the country, there are \ntoo many States such as Rhode Island, with 10, 11, 12 percent \nunemployment. The national unemployment rate is 9.5 percent. So this is \nan historical anomaly. We have routinely, on a bipartisan basis, \nextended unemployment compensation as long as the unemployment rate has \nbeen at least 7.4 percent. But now, in the midst of a much worse \nnational economic crisis, most of my colleagues are simply indifferent \nto it. I am hopeful tomorrow we will rally at least two who recognize \nthe need to respond to the needs of their constituents.\n  We have extended it for much longer periods of time than the current \nperiod. In the 1970s, under Presidents Ford and Carter--again, through \ntwo Presidents, one Republican, one Democrat--3 years and 1 month of \nextended unemployment benefits. In the 1980s under President Reagan, \nyes, we extended unemployment compensation benefits without paying for \nit under Ronald Reagan on a bipartisan basis to help Americans for 2 \nyears and 10 months. In the 1990s, under President Bush, George Herbert \nWalker Bush and President Clinton, 2 years and 6 months. So we are \nhardly at the point where these benefits have gone on so long that they \nare intolerable.\n  Again, routinely we have done this on a bipartisan basis, Republican \nPresidents, Democratic Presidents, Republican Congresses, Democratic \nCongresses. What I would argue has changed is our colleagues on the \nother side. Now we are going through another procedural vote and at the \nend of the day, on the final merits, this could pass by 75, 80, 90 \nvotes, because no one wants to be accused of not extending unemployment \nbenefits. But this whole procedural strategy of delay after delay after \ndelay effectively has denied millions of people not just the dollars, \nwhich are important, but the small sense of security that they can rely \non these funds, that there is someplace they can get help. In Rhode \nIsland, the average weekly benefit is $360. They can get roughly $360 a \nweek to feed their family, to provide for the essentials in life. When \nthat is stripped away, they lose more than just $360; they lose the \nsense that there is anything out there that is going to help.\n  Beyond this procedural delay, some of my colleagues are arguing: \nWell, the reason we don't want to give unemployment compensation is it \nis a disincentive to work. I say $360 a week is not a disincentive for \npeople to work who have worked all of their lives, making much more \nthan that, who are desperate to work. The reality is that for every \nworker unemployed today who is out there looking around, there are not \nthe jobs. In fact, there are five unemployed workers for every \navailable job. This is not a situation where they are sort of sifting \nthrough and saying, Well, I don't like that work; that is too far for \nme to go. Talk to your neighbors, as we all do. They will take almost \nanything to get back in the workforce, and just to make more than, in \nRhode Island, $360 a week. So that argument is disingenuous, but it has \nbeen raised here as if it is the gospel. It is not.\n  We are in a deep economic crisis. Most of it is the result of \npolicies that my colleagues enthusiastically supported: deep tax cuts \nto benefit, because of the nature of the income tax, the wealthiest \nAmericans; more than low-income Americans. Two wars unfunded. In fact, \nI think this is probably the first time in the history of this country \nwhere we cut taxes in a time of war rather than trying to pay for these \nwars. The largest expansion of an entitlement program--Medicare Part \nD--in the history of the country since the 1960s, unpaid for. I could \ngo on and on and on. That has led to a myriad of other policies--lax \nregulation; inattention to the lack of innovation in our country; the \nlooking on as other countries such as China and others have taken bold \nsteps in terms of infrastructure construction; the development of new \ntechnologies, including alternate energy and high-speed electric rail \ntransportation--the Bush administration sort of casually tended to \nignore it.\n  I don't think anything indicates clearly the priorities of that side \nand this side. We have been struggling for months to try to pass an \nextension of unemployment compensation, but being told we have to pay \nfor it. In the same breath, our colleagues say, But we have to extend \nthe Bush tax cuts, including the estate tax cuts, without paying for \nthem. We can't help people struggling to find work with $360 a week, \nbut we can help multibillionaires with their estate taxes. I would \nargue that if you want to invest in productivity in America, help \nworking people get jobs and work, and they will pay their taxes, they \nwill work hard, they will contribute to the community.\n  Now we have to deal with the deficit, but the notion that the $34 \nbillion we are talking about today in unemployment compensation is \ngoing to rank with the $3.28 trillion that these Bush tax extensions \nwill cost the country it is not even apples and oranges. Literally and \nideologically we can't pay for tax cuts, yet the deficit is the most \nimportant problem we face. It doesn't make sense, and it particularly \ndoesn't make sense to Americans who are out there desperately looking \nfor work.\n  Again, when you look at where this deficit came from, I remember in \nthe 1990s when we stood up as Democrats without any Republican help and \npassed an economic program that resulted in not only deficit reduction \nbut a $236 billion surplus. It resulted in not only economic growth but \nstrong employment growth through the nineties.\n\n  When President George W. Bush took office, he was looking at a \nsignificant projected surplus. He was looking at solid employment \nnumbers and a growing, expanding economy. In the 8 years he was in \noffice, he took that surplus and not only turned it into a deficit, but \nhe increased the national debt more in 8 years than had been done in\n\n[[Page S5985]]\n\nthe previous history of the country. Then, again, to have my colleagues \non the other side suddenly discover that deficits are important--it \nwasn't important enough for them in the nineties to stand with us and \nvote to reduce the deficit, balance the budget, and raise the surplus. \nIt wasn't important enough for them in the Bush administration, which \nadopted programs and policies to undercut that fiscal stability and put \nus into a precipitous economic collapse--and now it is important.\n  It is important, but when we talk about this issue of unemployment \ncompensation, it is central to this debate. Robert Bixby, president of \nthe Concord Coalition, which has been, throughout the years, one of the \nmost consistent in terms of fiscal responsibility, put it well when he \nsaid:\n\n       As a deficit hawk, I wouldn't worry about extending \n     unemployment benefits. It is not going to add to the long-\n     term structural deficit, and it does address a serious need. \n     I just feel like unemployment benefits wandered onto the \n     wrong street corner at the wrong time, and now they are \n     getting mugged.\n\n  That is what is going on. They are mugging a program the American \npeople need. It is close at hand. It can invoke this notion of \nresponsible deficit reduction. Where was all this responsible deficit \nreduction talk when they were proposing Medicare Part D, which is a \nhuge benefit to the pharmaceutical industry--without any payments, a \nlot of expensive entitlement, which adds to the structural deficit, \nbecause year in and year out, when you get to be 65 years old, you \nqualify for Part D.\n  Unemployment benefits are countercyclical--people pay into it, it \nbuilds up the trust funds in the States, and then when you meet a point \nat which you need it, it should be there. It should be there now.\n  The other point that is important to make is, for every dollar of \nunemployment benefits there is $1.90 of economic activity. This is a \nstimulus measure too. At a time when we are seeing a fragile recovery, \nwe need to put more muscle behind the recovery. Not only are we giving \npeople a chance to make ends meet, when they take their unemployment \ncompensation and other resources and go into the marketplace, it \nprovides an increase in economic activity.\n  In fact, if we don't have increased economic activity, there is a \ndanger this recovery will be very slow--painfully slow--and that would \nbe unfortunate, because what we measure in terms of economic recovery \nis measured in American families by the opportunities to send their \nchildren to school, the opportunities to provide more for their \nfamilies. If that is inhibited over months and months, then those who \nsuffer are the American families.\n  There are other aspects of this. For example, the Joint Economic \nCommittee estimated that by the end of 2010--this year--290,000 \nunemployed disabled workers--these are people who work but have a \ndisability--will exhaust their benefits. If these individuals choose to \ndrop out of the labor market and go onto the Social Security disability \nrolls, go through the process of being qualified and approved for \ndisability, over the lifetime, this could result in $24.2 billion in \ncosts, contrasted to the $721 million this year that this group would \nreceive in extended benefits.\n  It is a simple sort of issue. Do we want to keep people in the \nworkforce--at least keep them looking for work with unemployment \nbenefits--or do we want them to say: I will give up and declare that I \ncan't work again, and I will go see if my disability can be covered by \nSocial Security disability insurance and, for the rest of my life, I \nwill collect my Social Security disability, even though I would really \nlike to work. That is another aspect of this problem.\n  We have a challenge tomorrow, when we greet our new colleague from \nWest Virginia, to stand and extend unemployment benefits. Once again, \nif we look at history, this should have been done weeks ago on a \nstrong, bipartisan basis, putting aside the relative politics of the \nmoment and concentrating on what we should do for the American people. \nTomorrow we will have a chance to do that, and I hope we do.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to speak for about 5 or 10 \nminutes--not very long--about an important matter before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am joined by my colleague from Oregon, \nMr. Merkley, who has been a wonderful supporter of the small business \npackage and as a member of the Banking Committee has been very \ninstrumental in the shaping of the jobs bill 3, the small business \npackage, that we will be debating and hopefully voting on this week.\n  I wish to say first that I appreciate all the work the members of the \nSmall Business Committee have done, both Ranking Member Snowe and all \nthe members of the committee, as well as the members of the Finance \nCommittee who worked very hard to put a package together and the work \nthat has come from the White House and Treasury to build a package that \nis paid for, fiscally responsible, and meaningful for small business in \nAmerica.\n  There are many important pieces of the package, but one of the most \nsignificant in this very tough time for small businesses, Mr. \nPresident, which you know because I am sure you hear from your small \nbusinesses in Delaware, is that they would like some tax relief, if \npossible. They understand we are in a deficit. They understand it is \ndifficult to provide tax relief, it is also difficult to cut spending, \nbut they would like to see us respond with some targeted tax cuts to \nsmall business.\n  This package, I am happy to say, that Leader Reid will be presenting \nin the next 24 to 48 hours has $12 billion in targeted, specific tax \ncuts for small businesses in America, from accelerated depreciation to \nzero capital gains for investments made in small businesses in the next \nyear, incentives to invest, not in the big businesses, not in the \nbusinesses on Wall Street but in the businesses that are on Main Street \nin all our States and all our towns, whether they be large cities or \nsmaller cities or tiny villages throughout, whether it is Delaware or \nLouisiana, Texas or New York I am pleased a centerpiece of this \nlegislation is targeted, substantial tax cuts for business.\n  The other very interesting piece of this bill is a whole series of \nthings on which the small business community has worked together in a \nvery bipartisan fashion for strengthening programs within the SBA, the \nSmall Business Administration; it is not a very big agency, it is a \nsmall agency, but it can be muscular. If it is provided the right tools \nand with the right shaping of those muscles, it can be actually very \neffective in lifting small businesses to a better place.\n  With Senator Snowe's help and support, we have managed to come out \nwith several provisions, one of which is the doubling of the loan \nlimits for the 504 and 7(a) programs, which together have the potential \nto leverage about $30 billion in lending. We have reduced the fees--\neliminated the fees, actually, for banks. We have increased the \nguarantee from 75 percent to 90 percent. We have expanded the amount of \nloans, the limit, people can ask for to provide greater access to \ncapital. It is widely popular with the small business associations, and \nwe have their broad support.\n  Again, small businesses in America have seen their credit lines \nshrinking or evaporated. They have seen their credit card companies \ncharging higher interest rates and demanding full payment on \noutstanding balances.\n  It is important for us to recognize that this recession is not going \nto end without some businesses hiring again. They do not hire on wishes \nand prayers. They hire on bottom-line finances and the hope that things \nwill get better. Both are important--bottom line finances, access to \ncapital, and the hope that things will be better. That is what this \nbill brings--bottom line support and hope that things can be better.\n  That is a big portion of our bill. Included in that is a very \nimportant component of increasing exports. When\n\n[[Page S5986]]\n\npeople say in the surveys: We need to increase demand, I agree. One way \nwe can increase demand is to open exporting opportunities for our small \nbusinesses.\n  I do not have it with me, but I have used it many times, a chart that \nshows only a small sliver that represents small businesses that export. \nMost of our products are exported and services sold by big companies. \nWhen people say to me: Senator, what can the Federal Government do to \nhelp open markets or to give us more customers, one thing we can do is \nto strengthen programs at the Federal level and the State level that \ngive technical assistance and support for our small businesses to \nexport. It is very important to Senator Snowe. It is very important to \nSenator LeMieux from Florida. It is very important to Senator Klobuchar \nfrom Minnesota, who has been a great advocate for this provision for \nexports, and others as well. That is in the bill.\n  The final piece I am going to speak about--and then I will turn it \nover to the Senator from Oregon, who has worked so hard on this \nparticular proposal--is, in addition to the $12 billion in tax cuts \ntargeted for small businesses in America, in addition to the \nstrengthening of the SBA direct lending programs that are so important \nto so many colleagues on both sides of the aisle, there is a $30 \nbillion lending program to small businesses. It is not a government \nprogram but a private sector-based lending program, using the great and \npowerful network of our community bankers. Not our big banks, not the \nWall Street banks, not the hedge fund managers about whom we have heard \nso much--usually bad--but our own very familiar partners at the local \nlevel, our community banks.\n  This program would take $30 billion and basically pass it through to \nsmall businesses that are looking for capital. I have people come into \nmy office, representing hundreds of small businesses, saying: Senator, \nwe don't have the capital we need to expand, and we have been in \nbusiness X number of years. If I could just get a loan for $5 million \nor $10 million or get a capital line for $20 million, I could expand my \nbusiness.\n  If we do not find a way to get more money into the hands of small \nbusinesses--this is not a banking program. It is not like the old \nbailout program we did for banks. This is about a liftup, a helping \nhand to small businesses in America.\n  With that program, amazingly, it encourages more lending to small \nbusinesses, it is voluntary, and it actually makes money for the \nFederal Treasury. Again, it is voluntary. It is available to all small \nbanks in good standing to encourage them to use this capital to lend to \nsmall businesses.\n  I am going to turn it over to the Senator from Oregon. Before I do, I \nwould like to call attention to the many strong endorsements we have \ngotten, starting with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors:\n\n       The proposals--the Small Business Lending Fund and the \n     State Small Business Credit Initiative--will provide much-\n     needed access to capital support small business lending, the \n     lifeblood of our national economy.\n\n  That is Neil Milner, president and CEO of that organization.\n  I will read another one from John Arensmeyer, founder and CEO of \nSmall Business Majority:\n\n       The Small Business Lending Fund will create a program that \n     will provide up to $30 billion in capital to smaller banks to \n     spur lending to small businesses and help create new jobs. \n     There's no ``silver bullet'' that will put small business \n     owners out of the financial hole . . . but these initiatives \n     are an important piece of the overall plan to help revive our \n     struggling economy. . . .\n\n  Finally, from Michael Grant, president of the National Bankers \nAssociation:\n\n       The Obama Administration--continuing its efforts to lift \n     the country out of a two-year recession--has hit a home run \n     with its proposed $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund. \n     This is not a bailout to small business and medium-sized \n     banks; it is, instead, a true investment in a brighter future \n     for America's working class.\n\n  Again, I turn it over to the Senator from Oregon. I thank him very \nmuch for his help in shaping this proposal, expanding it, and promoting \nit. It promotes itself based on its merits. We are always happy to have \nhis voice enter this debate.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am delighted to partner with my \ncolleague from Louisiana. Senator Landrieu has been a passionate and \neffective advocate for small business across this country. She has \nworked incredibly hard to drive through this small business jobs \nlegislation, recognizing that the success of our economy is going to \nrise or fall on the success of our small businesses.\n  That is what brings us together tonight. We have come to talk about \nthe small business lending fund, which is an essential component of \nassisting our small businesses.\n  Small businesses employ one-half of our Nation's workforce. However, \nless than one-third of small businesses today are reporting their \ncredit needs are being met. Indeed, 59 percent now rely on credit cards \nto finance their daily operations. That is an increase of about 15 \npercent from where we were at the end of 2009.\n  I can tell my colleagues that at every townhall meeting I hold, folks \nstand to talk about how their credit lines have been cut or they have a \nbusiness opportunity for which they normally could easily get a loan \nfrom a longstanding banking partner, but they are not able to get that \nloan. Often, the reason the banks cannot make the loan is because they \nare at their leverage limit. There are legal limits for every dollar \nthey hold, how many can they lend out. If they are at that limit, they \ncannot make a new loan no matter how good the opportunity.\n  This is a losing situation because our community banks are right on \nMain Street. They see and know the opportunities. They understand the \ncapabilities of individual entrepreneurs and managers, so putting that \nexpertise to work is going to fuel job growth in this Nation. But we \ncan't put it to work if the banks are unable to lend or are at their \nleverage limit.\n\n  The Small Business Lending Fund will proceed to inject liquidity into \nour economy, and that is like oil into an engine--a job-creating \nengine--to the tune of as much as $300 billion in additional lending to \nsmall businesses on Main Street, and this will occur under the Small \nBusiness Lending Fund without any dollar of subsidy from the U.S. \ntaxpayer.\n  Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office has studied this proposal and \nhas recognized and reported that it will save $1 billion to taxpayers \nover the next 10 years, and that is just from the earnings of the \npayments that the banks will make back to the funds that are injected \nas additional capital into our community banks.\n  But think about this: Every small business that is able to see an \nopportunity because it can gain access to credit is also going to make \nmoney on that proposition. When they make money, they pay additional \ntaxes. CBO doesn't score the additional taxes, but recognize that in \naddition to the $1 billion of savings on interest payments, there will \nbe all the benefits that will flow from additional jobs--additional \ntaxes paid on the income from those jobs, additional profits to small \nbusiness, additional revenue from those profits. So the real return is \neven greater to the taxpayer.\n  But most importantly we are creating jobs, and that is a return that \nis hard to measure. When a family has a job, they can diminish their \nreliance on every other program. The most important foundation of a \nfamily is a good job, and that is what the Small Business Lending Fund \nis all about. It does indeed have prominent endorsements, as my \ncolleague mentioned: the Independent Community Bankers of America, \nrepresenting 5,000 community banks on Main Street which are having to \nbypass the opportunities they are seeing because they are at their \nleverage limit. Recognize that they can make loans, which is good for \nthem, good for small businesses, good for their communities and \ncertainly great for the families who get the additional jobs. Also, the \nNational Bankers Association, the National Small Business Association, \nthe National Association for the Self-Employed, the Small Business \nMajority, and so on and so forth.\n  Let me give one example from Oregon. John and his business partner \nhave owned a small retail store in Portland, OR, for over 25 years. It \nis a store I have visited often. Because of lackluster consumer \nspending, John has made a lot of sacrifices to keep that business \nafloat during this recession. He has had to reduce his staff, cut\n\n[[Page S5987]]\n\nthe hours the shop is open, and he and others have had to take pay \ncuts. But to add insult to injury, his bank threatened to drop his line \nof credit.\n  John has never missed a payment, never had a late payment, but in \nthis process of reducing exposure or reducing the required leverage \nlimits, banks are cutting lines of credit, and John's line was being \ncut. Finally, after negotiation, they agreed to renew his line of \ncredit every 90 days but every 90 days charge a fee, and on many \noccasions to raise the interest rate.\n  He has been looking for a new lender who will work with him and not \nagainst him, but that is hard to find in this economy, where lender \nafter lender is affected by the same constraints. This story is \nrepeated, different versions, hundreds of times throughout Oregon, and \nthousands of times throughout this Nation.\n  How would a Small Business Lending Fund work? Essentially, it \ncapitalizes the community banks, so with that additional capital they \ncan make more loans. If they get more loans out the door, then the \nrepayment rate--the dividends they would pay back to the taxpayers--is \nreduced to as low as 1 percent. If they do not get loans out the door, \nthe payments go up to as high as 7 percent. So there is a significant \nincentive to take these funds, after a bank is recapitalized, and get \nthem out the door.\n  That addresses several of the challenges folks have raised. There has \nbeen concern about banks that might hoard cash and say: Well, we will \nprepare in case some assets are devalued in the future or that banks \nmight say: We will wait until a better time, when everything is surging \nforward. Well, things won't surge forward unless we get lending out to \nsmall businesses. That is why this structure of incentives is critical.\n  The banks that will qualify are banks that have CAMELS ratings, which \nmeans capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, \nand sensitivity--or exposure to market risk. So a bank that is in deep \ntrouble isn't going to be in a position to take advantage of this. But \nbanks that are sound and healthy will, and therefore this makes it a \ngood investment, an investment that has significant return to the \ntaxpayer but, more importantly, a big return to our communities.\n  I would also note that this will go hand in hand with the program to \nmake additional grants to State-based small business programs. My \ncolleagues, Senators Levin and Warner, have been very involved in \nhelping to forge that program. These things go together. Community \nbanks on Main Street will see opportunities and State-based small \nbusiness programs will see opportunities. They probably will see the \nsame opportunities. These will work together to take us out of this \nrecession.\n  I wish to read a note that I received:\n\n       Dear Senator Merkley: Overall, I believe the majority of \n     financial support under TARP went to the large investment \n     banks, insurers, FNMA, FHLMC and other giant institutions on \n     Wall Street. It is now very important to revive the economy \n     that the government assist Main Street, which includes \n     community banks, if we are to have job creation. Jobs are \n     created by small business that bank at community banks.\n\n  And the writer goes on:\n\n       As a community banker in Oregon, I urge you to retain the \n     $30 billion small business lending fund. . . . Community \n     banks are well-positioned to leverage the SBLF and have \n     established relationships with small businesses in their \n     communities to get credit flowing quickly. Leveraging the $30 \n     billion funds with community banks would potentially support \n     many times that amount in loan volume to small businesses--as \n     much as $300 billion in additional lending.\n\n  The writer concludes:\n\n       Banks that increase their small business lending by certain \n     threshold percentages will pay reduced dividend costs, \n     ensuring that their incentive to lend matches their great \n     capacity to do so.\n       Thank you very much, Sincerely Tom.\n\n  That was a letter from Tom of M Street Bank.\n  I thank the many colleagues who have put themselves behind this idea \nand supported it. An earlier rendition of this idea was called \n``Banking on our Communities'' and had support from Senators Carper, \nHagan, Kerry, Levin, Pryor, Stabenow, and Mark Udall, and I wanted to \nmention that they have been sponsors of that legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand for small businesses, stand to provide \na solution to the problem of liquidity and access to loans that is \nplaguing our small businesses, stand to help not just your community \nbanks but your community businesses and your families who will benefit \nfrom the jobs that it will create.\n  I thank my colleague for her passionate and effective leadership on \nthis particular issue and for her leadership on our Small Business \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, and let me add a \nfew words to that wonderful explanation. Again, what we are on the \nfloor talking about here--the jobs 3 bill, the small business bill--is \na lending program for small business. This is not a bank bailout. It is \nnot a big bank bailout. It is not a medium-sized bank bailout, It is \nnot a small-sized bank bailout. It is not for banks. It is for small \nbusinesses.\n  We are using healthy banks, not troubled banks, as a conduit to reach \nsmall businesses so they do not have to rely on high rates through a \ncredit card company that is impersonal and not interested in their \nbusiness but just the bottom line. They do not have the home equity \nthat they used to have, as you know, either in Delaware or Louisiana or \nOregon or Texas.\n  I think in America we want to encourage healthy relationships between \nour small businesses and our local banks. Only small healthy banks can \nparticipate in this voluntary program on behalf of small businesses in \ntheir communities. Ninety percent of community banks are less than $1 \nbillion, and you can only participate in the Small Business Lending \nProgram if you are below $10 billion. So none of the big banks can even \nqualify for this.\n  As the Senator from Oregon said, there is not going to be an end to \nthis recession any time soon if we don't, in this Chamber, figure out a \nway to get low-cost capital into the hands of small business. We don't \nhave many choices. We could issue some more credit cards to them and \nlet them pay 15, 16, 17, 24 percent. We can ask them to go back and get \nequity out of their homes, which has all but dried up, and not through \nany fault of their own, or we could give direct lending through the \nSmall Business Administration.\n  Some people have trouble with the Federal Government acting as a \ndirect lender, and I can understand that. It is not what we do. We are \nnot a bank. But there are banks out there--there are 8,000 community \nbanks--many of which are healthy, and with a little bit more capital \nand a partnership with the Federal Government, they could turn around \nand lend money to businesses that desperately need it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of small business organizations I received from the Small \nbusiness Access to Credit Coalition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am going to read a few of these \norganizations into the Record at this time. This is a very market-\nbased, private-sector approach to solving this problem, and that is why \nthe American Apparel & Footwear Association, the American Hotel & \nLodging Association, the American International Automobile Dealers \nAssociation, the Associated Builders & Contractors, Heating, \nAirconditioning & Refrigeration Distributers International, and we said \nthe Independent Community Banks of America, but how about the \nIndependent Electrical Contractors, the International Council of \nShopping Centers, the Main Street Alliance, the National Association of \nWomen Business Owners--Los Angeles, and I could go on and on and on.\n  There are hundreds of organizations that support this $300 billion \nSmall Business Lending Fund. Again, it leverages up to $300 billion of \npotential loans to small businesses right here in America to create the \njobs we need to move us out and past this recession to higher ground \nand happier times. We can't wait to get there, but we are not going to \nget there by peddling in place. We have to move forward.\n  This is a bold proposal, but it is very much based on common sense. \nIt is easy to understand, with clear parameters for understanding it. \nIt is using the great asset of community banks to\n\n[[Page S5988]]\n\nget low-cost capital into the hands of small businesses--shoe stores, \nretailers, cleaners, grocery stores--that can then start the hiring of \none or two or three extra people. All of that is going to add up to \nmore consumer demand. As people have paychecks, they can go spend them, \nincreasing demand.\n  This is economics 101. It is very simple. It is bold, it is simple, \nand I believe it will work. It is voluntary. It is for healthy banks \nonly--for community banks only. It has nothing to do with Wall Street, \nhedge funds or bailouts. It has everything to do with job creation on \nMain Street in America, and more than 100 small business organizations \nare supporting this initiative.\n  I thank the Members of the Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, \nwho have been very supportive. We are grateful for the wonderful \ntestimony and endorsements we have received from these very powerful \norganizations and we look forward, after we have the vote on \nunemployment sometime tomorrow, to getting back to the business of \nending this recession. We have all had about as much of it as we can \ntake.\n  We want to move to stronger times, to happier times. We are only \ngoing to do that by giving small business substantial and targeted tax \ncuts and a lending program that they can work for them and the \nbusinesses they want to serve and service every day on Main Streets \nthroughout America.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               Small Business Access to Credit Coalition\n\n                          (February 17, 2010)\n\n       Dear Senator: Access to credit is a critical issue facing \n     small businesses today. The undersigned organizations, \n     representing millions of small business owners in every \n     industry sector, were very disappointed to learn that only \n     one provision related to expanding small business access to \n     credit was included in the draft legislation offered by \n     Senators Baucus and Grassley, the ``Hiring Incentives to \n     Restore Employment Act.'' Furthermore, none of the provisions \n     aimed at improving the Small Business Administration (SBA) \n     lending programs are currently being considered in Majority \n     Leader Reid's latest proposal. We are concerned that if the \n     Senate fails to listen to the needs of small businesses and \n     address the credit crisis, a tremendous opportunity to help \n     create new, sustainable jobs in 2010 and beyond will be lost.\n       We urge your support for appropriations to extend the SBA \n     loan provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \n     (ARRA) through the end of December 2010. The depletion of \n     funds last fall is proof that the SBA programs were, and \n     continue to be, critically important for our nation's \n     creditworthy entrepreneurs. An additional $354 million in \n     appropriations is needed to fund the extension of the higher \n     guaranty percentages and waiver of borrower fees for the \n     balance of the fiscal year.\n       Additionally, we urge your support for an increase in the \n     maximum loan size and the maximum guaranteed portion of SBA \n     loans. Senators Landrieu and Snowe have introduced \n     legislation that would increase the maximum size of SBA 7(a) \n     and 504 loans from $2 million to $5 million. This legislation \n     would also provide a commensurate increase in the statutory \n     maximum guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans. Moreover, the \n     CBO has determined that their legislation, S. 2869, will have \n     no impact on spending or revenue. These levels are \n     recommended by the Administration, have bi-partisan support \n     and we urge your support as well.\n       By including these provisions in upcoming legislation aimed \n     at spurring new job creation, there is the potential to \n     leverage an additional $16 billion in SBA lending in 2010. \n     According to Federal Highway Administration data, federal \n     spending on highway programs can generate about 34,100 jobs \n     for every $1 billion spent. Small businesses can generate the \n     same rate of job creation, except that small businesses have \n     the ability to create new, sustainable jobs in every local \n     community. Therefore, by acting on these recommendations, the \n     Senate will help increase small business lending that will \n     result in over 545,000 sustainable new jobs in the next year.\n       We urge you to act quickly so that we can continue to \n     realize the SBA lending momentum we saw in 2009. Small \n     businesses cannot be the engine of our economy if they \n     continue to face unrelentingly tight credit markets. The \n     Senate must include these important provisions in the job \n     creation bills currently pending in order to restart the flow \n     of credit to America's small businesses or else these \n     entrepreneurs will be left to sit on the sidelines.\n           Respectfully,\n         American Apparel & Footwear Association; American Bankers \n           Association; American Foundry Society--California \n           Chapter; American Hotel & Lodging Association; American \n           International Automobile Dealers \n     Association; Associated Builders & Contractors; California \n     Association for Micro Enterprise Opportunity; California \n     Association of Competitive Telecommunications Companies; \n     California Cast Metals Association; California Chapter of \n     the American Fence Contractors Association; California \n     Employers Association; California Fence Contractors \n     Association; California Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; \n     California Metals Coalition; California Public Arts \n     Association, Inc.; Council of Smaller Enterprises (Ohio); \n     Engineering Contractors Association; Entrepreneurs \n     Organization Los Angeles; Fashion Accessories Shippers \n     Association; Flasher/Barricade Association; Golden Gate \n     Restaurant Association; Greater Providence (RI) Chamber of \n     Commerce; Heating, Air Conditioning & Refrigeration \n     Distributors International; Independent Community Bankers \n     of America; Independent Electrical Contractors; \n     Independent Waste Oil Collectors and Transporters; \n     International Council of Shopping Centers; International \n     Franchise Association; Main Street Alliance; Marin \n     Builders' Association; Marine Retailers Association of \n     America; Monterey County Business Council; Napa Chamber of \n     Commerce; National Association for the Self-Employed; \n     National Association of Development Companies; National \n     Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders; National \n     Association of Manufacturers; National Association of \n     Women Business Owners--Inland Empire; National Association \n     of Women Business Owners--Los Angeles; National Automobile \n     Dealers Association; National Cooperative Business \n     Association; National Council of Chain Restaurants; \n     National Council of Textile Organizations; National \n     Federation of Filipino American Associations; National Gay \n     & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce; National Marine \n     Manufacturers Association; National Ready Mixed Concrete \n     Association; National Restaurant Association; National \n     Small Business Association; North American Die Casting \n     Association--California Chapter; North Carolina Bankers \n     Association; Northern Rhode Island Chamber of Commerce; \n     NPES--The Association for Suppliers of Printing, \n     Publishing and Converting Technologies Oakland \n     Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce; Oregon Small Business \n     for Responsible Leadership; Peninsula Builders Exchange of \n     California; Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors of \n     California; Recreation Vehicle Industry Association; \n     Recreational Vehicle Dealers Association; Rhode Island \n     Small Business Summit Committee; Sacramento Asian Chamber \n     of Commerce; San Francisco Builders Exchange; San \n     Francisco Chamber of Commerce; San Francisco Small \n     Business Advocates; San Francisco Small Business Network; \n     Small Business Association of Michigan (SBAM); Small \n     Business Association of New England (SBANE); Small \n     Business California; Small Business Majority; Small \n     Manufacturers Association of California; South Carolina \n     Small Business Chamber; Spa and Pool Industry Education \n     Council of California; SPI: The Plastics Industry Trade \n     Association; The Financial Services Roundtable; The \n     Hosiery Association; Travel Goods Association; Tree Care \n     Industry Association; Urban Solutions--San Francisco; U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce; U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.

Mr. President, on April 13, 2010, the Impeachment \nTrial Committee on the Articles of Impeachment Against Judge G. Thomas \nPorteous, Jr., adopted two rules to govern aspects of its pretrial \nproceedings. On July 14, 2010, the committee adopted two additional \nrules.\n  The first rule, adopted pursuant to rule 26.7(a)(1) of the Standing \nRules of the Senate, establishes seven members as the committee quorum. \nIn the interest of fairness and continuity, and consistent with prior \nimpeachment trials, the committee adopted this rule and established a \n``natural'' quorum of at least seven of its members to receive evidence \nand conduct the business of the committee.\n  The second rule delegates the authority of the committee to the \nchairman\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\nand vice chairman to conduct the daily operations of the committee. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, hiring staff, issuing \nadministrative orders, ensuring compliance with those orders, \ncommunicating with counsel for the parties, determining a course of \nproceeding, and for any other purposes necessary for the committee to \ndischarge its responsibilities and address any other administrative or \nprocedural matters.\n  The third rule delegates to the chairman, in consultation with the \nvice chairman, the committee's authority to issue subpoenas for \nwitnesses called to testify or produce documents during all committee \nproceedings. Senate impeachment rule XI grants to the Impeachment Trial \nCommittee the power granted by Senate impeachment rule VI to the Senate \n``to compel the attendance of witnesses.''\n  The fourth rule, adopted pursuant to rule 26.7(a)(2) of the Standing \nRules of the Senate, reduces to one member the committee quorum for \ntaking sworn pretrial testimony. Judge Porteous has asked to examine \ncertain witnesses in advance of the committee's evidentiary hearings, \nwhich will begin on September 13, 2010. Although the pretrial \nexamination of witnesses in a Senate impeachment trial remains rare, \nthe committee has concluded that it should, in the circumstances of the \npresent impeachment, permit a limited number of them. The rule \nimplements the committee's determination that pretrial examinations may \nproceed before a quorum of one member. As with prior impeachment \nproceedings, and pursuant to the rules of this committee, the \nevidentiary hearings will take place in the presence of a natural \nquorum of at least 7 of its 12 members.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those rules printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                    RULE 1--DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY\n\n       The Chairman and Vice Chairman are delegated the authority \n     to communicate as necessary with House counsel and counsel to \n     Judge Porteous, for the purpose of determining a course of \n     proceeding, pretrial and trial scheduling, and for any other \n     purposes necessary for the Committee to discharge its \n     responsibilities. The Chairman and Vice Chairman are further \n     delegated the authority to address any other administrative \n     or procedural matters necessary for the Committee to \n     discharge its responsibilities.\n\n\n                 RULE 2--QUORUM FOR RECEIVING EVIDENCE\n\n       A natural number of seven members shall constitute a quorum \n     for the purpose of receiving evidence.\n\n\n                           RULE 3--SUBPOENAS\n\n       The Chairman and Vice Chairman are delegated the authority \n     to issue subpoenas on behalf of the Committee.\n\n\n          RULE 4--QUORUM FOR THE TAKING OF PRETRIAL TESTIMONY\n\n       One member shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of a \n     pretrial examination of a witness at which sworn testimony is \n     heard and evidence taken.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/19/senate-section/article/S5989-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Captain David A. Wisniewski\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a brave and \npatriotic son of Iowa who gave his life for his country, CPT David \nAnthony Wisniewski. He graduated from Woodbury Central High School in \nMoville, IA, before attending the Air Force Academy. It had been his \ndream to be an Air Force pilot since visiting Offutt Air Force Base as \na young child and he died doing what he loved. By all accounts, David \nWisniewski was a remarkable man and his numerous accomplishments \ninclude the saving of many lives during his several tours of duty in \nsupport of the global war on terrorism. In reference to the reason for \nhis service, I understand that he would end letters to his parents with \nthe reminder that, ``I do this so you can sleep safe at night.'' That \nis an excellent reminder for all of us to never take for granted the \ntremendous cost of our freedom. I find that words fail me in trying to \ndescribe the debt of gratitude we owe to the courageous and selfless \nAmericans like Captain Wisniewski. We can never begin to repay the \ndebt, but we can honor it by honoring David's memory and by fully \nappreciating our way of life and the sacrifices made to preserve it. Of \ncourse, his loss will be felt very deeply by his parents, Chet and \nBeverly Wisniewski, and all his family and friends. My prayers go out \nto them in this difficult time. They are no doubt very proud of their \nson, and all Iowans can be proud to call him one of our own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/19/senate-section/article/S5989-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LENA ARCHULETA\n\n Mr. BENNET.

Lena represents the \ntrue spirit of commitment to the greater good.

She was awarded a scholarship at \nthe University of Denver where she studied Spanish and education and \nlater received a master's in library science. In 1951, she joined the \nDenver Public Schools' Department of Library Services were she \nmaintained her belief that a high-quality education should be \naccessible to all students regardless of gender, race, or nationality. \nThis belief led Lena to work with the Denver Public Schools' Federal \nProject to promote and jumpstart programs for bilingual education. In \n1974, she used her vast experience in the education field to become the \nprincipal at Fairview Elementary and the first Hispanic principal in \nDenver public schools' history. In addition to this honor, she later \nbecame the first Hispanic woman appointed to a central administrative \nposition. Mrs. Archuleta dedicated and accumulated 17 years to New \nMexico and Colorado classrooms, as well as 14 years as a school \nadministrator.\n  While I am pleased to have the honor of recognizing Mrs. Archuleta \nand her great accomplishments, this is not the first time her \ndedication and commitment to serving others has been recognized and I \ndoubt that it will be the last. In 1963 the Latin American Educational \nFoundation appointed her to be the first woman to serve as president of \nits board of directors. In 1986, she was inducted into the Colorado \nWomen's Hall of Fame as the first Hispanic inductee. In addition to \nthese and other honors, both regional and national, Denver's Lena \nLovato Archuleta Elementary School was named after her in 2002. This \nwas perhaps, the most fitting of all of her honors as this elementary \nschool nurtures the same environment of discovery and lifelong learning \nthat Mrs. Archuleta herself created and passed along to fellow \neducators, students, and community members. Truly representative of her \nspirit and life's work, Mrs. Archuleta didn't merely accept the honor, \nshe went on to raise $20,000 for the school's library.\n  Mrs. Lena Archuleta continues to recognize and nurture the skills of \nher students and those around her. Through continued volunteer work \nwith organizations such as the AARP in Colorado, she inspires others to \nachieve their goals using entrepreneurship, dedication, and compassion. \nWorking in schools, Lena has inspired many of us through her example. \nShe has shown Coloradans that with humility, devotion, and empathy we \ncan improve the lives of others. For these reasons, today, we recognize \nMrs. Lena Archuleta.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/19/senate-section/article/S5989-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5989-S5990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO THE REVEREND HARRY BLAKE\n\n   Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the career \nof Reverend Harry Blake, pastor of Mount Canaan Baptist Church of \nShreveport, LA. After 15 years as the president of the Louisiana \nMissionary Baptist State Convention, Reverend Blake is retiring. He has \nbeen a friend and outstanding leader for many years.\n  Pastor of Mount Canaan Baptist Church for almost 44 years, Reverend \nBlake has also served in various capacities for a number of local and \nnational organizations. Most recently, he was appointed vice president \nfor the Southwest Region of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., \nhaving previously served as general secretary. He has also held \nprominent roles in the Thirteenth District Baptist Association, and \nwithin the Louisiana Baptist State Convention, he has served on the \nCongress of Christian Education and the Evangelical Board.\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\n  Locally, he is involved with the Louisiana Recovery Authority Board \nand numerous community development initiatives, such as Grace Project \nIncorporated, Project UpLift, Mount Canaan Day Care Center, and \nShreveport-Bossier Community Renewal. Additionally, he has served as \npresident of the Board of Directors for both Canaan Village Apartments \nand Canaan Towers, dedicating himself to serving low-income, elderly, \nand handicapped housing needs.\n  In addition to these myriad roles in the local, State, and national \ncommunities, Reverend Blake has graciously played the role of educator, \nhaving lectured at Morehouse School of Divinity, Arkansas Baptist \nCollege, Leland College, Wiley College, Bishop College, L.K. Williams \nMinisters Institute, American Baptist College, Birmingham Bible \nCollege, United Theological Seminary, and Union Theological Seminary. \nMany have been inspired by his counsel and leadership for many years.\n  Reverend Blake's innovations within his own church should also be \ncommended. By including various ministries as well as tutoring programs \nat Mount Canaan Baptist Church, Reverend Blake has developed a model \nprayer service which has been emulated throughout the country.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Reverend Blake has played the \nrole of dedicated husband, father, and grandfather, raising his four \nchildren, Elizabeth, Harry II, Rodney, and Monica, with his wife Norma \nJean and taking an active role in the lives of his 15 grandchildren.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Reverend Harry Blake \non his distinguished 15 years of service to the Louisiana Missionary \nBaptist State Convention and in wishing him the best for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/19/senate-section/article/S5990-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING NICK BACON\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I honor a true Arkansas and \nAmerican hero, 1SG Nick Bacon, who passed away this weekend. First \nSergeant Bacon, 64, was a Medal of Honor recipient and former director \nof the Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs. He served in the U.S. \nArmy from 1963 to 1984 and was awarded the Medal of Honor for his \nactions during a 1968 battle in Vietnam, along with countless awards \nand decorations including two Distinguished Service Crosses, the Legion \nof Merit, the Combat Infantry Badge, the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry, \nthe Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.\n  With his passing, Arkansas has lost one of its finest citizens, and \nhis death is a tremendous loss to our State. First Sergeant Bacon \nserved our State and Nation honorably, fighting valiantly in Vietnam. \nHe took command of two platoons after the leaders of each were wounded \nduring a battle near Tam Ky, Vietnam, on Aug. 26, 1968. Using grenades, \nhe destroyed an enemy bunker before singlehandedly killing an enemy gun \ncrew and disabling an antitank weapon. He then helped rescue several \nwounded and trapped soldiers.\n  After 20 years of military service, he returned to Arkansas to serve \nhis fellow veterans as the director of Veterans Affairs for the State \nfrom 1993 through 2005. It was an honor to be able to work with him \nserving the State of Arkansas. As director of the Arkansas Department \nof Veterans Affairs, he helped establish the Arkansas State Veterans \nCemetery and the Arkansas Veterans Coalition. He was also active in \nestablishing a Veterans Cemetery Beautification Program. In addition, \nFirst Sergeant Bacon served as Commander, American Legion Post 1, \nLittle Rock, after retiring as the director of the Arkansas Department \nof Veterans Affairs.\n  First Sergeant Bacon was a true ``Arkansas son,'' born Nov. 25, 1945, \nin Caraway in northeast Arkansas. He moved with his family as a child \nto Arizona, where he joined the Army, but he returned to Arkansas in \n1990 and most recently lived in Rose Bud. First Sergeant Bacon's legacy \nwill live on through projects such as the Nick Bacon VFW Special \nVeterans Scholarship for selected children and grandchildren of \nveterans who have a 60-percent or more service-connected disability.\n  Along with all Arkansans, I am grateful for First Sergeant Bacon's \nservice and for the service and sacrifice of all of our military \nservicemembers and their families. These men and women have shown \ntremendous courage and perseverance through the most difficult of \ntimes. As neighbors, as Arkansans, and as Americans, it is incumbent \nupon us to do everything we can to honor their service and to provide \nfor them and their families, not only when they are in harm's way but \nalso when they return home. It is the least we can do for those whom we \nowe so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/19/senate-section/article/S5990-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/19/senate-section/article/S5990-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/19/senate-section/article/S5990-4", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO THE FORMER LIBERIAN REGIME OF CHARLES TAYLOR AND ON \nTHE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY BLOCKING PROPERTY OF CERTAIN \n PERSONS AND PROHIBITING THE IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN GOODS FROM LIBERIA \n THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13348 ON JULY 22, 2004--PM 64\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 3609. A bill to extend the temporary authority for performance of \nmedical disability examinations by contract physicians for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that \nwould extend the Department of Veterans Affairs' authority to use \ncontract physicians to perform medical disability examinations.\n  The VA continues to struggle to compensate disabled veterans quickly \nand accurately. While the Administration and Congress work to produce \nlong-term, systemic solutions to this challenge, the reality is that we \nalso need short-term solutions to most effectively leverage available \nresources. One such tool, which has helped VA better serve veterans, is \nthe use of contract physicians for medical disability examinations.\n  In order to determine the type and severity of disabilities of \nveterans filing for VA compensation or pension benefits, VA often \nrequires thorough medical disability examinations. Because these \nexaminations form the basis of disability ratings, their accurate and \ntimely completion is essential. In recent years, the demand for medical \ndisability examinations has increased beyond the number of requests \nthat VA's in-house system was designed to accommodate. This rise in \ndemand is due to an increase in the complexity of disability claims, a \nrise in the number of disabilities claimed by veterans, and changes in \neligibility requirements for disability benefits.\n  In 1996, in Public Law 104-275, the Veterans' Benefits Improvements \nAct of 1996, VA was authorized to carry out a pilot program of contract \ndisability examinations through ten VA regional offices using amounts \navailable for payment of compensation and pensions. During the initial \npilot program,\n\n[[Page S5995]]\n\none contractor performed all contract examinations at the ten selected \nregional offices. The pilot was deemed a success, with general \nsatisfaction reported from all stakeholders.\n  Subsequently, in 2003, in Public Law 108-183, the Veterans Benefits \nAct of 2003, VA was given additional, time-limited authority to \ncontract for disability examinations using other appropriated funds. \nThat initial authority was extended until December 31, 2010, by Public \nLaw 110-389, the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008. VA \ncontinues to report high demand for compensation and pension \nexaminations, and satisfaction with the contracted exams.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that will allow the \nextension of VA's authority to utilize qualified non-VA doctors for two \nadditional years, until December 31, 2012.\n  Should we not authorize a temporary extension of VA's authority to \nuse contract physicians, it will further contribute to the Department's \npending claims inventory, which is not a result any of us would want \nfor ill and injured veterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3609\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR PERFORMANCE OF MEDICAL \n                   DISABILITY EXAMINATIONS BY CONTRACT PHYSICIANS.\n\n       Section 704(c) of the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (Public \n     Law 108-183; 38 U.S.C. 5101 note) is amended by striking \n     ``December 31, 2010'' and inserting ``December 31, 2012''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 3610. A bill to require a study on spectrum occupancy and use; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Kerry, to \nintroduce comprehensive spectrum reform legislation to modernize our \nNation's radio spectrum planning, management, and coordination \nactivities. Taking this corrective action will allow us to meet the \nfuture telecommunications needs of all spectrum users. For consumers, \nthese fixes will lead to additional choices, greater innovation, lower \nprices, and more reliable services.\n  Over the past year, there has been growing concern about a looming \nradio spectrum crisis. It is not without reason--there has been an \nexplosion of growth and innovation with spectrum-based services over \nthe past decade. In particular, the cellular industry has been a \nprominent driver of this expansion. Currently, there are more than 276 \nmillion wireless subscribers in the U.S., and American consumers use \nmore than 6.4 billion minutes of air time per day.\n  While the foundation for wireless services has been voice \ncommunication, more subscribers are utilizing it for broadband. \nAccording to the Pew Research Center, 56 percent of adult Americans \nhave accessed the Internet via a wireless device. ABI Research \nforecasts there will be 150 million mobile broadband subscribers by \n2014--a 2,900 percent increase from 2007. Spectrum is so important the \nFederal Communications Commission, FCC, has made it a major focal point \nof its National Broadband Plan in order to meet the growing broadband \ndemands of consumers and businesses alike.\n  There are constraints however--spectrum is a finite resource--and we \ncannot manufacture new spectrum. Making matters worse, the government's \ncurrent spectrum management framework is inefficient and has not kept \nup with technological advancements. As evidence, the Government \nAccountability Office, in a series of reports, concluded ``the current \nstructure and management of spectrum use in the U.S. does not encourage \nthe development and use of some spectrum efficient technologies.''\n  The legislation we introduce today fixes the fundamental deficiencies \nthat exist in our policy and spectrum management and promotes efforts \nto improve spectrum efficiency. Specifically, the Spectrum Measurement \nand Policy Reform Act tasks the FCC and the National Telecommunications \nand Information Administration, NTIA, to perform much needed spectrum \nmeasurements to determine actual usage and occupancy rates. This data \nwill assist policymakers and the public in making informed decisions \nabout future spectrum uses. Also required is a cost-benefit analysis of \nspectrum relocation opportunities to move certain incumbent users and \nservices to more efficient spectrum bands. Many legacy wireless \nservices could employ newer technologies to provide more efficient use \nof spectrum.\n  In addition, my bill requires greater collaboration between the FCC \nand NTIA on spectrum policy and management related issues, \nimplementation of spectrum sharing and reuse programs, as well as more \nmarket-based incentives to promote efficient spectrum use. It also sets \na deadline for the creation of the National Strategic Spectrum Plan, \nwhich will provide a long-term vision for domestic spectrum use and \nstrategies to meet those needs. While the National Broadband Plan \ntouches on several of these areas, this legislation will provide \ngreater assistance in developing a 21st Century comprehensive spectrum \npolicy necessary to meet the future spectrum needs of all users.\n  It should be noted that the Spectrum Measurement and Policy Reform \nAct is intended to complement the National Broadband Plan and the \nrecently announced Presidential Memorandum in promoting more efficient \nuse of spectrum and ensuring that the proper framework is in place to \nmeet America's future telecommunications needs. But it also encourages \ngreater focus on other areas outside the Plan or Memorandum by \npromoting technological innovation and more robust spectrum management. \nFor example, a technology known as femtocell, that can increase \ncapacity by offloading wireless traffic onto broadband wireline \nnetworks, wasn't mentioned once in the National Broadband Plan even \nthough Cisco's Virtual Network Index indicated that at least 23 percent \nof smartphone traffic could be offloaded onto fixed wireline networks \nby 2014 through femotcells and dual-mode phones. These technologies and \nspectrum management practices such as spectrum sharing and reuse need \nto be fully explored and this legislation will assist in doing that.\n  Senator Kerry and I envision this legislation as a starting point to \ninitiate an ongoing discussion about how to make the best use of this \nnational asset and, in turn, encourage innovation and unleash \nopportunity. We look forward to continuing to work with all \nstakeholders as this bill advances.\n  Our Nation's competitiveness, economy, and national security demand \nthat we allocate the necessary attention to this policy shortcoming--it \nis the only way we will be able to avert a looming spectrum crisis and \ncontinue to realize the boundless benefits of spectrum-based services. \nThat is why I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join Senator Kerry \nand me in supporting this critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 3612. A bill to amend the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National \nHistorical Park Establishment Act to expand the boundary of the Marsh-\nBillings-Rockefeller National Historical Park in the State of Vermont, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague and \ngood friend Senator Sanders to introduce the boundary expansion of the \nMarsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park in the State of \nVermont. This amendment will add 159 acres and several historic \nfarmstead structures to the 555-acre National Park.\n  This park is an extraordinary place in Vermont where a unique and \nenduring connection has been forged between the land and its \ninhabitants. The picturesque and historic landscape of the Marsh-\nBillings-Rockefeller National Historical Park is nestled in the rolling \nhills near Woodstock, in Vermont's Windsor County. It is a small park \nwith the powerful mission of recognizing and continuing the legacy of \nthree generations of stewardship thought, and stewardship in action. \nThe successive owners of this estate,\n\n[[Page S5996]]\n\nfor whom the park is named, were each in their own right giants of \nconservation ideas and practice. This legislation will expand the \npark's land area to help our generation and future generations to \nbetter fulfill and carry forward its mission.\n  The boyhood home of George Perkins Marsh, one of America's first \nconservationists, and later the home of Frederick Billings, the \nproperty was given to the American people by its most recent owners, \nLaurance S. and Mary F. Rockefeller. The park was created by an Act of \nCongress and signed into law by President George Bush on August 26, \n1992. It is a living symbol of America's conservation ethic. The Marsh-\nBillings-Rockefeller National Historic Park tells a story of \nconservation history and the evolving nature of land stewardship in \nAmerica.\n  The park puts the idea of conservation stewardship into a modern \ncontext, interpreting the idea of place and the ways in which people \ncan balance natural resource conservation with the requirements of our \n21st Century world. It is also a repository for the histories of these \nthree American families. Visitors can tour the mansion and gardens and \nlearn more about conservation by hiking in the sustainably managed \nforest, and they can visit the land stewardship exhibit at the Carriage \nBarn Visitor Center. The park operates in partnership with The \nWoodstock Foundation and the adjacent Billings Farm and Museum--a \nworking dairy farm and a museum of agricultural and rural life that \noffers visitors the opportunity to experience both farm and forest \nlandscapes, in side-by-side settings.\n  This new legislation would expand the boundaries of the park to \nincorporate the neighboring King Farm. The land and structures of this \nhistoric Woodstock farm will allow the National Park Service to expand \nthe scope and delivery of its telling of the conservation story. The \nfarm will provide a setting for programs in sustainable agriculture and \na venue for community groups and others to undertake related projects \nand educational opportunities activities that have been limited in the \npast by the sensitivity of the historic structures constituting the \nRockefeller estate. Model forestry activities and the trail network \nwill also be enhanced through this boundary expansion.\n  This legislation also formally establishes the Conservation Studies \nInstitute within the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical \nPark. The Institute has evolved within the National Park Service over \nthe past decade to enhance leadership in conservation throughout the \nNational Park Service and to facilitate stewardship partnerships in \nlocal communities. It is through these partnerships that the Institute \ninspires collaborative conservation to engage communities and help them \nbuild their vision for the future. The park, the Institute and their \nVermont setting are a great fit and a valuable setting in which to \noffer prototypes for conservation and sustainable practices on so many \nfronts.\n  A Vermont author and professor, John Elder, said this at the park's \ndedication on June 5th 1998:\n\n       There is a mandate to invent an entirely new kind of park. \n     It must be one where the human stories and the natural \n     history are intertwined; where the relatively small acreage \n     serves as an educational resource for the entire National \n     Park Service and a seedbed for American environmental \n     thought; and where the legacy of American conservation and \n     its future enter into dialogue, generating a new \n     environmental paradigm for our day.\n\n  This is a unique opportunity to enhance the mission of the Marsh-\nBillings-Rockefeller National Historical Park and its service to the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/19/senate-section/article/S5996-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 585--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF AUGUST 2 THROUGH AUGUST \n 8, 2010, AS ``NATIONAL CONVENIENT CARE CLINIC WEEK,'' AND SUPPORTING \n THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF RAISING AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR ACCESSIBLE \n AND COST-EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE OPTIONS TO COMPLEMENT THE TRADITIONAL \n                           HEALTH CARE MODEL\n\n  Mr. INOUYE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 585\n\n       Whereas convenient care clinics are health care facilities \n     located in high-traffic retail outlets that provide \n     affordable and accessible care to patients who might \n     otherwise be delayed or unable to schedule an appointment \n     with a traditional primary care provider;\n       Whereas millions of people in the United States do not have \n     a primary care provider, and there is a worsening primary \n     care shortage that will prevent many people from obtaining 1 \n     in the future;\n       Whereas convenient care clinics have provided an accessible \n     alternative for more than 15,000,000 people in the United \n     States since the first clinic opened in 2000, continue to \n     expand rapidly, and as of June 2010 consist of approximately \n     1,100 clinics in 35 States;\n       Whereas convenient care clinics follow rigid industry-wide \n     quality of care and safety standards;\n       Whereas convenient care clinics are staffed by highly \n     qualified health care providers, including advanced practice \n     nurses, physician assistants, and physicians;\n       Whereas convenient care clinicians all have advanced \n     education in providing quality health care for common \n     episodic ailments including cold and flu, skin irritation, \n     and muscle strains or sprains, and can also provide \n     immunizations, physicals, and preventive health screening;\n       Whereas convenient care clinics are proven to be a cost-\n     effective alternative to similar treatment obtained in \n     physician offices, urgent care, or emergency departments; and\n       Whereas convenient care clinics complement traditional \n     medical service providers by providing extended weekday and \n     weekend hours without the need for an appointment, short wait \n     times, and visits that generally last only 15 to 20 minutes: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of August 2 through August 8, 2010 \n     as ``National Convenient Care Clinic Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Convenient \n     Care Clinic Week to raise awareness of the need for \n     accessible and cost-effective health care options to \n     complement the traditional health care model;\n       (3) recognizes the obstacles many people in the United \n     States face in accessing the traditional medical home model \n     of health care;\n       (4) encourages the use of convenient care clinics as a \n     complimentary alternative to the medical home model of health \n     care; and\n       (5) calls on the States to support the establishment of \n     convenient care clinics so that more people in the United \n     States will have access to the cost-effective and necessary \n     emergent and preventive services provided in the clinics.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize all of the \nproviders who work in retail-based Convenient Care Clinics in a \nResolution to designate August 2 through August 8, 2010, as National \nConvenient Care Clinic Week. National Convenient Care Clinic Week will \nprovide a national platform from which to promote the pivotal services \noffered by the more than 1,100 retail-based convenient care clinics in \nthe United States.\n  Today, thousands of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and \nphysicians provide care in convenient care clinics. At a time when \nAmericans are more and more challenged by the inaccessibility and high \ncosts of health care, convenient care offers a vital high-quality \nprimary care alternative.\n  This resolution will help pave the way for this effort. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this tribute to Convenient Care \nClinics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/19/senate-section/article/S5996-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5996-S5997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4484.
