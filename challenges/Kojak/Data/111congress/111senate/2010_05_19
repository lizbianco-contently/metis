Mr. President, we worked late last night trying to take \ncare of some of the final discussion on this legislation before cloture \ntoday. The reason we have an hour of morning business is to give \nSenators some time to say whatever they want to say as well as to give \nSenators time to look at the proposed consent agreement that was \narrived at last night between the majority and the minority. I hope \nSenators will allow this agreement to go forward. If people look at \nwhat is in it, I think there is a series of amendments that will be \naccepted by the two managers of the bill. If someone doesn't like \nsomething in the consent agreement, be sure and talk to the two \nmanagers. It would be good to get some of these matters out of the way. \nWe have had a number of Senators who have waited a long period of time \nto have their matters resolved. For example, Senator Harkin last night. \nWe were able to arrive at a conclusion of an amendment that he felt was \nappropriate. It is an amendment I support and others support it. I just \nthink it wouldn't be--for lack of a better word--fair to not let some \nof these amendments go forward, but Senators have the right to make \nwhatever decision they feel is appropriate.\n  As far as the cloture vote, I don't think anyone can criticize our \nhaving taken time on this legislation. There are a number of amendments \nthe proponents of which worked to perfect the language on and it took a \nwhile for them to do that. There comes a time, however, when we have to \nput this thing to rest. We have been on this bill for a month. As of \ntomorrow, it will be 1 month. We have another step we have to go \nthrough and that is conference. People have all kinds of opportunities \nthere to make whatever decisions they think are appropriate to make \nthis bill better. It gives both sides all the adequate protection they \nwant when the bill comes back in its conference form.\n  I hope we can move forward. We have a few hours before cloture. I \nhope cloture will be invoked. If it isn't, we will continue working \nuntil we finish this legislation. As I have told everyone and I will \nsay again, we have to finish this legislation, Wall Street reform; we \nhave to do the supplemental. I wish to get the supplemental started \nsometime tomorrow. Then we have the extenders we have to do. We have \nparts of that extenders bill that are essential to the economic \nrecovery. There are many aspects that are important, but one is the tax \ncredit for research and development. Businesses absolutely need that.\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\nThe uncertainty of it is hurting the overall economy.\n  We have to do those before we take the Memorial Day break. We can't \nlet the troops go unfunded and we can't let those provisions expire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/19/senate-section/article/S3952-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as I stand here this morning, the U.S. \nGovernment is in dire fiscal condition, with the Federal debt now about \nto break $13 trillion for the first time in history, a level that was \nunthinkable a few years ago. Meanwhile, Democrats in Washington seem to \nthink there is some law out there that will somehow prevent us from \nexperiencing the same kind of crisis that is currently engulfing \nEurope.\n  The fact is, Washington can't even pay its bills. Yet over the last \n16 months it has taken over banks, insurance companies, car companies, \nthe student loan business, and health care. Now it has its sights set \non anyone in America who engages in a financial transaction. The \narrogance of this approach to governing is truly astounding.\n  Everyone recognizes the need to rein in Wall Street to prevent \nanother crisis, but the bill the majority wants to end debate on today \ndoes not do that. Instead, it uses this crisis as yet another \nopportunity to expand the cost and size and reach of government. It \npunishes Main Street for the sins of Wall Street. Worst of all, it \nignores the root of the crisis by doing nothing whatsoever to reform \nthe GSEs.\n  But all this should sound very familiar to anyone who followed the \nhealth care debate. Remember that the problem with health care was that \nit cost too much and the administration's solution was to spend even \nmore money on it. This time, the Fed, the SEC, and Treasury all missed \nthe housing bubble and the irresponsible risk-taking that led to the \nfinancial crisis, and the administration's solution to this is to hire \nmore of these people to give them even more authority than they had \nbefore. So we have been down this road before.\n\n  The administration used the cost crisis in health care as an excuse \nto force a government takeover on a public that didn't want it. Now it \nis using the financial crisis as a way to intrude into the lives of \npeople and businesses that had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with \nthe problem, and to hire thousands of government employees and spend \nbillions of dollars in taxpayer money to pay for it all. At the outset \nof this debate, Republicans argued that getting on to the bill would be \na mistake since Democrats had no intention of improving it. As it turns \nout, we were right. Not only does the bill still contain a massive new \ngovernment agency with broad new powers over consumer spending and Main \nStreet businesses, it does nothing--nothing--as I indicated, to rein in \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the main protagonists in the financial \nmeltdown. This is absolutely worse than irresponsible. It is the \nlegislative equivalent of wrongful conviction.\n  What is more, Democrats even opposed putting these two government-\nsponsored companies that were behind the housing crisis on the Federal \nbudget and accounting for the billions they got from taxpayers in \nbailout funds.\n  Republicans tried to address the concerns we have been hearing from \nMain Street, many of them targeted at this new Federal agency that \nwould regulate all aspects--all aspects--of a consumer's life, but \nDemocrats rejected them. We offered an amendment that would sunset this \nagency if it led to unwanted government intrusion. They rejected it. We \noffered an amendment that said banks that fail should go bankrupt \nrather than giving their Wall Street creditors a bailout. They rejected \nit. We offered an amendment that would have strengthened lending \nstandards. They rejected it. We offered three amendments to rein in \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They rejected them.\n  They can call this bill whatever they want, but there is no way--no \nway--it can be viewed as a serious effort to rein in Wall Street or to \naddress the problems that caused the crisis. How do you explain to the \naverage American--the average American--that a bill that was meant to \nrein in Wall Street can be supported--supported--by Goldman Sachs and \nCitigroup but opposed by car dealers, dentists, florists, furniture \nsalesmen, plumbers, credit unions, and community banks?\n  Let me say that one more time. How do you explain to the people of \nthis country a bill designed to rein in Wall Street that is supported \nby Goldman Sachs and Citigroup but opposed by car dealers, dentists, \nflorists, furniture salesmen, plumbers, credit unions, and community \nbanks? How do you explain how a bill that was supposed to target Wall \nStreet now threatens to subject manufacturers to a broad new financial \nregulation and new layers of government bureaucracy? How do you justify \nnew costs and regulations on small businesses struggling to dig \nthemselves out of a recession, while the biggest banks--the ones that \ncaused it--don't seem to mind it? How do you explain how a bill that \nwas supposed to end bailouts will be used to collect financial data on \nAmericans?\n  Look, the only thing we need to know about this bill is that a bill \nthat was meant to rein in Wall Street is now being endorsed--now being \nendorsed--by Goldman Sachs and is opposed by America's small business \nowners, community banks, credit unions, and auto dealers. A bill that \nwas supposed to rein in Wall Street is opposed by the Chamber of \nCommerce but supported by Citigroup.\n  Small businesses don't like it, but the biggest beneficiaries of the \nbailouts support it, because regulations never hurt them as much as \nthey hurt the little guys. Our friends on the other side are happy as \nlong as they pass something called reform, and the administration is \nhappy because it is bent--absolutely bent--on expanding government at \nany cost.\n  But the American people are watching, and they are not happy. They \nare astonished at the arrogance of elected leaders who seem to do more \nto create problems up here than to solve them: Health care costs too \nmuch, so let's spend more on it. Regulators missed the housing crisis \nand the financial panic; hire more of them.\n  The Federal Government has doubled in size over the past decade, and \nyet every day this administration devises some new way to make it \nbigger, costlier, and more intrusive. In my view, the administration \nhas lost all perspective about the limits of government and, frankly, \nit is losing the confidence and the trust of the American people.\n  Americans look at what is happening in Europe. They feel as though \nthey are seeing the same movie playing out right here. They feel as \nthough the one way to avoid this crisis from spreading across the \nAtlantic is to stop the spending and the government expansion that led \nto it; and they feel as though the administration doesn't see any of \nthis and is so bent on its government-knows-best solution to everything \nthat it can't even see when the government itself is the problem.\n  The goal of legislating is not to say we have solved the problem when \nwe haven't. It is to prevent or alleviate real hardships and expand \nopportunities for the people who sent us here.\n  But until the administration actually delivers on that promise, \nAmericans cannot and should not be expected to endorse its plans for \neven more government because, for most Americans, what all these crises \nreveal is not a need for more government but a need for less \ngovernment. I will vote against this so-called reform bill, and I urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/19/senate-section/article/S3952-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first, I congratulate the Republican leader \nfor a superb statement on where we stand relative to the bill on \nregulatory reform. It is truly a bill that is misnamed. This bill \nshould be called ``The Expansion of Government for the Purposes of \nMaking Us More Like Europe Act.''\n  As a very practical matter, the bill does almost nothing about the \ncore issues that have created the issue of financial stability in this \ncountry. It does nothing in the area of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, \nwhich is the real estate issue. It does virtually nothing in the area \nof making sure we have a workable systemic risk situation and structure \nso we can address the issue of systemic risk. Instead of addressing it \nin a constructive way, which would actually put some vitality and \nusefulness in to regulate the derivatives market, it actually steps \nback and creates a derivatives regulation that all the major \nregulators, whom we respect, have said simply will not work.\n  I wish to talk about that. I didn't think there was anything you \ncould do that would make this regulatory proposal on derivatives worse. \nBut now we see an amendment from the chairman of the committee, which I \nam sure is well intentioned, but it makes it worse. The way the \nderivatives language of the bill has evolved is it gets worse and \nworse, in an almost incomprehensible and irrational way, which is \nrather surreal. It is almost as if we were at the Mad Hatter's tea \nparty the way this derivatives language is evolving.\n  We now have in the bill itself proposed language which the chairman \nof the FDIC, the Federal Reserve staff, Chairman Volcker, and the OCC \nhave all said will not work. In fact, not only did they say it will not \nwork, they have said it will have a negative impact on the stability of \nthe derivatives market. It will cause the market to move overseas and \nmake America less competitive. It will cause a contraction in credit in \nthis country, and it will hurt consumers and users of derivatives \nacross this Nation.\n  Those are the words--paraphrased to some degree but essentially \naccurate--of the major players who actually discipline and look at this \nmarket, in defining the bill as it is presently before us. Now, in some \nsort of bizarre attempt--as if the Mad Hatter had arrived--to correct \nthis issue, we see an amendment from the chairman of the committee \nsuggesting that we should put into place an even more convoluted \nsystem, tied to uncertainty of no decision occurring for 2 years. The \nproposal says we will have the stability council, which is made up of, \nI think, nine different regulators, take a look at what is in the \nlanguage of the bill now, relative to taking swap desks out of \nfinancial institutions and determine whether that language makes sense. \nWell, it doesn't. We know that already because a group of regulators \nhas already said it doesn't make sense. So we are going to wait for 2 \nyears to determine it doesn't make sense, when we already know it \ndoesn't. Then they are going to make that recommendation to the \nCongress, so the Congress gets to legislate to correct what we already \nknow is an error in the bill.\n  Then, to make this an even more Byzantine exercise in regulatory \nabsurdity, the Secretary of the Treasury has the right to overrule the \nCongress or maybe act independently of the Congress and take action \npursuant to whatever the stability council decided.\n  On top of this convoluted exercise in chaos, the proposal actually \nundermines the Lincoln proposal, which is in the bill, and makes it \neven less workable, by saying the swap desk cannot even be retained by \naffiliates but must be totally separated, which inevitably leads to \nswap desks that do not have capital adequacy or stability or the \nnecessary strength to defend the derivatives action which they are \nmaking markets in. So you weaken and significantly reduce the stability \nof the market, making it more risky and, at the same time, the estimate \nis, you would contract credit in this country by close to $\\3/4\\ \ntrillion less credit.\n  What that means is John and Mary Jones, who are working on Main \nStreet America producing something they are selling to a company that \nis maybe a little larger, and then they are selling that product \noverseas, are probably not going to be able to get the credit they need \nto produce the product, so they will have to contract the size of their \nbusiness, and we will reduce the number of jobs in this country or \ncertainly the rate of job creation.\n  This country's great and unique advantage is that we are the best \nplace in the world for an entrepreneur and risk-taker--somebody who is \nwilling to go out there and do something to create jobs--to get capital \nand credit at a reasonable price and in a reasonably efficient way. \nThis bill fundamentally undermines that unique advantage that we have \nin this language, and this language compounds that event, undermining \nthat unique situation. It is, as I said, similar to participating in \nthe Mad Hatter's tea party to watch the way this bill has evolved on \nthe issue of derivatives regulation. The product--I guess the Queen of \nHearts would be proud of it, but I can tell you the effect on the \nAmerican people, on commerce, and on Main Street will be \nextraordinarily negative should we pass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, recently, Leader McConnell and Dr. John \nBarrasso, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, and I engaged in a \ncolloquy regarding President Obama's nominee for the head of CMS, the \nCenters for Medicare Services, Dr. Donald Berwick.\n  Simply put, Dr. Berwick has a long history of interesting \nstatements--pertinent statements--that support government rationing of \nhealth care, an issue I have vigorously fought against throughout the \nentire health care debate.\n  The White House response to our colloquy, it seems to me, was most \nunfortunate, if not rather incredible. Here is what the Obama \nadministration had to say:\n\n       No one is surprised that Republicans plan to use this \n     confirmation process to trot out the same arguments and scare \n     tactics they hoped would block health insurance reform.\n       The fact is, rationing is rampant in the system today, as \n     insurers make arbitrary decisions about who can get the care \n     that they need. Dr. Don Berwick wants to see a system in \n     which those decisions are transparent--and that the people \n     who make them are held accountable.\n\n  This is a fascinating response. Instead of flatout denials of \ngovernment rationing, we have excuses. If you read between the lines, \nyou will notice that for the first time ever in this debate, the Obama \nWhite House is admitting their health care plan will ration health \ncare. It just doesn't make it transparent.\n\n  Remember, when Republicans, such as myself and Jon Kyl and Dr. \nCoburn, the Senator from Oklahoma, tried to warn that health care \nreform would result in government-rationed care, we were dismissed as \ncrazy reactionaries or even worse. President Obama accused us of trying \nto scare people, and no less than the American Association of Retired \nPersons, AARP--that organization that purports to represent Medicare \npatients and seniors all across our great Nation--said our rationing \nconcerns were a mere ``myth''--that ``none of the health care reforms . \n. . would stand between individuals and their doctors or prevent any \nAmerican from choosing the best possible care.''\n  How interesting that now, after the health care bill has become law, \nthe President is admitting we were right all along. Here is the quote:\n\n       Don Berwick wants to see a system in which those \n     [rationing] decisions are transparent--and that the people \n     who make them are held accountable.\n\n  That is a complete and utter about-face.\n  Although cloaked in the typical straw man arguments that have come to \ncharacterize this administration,\n\n[[Page S3954]]\n\nthe statement is undeniable. The government is going to ration your \nhealth care.\n  To set the record straight, I don't accept rationing, whether it be \ntransparent or otherwise. I am opposed to rationing whether it is done \nby the government or by an insurance company. I am not defending any of \nthe practices of insurance companies that have unjustly denied claims.\n  I am against rationing whether it is proposed by Republicans or \nDemocrats or think tanks or the special interest sidelines in this \ncity.\n  But the Obama administration's response does nothing to address my \nconcerns that our government will ration health care. Instead, we \nfinally have an admission from the White House that this is what they \nplan to do.\n  I am not holding my breath for an apology or a correction from the \nPresident or the AARP or any of the other organizations that demonized \nour concerns for the past year. But I do intend to ask some very tough \nquestions of Dr. Berwick, the President's pick to implement and enforce \nliterally thousands of regulations that will soon come pouring out of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, and that will inevitably \ninclude rationing.\n  It is nothing personal, as I have said before. I have met Dr. \nBerwick. He is a very personable, affable, intelligent man. I don't \ndoubt that he has support from his peers who know him. I am not \nquestioning his honor or his motives or his love for this country.\n  As an aside, I would appreciate it--and I know a lot of other Members \nof this body would as well--if the White House extended the same \ncourtesy to me and, for that matter, anybody else raising serious \npolicy questions.\n  But we have a fundamental disagreement about the future of our health \ncare delivery system. I happen to think it is important that we have \nthis conversation so the American people can understand what is going \non.\n  Please quit attacking my motives and the motives of others. \nAccentuate the policy, eliminate the politics, and don't mess with \nthose in between raising reasonable questions. That is an old song that \nrather dates me, but I think it is appropriate. Questions such as this: \nWhat did Dr. Berwick mean when he said:\n\n       I am a romantic about the [British] National Health \n     Service; I love it. All I need to do to rediscover the \n     romance is to look at the health care in my own country.\n\n  So he is both romantic and supportive of the British National Health \nService.\n  With cancer survival rates for women 10 percentage points higher in \nthe United States than in England and over 20 points higher for men, \nwhy does he think their government-run system is superior to our \nsystem?\n  Please explain this quote:\n\n       If I could wave a magic wand . . . health care [would be] a \n     common good--single payer . . . health care [would be] a \n     human right--universality is a nonnegotiable starting place . \n     . . justice [would be] a prerequisite to health equity as a \n     primary goal.\n\n  While that may sound very nice, very idealistic, the reality is, \ndeclaring health care to be a human right necessarily places some \ncitizens' rights above others--suppressing the rights of some in favor \nof another government-favored group.\n  If you are saying health care is a universal right, what you are \nessentially saying is that some people have a right to someone else's \nproperty, whether that be taxable income or doctor services or their \nhealth care.\n  I disagree with this argument. Health care has become an entitlement \nfor some in this country, but it cannot be properly described as a \nright without egregious government coercion and income redistribution \nand patient care consequences.\n  But maybe that is OK with Dr. Berwick. After all, he did say that \n``any health care funding plan that is just, equitable, civilized, and \nhumane must--must--redistribute wealth from the richer among us to the \npoorest and less fortunate.'' I want to hear more from Dr. Berwick on \nthis point.\n  Furthermore, what did he mean when he said that ``equity'' is a \nnecessary component of ``quality''? Does that mean high-quality care \nshould not be available unless it is available to all? This certainly \nseems to square with the United Kingdom's practice of delaying access \nto the latest breakthrough drugs and technologies because of their high \ncosts. What does Dr. Berwick think this attitude will do to investments \nand innovations in lifesaving treatments?\n  And what about this quote:\n\n       Limited resources require decisions about who will have \n     access to care and the extent of their coverage. The \n     complexity and cost of health care delivery systems may set \n     up a tension between what is good for the society as a whole \n     and what is best for an individual patient . . . Hence, those \n     working in health care delivery may be faced with situations \n     in which it seems that the best course is to manipulate the \n     flawed system for the benefit of a specific patient . . . \n     rather than to work to improve the delivery of care of all.\n\n  Is this a suggestion that it is a doctor's duty to concentrate on the \ngood of society or the good of his or her patient? That certainly \nsounds like a proponent of socialized medicine to me. I use that word \nvery carefully.\n  Finally, this is a question about the following statement by Dr. \nBerwick:\n\n       Most people who have serious pain do not need advanced \n     methods; they just need the morphine and counseling that have \n     been around for centuries.\n\n  That is an amazing statement. I know Dr. Berwick is familiar with the \nLiverpool Care Pathway to death that is employed in the British health \ncare system and its reliance on morphine and counseling. He should also \nbe aware of the growing concerns of many British doctors that this so-\ncalled pathway to death is being overused for patients who would have \notherwise recovered, especially stroke patients. Is this what is being \nadvocated for the American health care system? For Medicare patients? \nThis certainly sounds like the ``death panels'' that became so roundly \nridiculed and dismissed by ObamaCare supporters during last year's \ndebate.\n  I know that ``socialized medicine'' and ``death panels'' have become \nloaded terms. I understand that. But if that is what you are for, you \nshould just say so. Don't be afraid to have this discussion. Dr. \nBerwick certainly has not been shy about his views in the past.\n  Maybe this is a comment more appropriately directed at the \nadministration than at Dr. Berwick, but do not hide behind straw men \nand name-calling of those who disagree with you.\n  I have legitimate concerns--many of us have legitimate concerns--\nabout the direction we are taking in this country with particular \nregard to health care. The thousands of people in Kansas who have \ncontacted me over the last year have very legitimate concerns, too, and \nif you do not think I deserve some answers, they certainly do.\n  The American people are sick and tired of being told that they are \ncrazy or racist or that they do not know what they are talking about or \nbeing misled or that any question raised is simply partisan politics. \nPromise after promise has been broken, from the pledge not to raise \ntaxes to the promise that if you like what you have you can keep it, to \nthe falsehood that this new law does not cut Medicare. And remember the \none about lowering premiums. The list goes on and on. Now it is beyond \na shadow of a doubt that the law will ration health care. I think we \nare duty-bound to hold this administration and its nominees accountable \nfor these broken promises and for what lies ahead for patient care. \nThat is why I will continue to ask the hard questions that need to be \nasked of this nominee.\n  I will continue to fight against what I truly believe is government \nrationing of health care. I did so on the HELP Committee when we \nconsidered it, the Finance Committee when we considered it, and during \nthe reconciliation process when we considered it. All, of course, were \ndefeated by party-line votes. And I will continue to maintain that the \nAmerican health care system, with all of its flaws, is the best health \ncare system in the world. We need to fix the flaws. We do not need \nrationing.\n  In the case of Dr. Berwick, we need answers.\n  I yield the floor. It appears to me there is not a quorum, so I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, what has happened in the Gulf of Mexico \nmakes one thing very clear; that is, America's energy policy is a \ndisaster. I thank Senator Kerry, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Boxer \nfor their leadership in pointing out the need for America to get off \nits addiction to oil and promote safe and clean energy sources for \nAmerica so that we can be independent, so that we can achieve the type \nof economic growth we need and contribute to a cleaner environment. If \nwe do our energy policy right, as Senator Kerry, Senator Lieberman, and \nSenator Boxer have been telling us, we can solve all three problems.\n  I must tell you, I think one of the most urgent needs for an energy \npolicy is to make America more secure. We spend almost $1 billion a day \non imported oil that goes to many countries that disagree with our way \nof life. Americans are actually helping to fund those who are trying to \ncompromise America's security. That makes no sense whatsoever.\n  The Department of Defense has pointed out that our energy policy \nactually contributes to international instability. We spend a lot of \nmoney trying to figure out how we can make the world safer. One way we \ncan make the world safer is to develop an energy policy where we are \nself-sufficient, where we do not have to rely on imported oil.\n  We can also solve the second problem, and that is economic growth. \nTake a look at what is happening in China. They are investing heavily \nin solar and wind power because they know they are going to create \njobs. We want to create these clean jobs in America. We want to \nmanufacture the component parts for solar and wind. We want to be able \nto manufacture component parts for nuclear. We believe we can create \njobs in America by having a policy that relies more on clean energy. \nThere are more jobs to be created, much more so than in oil. For the \nsake of our economy, we need to develop a comprehensive energy policy.\n  Then, for our environment, I can talk a great deal about why we need \nto move forward and get the pollutants out of our air and reward those \nwho use clean technologies. Climate change is real. Tell the people on \nSmith Island, as they see their island disappearing because of the \nrising sea level, or tell those who see the traditional seafood \nindustry go in decline because of warmer waters. We know climate change \nis real, and it is causing instability around the world. We need to \ndeal with it.\n  If we need a reminder, take a look at what is happening in the Gulf \nof Mexico. BP originally told us there was 1,000 barrels a day leaking. \nNow they tell us it is 5,000. We do not know whether that is accurate. \nWe know one thing: It has caused an environmental disaster in the Gulf \nof Mexico. We can expect dead zones because of oxygen deprivation. We \ncan expect that our wetlands, which are critically important for our \necosystem and to protect our environment, will be invaded by this oil. \nAs Senator Nelson points out frequently, if it gets into the Loop \nCurrent, it could very well go through the Keys and the east coast of \nthe United States.\n  The tragedy of this is, we all know we cannot drill our way out of \nour energy problem. We have less than 3 percent of the oil reserves and \nwe use over 25 percent. We know we cannot drill our way out of our \nenergy problems.\n\n  Additional exploration will give us very little as far as energy \nindependence. I will talk about the mid-Atlantic because I am most \nfamiliar with the mid-Atlantic. We have been told by recent studies \nthat we may have enough oil in the mid-Atlantic to handle our energy \nneeds for 2 months in the United States. Think about that--the risk \nfactor versus the reward. It makes no sense whatsoever.\n  If we have a Deepwater Horizon episode in the mid-Atlantic, it will \nbe catastrophic to the Chesapeake Bay. Many of us have invested a lot \nof energy to clean up the Chesapeake Bay. We know we need to do more. \nEPA has come out with its game plan. I filed legislation with my \ncolleagues to have a stronger effort in cleaning up the bay. But if we \nhad an oilspill in this region anywhere near what happened down in the \nGulf of Mexico, it would set us back for generations.\n  Some say: Is that a real possibility? Could that really happen? Let \nme tell you about the lease site 220 off of Virginia which is being \nprimed for offshore drilling. That is 60 miles from Assateague Island \nand 50 miles from the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The prevailing winds \nare toward the coast, which means a spill is likely to come on the \ncoast a lot quicker than we saw in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  I have a few suggestions for my colleagues. First, we need to stop \nany further offshore exploration of gas or oil until we have put in \nplace the regulatory structure to make sure we have done adequate \nenvironmental assessments before any new drilling is permitted. That is \nthe least we can do.\n  We know the exploration plans submitted by BP Oil told us there was \nvirtually no risk, and if there was a spill, they had the proven \ntechnology to make sure it did not reach our coastlines. The proven \ntechnology was these blowout protectors that we note failed in the \npast, had very little experience at 5,000 feet of water, and as a \nresult we see the disaster that has unfolded.\n  The regulatory system is not independent. It needs to be changed. We \nneed to make sure other agencies in the Federal Government that are \nknowledgeable about wildlife are consulted before permits are granted. \nAt least we need to make sure those regulatory changes are in place.\n  Secondly, we need to protect, as Secretary Salazar has said, those \nplaces in America that are environmentally too sensitive to risk \ndrilling. Secretary Salazar points with pride--and I agree--to the west \ncoast of the United States or to the North Atlantic.\n  The area off the coast of the Chesapeake Bay is environmentally too \nsensitive to risk drilling for the little bit of oil that may be there. \nI urge my colleagues to provide protection--permanent protection--from \nthe offshore drilling in the mid-Atlantic.\n  Then we need to consider legislation for a comprehensive energy \npolicy in this Nation. I applaud Senator Kerry and Senator Lieberman \nfor bringing forward a proposal. It is a good start. I compliment them \nfor the manner in which they handled offshore drilling because they \ngive States, such as Maryland, a veto if the environmental risks are \nthere. To me, that is far better protection than current law and better \nthan what the administration has proposed.\n  I hope we can do better. There are provisions in the bill I want to \nstrengthen. There are issues I want to make sure are added to it. But \nunless we get started on energy legislation, unless we bring to the \nSenate Floor and are willing to debate, as we should, an environmental \nand energy policy for our country, we won't have a chance to move on \nthese issues.\n\n  I can't tell you how many people I have talked to in the State of \nMaryland who say: Look, we need to be energy independent, we need to \ncreate jobs, we need to be sensitive to the environment. But we can't \ndo that unless we have a bill before us.\n  I want to applaud Senators Kerry and Lieberman for their efforts. I \nhope we will have a chance to consider that, and I can assure my \ncolleagues that I will have some suggested changes for that legislation \nin order to strengthen it so we truly can achieve the goals of making \nAmerica more secure, of creating the jobs we need and being an \ninternational leader on preserving our environment to make sure that \npolluters do not continue to pollute our environment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to clarify some confusion \nregarding two amendments adopted by the\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\nSenate last week to the Wall Street reform bill. Some in the media have \ncharacterized the two amendments as conflicting, incompatible, or \nrendering one another moot, and I wish to put a quick end to that \nmisunderstanding.\n  To draw these conclusions means you think there is only one problem \nwith the credit rating industry. In fact, there have been many problems \nwith the credit rating industry, and the two amendments passed last \nweek tackle two different problems. In the end, these two amendments \ncan be implemented concurrently and effectively.\n  My colleague from Florida offered an amendment that he stated \n``writes NRSROs out of the law.'' NRSROs are a select group of credit \nrating agencies recognized by the SEC. But in fact his amendment does \nnot get rid of credit rating agencies and it does not get rid of the \ncategory of NRSROs. This is based on our reading of the text in our \noffice, the Senate legislative counsel's office has confirmed this, and \nseveral academics in the field have further confirmed it. The amendment \nsimply does not eliminate NRSROs. Instead, the LeMieux amendment \neliminates provisions in Federal laws that require reliance upon \nratings from NRSROs.\n  For example, this amendment eliminates a provision that requires \ncertain State-chartered banks to only buy securities with top NRSRO \nratings. It replaces this provision with a requirement that banks may \nonly acquire securities which meet ``creditworthiness standards'' \nestablished by the FDIC.\n  The amendment also changes a provision in which the Director of the \nFederal Housing Finance Agency may hire an NRSRO to conduct a review of \nFannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Bank. Under Senator \nLeMieux's amendment, the reviewer need not be an NRSRO. So while the \namendment eliminates reliance upon NRSROs, it does not eliminate the \nNRSRO designation or eliminate credit rating agencies.\n  One can argue that there are benefits to reducing overreliance on \nNRSROs. Regulators gave little thought to the types of debt held by \nbanks because they were rated AAA. Perhaps the regulators should have \nlooked at factors other than the AAA rating before waving through these \nvolatile securities. This is all true, and the LeMieux amendment seeks \nto address it.\n  But here is the problem. Here is the problem. Eliminating federally \nmandated reliance on NRSRO credit ratings doesn't change the fact that \nState laws, pension fund policies, and other private market actors will \nstill explicitly rely on NRSRO ratings. Eliminating blind overreliance \non NRSRO ratings is a respectable goal, but the amendment will not \neliminate reliance on credit ratings entirely, nor should it.\n  For example, at least 5 of the 10 largest pension funds--California \nPublic Employees, California State Teachers, Texas Teachers, Wisconsin \nInvestment Board, and New Jersey Retirement funds--are required by \nState law or internal policy to use NRSRO ratings. These are funds \ntotaling over $\\1/2\\ trillion--and that is just the top 10. In fact, in \nmy colleague's home State of Florida, the Local Government Surplus \nFunds Trust Fund controls $6 billion in assets from 954 local \ngovernments and school districts, and the fund explicitly conditions \npurchases of asset-backed securities on NRSRO credit ratings.\n  In fact, 42 States, plus the District of Columbia, incorporate NRSRO \nratings into their State laws. So NRSRO ratings are not going anywhere. \nThe LeMieux amendment has absolutely no effect on those requirements. \nThe simple fact is that credit rating agencies have a place in the \nmarket and they perform a needed function.\n  Most institutional investors simply lack the capacity to perform the \nanalysis that credit rating agencies perform. For many small \ninstitutional investors, such as a school district's pension fund, \nresearching its own investments would be cost prohibitive. It needs to \nrely at least in part on credit ratings issued by a rating agency.\n  Let's say we want the LeMieux amendment implemented into law as has \nbeen passed. After its implementation we still have the issue of States \nand pension funds and other investors relying on NRSRO ratings.\n  I should say, the amendment wasn't passed into law, but it was passed \nas an amendment to this bill. So we still will have to rely on NRSRO \nratings. But not only that, it is also very likely that Federal \nregulators will continue to use credit ratings as part of their new \ncreditworthiness standards. So it is safe to say that the credit rating \nagencies will still be very much a part of the market. What is being \ndone to ensure the accuracy of these ratings?\n  That is where my amendment comes in. Eliminating government-mandated \nreliance on NRSRO ratings is one thing, but actually changing the way \nthey play the game to eliminate conflicts of interest is entirely \nanother. My amendment gets to the heart of how they play the game.\n  Right now, credit rating agencies have incentives to hand out top AAA \nratings to every product because they need to maintain their business. \nIf they hand out low ratings, issuers of financial products can go shop \naround for a higher rating from a different rating agency. My amendment \nfinally puts a stop to the rating shopping process and implements a \nsystem that would finally reward accuracy instead of grade inflation.\n  The board created by my amendment--and contrary to some claims, this \nboard will be a self-regulatory organization, not a part of the \ngovernment--will create a process to assign a credit rating agency to \nprovide a product's initial rating. This will eliminate the rating \nshopping process and the conflict of interest it creates. The board can \ntake past performance into account in handing out further assignments \nand finally incentivize accuracy in the market.\n  The amendment offered by my colleague from Florida has an admirable \ngoal--to eliminate blind overreliance on credit ratings. But it does \nnot go far enough and does not get to the heart of the problem. The \nheart of the problem is that the current market incentivizes inaccurate \nratings, which contributed to the financial crisis--which was a huge \npart of the financial crisis.\n  Alone, my colleague's amendment doesn't respond to the reality that \nthe market will still demand credit ratings, whether the Federal \nGovernment mandates it or not. State laws, pension fund policies, and \nprivate investors will continue to exist and continue to need the \nexpertise credit rating agencies can supply, if given proper \nincentives.\n  Our amendments each tackle a different part of the problem, and there \nis nothing about them that would prevent them from both being \nimplemented. That is why this body passed both of them. Together, these \ntwo amendments will both reduce the blind overreliance on credit \nratings and ensure that the ratings demanded by the marketplace will \nfinally be accurate.\n  Any assertion implying that these two amendments cannot be reconciled \nor are contradictory is ill-informed. In fact, these amendments will go \na long way in addressing the multiple problems plaguing the credit \nrating industry. Together, they will create more stability and \ncertainty in our economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wanted to share with my colleagues \nan update on where we are with the bipartisan amendment on which I have \nbeen working so hard. I see Senator Sanders of Vermont is here, and he \nis one of my cosponsors, as is the Presiding Officer, Senator Udall of \nNew Mexico.\n  The amendment, as you know, would allow States to protect their \ncitizens from exorbitant interest rates that are charged by out-of-\nState banks. There is a trick to this. Years ago, the Supreme Court \nmade a decision saying when a bank is in one State and a consumer in \nanother, the transaction between them is governed by the laws--and here \nthey had to pick one State or the other--the bank's State. It didn't \nseem like a big deal at the time, but it opened a loophole that crafty \nbank lawyers figured out, and that is that you could move and \nredomicile a bank's headquarters in the State with the worst consumer \nprotection laws in the country. Then, from that State, you could market \nback to other States which have consumer protections, which have \ninterest rate limits honoring the tradition of usury restriction that \nwas at the founding of this country and that lasted for hundreds of \nyears but goes back to all our ancient religions and which is a \nconstant in human civilized\n\n[[Page S3957]]\n\nlegal codes. This overruled all of that, allowing them to sneak right \nby it because they have either gone to or perhaps even cut a deal with \ntheir home State to have the worst consumer protection and be able to \ntake advantage of people in other States. It is the proverbial race to \nthe bottom. I am confident if you called up on the Senate floor as the \ngovernment's policy proposal the way it is right now, you would not get \na single vote. Who would vote for the notion that the consumer \nprotection policy of the country is going to be set by the worst State \nand have that be a situation in which the worst State is usually \ngetting rewarded by the industry for being the worst State?\n\n  It is a bad situation. This amendment has gotten a lot of attention. \nIt has gotten a lot of support--it has bipartisan support. It is a very \npractical thing we can do for American consumers.\n  This is a pretty esoteric piece of legislation in a lot of ways, this \nWall Street reform bill. This does things like trying to rebuild the \nGlass-Steagall firewall. Until I got in the middle of this debate, I \ncouldn't tell what that was. This changes the leverage limits and puts \nrestrictions on what banks can do. That is pretty esoteric stuff. This \ndeals with the regulation of derivatives and collateralized debt \nobligations and credit default swaps and things that nobody ever heard \nof until we were drilled into this legislation--esoteric, preventive \nstuff. But this piece of the bill, this amendment would enable all of \nus to go home and tell our constituents: You know those 30 percent \npenalty rates that your out-of-State credit card company drops you into \nif you make a mistake, if you are late in a payment, for no reason at \nall? We have done something to protect you against that--consistent \nwith the traditions of our country, our laws, consistent with the \ndoctrine of federalism and States rights, consistent with the Founding \nFathers' delegation to the States, the ability to protect consumers in \nthis way. We have restored the States rights. They are no longer \ntrumped by an out-of-State corporation. Now they have the sovereign \nright they should to protect consumers.\n  I think it is a meritorious piece of legislation. I think it is an \namendment that deserves consideration on the floor. It is beginning to \nappear that it may not actually even get a vote, notwithstanding that \nit is pending. We may be edged right out.\n  I want to explain why. People who have been watching this debate have \nseen long hours of nothing happening on this floor. There has been a \nlot of delay. There has been a lot of delay allowing us to get to \namendments. Why is that? We are up against a time restriction on this \nbill. It is a practical time restriction. The leader needs to make sure \nwe pass the supplemental Defense appropriations bill that funds our \ntroops. What could be more important than, when we have troops in the \nfield, overseas, serving our country, putting themselves in harm's way, \nthat we provide them the resources they need to be successful? We have \nto do that.\n  We have to do something to increase the strength of our economy. In \nRhode Island we are at 12.6 percent unemployment. We have been in the \ntop three States for unemployment every single month of the Obama \nadministration.\n  I think we are in the 28th month of severe recession. So we know how \nbad this economy is and how much more we need to do to try to bolster \nit. So we need to get to the next jobs bill, the jobs and tax extenders \nbill, to make sure we are providing the necessary support to our \neconomy.\n  We have to get to those things. Because of all the delay that our \nfriends on the other side have built into the process we are now \ngetting into the end point where we are starting to be squeezed for \ntime.\n  Now that we are squeezed for time, they are refusing to give time \nagreements to amendments like mine that would actually make a \ndifference. They do not want to vote in favor of out-of-State \ncorporations and against their home State's ability to protect their \nhome State's fellow citizens. But they do want the out-of-State \ncorporations to win. They don't want to vote in their favor, but they \nwant them to win.\n  If that is your position, the perfect thing is to delay and delay \nuntil it gets to be here at the end, crunch time, then take the \namendments that worry you, the amendments that will get after the big \nbanks, the amendments that will be fair to consumers, and refuse to \ngive time agreements and vote agreements on those and basically run out \nthe clock.\n  That is the position we are in right now. It appears there is no \nwillingness on the other side of the aisle to give this a vote--not \njust at a 50-vote margin, even at a 60-vote margin. They don't want to \nbe on record supporting these out-of-State credit card companies that \nare gouging their own citizens. They just want them to win, and they \nfigured out this way to do it.\n  The only alternative is to call up the bill, what is called \npostcloture, which means I have to be technically something called \ngermane. Right now we are working with the Parliamentarian to argue as \nstrongly as we can that we are indeed germane. It is an open question \nwhether we are indeed germane, and I hope it gets resolved in our favor \nbefore the bill comes up in its regular order postcloture.\n  That is the situation. If people are wondering why this amendment \ndoes not appear to be on any list, is not going anywhere, it is because \nthere is a blockade of it on the other side. They are taking advantage \nof the time crunch that they created with all the delays that led us to \nthis time crunch to squeeze out the amendments where they do not want \nto vote for the big banks, they don't want to vote for the big credit \ncard companies, but they do want the big banks and the big credit card \ncompanies to win. So it is the squeeze play at the end to try to drive \nthese impactful amendments that will make a tangible, immediate \ndifference in the lives of Rhode Islanders and the lives of their home \nState citizens, the ones paying that 30-plus percent interest rate that \nuntil very recently would be a matter to bring to the authorities of \nthis country, not a matter that the Senate tried to defend. So that is \nwhere we are.\n  I will continue to work with the Parliamentarian to make sure we are \ngermane postcloture, and I will continue to argue to try to get a vote. \nBut forces are arrayed against us at this point, and I want to be \nperfectly candid about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, for weeks now we have been debating the \nfinancial reform bill, which is being sold to the American people as \nthe solution to holding Wall Street accountable for the economic crisis \nthat hurt every American family and business in every community across \nthe Nation.\n  Unfortunately, in this current form, the so-called reform bill will \nactually punish Main Street America, the families who suffered from and \ndid not cause the financial meltdown. It should be a wakeup call when \nLloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs says Wall Street will be the big \nwinner under this bill, and we know the people who provide jobs, \nessentially small business, and the people who provide credit to the \nrest of America are warning of dire consequences.\n  Let me make this clear. This bill was meant to rein in Wall Street. \nYet it is supported by Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. It is opposed by \nsmall business and community bankers. I think that tells you all you \nneed to know about this bill. That is why I rise today in strong \nopposition to cloture on this bill. Yes, we made some improvements on \nthe bill, and I congratulate the leadership for allowing us to have \namendments and debate them, and I thank and I am grateful to my \ncolleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, for working across the aisle \nto remove an onerous provision that unintentionally\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\nwould have killed small business startups. Senator Dodd has worked in \ngood faith in a bipartisan fashion to make real changes in the bill. \nBut despite the progress we have made, the provisions most destructive \nand harmful to taxpayers, families, and small business still remain.\n  First, it is completely unbelievable and unacceptable that so many of \nmy colleagues want to turn a blind eye to the government-sponsored \nenterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which contributed to the \nfinancial meltdown by buying the high-risk loans that banks were pushed \nto make to people who could not afford them.\n  They were the enablers of the issuance of bad mortgages. Everyone \nhere knows what I am talking about. Despite the bill's 1,400-plus \npages, it completely ignored the 900-pound gorilla in the room. The \nneed to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or the ``toxic twins'' as I \nrefer to them, is completely ignored. How can you ignore the major \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises that were the enablers for the bad \nmortgages that brought our system and much of the world's system down?\n  To add insult, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac devastated entire \nneighborhoods and communities as property values diminished. But when \nthey bought up loans and encouraged issuance of loans to people who \ncould not afford them, that turned the American dream of home ownership \ninto the American nightmare for far too many families.\n  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac went belly up, and now it is the very \nAmericans who suffered from their irresponsible actions who are left \nfooting the bill for them, because, if it were not bad enough, unless \nwe act now to reform the toxic twins, over the next 10 years, Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac will run up hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  Let me put that into perspective. Freddie Mac lost $8 billion in the \nfirst quarter, one quarter of this year, and an additional $10 billion \nfrom taxpayers, and warned that it will need more in the future. That \ncomes on top of the $126 billion that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had \nalready lost through the end of 2009.\n  To make matters worse, this administration has taken off the $400 \nbillion credit card limit on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and it is our \ncredit card they took the limit off. How much more does the \nadministration think Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae can lose? How much more \nare they going to force not just us as taxpayers but our children and \ngrandchildren to pay to bail out these toxic twins?\n  Next, a great concern I have is that this bill lumps in the good guys \nwith the bad guys and treats them all the same, particularly when it \ncomes to derivatives. When it comes to derivatives, this bill lumps in \nthose folks who try to manage risk and control costs by making long-\nterm contracts with their suppliers or with their purchasers to even \nout the prices at which goods are exchanged. These are normal hedging \ncontracts, and they are very different from the people who are \nspeculating in the market to make a buck by shady bets with money they \ndid not have or they were making insurance bets on property they did \nnot own.\n  I would urge my colleagues, if they have not read it, to read ``The \nBig Short'' which talks about how this whole scam unfolded with the bad \nunderlying mortgages that caused the meltdown.\n  I have heard some folks say, what actually does this bill mean to you \nand me? Well, it means, for instance, that utility companies may not be \nable to lock in steady rates for their customers, leaving them instead \nat the whim of the volatile market. They will have to clear all of \ntheir long-term contracts and pay billions of dollars to Wall Street or \nChicago to clear the normal long-term contracts with energy suppliers \nwhom they work with on a regular basis, and whose contracts never \ncontributed a nickel to the volatility.\n  As a matter of fact, by locking in prices, they were able to produce \ntheir energy at a reasonable rate. The billions of dollars these \nutility companies will be forced to cough up to Wall Street and Chicago \nwill come down to each and every one of us on our utility bills. When \nthe utility companies have to pay more, guess what. We, as ratepayers, \nget it in the wallet. That is where we will feel it, and that is what \nit means in every community in this country. You will be paying a \nhigher cost every time you flip on the light switch, turn on the air \nconditioning, or use a computer. You will pay more for that energy.\n  For family farms, the backbone, the agricultural backbone of our \ncountry, they will not be able to get long-term financing. That may \nforce some of them to quit farming and prevent others from even getting \nstarted.\n  Frankly, I am stunned that any Senator in good conscience would vote \nfor a bill that would increase costs for every American, especially at \na time when working families are struggling to make ends meet. What \nwill this do to business? These businesses, who will be forced to pay \nhigher energy costs, who will have requirements on derivatives that \nhave to be cleared, may not create the jobs.\n  The community bankers who make the loans that families need or that \nsmall businesses need may be so strapped they cannot make the loans. \nThat credit will dry up. I cannot vote for a bill that creates a \nmassive new superbureaucracy with unprecedented authority to impose \ngovernment mandates and micromanage any entity that extends credit.\n  We are not talking just about the Goldman Sachs and AIGs of the \nworld, the ones at the center of this crisis. No, in the real world we \nare talking about this organization, this Consumer Finance Protection \nBoard or Bureau, regulating the community banks, your car dealers, even \nyour dentist or orthodontist who has to extend some credit to a few \npeople for expensive orthodontic features.\n  Don't be fooled. Any of the new costs as a result of the new mandates \nand regulations will be passed on to the consumers. The very people the \nbill was supposed to protect--you and I--will get to pay for it.\n  Under this new superbureaucracy misnamed the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, will safety and soundness requirements for healthy \nbanks give way to a prevailing agenda of the new bureaucracy? There \nwill be political appointees of the President who will be looking over \neverything as consumer protectors.\n  Some of these consumer protectors were the ones who forced banks to \nmake loans to people who could not afford them in the past. Will the \nsafety and soundness which is key to assuring a sound banking system be \noverridden by these rules and regulations?\n  These regulations can be enforced by every attorney general in the \nNation. Attorneys general may decide it is an abusive practice if a \ncommunity bank does not follow the mandates, the credit allocations, \nmandated to this CFPB. How would the community banks be able to operate \nif the attorneys general are suing them? This bill, regrettably, is \nmuch like the health care bill recently signed into law, because I fear \nthat small businesses will soon learn that there are many more \nunintended consequences which have yet to be seen.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the end of my remarks, I have printed \nin the Record an article by Meredith Whitney that appeared in \nyesterday's Wall Street Journal, one of the people who foresaw this \ncrisis coming, who warned of the impact on small business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. To sum up my view on this bill, if the goal here is to \nenact real reform that ensures we never have another financial crisis \nsuch as the one we had 18 months ago, this bill falls woefully short of \nthe goal. The bill is light on reform of Wall Street and the bad \nactors, it is heavy on overreach and unintended consequences throughout \nour economy, which will affect the ability of people to get and hold \njobs.\n  It will affect the budgets of every family. My colleagues I hope will \noppose cloture and continue to work to pass bipartisan amendments that \nwill make changes to the destructive provisions I have outlined above.\n  Let us not forget about the rating agencies. The book I mentioned, \n``The Big Short,'' pointed out that the brain-dead analysts at the \nratings firms routinely put AAA ratings on some of the\n\n[[Page S3959]]\n\nmost toxic, worthless paper, and then other people managed to buy \ninsurance on those bad contracts even though they did not have any \ninterest in them and made millions.\n  This amendment takes out the rating agencies, but the rating agencies \nstill need to be overlooked and they ought to be funded not by the \npeople who issue the paper but by the people who are buying the paper.\n  There is no doubt that everybody here knows we need to protect \nAmericans from falling victim to another Wall Street gone wild. This is \ngovernment gone wild. It benefits Wall Street. It harms small business, \ncommunity bankers, your local utility company, which sends you your \nutility bill. Is that on the right track? I do not see how anybody can \nsay it is.\n  We do not want--and this is why this debate is so important--to \npunish the everyday Americans for a crisis they did not cause and whose \nimpact they feel the burden, and our children will feel it, for years \nto come. Unless we succeed in it, the Democrats' bill will do just \nthat. The cost will be paid by Main Street and by each and every one of \nus. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture and let us get to \nwork on regulating what went bad and not messing with things that work.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 17, 2010]\n\n                    The Small Business Credit Crunch\n\n                         (By Meredith Whitney)\n\n       The next several weeks will be critically important for \n     politicians, regulators and the larger U.S. economy. First, \n     over the next week Capitol Hill will decide on potentially \n     game-changing regulatory reform that could result in the \n     unintended consequences of restricting credit and further \n     damaging small businesses.\n       Second, states will approach their June fiscal year-ends \n     and, as a result of staggering budget gaps, soon announce \n     austerity measures that by my estimates will cost between one \n     million to two million jobs for state and local government \n     workers over the next 12 months.\n       Typically, government hiring provides a nice tailwind at \n     this point in an economic recovery. Governments have employed \n     this tool through most downturns since 1955, so much so that \n     state and local government jobs have ballooned to 15% of \n     total U.S. employment.\n       However, over the next 12 months, disappearing state and \n     local government jobs will prove to be a meaningful headwind \n     to an already fragile economic recovery. This is simply how \n     the math shakes out. Collectively, over 40 states face \n     hundreds of billions of dollars in budget gaps over the next \n     two years, and 49 states are constitutionally required to \n     balance their accounts annually. States will raise taxes, but \n     higher taxes alone will not be enough to make up for the vast \n     shortfall in state budgets. Accordingly, 42 states and the \n     District of Columbia have already articulated plans to cut \n     government jobs.\n       So the burden on the private sector to create jobs becomes \n     that much more crucial. Just to maintain a steady level of \n     unemployment, the private sector will have to create one \n     million to two million jobs to offset government job losses.\n       Herein lies the challenge: Small businesses, half of the \n     private sector (and the most important part as far as jobs \n     are concerned), have been heavily impacted by this credit \n     crisis. Small businesses created 64% of new jobs over the \n     past 15 years, but they have cut five million jobs since the \n     onset of this credit crisis. Large businesses, by comparison, \n     have shed three million jobs in the past two years.\n       Small businesses continue to struggle to gain access to \n     credit and cannot hire in this environment. Thus, the full \n     weight of job creation falls upon large businesses. It would \n     take large businesses rehiring 100% of the three million \n     workers laid off over the past two years to make a \n     substantial change in jobless numbers. Given the productivity \n     gains enjoyed recently, it is improbable that anything near \n     this will occur.\n       Unless real focus is afforded to re-engaging small \n     businesses in this country, we will have a tragic and \n     dangerous unemployment level for an extended period of time. \n     Small businesses fund themselves exactly the way consumers \n     do, with credit cards and home equity lines. Over the past \n     two years, more than $1.5 trillion in credit-card lines have \n     been cut, and those cuts are increasing by the day. Due to \n     dramatic declines in home values, home-equity lines as a \n     funding option are effectively off the table. Proposed \n     regulatory reform--specifically interest-rate caps and \n     interchange fees--will merely exacerbate the cycle of credit \n     contraction plaguing small businesses.\n       If banks are not allowed to effectively price for risk, \n     they will not take the risk. Right now we need banks, and \n     particularly community banks, more than ever to step in and \n     provide liquidity to small businesses. Interest-rate caps and \n     interchange fees will more likely drive consumer credit out \n     of the market and many community banks out of business.\n       Clearly, the issue of recharging the securitization market \n     as an alternative source of liquidity is one that needs to be \n     addressed over time, but politicians should not force rash \n     regulatory reforms when significant portions of our economy \n     remain fragile. The very actions designed to ``protect'' the \n     consumer, such as rate caps and interchange fees, will \n     undoubtedly take more credit away from the consumer.\n       It is important now to support any and all lending \n     activities that would enable small businesses to begin hiring \n     again. If the regulatory reform passes with rate-cap and \n     interchange regulation amendments incorporated, small \n     businesses will be hurt rather than helped. Politicians and \n     regulators need to appreciate the core structural challenges \n     facing unemployment in the U.S.\n       Elected officials know better than most that an employed \n     voter is better than an unemployed voter. They should improve \n     their odds of re-election and do the right thing on \n     regulatory reform.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to S. \n3217, the Restoring American Financial Stability Act. I am not opposed \nto financial regulatory reform, but there is precious little of that in \nthis misnamed bill.\n  No, real financial regulatory reform is something that should have \nbeen done a year ago, but, instead, Democratic leaders and the Obama \nadministration opted to focus on a Washington takeover of our Nation's \nhealth care system.\n  There are a few parts to the Restoring American Financial Stability \nAct that are worthy of support. In particular, I believe we need to \nmonitor derivatives to require more capitalization and demand issuers \nmaintain a stake in the game when creating and selling certain \nfinancial instruments. However, I think this bill is going to do more \nharm than good to our economy. It will weaken our financial system \nrather than strengthen it. Furthermore, it not only preserves the \nfragmented financial regulatory structure that is already in place but \nadds even more burdensome, costly, and misguided regulations. Before I \nlist my concerns about the bill, I am going to address the specious \naccusations I have heard from the other side of the aisle that \nRepublicans are being obstructionist or trying to protect the interests \nof Wall Street over those of Main Street. Give me a break.\n  These accusations are not only false, they are aimed at diverting \nattention from our solutions to a bad bill by attacking our credibility \nand motivations. We are not trying to protect anyone except the \nAmerican people who are the victims of this economic collapse.\n  Let me be clear that every Senate Republican and I want financial \nregulatory reform in order to prevent a recurrence of what happened a \ncouple of years ago with the collapse of our financial markets. But the \nproblem with this proposal is that it not only regulates Wall Street \nbut also Main Street. It goes beyond regulating large financial \ninstitutions that caused the problem and proposes to regulate community \nbanks and credit unions, payday lenders, and other small businesses and \nalmost any business that provides financing to their customers. If the \nother side is implying that we are trying to protect Wall Street \nbecause we have some sort of special relationship with large financial \ninstitutions, that is blatantly false on its face and simply not true.\n  Large financial institutions contributed way more to Democrats than \nRepublicans in the last election and elections before that. If anyone \nis guilty of trying to do a special favor for Wall Street, it certainly \nisn't this side. That is all I can say. If you look at the financial \nfilings, it is pretty darn clear who Wall Street supported.\n  If anything, I believe this bill will benefit Wall Street in the \nsense that it is something they can always get around. It would provide \na perpetual bailout for large financial institutions. I know there is \nan argument against that, but look at the bill. It would require higher \ncapitalization for many of the companies in which these institutions \ninvest and place larger financial institutions at an unfair advantage \nover smaller financial institutions.\n  But don't take it from me. Take it from the CEO of Goldman Sachs, \nLloyd Blankfein, who said ``the biggest beneficiary of reform is Wall \nStreet itself.'' He is a smart guy. He deserves to be the president of \nGoldman Sachs, one of\n\n[[Page S3960]]\n\nthe more important companies on Wall Street. There isn't any way they \nwould not get around whatever we do today. They are the smartest people \non Earth. So the claim that Republicans are trying to protect Wall \nStreet doesn't hold very much water at all.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle have claimed our objective is to \nobstruct passage of any financial regulatory reform bill. I can't agree \nwith that. In fact, I cannot disagree more. Not only did a Democrat \njoin Republicans in voting against proceeding to this bill, another \nDemocrat who serves on the Banking Committee and has been involved in \nnegotiations noted that the concerns being raised by Republicans about \npotential bailouts of large financial institutions are legitimate. He \nvalidated our concerns by stating that ``there are parts that need to \nbe tightened.'' So at the very least, both Democrats and Republicans \nbelieve this bill leaves a lot of room for improvement.\n  I would like to turn my attention to the substance of the bill. The \nreasons I am opposed to this legislation are because, along with many \nothers, I have serious misgivings about its effectiveness, specifically \nthe FDIC's orderly liquidation authority, the overregulation of the \nconsumer protection agency, and the lack of reforming Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae. The meltdown of our financial markets highlights a major \nflaw in our financial regulatory system--the expeditious dissolution of \na financial institution.\n  I recently finished reading former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's \nbook, ``On The Brink,'' which details the time leading up to the \ncatastrophic failures and the handling of the crisis. I would like to \nread a short passage:\n\n       Back in my temporary office on the 13th floor, a jolt of \n     fear suddenly overcame me as I thought of what lay ahead of \n     us. Lehman was as good as dead, and AIG's problems were \n     spiraling out of control. With the U.S. sinking deeper into \n     recession, the failure of a large financial institution would \n     reverberate throughout the country--and far beyond our \n     shores. It would take years for us to dig ourselves out from \n     under such a disaster.\n\n  What I took away from this book was the enormity and complexity of \ntrying to dissolve these large financial institutions before their \nassets disappeared. There is no doubt that our current system is \nincapable of handling such a complicated task. In fact, over the last \nfew weeks, I not only read ``On The Brink,'' but I read ``The Ascent of \nMoney.'' I read ``The Panic of 1907'' and was amazed at the correlation \nbetween 1907 and 2007. I read ``On The Brink'' by Hank Paulson. I read \nSorkin's book, ``Too Big To Fail.'' Just last weekend I read the book, \n``The Big Short,'' by Michael Lewis, which is an excellent read. They \nhave all been excellent reads. That is in the last few weeks.\n  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, was established \nin 1933 to insure bank deposits. It mainly deals with the common brick-\nand-mortar bank that most of us use on a daily basis. It oversees \nroughly 8,000 depository institutions and $9 trillion in deposits. In \nthe aftermath of the economic collapse, the FDIC administered 25 bank \nfailures in 2008 and 140 in 2009. That is approximately 2 percent of \nall the banks they oversee.\n  Despite such a low percentage, the FDIC's deposit insurance fund was \nnearly depleted. According to the Federal Reserve, there are \napproximately 5,000 top-tier bank holding companies with roughly $17 \ntrillion in assets. The top 10 largest financial institutions hold $9 \ntrillion in assets. The current financial regulatory reform bill \nproposes to provide the FDIC with an orderly liquidation authority to \nunwind not only depository institutions but now large financial \ninstitutions that pose a systemic risk to our financial system.\n  With the passage of this bill, the FDIC would be responsible for \nunwinding nearly double the total number of assets. However, the \nmagnitude of the task is the least of my concerns. By taking the \nresolution out of the bankruptcy courts, with all of their expertise, \nand putting it in an executive branch administrative proceeding \nconducted by politically appointed bureaucrats, we definitely lose \ntransparency and accountability. It is ridiculous.\n  If you would like to see a glimpse of the consequences of losing \ntransparency and accountability, just look at the FDIC's behind-closed-\ndoors handling of Washington Mutual. During a Senate investigatory \nhearing last month, former Washington Mutual Chief Executive Kerry \nKillinger denounced the FDIC's handling of the bank failure as \n``unnecessary'' and ``unfair,'' partly because the thrift was shut out \nof hundreds of meetings and phone calls with financial industry \nexecutives who determined the ``winners and losers'' in the crisis.\n  Our current bankruptcy courts avoid many of the problems associated \nwith creating a government resolution authority and are a superior way \nof dealing with failed or failing nonbank financial firms. The \nbankruptcy courts make dissolving large institutions transparent. That \nis why we have them. They are experts at it. They know what they are \ndoing. We can all watch what they are doing. We can read the pleadings. \nWe can do a lot of things that bring transparency. The other way will \nnot.\n  That brings me to my next concern with this bill, the creation of the \nConsumer Financial Protection Agency. Of course, I think we can all \nagree we need to strengthen consumer protection within our financial \nsystem. But I first believe we need to ask what went wrong with the \ncurrent system before we create yet another government agency to create \nmore regulations and oversight.\n  This will only make it more difficult for consumers and small \nbusinesses to obtain a loan, a line of credit, or a credit card. The \nentire alphabet soup of Federal Government agencies--the FDIC, OCC, \nSEC, FTC, and the Fed--all have consumer protection divisions. However, \nthese divisions did not meet the standard of protection we need. \nExtracting these consumer protection arms from each of the agencies and \nputting them in a new agency is like taking the worn parts from several \nclunkers and using them to build another car. You will still have a \nclunker.\n  Furthermore, think of the costs that new local banks, credit unions, \npayday lenders, and other industries that deal with credit, such as \nauto dealers and other small businesses, will incur when trying to \ncomply with all these new, overly burdensome regulations.\n  But the worst part of this legislation is what it is missing--reform \nof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These two mortgage agencies caused the \nfinancial crisis by backing loans to people who couldn't afford them. \nBut that certainly didn't stop Uncle Sam from bailing them out at a \ncost to taxpayers of some $145 billion. This financial abuse is swept \nunder the rug because the debt is not put on our books. These \ncompanies, which the government now fully owns, are not considered \ngovernment agencies and, therefore, are not included when tallying up \nour outrageous trillion-dollar deficits. I might add, that is just the \nbeginning. We all know Fannie and Freddie are about to explode into all \nkinds of bigger problems, some estimate as much as $500 billion. That \nis scary. Yet we are not doing a doggone thing about it in this bill.\n  We should have faced the music and done whatever we could. A lot of \ngames are played with the budget.\n  As I said before, I support financial regulatory reform. However, \nthis bill falls short of reform and opens the way for another economic \ncollapse to occur. It will unjustly protect companies that are deemed \ntoo big to fail by providing them preferential treatment during FDIC-\nconducted liquidations. It will create costly burdens for the 99 \npercent of financial institutions that did not cause the financial \ncollapse, and it misses the mark by not addressing the reform of Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac.\n  There are other reasons, but I think I will limit my remarks today to \nthose few. Those few involve trillions of dollars, involve all kinds of \nfuture problems for our country, and I think will lead us even further \ndown the path of poor economics, higher debt, higher spending, more and \nmore government, and less and less control by the people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor as someone who has \npracticed medicine in Casper, WY, since 1983, as an orthopedic surgeon \ntaking care of many of the families in the great State of Wyoming. I \ncome to you to talk about the health care bill that has been signed \ninto law and to provide a doctor's second opinion about what is now the \nlaw of the land.\n  I come to you as someone who has worked very hard for many years, \nworking with preventive medicine and early detection of problems as a \nmedical director of the Wyoming Health Fairs, a program designed to \ngive people information to stay healthy and keep down the cost of their \ncare.\n  I come to you with a second opinion on what is now the health care \nlaw because I believe the goal of health care reform should be to lower \ncosts, improve quality, and increase access to care.\n  Unfortunately, the new health care law, in my opinion, is going to be \nbad for patients, for providers--the nurses and doctors who take care \nof them--and for the payers, the people paying the bills--the patients \nas well as the American taxpayers.\n  I am concerned that the health care bill signed into law is going to \nincrease the cost of care, provide less access to care, and is going to \nlessen the quality of the available care in this country.\n  I come to you with new information that has come to light on the \nhealth care bill and, specifically, an article that was in Politico \nthis Monday, May 17, written by Kathleen Sebelius, the\n\n[[Page S3962]]\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services. What she said in this article \nis:\n\n       We are collaborating with States to set up federally funded \n     high-risk insurance pools to make sure that the Americans \n     with the greatest need for health insurance will be able to \n     get it.\n\n  Madam President, you know as well as I that there is an old phrase in \npolitics that goes: ``How does it play in Peoria?'' It is referring to \nPeoria, IL, and means what is the average American thinking about this. \nRegarding this health care law, it is not playing very well in Peoria. \nPeoria is a place that President Clinton referred to when he was \nrunning, as did George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, and President Obama. \nThose Presidents went to Peoria to talk with people. Yet, when you look \nat what the Peoria Journal Star has reported about this health care \nbill, which is now law, in the President's home State, a place that is \nfelt to be the bellwether for political thought in the country, Peoria, \nIL, the verdict is not good about this health care bill which is now \nlaw. I will start with an article that appeared in the Peoria Journal \nStar that talks about what is happening in Illinois today. It says:\n\n       For thousands of Illinois residents who pay high health \n     insurance premiums because of medical problems, the new \n     federal health care legislation won't offer relief.\n\n  It will not offer relief, this says. Continuing:\n\n       The 16,000 residents who already pay into Ilinois' high-\n     risk health insurance pool will keep paying high rates, while \n     others who enroll this summer under a new, similar program \n     will get coverage at lower, more reasonable prices.\n\n  What happened here? This is one of the fundamental flaws. Only the \npeople who have been uninsured for 6 months are eligible--meaning those \nin the current State pool cannot switch and save money. How do the \npeople of Illinois feel about this? How is it playing in Peoria? Quite \npoorly.\n  Julie Kramer is quoted in the article. She is 53. She said she is \n``feeling a bit cheated,'' in her words, by this health care law. She \nhas paid high premiums for nearly 7 years in the Illinois high-risk \npool; she has played by the rules and has done what she needed to do. \nIs she being helped by the new health care law? Not at all, and she is \nfeeling cheated.\n  She went on to say that:\n\n     . . . it feels very unfair. It goes against the spirit of \n     what health care reform was supposed to be.\n\n  Ms. Kramer is a self-employed writer and owner of Full Moon Marketing \nCommunications in Vernon Hills. She said: ``This does seem like a low \nblow.''\n  Members of the Senate voted for the bill about which this person says \nshe feels a bit cheated, it seems unfair, and it seems like a low blow. \nThe existing program is called the Illinois Comprehensive Health \nInsurance Program. Thirty-four other States have similar programs.\n  People in this Illinois program pay 25 to 50 percent higher--more \nthan standard rates. So they pay their premium; they pay every month. \nThey continue to pay. Yet they are feeling cheated, they feel it is \nunfair and is a low blow.\n  Even the Illinois Department of Insurance--their director--\nunderstands this lady's frustrations. To even the playing field, the \ndirector said the State legislature would have to act to reduce the \npremiums. You cannot rely on Washington. Illinois expects to receive \nmoney from the Federal Government to start the new high-risk pool. The \ninsurance department says there might be enough money to cover about \n5,000 people in the new plan. How does that compare? Far fewer--\naccording to the article in the Peoria, IL, paper, far fewer than the \nnumber of people who may qualify. A Government Accountability Office \nreport said about 218,000 people might be eligible for a high-risk pool \nin Illinois.\n  Well, what does the Illinois high-risk pool Web site say? They sent a \nletter to enrollees--the people who pay their premiums month after \nmonth and play by the rules--and it says it is unlikely Federal funds \nwill be available to reduce premiums paid by the current enrollees--the \npeople who have played by the rules and have continued to pay the \nbills. They didn't actually send out this letter. They put it on their \nWeb site. They wanted to send it out, but they didn't have the $5,000 \nfor postage to send this letter to the people who have been sending \nthousands and thousands of dollars into this high-risk pool every year.\n  The director said: No, we have not mailed the letter because the cost \nof mailing was prohibitive, given that we have, at this point, not \nreceived any actual funding. He said it would be inappropriate to \nwithdraw funds to send such a letter.\n  Well, Julie Kramer was shown the letter on the Web site, and she \nsaid: You know, I did feel a little flash of anger and disappointment \nwhen I read it.\n  I say to the Secretary of Health and Human Services--who wrote a \nletter to those in Washington via Politico, who said we are doing what \nwe can to make sure we are helping these people--the people of Peoria \ndo not agree and do not believe what she has to say.\n  That is why, across the board, a majority of the Americans who need \nhealth care, who are concerned about the cost of care, look at this \nhealth care law and believe, in terms of a law this Congress has passed \nand this President has signed, that it is going to actually make the \ncost of their own care go up and the quality of their own care go down. \nThat is why, overwhelmingly, the American people have rejected this \nhealth care law.\n  That is why I come to the floor again with my second opinion, and my \nopinion is it is time to repeal this law and replace it--replace it \nwith solid ideas that will help people lower the cost of their care, \nimprove the quality of their care, and increase their access to care. \nThat would be patient-centered health care, health care that allows \npeople to buy insurance across State lines, that gives people who buy \ntheir own policies the opportunity to get the same tax relief that big \ncompanies get, to provide individuals incentives to stay healthy and \nget the cost of their care down by lowering their risk factors for \ndisease because half the money we spend in health care in this country \ngoes to 5 percent of the people--those who eat too much, exercise too \nlittle, and smoke. We need to find solutions that deal with lawsuit \nabuse, to get down the cost of all the defensive medicine that is \npracticed in this country and allow small businesses to join together \nto provide less expensive insurance for the people who work for those \nbusinesses.\n  Those are the things we know will work, the things we know will be \nable to allow us to deliver higher quality care, that will allow us to \nlower the cost of care. That is why it is my opinion, as a physician \nwho has practiced medicine since 1983, that we need to repeal this \nhealth care law and replace it with something that will work for the \npeople of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I came to speak on the Merkley-\nLevin amendment, which I think is so important. I will speak about that \nin a moment.\n  I am a little surprised to hear another health care debate comment. \nLast year, through much of the year, there was opposition--a lot of \nopposition--to the health care bill. Most of the opposition came about \nbecause of the kinds of things that were said on the Senate floor that \nsimply weren't true: that this bill would mean the government would put \na bureaucrat between your doctor and yourself as a patient, that it was \na government takeover, that it was socialism.\n  In fact, the arguments they used last year against the health care \nbill were the same arguments they used against Medicare in 1965: \nsocialism, government takeover, and bureaucrat between you and your \ndoctor. Those things didn't pan out with Medicare. The same arguments \nwere used, but they clearly weren't true in 1965, when conservatives, \nincluding the John Birch Society and others similar to that, did \neverything they could to defeat Medicare. They were not successful then \nand they weren't successful on the health care bill now.\n  When I hear that kind of discussion from colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, when I hear the most conservative Members of this \ninstitution saying we should repeal the new health care bill, I guess \nthe questions to ask are: Do they want to repeal the provision when my \nfriend's 22-year-old daughter comes home from college or his son comes \nhome from the military\n\n[[Page S3963]]\n\nand they can't find a job with insurance? Are they going to repeal the \nsection that says they can stay on their parents' health insurance? It \nwas a great idea that the young men and women coming home from the Army \nor from school can stay on their parents' health care insurance until \nthey are 27. I guess they want to repeal that.\n  I guess they want to repeal the tax breaks that this health care bill \ngave to small businesses so they can insure their employees. I guess \nthey want to repeal the support for those who fall into the doughnut \nhole for prescription drugs, those seniors continuing to pay their \npremiums and get that benefit from it. They want to repeal the benefit \nthis bill is going to give them. They want to repeal the prohibition on \npreexisting conditions. During much of last year, I would come to the \nfloor and read letters from constituents--Ohioans from Ravenna, Toledo, \nHillsboro, to Wilmington.\n  These letters would be mostly from people who thought they had good \nhealth insurance until they got sick and needed it. This legislation \nwill not let insurance companies knock people off the rolls because of \na preexisting condition or knock them off the rolls because they got \ntoo sick and expensive, will not let them knock them off the rolls if \nthey had a child born with a preexisting condition. All of those issues \nwere resolved, and we are beginning to see all of these benefits from \nthis health care bill. The American public knows that.\n\n  I wish my colleagues, rather than advocate for repeal of something \nthat has moved this country forward, would work with us on issues such \nas the Merkley-Levin amendment. Let me for a moment discuss that \namendment.\n  It is a good amendment. It will make this final bill stronger. It is \nworthy of an independent up-or-down vote. It is worthy of a majority \nvote. If we get 51 votes, we ought to be able to adopt an amendment in \nthis body to add to this legislation.\n  Republicans have criticized this bill for weeks. They have blocked us \nfrom bringing it up for debate because they said it did not address the \nproblem of too big to fail. But the first major amendment we considered \nwhich would have addressed the problem of too big to fail--that is, too \nbig to fail is too big--would have meant those huge banks would have \nhad to sell off a part of their assets.\n  Let me give a number. The total assets of the six largest banks in \nthis country 15 years ago was 17 percent of gross domestic product. The \ntotal assests of those six largest banks today are 63 percent of the \ngross domestic product. Too big to fail is, in fact, too big.\n  Every Republican, with the exception of Senator Ensign from Nevada, \nSenator Coburn from Oklahoma, and Senator Shelby from Alabama, every \nsingle Republican voted against that, again siding with the big banks, \nthe six big banks, against the country, against manufacturers in \nDayton, OH, against the small-town bank in Dover or New Philadelphia, \nOH, against the regional banks in Cleveland, Cincinnati, or Columbus, \nagainst the small business guy or woman who wants to get a loan. By \nvoting for the big banks and giving them even more advantage, it was \ndiscriminating against the regional banks, the community banks. It was \nhurting the manufacturer in Shelby, OH, or Mansfield, OH, that needs a \nloan to build their business. That was the first chance.\n  I cannot think of another proposal that deals with the problem of too \nbig to fail better than the Merkley-Levin amendment. There are all \nkinds of parliamentary shenanigans going on around this amendment \ntrying to block it. Let me talk about the amendment for a moment.\n  If they are successful in beating this amendment, it is clearly a win \nfor the Wall Street banks. For too long these banks used their own \ncapital or borrowed billions of dollars to invest in risky financial \nproducts. We know they did that. We know the damage it caused to our \nsystem, to our economy, to our country. After telling their clients to \nbuy these risky products, big banks turned around and bet against their \nown clients to cushion their profits. With one hand, they sold a client \na risky financial product--a subprime mortgage or a large debt \nobligation. With the other hand they placed bets on those products \nunderperforming. That is how proprietary trading works. That is what \nthey want to continue.\n  It is like me selling you a house and then taking out a fire \ninsurance policy on it and starting the fire. Whether it was greed or \narrogance run amok, these megabanks blew our economy apart--we know \nwhat happened--leaving taxpayers to piece it back together.\n  Proprietary trading is not just a gamble. It is a drag on sectors of \nour economy that traditionally have been supported by the banks. \nPropriety trading displaces lending to businesses small and large. It \nincreases Wall Street's bottom line while leaving the rest of the \neconomy behind.\n  Over the past dozen years, proprietary trading--as this reckless \ngambling is called--has become an increasingly larger portion of the \nbusiness conducted by our largest financial institutions.\n  At the end of 2009, the large banks reported to the FDIC that their \ntrading revenues, as opposed to revenues from lending and other \ntraditional banking activities, accounted for 77 percent of their net \noperating revenues. At the same time over the last year, FDIC-insured \nbanks' securities holdings have increased by 23 percent. Instead of \nlending to businesses, they lend to themselves.\n  It is no coincidence that manufacturing faltered, that millions of \njobs were lost, and our Nation's unemployment rate hovers at 9.9 \npercent and higher in a dozen States such as Ohio. There is no room in \nthe financial sector to absorb good-paying jobs in other sectors; and \nwhen banks stop lending, other sectors dry up. That is not sustainable.\n  We know in this country that 30 years ago one-third of our GDP was in \nmanufacturing. Financial services accounted for only 10 or 11 percent \nof our gross domestic product. That really tells the story. As \nmanufacturing declined as a percentage of GDP and financial services \nwent up so much, that is clearly why we are where we are today. \nFinancial services has accounted for 44 percent of corporate profits in \nrecent years, again, instead of manufacturing, instead of contributing \nwealth to our country.\n  The support of the Merkley-Levin amendment makes sense. It is not a \ntime to play games with the financial well-being of hard-working, \nmiddle-class Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/19/senate-section/article/S3963-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, 3 weeks ago I supported invoking \ncloture on the motion to proceed to this bill. Proceeding to this \nmeasure was essential to being able to debate, amend, and strengthen \nit. But as I noted at that time, after 30 years of acquiescing to the \nwishes of Wall Street lobbyists, it is essential that Congress get it \nright this time, and finally enact tough reforms to prevent Wall Street \nfrom driving our economy into the ditch again. In particular, that \nmeans eliminating the risk posed to our economy by the massive \nfinancial firms that are considered ``too big to fail.''\n  Over the last few weeks, this body has repeatedly rejected amendments \nthat address ``too big to fail.'' And perhaps the most important \namendment in this respect--one offered by the Senator from Washington, \nMs. Cantwell, to reinstate the protective firewalls of the Glass-\nSteagall Act--may not be considered if we invoke cloture on the \nunderlying measure.\n  Three weeks ago, I said that for me the test for this legislation is \na simple one--whether or not it will prevent another financial crisis. \nAnd central to that test is how this bill will address ``too big to \nfail.'' Right now, this bill fails that test, and for that reason I \nwill not support ending debate on the measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nDodd substitute amendment No. 3739 to S. 3217, the Restoring American \nFinancial Stability Act of 2010, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Walsh Nomination\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will have a unanimous-consent request \nthat has been cleared on both sides. This is a unanimous-consent \nrequest about a nomination that has been on the calendar since \nSeptember 27, which was reported out of the Armed Services Committee by \nSenators Levin and McCain--reported out unanimously--for the promotion \nof BG Michael J. Walsh.\n  On October 27, it was determined that the Armed Services Committee \nagreed with the President for the recommended promotion for the second \nstar for this soldier. It has regrettably been held up; there has been \na hold on it since late last year. I have been to the floor several \ntimes asking unanimous consent that this nomination for General Walsh \nbe approved.\n  Our colleague, Senator Vitter, from Louisiana, has been upset with \nthe Corps of Engineers for other reasons and has held this nomination \nfor a period of time now. It has been about 7 months. I have indicated \non the floor how unfair I think it is to hold the nomination of a \npromotion of a soldier who has served this country for 30 years. He has \ngone to war for this country. I know this soldier. He has done an \nextraordinary job. On a unanimous vote, the Armed Services Committee \ndecided he should be promoted. But month after month, it has sat on \nthis calendar because of the objection of one Senator.\n  My understanding is now the Senator has released the hold as of \ntoday. I indicated yesterday I would be on the floor today to ask \nunanimous consent once again. This morning, it is my understanding that \nthe Senator from Louisiana released his hold.\n  Following yielding to Senator Levin, the chairman of the committee \nthat moved this nomination out--and, by the way, who has also been on \nthe floor and asked unanimous consent to move this nomination--if \nappropriate, I\n\n[[Page S3965]]\n\nwould allow him to say a few words, and then I will ask unanimous \nconsent to move the nomination. I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLevin be recognized, following which I will move the nomination by \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. He \nhas been dogged in his determination to get this nomination before the \nSenate. It is unconscionable that a military officer in the uniform of \nthe United States, who has put his life on the line for this country, \nmonth after month after month, has had his promotion held up by one \nSenator. It is only one Senator. All the Senators of the Armed Services \nCommittee on both sides wanted to confirm this general. But the rules \nof the Senate permit one Senator to threaten a filibuster or a so-\ncalled hold. In this case, it was an open hold, not a secret hold. He \nwas able to thwart the Senate because we cannot take 2 or 3 or 4 days \nto take up every nomination of every soldier or civilian because we \nwould get even less done than we do now.\n  Those are the rules of the Senate. They should not be used this way. \nWe expressed that to Senator Vitter. That hold has been lifted. So a \nwell-qualified soldier is going to be promoted 6 months late by the \nSenate. We can thank him for his service, but the best way we could \nhave thanked him would have been to have promptly promoted him. Short \nof that, he knows he has, on a bipartisan basis, the support of the \nSenate. It is very important to us as an institution that he knows \nthat. He also knows full well the power of one Senator. He should also \nunderstand that when it comes to the defense of this country, \nRepublicans and Democrats are going to stand together.\n  I, again, thank the Senator from North Dakota for his determination. \nHe is kind of the 27th member of the Armed Services Committee, if my \nmemory is correct. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, again, Michael Walsh is a good soldier, \nwho served 30 years and has gone to war for this country. The demand \nthat existed and resulted in holding this nomination is a demand that \ncould not be met. He could not possibly do what he was asked to do. He \ndoes a good job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/19/senate-section/article/S3965-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF BRIGADIER GENERAL MICHAEL J.

My understanding is that we would now yield 6 minutes to \nthe Senator from Illinois, after which I have been asked to call for a \nquorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues on the \nfloor of this Chamber today.\n  Here, in our Nation's Capital, we gather to confront shared \nchallenges. We celebrate our great leaders, and mourn fallen heroes. \nHere, we carry out the hard work of self-government. We try to make \nthis union a little more perfect every day. It is messy. It is \ndifficult. We make mistakes, and at times we fall short.\n  In any other country, these flaws and missteps might be fatal--but \nnot in the United States of America. Here, we are defined by our \nability to correct injustice to confront problems and move ahead \npeacefully, with respect for the rule of law even when those problems \nare great.\n  Mr. President, much of our history has been written right here in \nthis city. But in some ways, the city itself tells two divergent \nstories:\n  More than two centuries ago, the foundation of this country was laid \nby a group of American patriots, who chose this land for their new \nCapitol.\n  They fought--and many died--for principles of freedom and equality. \nThey framed the greatest, most progressive system of government in the \nhistory of the world.\n  And then, in an irony both tragic and unjust, the foundation of this \nvery building the heart of our democracy was laid by enslaved African \nAmericans.\n  So, from the very beginning, our Nation has struggled to live up to \nits highest ideals.\n  But, in many ways, I believe that is where our greatness truly lies: \nin our ability to determine our own course, and correct the mistakes of \nthe past.\n  That is why the American civil rights movement is perhaps one of the \ngreatest periods in our history.\n  During the 1950s and the 1960s, citizens and activists joined \ntogether with lawmakers to overturn policies of hatred and \ndiscrimination that created a powerful nonviolent movement for civil \nrights under the rule of law which brought about one of the most \nsignificant social and cultural changes in our Nation's history.\n  Earlier today, I spoke before the Subcommittee on National Parks, \nchaired by my friend, the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Mr. \nUdall, to advocate for a piece of legislation that is very important to \nme. I am proud to sponsor the United States Civil Rights Trail Special \nResource Study Act, S. 1802, a bill that will help identify and \npreserve the history of the people and places that defined the civil \nrights movement. This bill joins a bipartisan companion measure from \nthe House of Representatives, H.R. 685, which passed unanimously last \nSeptember.\n  It will honor folks who forever changed the landscape of this Nation. \nTheir stories deserve to be told. In any other country, this kind of \nprogress would have been impossible, but not in America. We have the \ncapacity for sweeping change woven into our very identity, and that is \nwhat my bill would recognize, celebrate, and preserve.\n  This Capitol Building was constructed under slavery. Yet it embodies \na system of government that allows subsequent generations to correct \nthis terrible wrong. During the civil rights movement, thanks to \nordinary people with extraordinary vision, we witnessed a revolution of \nvalues and ideas that changed this Nation forever.\n  I come to this floor today in celebration of the pioneers who made \nthese changes possible. My bill would direct the Secretary of the \nInterior to identify the places, the resources, and the themes \nassociated with this movement and consider adding them to the National \nTrails System. This would include the sites of the famous march in \nSelma and Montgomery, AL, the Greensboro sit-in, and the Montgomery bus \nboycotts. We would commemorate these places where peaceful protesters \ndemonstrated for equal rights, and even in some places where violence \nbroke out and lives were lost in the cause of freedom.\n  My bill would also recognize folks such as the citizens and elected \nleaders\n\n[[Page S3966]]\n\nof Savannah, GA, who were ahead of the rest of the country and took \npeaceful action to desegregate local communities well before Federal \nlaws were passed.\n  We need to make sure the next generation learns and does not forget \nthe story of the civil rights movement and the ideals it strove to \nachieve. That is why this legislation is so important.\n  This bill, with the companion bill in the House, would highlight this \npowerful legacy. Yes, these injustices were great and they must never \nbe forgotten, but it would be a mistake to dwell exclusively on the \nerrors of our past. Instead, I believe we should celebrate the progress \nwe have made. We accomplished what many other countries find \nimpossible. We corrected the greatest mistakes of our history. We \nencountered obstacles and overcame them. We took control of our shared \ndestiny and redefined it.\n  Our Union remains far from perfect, but challenges persist, and it \nwill be up to future generations to address these challenges. But there \nis no denying we have come a very long way.\n  Two centuries ago, my ancestors would not have been allowed in this \nbuilding except as laborers. Today I stand on the floor of the Senate \nas a Member of the highest ranking body in this land. That is a \npowerful affirmation of what this country stands for.\n  Let's preserve this history and pass it on to the next generation.\n  I thank Chairman Udall, Ranking Member Burr, and other members of the \nSubcommittee on National Parks for allowing me to offer a statement \nearlier today.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill before the \nfull committee and the full Senate so we can send it to the President's \ndesk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes talking \nabout our previous vote this evening.\n  I know many of my colleagues worked hard on regulatory reform \nlegislation, but I also think it is important that we keep our eye on a \nvery critical part of solving this problem. I know many of my \ncolleagues, particularly on the Banking Committee, have had a long \nhistory with banking issues and may see things a little differently \nfrom the context of the issues they have been dealing with in the \ncommittee.\n  It has been clear to me for a long time that the deregulation of the \nderivatives market in 2000 led to a very unfortunate situation. Before \nderegulation, we actually had transparent trades in reporting to the \nCFTC. We had capital requirements. We had speculation limits. We had \nantifraud and antimanipulation. We had trader licensing and \nregistration. And we had public exchange trading.\n  The reason I bring that up is because to me, if the derivative crisis \nbrought on basically a world economic implosion, then the principles of \nthis underlying bill ought to adhere to the principles that have been \nlaid out by the White House and others on what would help us fix this \nproblem.\n  We know it was deregulated, and we know these things were eliminated. \nBut I take the Treasury Secretary at his word when he wrote earlier \nthis year:\n\n       To contain systemic risks, the CEA and the securities laws \n     should be amended to require clearing of all standardized \n     derivatives through regulated central counterparties.\n\n  The reason I bring that up is because the underlying bill before us--\neven though the Agriculture Committee corrected this--the language \ncoming from the Banking Committee created a loophole and basically says \nthat if you go to a clearinghouse and they say you do not need to be \ncleared, don't worry about it, you don't need to be cleared.\n  It should be no surprise to anybody that the swaps dealers are the \npeople who own the clearinghouses. In that context, a fundamental tenet \nof derivative regulatory reform, exchange trading, clearing, aggregate \nposition limits, and transparency, one of those pillars is missing from \nthis bill.\n  Look at what happened because of this deregulation in 1999. There was \nless than $100 billion in the derivatives market, and today we are at a \n$600 trillion derivatives market--$600 trillion. Before deregulation it \nwas a very small amount of money, and now we have this incredible \nmarket.\n  The question is whether we are going to regulate it to have the basic \ntenets of true competition, which means there is some oversight and \nsome transparency to make sure that there are not manipulative devices \nor contrivances in this legislation.\n  The good news is we have tried to say that of these principal tenets \nof exchange trading, we have to have transparency, real-time \nmonitoring--all these things should be in there. But you also have to \nhave capital behind the trades. That means we have to have a \nclearinghouse to make sure this type of activity is being cleared.\n  There were many times before the Senate Finance Committee where the \nTreasury Secretary said:\n\n       I'm fully supportive of moving the standard part of those \n     markets onto central clearinghouses and exchanges . . . We \n     want to make sure that the standardized part of those markets \n     moves into central clearinghouses and onto exchanges as \n     quickly as possible . . .\n\n  That was in January.\n  We had another time where the administration said:\n\n     . . . we need to establish a comprehensive framework of \n     oversight, protections and disclosure for the OTC derivatives \n     market, moving the standardized parts of those markets to \n     central clearinghouses, and encouraging further use of \n     exchange-traded instruments.\n\n  That was in March.\n  I don't know why we are still having this debate as to whether we are \ngoing to have clearing of these derivatives. To me it is critical.\n  I know there are other good parts of this legislation about which \npeople care deeply. But if we have this $600 trillion market and we are \nnot truly going to have exchange trading and clearing and aggregate \nposition limits across all exchanges, we are not going to rein in the \nderivatives problem. We are not.\n  I hope my colleagues will take these words from the Treasury \nSecretary and from the White House and hopefully get a piece of \nlegislation on this floor that will take care of this clearinghouse \nloophole.\n  I know my colleagues think we can talk about building a dam against \nthis wall of dark derivatives. But even something such as Hoover Dam, \nwith all the great concrete and all the great engineering and all the \ngreat things that make that structure work, still has a problem if \nsomebody drills a hole in the bottom of it. Over time, that is where \nall the water will flow, and that is where this derivative market is, \ntoo. If we do not have a regime of exchange trading and clearing, we \nwill have money seeping into a continuation of a dark market.\n  Would I like other amendments, would I like a vote on an amendment by \nmy colleague from Arizona and me that is the reinstatement of Glass-\nSteagall? Sure, I would. Sure, I would like to have many other \namendments that my colleagues have been talking about, and hopefully \nthey will get votes on them, whether it is Merkley-Levin or other \npieces of legislation people have been offering. But this issue is a \nfundamental one. We will not have reform if we do not have exchange \ntrading and clearing, if we do not bring derivatives onto the same kind \nof mechanisms we have for other products in the financial markets. If \nwe do not do that, then I don't know what we are doing out here in the \ncontext of what brought us to this crisis.\n  Trading of dark market derivatives is what has brought this challenge \nto our U.S. economy. Let's bring some transparency into that market. \nLet's adhere to these words and actually implement this so we can move \non with this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what is the order of business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Merkley amendment is pending.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I stand in support of the Merkley \namendment.\n\n[[Page S3967]]\n\nThis is an effort by Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Carl Levin of Michigan \nto try to strengthen the bill that is before us on Wall Street reform; \nto try to minimize the types of investments made by banks which could, \nin fact, jeopardize those government institutions that guarantee the \ndeposits at banks because some bankers make bad decisions and bad \ninvestments. What Senator Merkley is trying to do is to reduce that \nlikelihood, which means banks are less likely to fail and taxpayers are \nless likely to be holding the bag.\n  Senator Levin of Michigan, you will remember, 3 or 4 weeks ago held a \nhistoric hearing with Goldman Sachs representatives, including Mr. \nLloyd Blankfein, their CEO, to discuss some of their practices. Those \nof us who know Senator Levin know he is a very studious and thoughtful \nindividual and he doesn't take on complex issues lightly. He spent \nmonths in preparation for that hearing, and coincidentally it came up \njust as we began the debate here on Wall Street reform. It was quite a \nhearing. It went on for many hours because there was an effort by the \nwitnesses to avoid answering questions, so the committee decided they \nwould keep the witnesses there until the questions were answered. As a \nresult, they stayed into the night. At the end of the day, I think \npeople had a better understanding of some of the practices at Goldman \nSachs, one of the largest financial institutions on Wall Street. I \nthink they also may have had some second thoughts about some of the \nstandards being used by that firm and others.\n  We know Goldman Sachs is currently being investigated by the \ngovernment for alleged wrongdoing when it comes to the sale of \ninvestment products. It turns out, as best I understand it, that this \nWall Street firm of Goldman Sachs was selling investments to \nindividuals and then basically betting they would fail--with their own \nmoney. It strikes me as a complete abdication of any financial or \nfiduciary responsibility, to put their customers in that kind of \ncompromised position. It is interesting that I have had a conversation \nwith people in other firms on Wall Street who think this is routine and \nnot extraordinary. That makes it all the more troubling.\n  The Levin portion of the Merkley-Levin amendment addresses this issue \nabout the ethical considerations of these companies that, in fact, are \nselling products to their customers and then turning around and \nsecretly, quietly betting with their own investments that those \nproducts will fail.\n  So that sort of thing should be addressed in this bill. The Merkley-\nLevin amendment is an amendment which would have been considered \nregardless of whether today's cloture motion had passed.\n  For those who do not follow the Senate, the cloture motion is an \nattempt to at least bring a close to the beginning of a debate and \nstart to wind down the debate toward a vote. So we had a vote today. We \nneeded 60 votes in the Senate out of 100 Members to vote in favor of \nthe cloture vote.\n  After 4 weeks on the floor of the Senate on this Wall Street reform \nbill, the majority leader and many of us felt we had reached a point \nwhere we needed to start winding this bill down and bring it to a final \nvote. Well, we needed 60 votes to do it. There are 59 Democratic \nSenators here when all are present and accounted for. One of our \nSenators, Mr. Specter of Pennsylvania, was not here today, and as a \nconsequence we found ourselves needing help from the other side of the \naisle.\n  We needed at least one--it turns out three--Republican vote in order \nto move forward and to bring this bill to a vote. At the end of the \nday, we did not have them. We fell one vote short. We had two \nRepublican Senators who crossed the aisle and voted with us--that would \nbe the two Senators from Maine, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe--and no \nother Republicans who would join us in trying to bring this bill to a \nclose with some closing amendments and a vote.\n  If you followed the debate on this bill, it is no surprise that the \nRepublicans are reluctant to be part of Wall Street reform. When the \ndebate started, it started with three--not one but three--straight \nfilibuster votes. Those were efforts by the Republicans to stop us from \neven bringing this issue and subject to the floor of the Senate. Many \nof us felt this discussion and debate over this bill was long overdue. \nWe know this recession has cost us dearly in the United States. We know \nit extracted $17 trillion out of the American economy.\n  We felt it personally. You felt it in your savings account, your IRA, \nyour retirement account. You saw it when the business down the street \nstarted to lay off its employees and another one closed. You noticed \nthe home across the street going into foreclosure.\n  You heard all the stories about unemployed people, maybe some in your \nown family. So we knew what this recession meant and what it cost us, \n$17 trillion. What we are trying to do with this Wall Street reform \nbill is to change the way they do business on Wall Street so we never \nface another recession such as the one we are in, brought on by the \ngreed and stupidity of the so-called banking experts on Wall Street.\n  We know what happened. Wall Street got away with murder for years, \nand taxpayers ended up holding the bag. Hundreds of billions of dollars \nout of the Treasury, out of the wallets of families across America in \nterms of tax payments, that ultimately found their way to Wall Street \nto rescue the failing businesses there.\n  Why were they failing? Well, try reading ``The Big Short'' by Michael \nLewis, one of the most popular books now in America. Mr. Lewis was in \nmy office today. He has written a number of books, and he is pretty \ngood at it. He talked about his experience sitting down with people who \nwere insiders on Wall Street who were describing what went on literally \nfor years.\n  What you think is that when you get to the top, you will find the \nsmartest people. I guess that is possible and likely. But in this case, \nwhen you got to the top, you found some of the dumbest people who were \ninvolved in constructing investment ideas that were fundamentally \nflawed, taking failing mortgages across the United States and packaging \nthem together and then trying to sell them locally and globally and \nwatching the bottom eventually fall out.\n  Lewis wrote this in this his book, ``The Big Short.'' Many of us have \nread it. He and I had a chance to talk about it today. But it was that \nkind of conduct that led to this recession that cost us all these jobs, \nthat wrecked the savings accounts of American families, that has set us \nback on our heels, and we are finally coming out of it slowly. But it \nhas cost us dearly as a nation.\n  We are trying to change the way Wall Street does business so we never \nhave to face a recession such as this again. The Republicans in the \nSenate, with only a few exceptions, have resisted our efforts to pass \nthis bill.\n  First, with three straight filibusters to stop us from bringing the \nWall Street reform bill to the floor, three efforts to stop us from \neven debating the bill, then 4 weeks of debate on the floor of the \nSenate, and I will tell you, that is rare. I have been around here for \na few years. It is very rare that you would spend 4 weeks on one bill. \nWell, this is our fourth week on this bill.\n  During that time, Senator Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking \nCommittee, has been working with Senator Shelby, the ranking Republican \nfrom Alabama, who is on the floor, and they have been going back and \nforth with amendments.\n  I think Senator Dodd said today almost 60 amendments have been \nconsidered, pretty close. A lot of different ideas have come to the \nfloor back and forth. Some Democratic amendments have been considered \nand failed, some passed. Some Republican amendments were considered and \nfailed. There were bipartisan rollcalls. It has been a real Senate \ndebate.\n  It feels good. It does not happen enough around here. This so-called \ndeliberative body spends a lot of time, such as at this moment, where \nnothing is going on, on the floor except some profound speeches by the \nMembers. What we have tried to do, during the course of this debate, is \ngive everybody a chance to bring out their point of view. Points of \nview are much different. That is OK. That is why we are here. We are \nsupposed to debate these things and vote on them.\n  I had an amendment last week, one that I have been working on for \nliterally 3 years or more, that deals with\n\n[[Page S3968]]\n\nthe credit card companies' charges to merchants and retailers. When a \ncustomer uses a credit card, they not only get credit to buy a meal, \nfor example, that restaurant has to pay a percentage of the bill, the \ncost of the meal, back to the credit card company. This interchange fee \nhas become unfair to small businesses.\n  Well, after working at it for more than a week, we finally had the \namendment called 6 days ago, and it was enacted, passed by the Senate, \nwith a vote of 64 to 33, 17 Republicans joined me. So it was a good \nbipartisan amendment. It was a surprise to many because the credit card \ncompanies and the banks that support them are very powerful. In this \ncase, they came up short. The retailers, the merchants, the convenience \nstores, the gas stations, the restaurants, grocery stores all across \nAmerica finally prevailed in this long battle against the credit card \ncompanies.\n  But that was the best of the Senate, I thought, and of course I am \npartial because my amendment passed. But it was the best of the Senate \nbecause it was a real debate and a real vote and an outcome which was \nbipartisan.\n  We felt this was a good time, in the course of the debate, to start \nwinding it down and come down to a handful of amendments, vote on them, \nand then vote for final passage so we can conference this bill, work it \nout with the House, send to it the President to be signed into law. But \nwe could not get the votes.\n  The Republicans, but for two Senators, refused to give us the votes \nto end this part of the debate and bring this bill to a final vote. It \nis frustrating. I do not know that they can argue that we have been \nunfair. We have given pretty wide berth to the Republican side to offer \nthe amendments they wanted to offer. They have offered quite a few, and \nwe have, too, on our side of the aisle.\n  So I do not think you can argue that we should not stop debate over \nfairness in the course of the debate. They might be arguing they do not \nwant a bill at all. That is possible. First, they filibustered to stop \nus from bringing the bill to the floor. Now they are basically \nfilibustering to stop us from ending the debate on the bill and bring \nit to a final vote.\n\n  I only know of several groups across the country that want to stop \nthe debate on this bill: Wall Street, the biggest credit card \ncompanies, and the biggest banks. They want to stop this bill. They \nwant to kill it. They have spent a fortune on lobbyists, roaming around \nour offices on Capitol Hill, to try to convince Members to stop this \nWall Street reform bill.\n  Well, they at least were successful today. They convinced all but two \nRepublican Senators to come to their side of the issue and to stop this \ndebate on Wall Street reform. That is unfortunate because I think the \nAmerican people expect us to get something done. They expect us to hold \nWall Street accountable, to make sure the reckless gambling by Wall \nStreet institutions that led to the loss of more than 8 million \nAmerican jobs comes to an end.\n  They want to end taxpayer bailouts once and for all. They do not ever \nwant to hear the word ``TARP'' again, unless it is something you can \nput over the top of your station wagon. They certainly do not want us \nin a situation where we are coming up with hundreds of billions of \ndollars to bail out these banks. Thanks to an amendment by Senator \nBarbara Boxer of California, one of the first, we made it clear that we \nare prohibiting any future bank bailouts under this bill. Senator Boxer \nwas a real leader on that issue.\n  I think most Americans believe we need to have an agency that is \ngoing to be here in Washington which will administer the strongest \nconsumer financial protection law in the history of the United States, \na law that will empower consumers when they go through a real estate \nclosing or sign a credit card agreement or sit down next to their son \nor daughter to sign the student loan forms or take out a loan for a \ncar, knowing they are not going to be cheated and treated poorly.\n  This agency is there to empower consumers so they are not, in fact, \nswindled out of their life savings and are not brought into legal deals \nwhich are totally unfair. We want to bring sunlight and transparency to \nshadowy markets. Some of the things we voted on will move us in that \ndirection, to start eliminating some of the trading that has gone on \nthat is an outrage.\n  I do not think business as usual is the right way to go. But the \nRepublican votes today, all but two Republican Senators voted to \ncontinue business as usual on Wall Street. They do not want this bill \nto pass. So they voted that way today. At the end of the day, 39 out of \n41 Republican Senators voted for the status quo, keep things as they \nare on Wall Street.\n  In addition, of course, we understand that Wall Street is powerful. \nWhen my amendment came up on interchange fees, the banks warned \nSenators: If you vote for the Durbin amendment, we are not going to \nsupport you; that is, contribute, in the next election campaign. That \nwas on the front page of the New York Times last Saturday. It is the \nmost bald-faced admission I have ever seen by special interest groups \nthat they are putting the pressure on Members who vote for Wall Street \nreform.\n  So I say to my colleagues: They may have won today and kept the banks \nhappy. But, ultimately, it is more than the bankers who will be voting \nin November. It is people all across America who are angry at what \nhappened on Wall Street and do not want it to happen again. They are \ngoing to remember the Senators who voted with Wall Street and those who \nvoted for reform, and today we have a rollcall that indicates it.\n  We have to make sure we make the changes that make the difference \nacross America. Some of the things that have happened here are pretty \ngraphic. Paul Krugman, a writer from the New York Times, wrote a few \nweeks ago:\n\n       The main moral you should draw from the charges against \n     Goldman, though, doesn't involve the fine print of reform; it \n     involves the urgent need to change Wall Street. Listening to \n     financial industry lobbyists and the Republican politicians \n     who have been huddling with them, you'd think that everything \n     will be fine as long as the federal government promises not \n     to do any more bailouts. But that's totally wrong--and not \n     just because no such promise would be credible.\n       For the fact is that much of the financial industry has \n     become a racket--a game in which a handful of people are \n     lavishly paid to mislead and exploit consumers and investors. \n     And if we don't lower the boom on those practices, the racket \n     will just go on.\n\n  That is why this vote today was so critically important. Those who \nwant to stick with the status quo, who want to reward the special \ninterests, who want to load up this bill with lobbyists' loopholes, \nprevailed today on this vote today by one vote on the floor of the \nSenate. There will be another vote tomorrow and maybe the day after \ntoo. The question is, Will any other Republicans, aside from the two \nSenators from Maine, break ranks and join the Democrats for Wall Street \nreform?\n  This is a once-in-a-political-lifetime opportunity. If they want to \nstand with the special interests and Wall Street to stop this reform, \nthey will certainly have to answer for it when the time comes and they \nface the voters.\n  This attempt we are making to change the rules on Wall Street is an \nattempt to empower the people of this country to help them make the \nright decisions personally and to make certain that they do not end up \nlosing their savings and their homes and their jobs because of the \ngreed and selfishness of those on Wall Street.\n  I can remember many years ago on the floor of the Senate, when I was \na brand new Senator, way in the back row there, and offered an \namendment to a bankruptcy bill. The amendment said: If you are a \npredatory lender; that is, if you violated the laws of America in the \nloans that you are making, such as mortgages, you cannot then turn \naround in bankruptcy court and recover from the debtor who has been the \nvictim of your predatory lending practices.\n  I was arguing on the floor with Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who was \nhere arguing against my amendment. He was high ranking on the Senate \nBanking Committee. He said: If the Durbin amendment passes, it is going \nto kill the subprime mortgage market in America. Well, I lost by one \nvote. If my amendment had prevailed, who knows, history might have been \na little different. That is why one vote makes a difference.\n  Today, we needed one more Republican Senator to vote for Wall Street \nreform. We had two. We needed one more. I understand two of our \nDemocratic Senators withheld their votes\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\nbecause they want this bill to be stronger. I hope they will come \naround. I hope they will vote with us. But at the end of the day, we \nonly had two Republican Senators who stepped up and said they favored \nWall Street reform.\n  Well, I lost my amendment by one vote that might have changed a \nlittle bit of financial history if it had passed. Today, we lost by one \nvote when it came to Wall Street reform.\n  We are not going to quit. President Obama is committed to it. \nDemocrats in the Senate are committed to it. Democrats in the House \nalready passed their bill. We need to get this done. It is time to stop \nthe obstructionism. It is time to stop the stonewalling. It is time to \nbring this to a close with a handful of amendments on both sides of the \naisle. Let's have an up-or-down vote, and let's get on with it. Let's \npass this bill.\n  On final passage, a number of Republicans who have been holding back \nand would not support this bill may have second thoughts. They may \ndecide they don't want to be found on the wrong side of history again; \nthat it isn't worth standing up with the special interest groups or \nWall Street lobbyists when America is crying for basic reform and \naccountability.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the distinguished majority \nwhip. I voted with him last week on the interchange fees on debit \ncards. I thought it was a good amendment. But I have to take issue. \nDon't generically accuse those of us in this body of stonewalling a \nbill or more or less being interested in looking out for Wall Street or \nanybody else.\n  A little history lesson is due. First, what brought us into this \nrecession was the subprime market, which the distinguished Senator \nmentioned, and the housing market. It happened because Members of this \nbody and the body down the way, 13 years ago, began to direct Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac to include in their portfolios a portion of \naffordable housing loans which were the words for what became subprime \nloans.\n  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae created the market that allowed Wall \nStreet to go find capital and collect that capital, put a high premium \non the capital, high interest rate, maybe 200 basis points over the \ngoing rate, but then make it a higher credit risk to lenders because \nthat is the way credit works. What happened is, those loans became \npopular, and because of a government-sponsored entity that began the \nconsumption of those loans, they proliferated. Those securities were \nsold around the world. When they collapsed, and we went all through \nthat, it was a terrible collapse. But the root of this problem is that \nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae were under the direction of the Congress as \nto what they should do in terms of the securities they owned. I am \nsaying the Congress of the United States, not pointing fingers at any \nparticular party.\n  With that being true--and I don't think anybody can dispute it--we \nhave a financial reform bill before us that exempts Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae from reform. That doesn't make any sense. If you listen to \nthe arguments to why they weren't there, it is because it was too hard.\n  These are hard times. Americans are having hard times. It is time we \ndid the hard things. It is time we not try and politically label \nMembers as friends of Wall Street or friends of Main Street. We are all \nAmericans. It is our economy. It is not just part of the economy. I \ntake issue with the labeling that takes place sometimes. Let's talk \nabout the facts that are there, one way or another. Let's let the facts \ndetermine what we do.\n  I didn't vote for cloture because I don't think it is right to leave \nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae outside the equation and incorporate every \nother business on Main Street and on Wall Street to the extent we have. \nIt is right for us to take some of the blame in the Congress. A lot of \nthis wouldn't have happened had we not directed the government-\nsponsored entities with which we had influence, and the implied full \nfaith and credit of the taxpayers would be the consumers that would \ncreate the liquidity for subprime loans.\n  My only statement to the majority whip is this: I understand facts. \nThe facts are that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae started this. They are \nexempt from this piece of legislation. I, for one, take issue with \nthat. We cannot reform and address the concerns that happened if we \ndon't address the root of the problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at the risk of a real debate, I invite the \nSenator from Georgia to stay, if he would, for a moment so we can \nengage.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have the highest respect for the Senator from Georgia \npersonally, and I thank him for his support on my interchange \namendment. We have worked on many other issues, and we will in the \nfuture. I will concede what he pointed to as a fundamental flaw, a \nmistake that was made. There was a presumption made that owning a home \nwas such a valuable American ideal--and I know your background; you \ncertainly agree with that--but we went too far. We extended the \nopportunity for home ownership to people who were not ready. We \nbelieved if we pushed them to the limit of how much they could pay, the \nhome would appreciate in value, their incomes would go up, and \neverything would work out. It turned out that gamble was wrong for some \npeople. Certainly, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as the ultimate \nguarantors of mortgages, were part of that. There is a government \nelement here. I don't question that for a moment. Certainly some blame \nlies there.\n  Blame lies with those people who overextended, bought more than they \ncould afford. They may have been misled into it, but the fact is, they \ndid it. They made mistakes.\n  Having said that, though, there were a lot of people involved in \nfinancial institutions which led them into this, misled them into this. \nNo-doc closings, where people didn't have to present a document proving \nthe amount of income they had, basically telling people: We will give \nyou a mortgage where it is; you will be paying just interest for a few \nyears, and everything will be just fine.\n  These mortgages where the interest rates would explode in the \noutyears, and people would not be able to pay, there was a lot of \nthings that went wrong there. But I hope the Senator from Georgia will \nagree that behind this bill is the notion that some things happened on \nWall Street which were outrageous. The fact that we ended up coming up \nwith somewhere in the range of $700 or $800 billion to save most Wall \nStreet institutions is an indication that things were out of hand on \nWall Street, that we never want to return to that again.\n  I will concede to the Senator from Georgia his premise. Do we need to \nreform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Yes, we do. If we don't, we will pay \ndearly for it. I don't know if we can accomplish it in this bill, \naccomplish it at this moment, but it literally has to be done. I have \nnever quarreled with that premise in the debate, nor do I question his \nstarting point that this was part of the problem that led to where we \nare today.\n  It is always the best is the enemy of the good around here. We have a \ngood Wall Street reform bill that moves in the right direction to avoid \nsome of the abuses there. To argue that it doesn't include Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac and therefore we can't support it, perhaps we just have \na different point of view. I think this is a valuable thing to do to \nmove forward. I will concede his point. He is right in what he said.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I appreciate his comment. That was my point. When I was \nlistening to the Senator's speech, I got a little irritated. Then I \nrealized I have probably done the same thing before too. I leaped over \nsome facts that belong in the debate. The fact that the Congress \ndirected Freddie and Fannie to own a percentage of their portfolio in \nsubprime loans was the source of the capital that bought the first \nsecurities that created the subprime securities. I do not argue that \nthere are not good things in this bill.\n\n  In fact, when the Senator was referring to the liar loans, it was the \nIsakson-Landrieu amendment that we\n\n[[Page S3970]]\n\nsuccessfully added to this bill that defined that a qualified loan is \nto be exempt from risk potential because it requires income \nverification, requires an employer statement that the employee is \nhired, and it requires an income ratio that is sufficient to retire \ndebt that is borrowed. I agree with the Senator.\n  My point was that when all of us make these remarks of what bills are \nand they are not, we ought to include all of the facts that are in \nthere, not just a select few. I appreciate the Senator's comments. I \nwas proud to be a part of his amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Georgia. It depends on one's \nperspective. The amendment he just described that he added to the bill \nis a valuable part of this bill. It wasn't there originally. It is now. \nI am glad it is. I am happy to support it. That is what we are trying \nto do today, to move its passage so it becomes the law of the land. But \nbecause we fell short by only two Republican votes coming forward \ntoday, we can't move forward.\n  If the position of the Senator is we should not pass his amendment or \nthis underlying bill until we reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, I am \nwith him in terms of the reformation. I don't believe it is reasonable \nto require this bill to do everything that needs to be done. That is my \nonly difference with the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The Senator and I might differ on points, but I defer to \nthe Senator. I wish I had the control to control votes, but I don't. \nThere were two on his side and two on ours. There are people with \nhigher pay grades who were responsible for that. I wanted to make the \npoint about what is, to me, a serious issue with regard to the bill and \nsomething that should be considered in the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I don't mean to jump into these things, but \nI wanted to make a couple comments. First, no one knows real estate \nlike Johnny Isakson. I have had the privilege of working with the \nSenator from Georgia over the last year or so on a couple of proposals, \none of which I think made a big difference. That was the $8,000 tax \ncredit for home buyers to go out and encourage home purchases and \nsales. It has proven to be pretty worthwhile. I haven't seen the latest \ndata. My friend is far more familiar than I. But, clearly, for most \nAmericans, home ownership is the single largest and most important \nacquisition they ever have. It is the greatest wealth creator for most \nAmericans.\n  As the Senator from Illinois points out, that additional trajectory \nis where we increased this, and people used that equity to help with \nretirement and student loans, a variety of things they need as a \nfamily.\n  As my friend from New Hampshire pointed out the other day, there is a \nhistory here. I acknowledge that we in Congress have failed in this \nresponsibility, actually going back to around 2003. The Senator from \nAlabama can correct me. There were various attempts. A good friend of \nours, the former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, \nMike Oxley, a Republican, offered one as chairman. They actually got \none done.\n  It was a bipartisan bill in the House on Fannie and Freddie in 2005. \nIt then came to the Senate, and things got bogged down over here. There \nwere attempts, including the former chairman from Alabama, who offered \na proposal. Senator Sarbanes did. It went back and forth. We didn't get \nthe job done.\n  It is important to remember during times such as this, when we are \nnot hesitant to point an accusing finger at other institutions for \nhaving helped create this problem, we in Congress collectively did not \nget the job done with Fannie and Freddie. I join with my colleague from \nIllinois, it is important we acknowledge that if we are going to be \naccusing other institutions for malfeasance or misfeasance. In this \ncase, we should have done a better job.\n  Here is the problem. As the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out--I \nam quoting him--this issue was ``too complex'' for this bill. The \nreason is, we don't know what to replace it with at this point. There \nare a number of ideas floating around because all of us recognize we \nneed to have a housing financing system in place. In the absence of \nhaving any in place, around 97 percent of all home mortgages are backed \nby the Federal Government today. If we pull that rug out at this \nparticular juncture, I don't know what the implications would be. I \nthink they would be pretty profound.\n  We are caught in this quandary, acknowledging the need to reform and \nreplace Fannie and Freddie, the present structure, but doing so without \nreplacing it with something could pose serious problems in the very \narea the Senator from Georgia is so knowledgeable in; that is, how do \nwe continue to promote home ownership.\n  What we did--and I would be the first to admit it, being the author \nof the provision--is fairly anemic in light of what we need to be \ndoing. We have said we are mandating that there be a study completed \nwith options presented within 6 months. The President of the United \nStates I have heard say on one occasion, maybe more, this is a top \npriority come next January for him and this Congress to grapple with.\n  Again, there is nothing there that absolutely requires it, but it \nwill be essential that we come up with options.\n  I recall the previous Secretary of the Treasury advocating for a \npublic utility concept to replace Fannie and Freddie. I would be the \nlast one to tell others whether that is a good idea or a bad one. But \nit is one option. Clearly, we have conflicting goals--one of home \nownership, which is the very one we all support, combined with the goal \nof satisfying shareholder interests. What happened is, shareholder \ninterests trumped in a sense the kind of manageable, sensible policy \nthat would promote home ownership at the expense of returning \ninvestments for shareholders. That is also a laudable goal. But to have \nthe same entity have the two missions, one for home ownership, one for \na return on investment, they collided with each other. We have ended up \nin the situation we are in without a great answer--yet--as to how to \nreplace it.\n\n  The point I guess I am making is, I totally agree with the Senator's \npremise. The question is, as chairman of this committee, how do we fix \nthis thing at this point? And I have never suggested with this bill we \nwere dealing with every financial problem in the country. It would be \nan impossible task for us to take that on.\n  So all I can say to the Senator, as someone who will not be here next \nJanuary, is, I hope whoever sits at this desk--or at this desk, across \nfrom my good friend from Alabama chairing the committee--that this will \nbe a priority of our Banking Committee. I cannot dictate that. I cannot \neven bind the next Congress constitutionally with anything we require \nhere. But my fervent hope would be--I cannot think of a more important \npriority for the Banking Committee of the Senate than to have the \nreform of Fannie and Freddie because I think we are going to be in \ndeeper and deeper trouble both financially and in terms of home \nownership if we do not. So whatever else happens here in the next few \ndays with regard to this bill, I want to thank my friend from Georgia \nfor his continuing commitment to the issue and to say that I associate \nmyself with his concerns. I would also plead that failure to deal with \nthat issue in this bill ought not to be justification for walking away \nfrom all the other good things we are trying to accomplish in this \nlegislation.\n  I thank the Senator for hanging around and listening to this \nfilibuster.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one comment?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. First of all, my comments were directed specifically to \nthe speech of the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DODD. I did not hear it. I apologize.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. They were not a criticism of the chairman, first of all. \nI think the ranking member would certainly agree with that.\n  Second of all, there is some good news that was received today, \nthanks to the Senator's help, because I could not have done it if it \nwere not for him. We had the tax credit we extended and ultimately \npassed, which terminated April 30. As to the numbers from the most \nrecent month: the average sales price in the 20 top markets in America, \nfor the first time in 36 months, went up by six-tenths of 1 percent. So \nthe distinguished chairman deserves a lot of credit for that \ncontribution as well.\n\n[[Page S3971]]\n\n  I was just making sure there was a voice over here that reminded \neverybody of what got us in this to begin with in the context of the \nspeech of the Senator from Illinois. It was never a criticism of the \nchairman of the committee.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my friend from Georgia.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3746, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I understand the body may, in a little \nbit, take up the Whitehouse amendment, and out of an abundance of \ncaution, to be sure my statement is in the Record, I want to speak to \nthat amendment for a second.\n  I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nWhitehouse, and all of his work. But the amendment he has proposed \nbasically says that the usury rate to apply to any loan shall be the \nusury rate in the State, which will take us back to a period of time \npost 1982 or 1983, when interest rates went to 16 and three-quarters \npercent. And because usury rates in the United States were 8, 9, or 10 \npercent in most of the States, there was no money. Usury rates are the \nmaximum ceiling that a loan can do.\n  Now we have South Dakota and Delaware where there are no usury rates. \nMost banks are chartered there and, therefore, interest rates on loans \nare negotiable and competitive. There are a lot of people in public \nlife who think: Well, if you put a ceiling on interest rates, you are \nguaranteeing the consumer that they are not going to pay a high rate. \nWhat you are usually guaranteeing the consumer is, they are going to \npay a fixed rate, which is whatever the government says is the usury \nrate. Floors set by government become ceilings, and ceilings by \ngovernment become rates.\n  So I want to caution the body, in considering the Whitehouse \namendment, to be very careful what you ask for. Because what you will \ndo is you will put an end to credit in the housing business and in many \nother types of instruments in the United States, and you will have 50 \ndifferent usury regimens in 50 different States. You will create a \nfixed-rate environment by the government, not by competition. What \neffectively happens is a rise in the cost of credit, a rise in the cost \nto the consumer, and in the end what I am sure is intended to be \nbeneficial to the consumer will, in fact, cost the consumer more money \nand be disastrous to the expansion of credit in a time where there is \nvery little credit as it is.\n  I would respectfully ask the body to consider what we went through in \nthe mid-1980s and early 1980s with interest rates. We hope they will \nnot go up again, but if they do, credit is more important than no \ncredit at all, and usury rates can assure you have no credit at all and \nend up having the unintended consequence of having a negative impact on \nthe economy.\n  I would oppose the Whitehouse amendment, should it come up tonight, \nand I hope the Members of the body will consider the history lesson \nfrom the early 1980s.\n  Mr. President, I yield back and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3746, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nresume consideration of the Whitehouse amendment No. 3746 and that the \namendment be further modified with the changes at the desk; that it \nalso be in order for the Ensign amendment to be considered; that they \nbe debated for a total of 10 minutes, with time equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Whitehouse and Ensign or their designees; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote \nin relation to the Whitehouse amendment, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to the Ensign amendment; that each of these amendments be \nsubject to an affirmative 60-vote threshold; that if they achieve that \nthreshold, then they be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; that if they do not achieve that threshold, then they \nbe withdrawn; further, that prior to the second vote, there be 4 \nminutes of debate, divided as specified above, and the second vote be \nlimited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 1325 between lines 20 and 21 insert the following:\n       ``(g) Transparency of OCC Preemption Determinations.--The \n     Comptroller of the Currency shall publish and update not less \n     frequently than quarterly, a list of preemption \n     determinations by the Comptroller of the Currency then in \n     effect that identifies the activities and practices covered \n     by each determination and the requirements and constraints \n     determined to be preempted.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter \n     one of title LXII of the Revised Statutes of the United \n     States is amended by inserting after the item relating to \n     section 5136B the following new item:\n\n``Sec. 5136C. State law preemption standards for national banks and \n              subsidiaries clarified.''.\n\n       (c) Usurious Lenders.--Section 5197 of the Revised Statutes \n     of the United States (12 U.S.C. 85) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Any association'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(a) In General.--Any association''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Limits on Annual Percentages Rates.--Effective 12 \n     months after the date of enactment of this subsection, the \n     interest applicable to any consumer credit transaction, as \n     that term is defined in section 103 of the Truth in Lending \n     Act (other than a transaction that is secured by real \n     property), including any fees, points, or time-price \n     differential associated with such a transaction, may not \n     exceed the maximum permitted by any law of the State in which \n     the consumer resides. Nothing in this section may be \n     construed to preempt an otherwise applicable provision of \n     State law governing the interest in connection with a \n     consumer credit transaction that is secured by real \n     property.''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that there \nbe no further amendments to those amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Further, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be \nin order for the Cantwell amendment No. 4086 to be called up for \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Whitehouse amendment is now the pending question.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Rhode Island for \nhis passionate and persistent advocacy for his amendment. He has been \nextremely eloquent.\n  However, I have to oppose the Senator's amendment. I do it with some \nreluctance.\n  Nobody has been more concerned about credit card abuses in this body \nthan I have.\n  We passed strong, new legislation to address many of these abuses \njust last year, and the Federal Reserve has written regulations to \nimplement these protections.\n  In addition, the Wall Street Reform Act includes a strong new \nconsumer financial protection bureau that will, for the first time, \ncreate an independent entity devoted to empowering consumers with \nclear, transparent, easy-to-understand disclosures so that they can \nmake smart financial decisions for themselves.\n  This bureau will help achieve the goals that Senator Whitehouse hopes \nto accomplish with his amendment, though it will not be done in exactly \nthe way he seeks to do it.\n  By creating better disclosures, by eliminating confusing fine print, \nthe consumer bureau will help consumers become better shoppers. This \nwill help drive down credit card interest rates.\n  In addition, as Senator Whitehouse knows, the Wall Street Reform Act \nwill use States as partners in enforcing new rules under the consumer \ntitle. This will put additional cops on the beat to make sure American \nfamilies are not lured into buying unfair, deceptive, or abusive \nfinancial products.\n  In sum, the underlying legislation would be a giant leap forward for \nconsumer protection.\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\n  But as I have said earlier, I reluctantly oppose Senator Whitehouse's \namendment. One of the reasons is that this amendment does not actually \naddress the problems that it is supposed to solve. It would only stop \nnational banks from exporting interest rates. Out-of-state savings \nassociations and state-chartered banks can still charge a higher \ninterest rate. So it does not restore the states ability to enforce \ninterest rate caps against all out-of-state lenders. And it does not \nlevel the playing field for local lenders as intended.\n  I believe that the Wall Street Reform Act represents an important \nstep forward for consumer protection. If, indeed, the Whitehouse \namendment is even the right thing to do, we should not make the perfect \nthe enemy of the very good.\n  Finally, let me say that the abuses of which Senator Whitehouse \nspeaks are very real. The interest rates so many of these banks charge \nare outrageous. However, it is a complex issue that will not be solved \nin this debate.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's pass the Wall Street reform bill into \nlaw, so the consumer bureau can start doing its work and start helping \nthe American people make smart financial choices.\n  Mr. President, I have great respect for our colleague. He has worked \nhard on this amendment. He has been trying to get attention over the \npast 2 weeks, probably as much as anyone in this Chamber, and he is \nanxious to be heard. So I am grateful to my colleagues for giving him \nthe opportunity to have this debate on a legitimate issue; that is, \ninterest rates. All of us, of course, hear from our constituents about \nthe rising and higher cost of interest rates.\n  This amendment takes an approach that would, in effect, repeal the \nso-called Marquette decision reached a number of years ago that allowed \nfor interest rates to basically be determined by the home State of a \ncorporation. That the corporation actually does business in other \nStates is not terribly relevant to whatever the rates would be, but \nwhatever the rate is in the State where their corporate headquarters is \ndomiciled is what would determine that. I may not be stating that quite \nas eloquently as the author of the amendment will, but it is words to \nthat effect. I am getting tired after days of describing these.\n  While I respect the effort here, there are some problems associated \nwith this, in my view, so I will vote against the Whitehouse amendment. \nBut, again, I respect my colleague's proposal. I respect the efforts he \nhas made and believe there is legitimacy to the issue. I am not sure, \nhowever, the approach is the correct one to pursue.\n  With that, I see my colleague and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the chairman. I guess as the old song goes, \nwhat a long, strange trip it has been to get to this vote. But I \nappreciate very much the chairman's efforts and the ranking member's \nefforts that have allowed this vote.\n  I thank the cosponsors who have helped me work so hard on this \nlegislation: Senators Cochran, Merkley, Durbin, Sanders, Levin, Burris, \nFranken, Brown of Ohio, Menendez, Chairman Leahy, Senators Webb, Casey, \nWyden, my distinguished senior colleague from Rhode Island, Jack Reed, \nSenator Udall of New Mexico, and Senator Begich, who is now Presiding.\n  I am very proud of that support and very proud of the support of over \n200 consumer groups for this legislation, including AARP, Consumers \nUnion, National Consumer Law Center, Public Citizen, and Common Cause. \nThat is a blue ribbon group of consumer supporters, and it is just the \ntip of the iceberg of a large organizational push to correct an \ninequity in American society that arises out of an inadvertent loophole \nthat the Supreme Court created 30 years ago.\n  This vote presents all of my colleagues a clear, stark choice. Whose \nside you are on will be defined by your vote on this amendment. If you \nare on the side of the big out-of-State banks that are marketing into \nyour home State and that are forcing your home State citizens to pay 30 \npercent and over interest rates even though those interest rates might \nbe illegal under your home State laws, then you will cast your vote \nagainst this amendment and in favor of those big out-of-State banks \ncharging that exorbitant interest. If you support it, you are taking \nthe side of your home State citizens who are being gouged right now by \nbanks over which they have no control because they are pitching their \nbusiness into the home State from elsewhere and the home State laws, \nbecause of this peculiar Supreme Court loophole, have been held not to \napply. If you vote in favor of this amendment, you are voting in favor \nof your home State's laws.\n  This is not a reach of Federal authority. This is traditional \nfederalism and States rights to honor the laws of the States whose \ncitizens sent us here and who wish to protect them from abusive \ninterest rates.\n  If you vote in favor of this amendment, you are also voting in favor \nof your community banks, your local State-chartered banks, which don't \ntake advantage of this loophole, which don't create their headquarters \nin a faraway State that gives them zero consumer protection restriction \nand allows them to target their marketing against the laws of the home \nState. The home State banks have to play by the laws of the home State, \nand this would level the field for your home State banks.\n  So it is a pretty clear and stark choice: Are you for your home State \ncitizens, are you for your home State's laws, are you for your home \nState's banks or do you want to take your stand today with the big out-\nof-State banks whose interest rates are unregulated, whose behavior is \nin conflict with 200 years of American history and every civilized \nlegal tradition dating back into the mists of time? Every major \nreligion has limited usury. Every civilized legal code has restricted \nthe ability of one individual to harm another by charging them \nexorbitant interest rates when they are in need.\n  This is the aberration we are facing right now. We have the chance to \nfix it. We have the chance to fix it in a way that is justified and \nproven by 202 years of history in the United States and thousands of \nyears of tradition before that. I urge my colleagues to stand up for \ntheir fellow citizens against these out-of-State banks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), the Senator from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Menendez), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter), \nand the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the pending business is the Ensign \namendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not been called up at this time.\n  Mr. DODD. I would suggest that we call up the Ensign amendment. I \nunderstand the Senator from Nevada has a modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask that the amendment be called up for immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4146 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1273, delete lines 17-18.\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I wish to be recorded as opposing the \nEnsign amendment. Whether I have been speaking to community banks, \nconsumer advocates, or businesses, I have been clear that the purpose \nof the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would be to ensure that \neveryone plays by the same rules. I said I would not support carve-\nouts. It was clear from the initial drafts of the Ensign amendment that \nthis was intended to exempt certain lending by casinos from the \njurisdiction of the bureau. The underlying bill already clearly exempts \nsellers of nonfinancial products who offer financing in support of \nthose sales. It is my belief that the Ensign amendment could undermine \nthat goal and I therefore oppose it.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, from what I understand the amendment is \nagreeable to both sides.\n  Mr. DODD. With the modification.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. It is already modified. I would tell the chairman of the \ncommittee, through the Chair, the modification was the amendment we \ncalled up. So it is actually the modified amendment at the desk.\n  Mr. DODD. I understand there is no need for a recorded vote, we can \nhave a voice vote?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. That is correct. I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4146) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and move to \nlay that motion upon the table.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have an announcement to make. Members of \nthe Senate, we have made progress today. We are going to come in at \n9:30 tomorrow. There will be amendments processed until we leave to go \nto the joint session. We will come back as soon as that is over and \ncontinue working on this bill.\n  At 2:30 I will move to reconsider the vote we had earlier today. So \nwe will have a cloture vote at 2:30 tomorrow. Following that, of \ncourse, we have to look forward to when we are going to move to the \nbill of Senator Inouye and Senator Cochran, on which I understand they \nhave done some good work. That will be the next matter we move to. No \nfurther votes this evening.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 4003, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nconsider the Vitter amendment No. 4003, and that the amendment then be \nmodified with the Pryor amendment No. 4087; that the amendment, as \nmodified, then be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that title X of \nthe bill would give the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection the \npower to regulate not only businesses that provide financial products \nand services to consumers but also companies that provide services to \nthese businesses. I understand that the purpose of giving the bureau \nthe power to regulate these service providers is to prevent a financial \nservice company's use of a service provider to frustrate the efforts of \nthe bureau to protect consumers because important functions that bear \ndirectly on consumers are contracted out to service providers. I also \nunderstand that this approach is designed to provide the bureau with \nauthority comparable to the authority that Federal bank regulators have \nover service providers to banks under the Bank Service Company Act.\n  Am I correct in understanding that it is the intent of the service \nprovider provisions for the bureau to focus on the service contracted \nout, not the terms of the service contract? Further, am I correct that \nit is not the intent of the service provider provisions for the bureau \nto subject the terms of business-to-business contracts, or the \nagreements between providers of consumer financial products and \nservices and their own service providers, to the jurisdiction of the \nbureau, even when there may be disputes between these business parties?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the gentleman is correct; the purpose of the \nBureau of Consumer Protection is to protect consumers and not to \naddress disputes between businesses over the terms of their business \nrelationships.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of an \namendment that Appropriations Committee Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman \nCochran, Financial Services and General Government Appropriations \nsubcommittee Chairman Durbin and I filed to the Restoring American \nFinancial Stability Act regarding funding for the Securities and \nExchange Commission--SEC.\n  This amendment would strike the section that would permit the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission to be ``self-funded''. I have \nserious concerns with this provision because it would allow the SEC to \nself finance and thus avoid the scrutiny and oversight of the \nappropriations process. Our bipartisan amendment would keep SEC funding \nas part of the appropriations process and maintain critical \ncongressional oversight.\n  The financial crisis and its consequences have served to remind us \nall of the critical requirement for more robust oversight and \nheightened transparency throughout our regulatory environment and \nfinancial system. As we have seen, most recently in the review of the \nSEC's actions in the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme, there is clearly a \ndemonstrated need for more Congressional oversight. The annual budget \nand appropriations process ensures congressional oversight of vital \nenforcement agencies such as the SEC. As noted by Vice Chairman \nCochran, our amendment recognizes the need to ``regulate the \nregulators'' and to hold accountable those regulators who fail do their \njobs correctly.\n  And the recent inspector general investigation revealing that high-\nlevel SEC employees spent their days looking at porn rather than \npursuing wrong-doing demonstrates the need for oversight.\n  The appropriations process subjects the SEC to a review which must \nbalance the requests of the Commission against the competing needs of \nother Federal agencies. That process, however, is grounded in the \nConstitution and the very foundation of our government is based on the \nconcept of checks and balances. While I appreciate the accomplishments \nChairman Shapiro has achieved during her tenure as chairman, funding \ndecisions and the process by which they are made, cannot be based on \nany particular holder of an office, but rather on government-\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\nwide needs and the best interests of the taxpayers.\n  Allowing the SEC to have sole authority to negotiate the fees that \nsupport its operations with the institutions they regulate precludes \nany meaningful oversight by Congress and invites conflicts of interest. \nReports by the Government Accountability Office and the SEC Inspector \nGeneral regarding enforcement procedures and internal controls over \nfinancial reporting highlight the need for congressional oversight. \nAlso, the GAO has noted that SEC's current system of transaction-based \nfees could provide revenues that are less predictable and more \ndifficult to estimate than the assessments used by bank regulators to \nfund their operations.\n  While the budget and appropriations process is challenging for all \nFederal agencies, Senator Durbin and I, in our roles as Chairman and \nranking member of the Financial Services and General Government \nAppropriations subcommittee, have given careful review to all resource \nrequests from the SEC and consistently placed a high priority on its \nrequests, recognizing the agency's critical enforcement role. For the \ncurrent fiscal year, Congress provided $1.11 billion, a 25 percent \nincrease over the fiscal year 2007 level and $85 million above the \namount that the President and the SEC requested.\n  The financial reform bill passed by the House of Representatives does \nnot include a provision for the SEC to be self-funding. I share the \nhope of Chairman Inouye and all of the cosponsors of this amendment \nthat the conference agreement on the bill before the Senate will \npreserve the critical oversight function inherent in the appropriations \nprocess. I urge that the SEC self-funding provision be dropped from the \nbill in conference to ensure that Congress can continue to play an \nimportant role in the oversight of our financial regulators.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, I filed two important amendments \nto the pending Wall Street reform legislation to protect the identity \nof whistleblowers and to ensure transparency and accountability to the \nAmerican public when the government investigates allegations of \nfinancial fraud. My amendments on whistleblower confidentiality strike \na careful balance between the need to protect the identity of \nwhistleblowers and the public interest in transparency. I hope the \nSenate will work to include these amendments in the bill.\n  The recent economic crisis has revealed how corporate greed must be \nreigned in on Wall Street. While average Americans were suffering, many \nWall Street investment banks and insurance companies went to great \nlengths to hide their shaky finances from stockholder and government \nregulators. Whistleblowers serve an important role in exposing \nfinancial fraud. This underscores the importance of ensuring that \nwhistleblowers are provided the necessary protections to come forward \nwith allegations of financial fraud and ensuring that the American \npublic has access to critical information about corporate financial \nwrongdoing.\n  My amendments addresses two key problems with the whistleblower \nprovisions in the bill: First, the bill would prevent whistleblowers \nfrom obtaining information that they themselves have provided to \ngovernment regulators under any circumstances. Second, the bill creates \nan unnecessary exemption to the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, that \nwould, in some cases, shield critical information about financial fraud \nfrom the public indefinitely.\n  To strengthen the protections for whistleblowers, my amendments \nstrike the well-intended, but overbroad confidentiality provisions in \nsections 748(h) and 922(h) of the bill, and replace those provisions \nwith new language that both protects the confidentiality of \nwhistleblower identity information and ensures the public's right to \nknow. Specifically, the amendments require that government regulators \nmay not disclose whistleblower identity information without the \nwhistleblower's consent. My amendments also require that the government \nnotify the whistleblower if information about the whistleblower's \nidentity will be shared with other government agencies, or foreign \nauthorities assisting with an investigation.\n  To ensure the public's right to know, my amendments remove language \nfrom the bill that, in some cases, would change law and could \nindefinitely shield critical information about financial fraud from the \npublic. My amendments do not change existing disclosure requirements \nand exemptions under FOIA, but, rather, they require that government \nregulators treat information that reveals the identity of \nwhistleblowers as confidential. Other information that a whistleblower \nprovides to the government would remain subject to the existing \ndisclosure requirements and exemptions under FOIA and other Federal \nlaws.\n  My amendments are modeled after whistleblower protection provisions \nthat Congress has previously and overwhelmingly enacted in other recent \nlegislation. The amendments also complement the whistleblower \nprotections already included in the bill.\n  My amendments are supported by a broad coalition of open government \norganizations, including--the Project on Government Oversight, Citizens \nfor Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, OpenTheGovernment.org, \nPublic Citizen, the Progressive States Network, Common Cause, National \nCommunity Reinvestment Coalition, Consumer Action, OMB Watch, National \nFair Housing Alliance, and Americans for Financial Reform. I thank each \nof these organizations for their support of the amendments and for \ntheir work on behalf of whistleblowers and the public's right to know.\n  As the Senate concludes debate on critical reforms to head off the \nWall Street fraud and abuses, we must work to ensure accountability and \nopenness in how the government responds to this crisis. The \nimprovements in my amendments will ensure that whistleblowers have the \nprotection that they deserve and that financial firms will be held \naccountable. I urge all Senators to support these open government \namendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a support letter signed by \nseveral open government organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 11, 2010.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: We, the undersigned organizations, \n     write to thank you and share our support for the amendment \n     (SA 3297) you have offered to the Restoring American \n     Financial Stability Act, S. 3217. The amendment will replace \n     two dangerous provisions that would unnecessarily limit \n     public access to critical information and place a gag on \n     whistleblowers with language that instead would provide \n     authentic confidentiality and protection of the identity of \n     whistleblowers. We believe that in order to both preserve \n     government accountability and encourage whistleblowers to \n     come forward this amendment must be incorporated into S. \n     3217.\n       Tucked inside two provisions to establish whistleblower \n     incentives and protections to rightly encourage the flow of \n     information of wrongdoing to the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission (SEC) and the Commodities Futures Trading \n     Commission (CFTC) are poison pill secrecy measures. Sections \n     748(h)(2) and 922(h)(2) bar the public and the whistleblower \n     from ever being able to obtain information about \n     investigations if the government never acts. If a \n     whistleblower faces retaliation there would be no access to \n     government records needed to prove status as a whistleblower. \n     If there is no action due to inept bureaucracy, fraud, \n     collusion, or worse, there would be no way to hold the \n     government accountable.\n       We must preserve the ability of the whistleblower to gain \n     access to the information if retaliation occurs, as well as \n     public access to hold the Commission and other government \n     agencies accountable, especially if there is no investigation \n     or the investigation leads to no further judicial or \n     administrative action. Your amendment would do just that, and \n     would remove the blanket gag orders creating a permanent seal \n     and government secrecy.\n       Moreover, as you know, it is unnecessary to add additional \n     exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in these \n     whistleblower provisions. Forty years of jurisprudence have \n     proven the FOIA's exemptions (amended in 1986 to expand \n     protection for law enforcement records) have stood the test \n     of time, fairly and effectively balancing the agency's \n     interests in confidentiality and personal privacy rights with \n     the public's right to know.\n       Investigations occur across the federal government every \n     day and information pertaining to the administrative stages \n     of these investigations is protected. In more than two \n     decades, no agency has expressed concern over unwarranted \n     access to investigative information during an open \n     investigation. We not only see no justification to hide \n     closed\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\n     investigations of possible wrongdoing in the financial \n     industry, whether or not provided by a whistleblower, but \n     find this to be at cross-purposes with making government \n     regulation of the financial industry more transparent and \n     effective.\n       We thank you for this amendment to preserve whistleblower \n     rights, public access to information, and government \n     accountability, and for your commitment to protecting the \n     public's right to know.\n           Sincerely,\n         Project on Government Oversight (POGO); Citizens for \n           Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW); \n           Government Accountability Project (GAP); \n           OpenTheGovernmentorg; Public Citizen; Progressive \n           States Network; Common Cause; National Community \n           Reinvestment Coalition; Consumer Action; OMB Watch; \n           National Fair Housing Alliance; Americans for Financial \n           Reform.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to make a point of \nclarification on my GASB amendment. This amendment creates a new and \nstable funding source for the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. \nThe GASB serves an important function to provide pronouncements on \naccounting and financial reporting for State and local governments, and \ntheir work should be commended. However, I must clearly make a point \nthat for the purpose of this amendment, and the work of the GASB, that \nfinancial reporting be defined as the ``presentation of objective \nhistorical financial data on the financial position and resource \ninflows and outflows of State and local governments, as well as \ninformation necessary to demonstrate compliance with finance-related \nlegal or contractual provisions.''\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof two amendments to the Restoring American Financial Stability Act \nthat seek to ensure there is greater transparency around how \ninternational companies are addressing issues of foreign corruption and \nviolent conflict that relate to their business. Creating these \nmechanisms to enhance transparency will help the United States and our \nallies more effectively deal with these complex problems, at the same \ntime that they will also help American consumers and investors make \nmore informed decisions.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that my colleagues agreed yesterday \nto accept the first amendment, sponsored by Senator Brownback. This \namendment specifically responds to the continued crisis in the eastern \nregion of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Despite efforts to curb the \nviolence, mass atrocities and widespread sexual violence and rape \ncontinue at an alarming rate. Some have justifiably labeled eastern \nCongo as ``the worst place in the world to be female.'' Several of us \nin this body, including Senators Brownback and Durbin and I, have \ntraveled to this region and seen first-hand the tragedy of this \nrelentless crisis. Increasingly, American citizens are also learning of \nthe devastating situation in eastern Congo and are actively engaged to \nbring about policy changes. I am pleased to see Americans so engaged on \nthis issue.\n  One of the underlying reasons this crisis persists is the \nexploitation and illicit trade in natural resources, specifically \ncassiterite, columbite-tantalite, wolframite and gold. The United \nNations Group of Experts has reported for years how parties to the \nconflict in eastern Congo continue to benefit and finance themselves by \ncontrolling mines or taxing trading routes for these minerals. In \nresponse to these reports, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution \n1857, 2008, encouraging Member States ``to ensure that companies \nhandling minerals from the DRC exercise due diligence on their \nsuppliers.'' Over a year ago, Senator Brownback, Senator Durbin, and I \nteamed up to author legislation that would do just that: the Congo \nConflict Minerals Act, S. 891.\n  Senator Brownback's amendment is taken from that bill, but includes \nmodifications based on discussions with representatives from industry, \nU.S. Government agencies, and the Banking Committee. The amendment \napplies to companies on the U.S. stock exchanges for which these \nminerals constitute a necessary part of a product they manufacture. It \nwill require those companies to make public and disclose annually to \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission if the minerals in their \nproducts originated or may have originated in Congo or a neighboring \ncountry. Furthermore, it will require those companies to provide \ninformation on measures they have taken to exercise due diligence on \nthe source and chain of custody to ensure activities involving such \nminerals did not finance or benefit armed groups.\n  I recognize that this conflict minerals problem is a complex one, \ngiven the importance of this trade to the local economy in eastern \nCongo and given the extensive supply chains and processing stages \nbetween the source and end use of these minerals. The Brownback \namendment was narrowly crafted in consideration of those challenges, \nand it includes waivers and a sunset clause after 5 years. However, I \nbelieve strongly that the status quo in eastern Congo is unacceptable \nto the people there and it should be to us as well. We have put \nfinancial resources toward mitigating this crisis, but we need to get \nserious about addressing the underlying causes of conflict. The \nBrownback amendment is a significant, practical step toward doing that, \nand I thank my colleagues for their support of it. I thank Senator \nBrownback for his longstanding leadership on these important \nhumanitarian issues.\n  The second amendment, led by Senator Cardin and Senator Lugar, is \ndifferent than the Congo amendment but would complement it. This \namendment would require companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges to \ndisclose in their SEC filings extractive payments made to foreign \ngovernments for oil, gas, and mining. This information would then be \nmade public, empowering citizens in resource-rich countries in their \nefforts to combat corruption and hold their governments accountable. In \nfar too many countries, natural resource wealth has fueled corruption \nand conflict rather than growth and development. This so-called \n``resource curse'' is especially problematic in Africa, and in 2008, I \nchaired a subcommittee hearing on this very topic. I said then that we \nmust look for ways that the United States can use our leverage to push \nfor greater corporate transparency in Africa's extractive industries.\n  In addition to helping countries combat the ``resources curse,'' it \nis also in our national interest to improve transparency in the \nextractive industries. The amendment was drawn from an important piece \nof legislation, the Energy Security through Transparency Act, S. 1700. \nThe bill was given this title because enhancing transparency in the \nextractive industries can have real benefits for U.S. energy security. \nThis will ultimately create a more open investment environment and \nincrease the reliability of commodity supplies. Energy security is a \ntopic that Senator Lugar and his staff have worked on for years, and we \nall know how central it is to our national security. I thank Senator \nLugar and Senator Cardin for their work on this important amendment, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend and thank Senators \nDodd and Shelby for their extraordinary leadership and tenacity in \nshepherding this complex bill through the arduous floor consideration \nprocess over the past several weeks, and for their years of work to \nreach this point. Their task has not been an easy one. The amendment \nprocess was delicate at times, but certainly collegial and fair. The \nfruits of our labor are an improved product emerging from the Senate, \nalbeit not a perfect one. Invariably, in a bill of this scope and \nsignificance, some matters were not fully addressed or resolved to \neveryone's satisfaction.\n  I am disappointed that we did not consider an important bipartisan \namendment submitted by Senators Inouye and Cochran relating to the \nfunding of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Section 991 of the bill would permit the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to be ``self-funded,'' thus removing a critical oversight \nrole for the Appropriations Committee. The Inouye-Cochran amendment \nwould have stricken this section.\n  Retention of the language in the bill is objectionable for a host of \nreasons. Section 991 removes the role of Congress in dictating how \npotentially limitless funds, up to whatever level is generated in fees \nunder a budget that would be set by the SEC itself, are to be spent. It \nwould make the agency potentially less, rather than more, responsive to \ncongressional priorities.\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\nSpending would go unmonitored. The critical role of the Office of \nManagement and Budget for apportionment of funds would also disappear.\n  Congress oversees Federal agencies primarily through two distinct but \ncomplementary processes--authorizations and appropriations. The \nauthorizing committees are responsible for creating a program, \nmandating the terms and conditions under which it operates, and \nestablishing the basis for congressional oversight and control. The \nappropriations committees and subcommittees are charged with assessing \nthe need for, amount of, and period of availability of appropriations \nfor agencies and programs under their jurisdiction.\n  Exempting an agency from the appropriations process reduces \nopportunities for annual congressional oversight. The appropriations \nprocess, with its annual budget justifications, hearings, and markups, \nprovides a useful layer of congressional review and scrutiny of agency \noperations, in addition to what is provided by the authorizing process. \nIn the appropriations subcommittee I am privileged to chair, I have \nconducted annual hearings on the SEC's budget through which I have \nlearned much about this agency's requirements, particularly its \nstaffing and information technology needs.\n  Allowing an agency to set its own budget is an abdication of the \nconstitutional responsibility of the legislative branch of government. \nIt is a dangerous surrender of the congressional power of the purse.\n  It does not make sense--in this comprehensive bill aimed at \nbolstering oversight, transparency, and accountability of the world \nthat the SEC regulates--that we would weaken, in fact, abolish, the \nvital role of the appropriations committee to evaluate the resource \nneeds and spending by this agency.\n  This comprehensive bill confers significant new responsibilities on \nthe SEC as a financial regulator. Shouldn't we evaluate on a regular \nbasis whether this agency is responsive to the mandates we impose? \nShouldn't Congress determine if the SEC has adequate funds and is using \nthose resources wisely, in the right places, to accomplish its mission? \nUnder section 991, we toss out the important, longstanding role and \nresponsibility of appropriators to do just that.\n  Public opinion of the SEC as a vigilant investor-protector has been \nless than stellar in recent years. The SEC has been under withering \ncriticism over the past years with the release of the inspector \ngeneral's report chronicling the SEC's failure to identify Madoff's \nPonzi scheme as far back as 1992. The recent IG report on the Stanford \ncase is another example of years of SEC inaction to act against a Ponzi \nscheme.\n  Under the leadership of Chairman Mary Schapiro, the SEC is making \nstrides to turn things around. I think Chairman Schapiro is doing a \ncommendable job leading the charge for reform. However, she herself \nadmits that there's more to do and much room for improvement. Our \ninterest in leaving the appropriations oversight process intact is not \na verdict on Chairman Schapiro's ability to effect meaningful change.\n  Those who contend that the SEC ought to set its own budget argue that \nrequiring the agency to compete for funding in the annual \nappropriations process will lead to chronic underfunding and limited \nflexibility. Recent experience suggests to the contrary. My Financial \nServices and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee has placed \nhigh priority on the budgets of several agencies including healthy and \njustified increases above the President's request. For the current \nfiscal year, Congress provided $1.111 billion, a 25-percent increase \nover the fiscal year 2007 level--and $85 million above the amount that \nthe President and the SEC requested. We have also acted promptly to \nconsider and approve reprogramming and internal reorganization \nrequests.\n  Those who claim that the SEC has been shortchanged in past years \nshould consider that in each of the past 7 years, the SEC has had \nsubstantial amounts of unobligated balances from prior years. This \nmeans there were appropriations provided that the SEC was not able to \nuse.\n  The SEC has not been reauthorized since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of \n2002, when Congress authorized $776 million for fiscal year 2003. \nInstead of putting this agency beyond the reach and oversight of \nappropriators, we should act to authorize levels of robust funding for \neach of the ensuing 5 years--like the House did--and thus clearly \nexpress the intent of Congress that this agency be adequately funded.\n  Reauthorization of suitable and reasonable funding levels would \ncertainly send a strong signal about the amount of resources that \nCongress believes are necessary for this agency to thrive and grow to \nmeet its important mission and satisfy its many new responsibilities. \nLeaving this agency unchecked in its budgeting and spending activities \nis simply the wrong way to go.\n  I trust that as we reconcile this bill with the version adopted in \nthe House that this matter will be favorably resolved and that the \nconference agreement will acknowledge and preserve the critical \noversight role of the appropriations process.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to further discuss the reasons for my \nvotes against two amendments relating to credit rating agencies, \namendment No. 3991 creating a new credit rating agency board and \namendment No. 3774 which eliminates references to requiring credit \nratings from certain financial laws.\n  First, I want to emphasize that I agree with my colleagues that \nerroneous credit ratings on asset backed securities played a central \nrole in the financial crisis and that we need to improve the regulation \nof credit ratings.\n  Credit rating agency reform is an extremely important area of the \nRestoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010 passed by the \nBanking Committee. It has 40 pages of carefully constructed credit \nrating reforms to improve regulation, transparency and accountability. \nLet me highlight some of these strong provisions, as they would improve \nthe SEC, reform rating agencies and empower investors.\n  The SEC will have a new Office of Credit Ratings to regulate and \npromote accuracy in ratings, staffed with experts in structured, \ncorporate and municipal debt finance. The office's own examination \nstaff will conduct annual inspections and the essential findings will \nbe available to the public. The SEC will have expanded authority to \nsuspend the registration of agencies that consistently produce ratings \nwithout integrity. The SEC will also have more authority to sanction \nratings agencies that violate the law, including managers who fail to \nsupervise employees.\n  Credit rating agencies will have to comply with tough new \nrequirements. Rating agency boards will be subject to new rules for \nindependence. Rating analysts must work separately from those who sell \nthe firm's services. Agencies must publicly disclose when they \nmaterially change their procedures or methodologies or make significant \nerrors, and update their credit ratings accordingly. Agencies must \nestablish strong internal controls for following procedures and \nmethodologies and have these attested to by their CEO. The agencies \nmust establish hotlines for whistleblowers and retain complaints about \nthe firm's work for regulators to examine. Agency compliance officers \nmust report annually to the SEC. Agencies must consider credible \ninformation they receive from sources other than the issuers in making \nthe ratings, rather than relying only on the issuer's representations.\n  Investors will be empowered. Agencies must disclose their track \nrecord of ratings in a way that is comparable so that users can compare \nratings for accuracy across different agencies. The agencies must \ndisclose more about their ratings assumptions, limitations, risks, \nhistoric accuracy and factors that might lead to changes in ratings. \nInvestors will also have access to due diligence reports prepared at \nthe request of underwriters on asset backed securities, as well as have \nthe benefit of having a new pleading standard when they need to file \nsuit.\n  The recommendations and ideas underlying these provisions have been \nconsidered by the Banking Committee over the course of more than 3 \nyears. The committee held hearings and received analyses from countless \nexperts, regulators, ratings agencies, investors and other users. The \nprovisions in this bill have been extensively vetted, improved and \nrefined.\n\n[[Page S3978]]\n\n  Regarding conflicts of interest, when I served as ranking member of \nthe Securities Subcommittee, I worked with then-Banking Committee \nChairman Shelby and others to enact legislation to control or eliminate \ncredit rating agency conflicts of interest. Through the Credit Rating \nAgency Reform Act of 2006, we added section 15E to the Securities \nExchange Act of 1934 so that they are controlled or eliminated if they \ncannot be effectively managed. It gave to the SEC the power:\n\n     to prohibit, or require the management and disclosure of, any \n     conflicts of interest relating to the issuance of credit \n     ratings by a nationally recognized statistical rating \n     organization, including, without limitation, conflicts of \n     interest relating to--\n       (A) the manner in which a nationally recognized statistical \n     rating organization is compensated by the obligor, or any \n     affiliate of the obligor, for issuing credit ratings or \n     providing related services;\n       (B) the provision of consulting, advisory, or other \n     services by a nationally recognized statistical rating \n     organization, or any person associated with such nationally \n     recognized statistical rating organization, to the obligor, \n     or any affiliate of the obligor;\n       (C) business relationships, ownership interests, or any \n     other financial or personal interests between a nationally \n     recognized statistical rating organization, or any person \n     associated with such nationally recognized statistical rating \n     organization, and the obligor, or any affiliate of the \n     obligor;\n       (D) any affiliation of a nationally recognized statistical \n     rating organization, or any person associated with such \n     nationally recognized statistical rating organization, with \n     any person that underwrites the securities or money market \n     instruments that are the subject of a credit rating; and\n       (E) any other potential conflict of interest, as the \n     Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public \n     interest or for the protection of investors.\n\n  The SEC has adopted several rules under the act to address NRSRO \nconflicts of interest, amending those rules twice since they took \neffect in 2007. The first set of amendments took effect in 2009, and \nthe second set of amendments will go live in a few weeks. Among other \nthings, in addition to prohibiting certain conflicts of interest \noutright, these rules require each NRSRO--issuer-pay and subscriber-\npay--to publicly disclose certain additional conflicts, as well as the \npolicies and procedures it has adopted to address those conflicts. \nPursuant to these rules, NRSROs must separate their business activities \nfrom their rating activities, so that the analysts, who operate in \nteams, to reduce the influence of any one person, do not negotiate, \narrange or discuss fees. Commission rules designed to address the \nissuer-pay conflict include prohibitions on issuing credit ratings in \ncertain circumstances, such as when: the NRSRO has received 10 percent \nor more of its revenue from an issuer or underwriter; the NRSRO makes \nrecommendations on how to structure an instrument; the analyst has \nparticipated in fee negotiations with the issuer; or the analyst has \nreceived gifts from the issuer. There also is a new requirement that \ninformation provided to a hired NRSRO to rate a structured finance \nproduct be made available to any other NRSRO to allow the other NRSRO \nto determine an unsolicited--i.e., non-issuer-paid--credit rating.\n  Since these rules have been in effect for only a short time, we have \nyet to see their full benefits. And if more regulation is needed, the \nSEC has authority to go farther under the 2006 law.\n  During the consideration of S. 3217, amendment No. 3808 was \nintroduced and passed to direct the SEC to set up a new credit rating \nagency board, which prohibits the private selection by issuers of \nrating agencies for initial asset-backed securities ratings and creates \na system in which the board makes semi-random ratings assignments to \nnationally recognized statistical ratings organizations that it deems \nto be qualified. The intention is to eliminate negative effects of \nconflicts of interest in the issuer pay business model.\n  I applaud my colleague's goal of developing a solution to this \nproblem of poor credit ratings. And I appreciate his devoting a \ntremendous amount of effort in a short period of time to craft his \nsolution.\n  However, this novel approach raises many questions which have yet to \nbe answered. While I support Senator Franken's goal, I could not vote \nfor this amendment while many questions and uncertainties remained \nabout the impact of this new type of ``self-regulatory organization.''\n  Credit ratings have a tremendous impact on the credit markets \nnationally and internationally. Any significant change in their \npreparation should be the subject of full examination before enactment. \nUnresolved questions raise the potential for unintended or unforeseen \nconsequences. In addition to my own concerns, I have received \ncommunications from many interested parties, such as a letter from the \nInvestment Company Institute that I will ask to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Let me identify some of the questions that, it seems to me, exist \nwith respect to the board and its operations:\n  Will the board's semi-random assignment of ratings work cause the \nrating agencies to lose their incentive to do a superior job, which \notherwise might get them more initial ratings business?\n  Will the ``reasonable'' fees that the legislation directs the SEC to \nset for QNRSROs to charge issuers generate sufficient revenues for \nrating agencies of different types of securities to perform the quality \nof ratings they would like? In this connection, a technical question, \nwhat standards should the SEC use to determine the fees--a \n``reasonable'' return on capital? prices comparable to other ratings \nagencies? sufficient to hire staff at compensation levels comparable to \nother businesses or to Federal regulatory agencies?\n  How many of the 10 nationally recognized statistical rating agencies \nare expected to register as ``qualified nationally recognized \nstatistical ratings organizations''? Will the registrants be sufficient \nto make the board meaningful? Will some ratings agencies choose not to \nregister with the board, to avoid board assessments, costs, regulatory \nburden or for other reasons, and would this affect the quality of \nratings? Will some smaller rating agencies not register because they \nare unable to meet the board's qualification standards? I understand \nthat after the passage of the amendment, one of the NRSROs has \nderegistered from providing ratings on asset-backed securities.\n  The amendment uses an issuer-pay business model. How would the \namendment affect the rating agencies that use a different business \nmodel, such as a subscriber pay model, and want to provide ratings on \nasset backed securities?\n  What will be the costs of operating the new board? The legislation \nauthorizes the board to assess QNRSROs, and how much is the board \nexpected to assess the QNRSROs to cover its budget? How much would it \nadd to the current cost of ratings? What is the expected budget of a \nboard that must hire financial experts who evaluate rating agencies' \nqualities, institutional and technical capacity and performance and \nimplement systems that can make ratings assignments to QNRSROs on \npotentially hundreds of thousands of securities in a timely fashion?\n  How many different categories of securities are expected to be rated \nand how many rating agencies are expected to be qualified to rate each \ntype? If only two agencies have the capacity or experience to rate some \ncomplex types of securities, and an issuer wants two ratings, what will \nbe the purpose of the SRO randomly choosing a rating agency?\n  How will the board attract, afford and retain top experts who would \nbe needed to perform its statutory mandates to assess the effectiveness \nof ratings methodologies and assess the accuracy of ratings?\n  The board would be given substantial powers such as rulemaking \nauthority over NRSROs, allocating business to NRSROs or rejecting an \nNRSRO's ability to obtain business. Is it certain that the board's \nestablishment and exercise of authority are consistent with the \nConstitution?\n  The legislation states that the board will be a ``self-regulatory \norganization.'' What will be the impact on the new board on the \nnumerous statutory and regulatory restrictions and obligations in the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 affecting ``self-regulatory \norganizations''?\n  What will be the interaction of the legislation's mandate that the \nboard assess the accuracy of the credit ratings provided by QNRSROs and \nthe ``effectiveness of the methodologies used by'' QNRSROs and the \nexisting Federal law that states the SEC may not ``regulate the \nsubstance of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by\n\n[[Page S3979]]\n\nwhich any nationally recognized statistical rating organization \ndetermines credit ratings''?\n  In this legislation, the Federal Government will obligate one private \nparty to deal with another private party of the government's choosing \nin a private business transaction. Does this raise any potential legal \nquestions?\n  It is my understanding that beginning in June, all NRSROs will also \nhave to publish a history of their rating actions since the NRSRO \nregulatory regime was instituted in June of 2007. When enough data \nbecomes available, issuers can see which NRSRO's ratings were more \nreliable. Would the board be expected to be better able to identify \nbetter QNRSROs than issuers who examine this data on their own?\n  These are some of the questions that existed at the time of the vote. \nWhile I am sure these questions will be fully addressed in the months \nand years ahead, and hope that the board is successful, these questions \nare significant and created uncertainty, with the potential for \nsignificant unintended consequences. Accordingly, I felt it \ninappropriate as chairman of the Banking Committee to support the \namendment.\n  Amendment No. 3774, which the Senate passed, removes provisions in \nbanking and securities statutes that use credit ratings of NRSROs to \ndistinguish the creditworthiness of obligors or debt instruments and \nwould replace these provisions with standards promulgated by banking \nagencies--in the case of the banking statutes--and the SEC--in the case \nof securities statutes.\n  I agree with the intent of the provision to reduce investor reliance \non NRSRO ratings in making investment decisions. However, I feel that \nit is unwise to eliminate all of these statutory requirements without a \nprior study of the consequences. Therefore, I voted against this \nprovision.\n  I think it more prudent to carefully study this matter and remove \nratings that are found to be unnecessary. This is why I included in S. \n3217 passed by the Banking Committee a required 2-year GAO study to \nexamine the scope of provisions in Federal and State law as to the \nnecessity and purposes of NRSRO ratings requirement; which requirements \ncould be removed with minimal disruption to the financial markets; the \npotential impacts on the financial markets and on investors if the \nrating requirements were rescinded; and whether the financial markets \nand investors could benefit from the removal of such requirements. This \nwould be followed by reviews by the Federal financial regulators of all \nregulations requiring the use of an assessment of a security, \nrequirements related to credit ratings and alternative standards of \ncreditworthiness that are based on market-generated indicators. The \nbill required each agency to modify references to credit ratings in \ntheir regulations and, when removed, to use an appropriate standard of \ncreditworthiness not related to credit ratings, if possible and \nconsistent with the statute or the public interest. This seems to me \nthe more appropriate way to improve the ratings situation while taking \nappropriate steps to avoid unforeseen and unintended consequences.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from the Investment Company Institute to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Investment Company Institute,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman, Senate Banking Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Banking Committee, Russell \n         Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Re Senate Amendment #3991, Credit Ratings.\n\n       Dear Senators: I am writing on behalf of the Investment \n     Company Institute, the national association of U.S. \n     investment companies, to express our concerns with elements \n     of Senate Amendment 3991 to S. 3217 of the Restoring American \n     Financial Stability Act of 2010 (RAFSA). The Institute is \n     highly supportive of the majority of rating agency reforms \n     contained in the RAFSA, which focus primarily on disclosure \n     and transparency of ratings and the ratings process. As long \n     as ratings continue to play an important role in the \n     investment process, they should provide investors and other \n     market participants with high-quality, reliable assessments \n     of the credit risks of a particular issuer or financial \n     instrument. We are concerned, however, that Amendment 3991, \n     which would create a Credit Rating Agency Board to regulate \n     structured finance product ratings, may conflict with the \n     RAFSA, create confusion for investors, and hinder competition \n     in the rating agency space. Presented at the last minute, the \n     changes contemplated by the Amendment would significantly \n     alter the current regulatory regime for rating structured \n     finance products and could, ultimately, affect the rating \n     process for other debt securities.\n       First, to properly address concerns about conflicts of \n     interest, poor disclosure, and lack of accountability, the \n     Institute believes the reform of the regulatory structure for \n     rating agencies must be applied in a uniform and consistent \n     manner and should apply equally to all types of rated \n     securities. This uniformity and consistency is not only \n     critical to improving ratings quality and allowing investors \n     to identify and assess potential conflicts of interest, but \n     also to increasing competition among rating agencies. By \n     focusing solely on structured finance securities, the \n     Amendment would create a different set of rules for different \n     segments of the rated marketplace which, among other issues \n     discussed below, could create confusion among investors.\n       Second, establishing an additional and distinct oversight \n     system for ratings of structured finance securities, as \n     outlined in the Amendment, does not improve investor access \n     to information about these securities. The Institute believes \n     that issuers, in addition to credit rating agencies, have a \n     role to play in the effort to increase transparency and \n     disclosure about structured finance products, as well as for \n     other debt instruments. To this end, we have recommended that \n     the Commission expand the disclosure of information to \n     investors by rating agencies. We also have recommended that \n     the Commission take additional steps to provide investors \n     with increased information by requiring increased disclosure \n     directly by issuers to investors, and requiring the \n     disclosure be in a standardized format where appropriate. In \n     its recent proposal to revise the asset-backed securities \n     regulatory regime, for example, the Commission has proposed \n     to do just that--expand and standardize issuer disclosure in \n     public and private offerings of asset-backed securities--and \n     we commend the Commission for its efforts.\n       Third, we are concerned that having a Board assign a rating \n     agency to a structured finance product stifles competition by \n     denying the market of two or more ratings on a security and \n     perhaps differing opinions and insights. Investors should be \n     encouraged to pick and choose investment transactions using, \n     to the extent they desire, the ratings they receive from the \n     various rating agencies, not a single agency. Further, this \n     approach creates the appearance of a ``seal of approval'' for \n     the assigned rating by placing a government imprimatur on the \n     rating, regardless of the proposed disclaimer contemplated by \n     the Amendment. The fact that the Amendment would permit \n     unsolicited ratings of an assigned security becomes \n     meaningless under the proposed framework; as in the status \n     quo, it will rarely, if ever, be done.\n       Fourth, a Board designating a rating agency allows for \n     politicizing the rating process, even if it is by a lottery \n     or rotation, whereby the Board could be biased on how it \n     chooses the ``preferred'' rating agency. Conflicts can arise \n     because Board members may have a strong interest in ensuring \n     favorable ratings for a particular issuer or security. \n     Consequently, we do not perceive an advantage to the proposed \n     Board-model over the existing rating agency models, all of \n     which possess various beneficial and detrimental \n     characteristics.\n       Fifth, what will be the criteria used for determining the \n     ``best performer'' for purposes of assigning a rating agency \n     to a new issue? Is an ``A1'' rating more correct than an \n     ``A'' rating? How would the Board define success or failure? \n     Performance of debt securities in the municipal market, for \n     example, has as much to do with structure and maturity of the \n     security as with its credit. Drawing a line in the structured \n     finance market would be even more difficult because of the \n     complexity, diversity, and novelty of this market. Further, \n     who would be responsible for surveillance under this model--\n     the Board, the Commission, the rating agencies?\n       We believe that education regarding the characteristics and \n     limitations of a rating would be of more value to investors \n     than the operational and policy concerns raised by the \n     Amendment. In the end, credit ratings are informed opinions \n     which play a significant role in the investment process. \n     Accordingly, the Institute has repeatedly stated that \n     improving disclosure and transparency about ratings and the \n     ratings process may be the most important reform for \n     improving the quality and reliability of ratings. Public \n     disclosure of this information allows investors and market \n     participants--the consumers of ratings--to more effectively \n     evaluate a rating agency's independence, objectivity, \n     capability, and operations. Such disclosure also serves as an \n     additional mechanism for ensuring the integrity and quality \n     of the credit ratings themselves.\n       We appreciate the substantial progress made in the RAFSA to \n     improve the ratings\n\n[[Page S3980]]\n\n     process and we look forward to continuing to work with the \n     Senate for the benefit of investors in this area.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Paul Schott Stevens,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/19/senate-section/article/S3980-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, Al Gunderson was a paratrooper, a blackjack \ndealer, a sailor and a voracious reader. He was a lawyer, a justice, a \nmentor and a teacher. He was a humanitarian. And he was a loving \nhusband to Lupe for 45 years and a wonderful father to Randy. Of all \nthe determined leaders I have met in Nevada, no one was tougher than \nAl. No one was funnier. And no one worked harder than he did.\n  His wife, Lupe, told me this week about one memory from their time in \nCarson City. A young man came up to her once and asked why he kept \nseeing Al's Jeep at the courthouse at 3 a.m. But everyone knew the \nanswer: Al Gunderson worked round the clock. It would be more strange \nnot to see his car at the office.\n  The man who as chief justice presided for 6 years over the highest \ncourt in our State believed strongly in the phrase that watches over \nthe entryway of the highest court in our Nation: Equal justice under \nlaw. He dedicated his life in public service to making sure everyone \ngot a fair hearing and a just ruling. During his 18 years on the court, \nhe steered it away from elitism and shaped it as a forum for everyday \nNevadans. And if that meant standing up for the little guy, all the \nbetter.\n  He was a staunch advocate for civil rights. He used his passion for \nthe law to groom future lawyers and judges as a professor at \nCalifornia's Southwestern University. And the same year Al was sworn in \nand joined the Nevada Supreme Court, he established the Nevada Judges \nFoundation to extend to more in our State the opportunity to serve as \njudges, especially in rural communities.\n  Al found his way to Nevada by way of Minnesota, where he was born of \nhumble means; Nebraska, where he earned his law degree; and Chicago, \nwhere he began his legal and public service career with the Federal \nTrade Commission. We are fortunate that he did.\n  My friend and mentor and our State's former Governor, Mike \nO'Callaghan, used to call Al Gunderson a human being first and an \noutstanding legal mind second. He was right. Al Gunderson brought honor \nnot only to the title of justice but also the pursuit of justice.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my \nremarks today to the National Policy Conference of The Nixon Center and \nThe Richard Nixon Foundation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       A central tenet of the Obama Administration's security \n     policy is that, if the U.S. ``leads by example'' we can \n     ``reassert our moral leadership'' and influence other nations \n     to do things. It is the way the President intends to advance \n     his goal of working toward a world free of nuclear weapons \n     and to deal with the stated twin top priorities of the \n     Administration: nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism. \n     This morning, I want to test this thesis--to explore whether, \n     for example, limiting our nuclear capability will cause \n     others who pose problems to change their policies.\n       To begin the discussion, let me mention just three specific \n     examples of things the administration has done to ``lead by \n     example.''\n       First, the Administration's Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) \n     changed U.S. declaratory policy to limit the circumstances \n     under which the U.S. would use nuclear weapons to defend the \n     nation on the theory that if we appear to devalue nuclear \n     weapons, other states will similarly devalue them and choose \n     not to obtain them. The downside, of course, is that such \n     emphasis on nuclear weapons only reminds states, including \n     rogue regimes, of their value.\n       Second, the central point of the START agreement, was a \n     significant draw down of our nuclear stockpiles. And, the \n     Administration has already been talking about a next phase \n     that could even include reductions by countries in addition \n     to the U.S. and Russia.\n       Third, President Obama wants to commit the U.S. never again \n     to test nuclear weapons under the CTBT so that, hopefully, \n     others will follow our example.\n       I'll discuss these three examples in more detail in a \n     minute.\n       Obviously, if the theory is wrong, we could be risking a \n     lot. For example, we could be jeopardizing our own security \n     and the nuclear umbrella that assures 31 other countries of \n     their security. Ironically, as our capacity is reduced, their \n     propensity to build their own deterrent is increased--the \n     opposite of what we intend.\n       We could be sacrificing our freedom to deploy the full \n     range of missile defenses we need by agreeing to arms control \n     agreements like START or other agreements or unilateral \n     actions like the U.S. statement on missile defense \n     accompanying the START treaty.\n       Were we to ratify the CTBT, we would forever legally give \n     up our right to test weapons. That's a very serious \n     limitation.\n       The point is, leading by example means sacrifices on our \n     part that could have significant consequences. The question \n     is whether the risks are justified.\n       Zero nukes: what does President Obama want to achieve with \n     this strategy? Barack Obama has long advocated zero nuclear \n     weapons going all the way back to his writings as a college \n     student in 1983. In fact, he wrote then that the drive to \n     achieve a ban on all nuclear weapons testing would be ``a \n     powerful first step towards a nuclear free world.'' He's even \n     cast it in moral terms, saying that ``as a nuclear power, as \n     the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the \n     United States has a moral responsibility to act.''\n       There are four big assumptions here: that the Global Zero \n     idea, a world without nuclear weapons, is necessarily a good \n     thing; that such a world could realistically be achieved; \n     that our leadership here will help to reestablish previously \n     lost moral force behind U.S. policy; and that, if we lead by \n     example, others will follow.\n       The first three assumptions need to be carefully examined; \n     though this morning, I will focus only on the last.\n       Suffice it to say the following about the first three \n     assumptions: first, is ``zero'' really desirable? If nuclear \n     deterrence has kept the peace between superpowers since the \n     end of World War II, which itself cost over 60 million lives \n     by some estimates, are nuclear weapons really a risk to peace \n     or a contributor to peace?\n       Second, since the know-how exists to build nuclear weapons \n     and they can't be disinvented, is it really realistic to \n     think they could be effectively eliminated? For example, if \n     we get near to zero, any nation that can breakout and build \n     even a few nuclear weapons will become a superpower.\n       And the superpowers themselves will find it difficult to \n     get close to zero. For example, if Russia deploys ten extra \n     nuclear weapons today, that's not a big deal, we have 2,200 \n     deployed. If, however, each side is at 100 weapons, and one \n     side deploys an extra ten, that's a significant military \n     breakout. And while we will have 1,550 deployed weapons under \n     the new treaty, and China will still have only several \n     hundred, as we go lower, China has every incentive to build \n     up quickly and become a peer competitor to the U.S. How do we \n     deal with these problems? It's not clear we know.\n       Third, do we really have to ``restore our moral \n     leadership'' and is it necessarily more moral or moral at all \n     to eschew weapons that have been a deterrent to conflict, but \n     the elimination of which could make the world again safe for \n     conventional wars between the great powers? Again, World War \n     2 cost an estimated 60 million lives. After 1945, the great \n     powers have been deterred from war with each other.\n       These three questions deserve full debate--but, it is the \n     last assumption I want to explore today--that if we lead, \n     others will follow.\n       Put another way: is the world just waiting for the U.S. to \n     further limit or eliminate its nuclear weapons? Is it true \n     that if we lead by example, others will follow, and nuclear \n     weapons will cease to exist? And, does our credibility in the \n     world depend on taking these actions?\n       The President outlined his vision in an interview with the \n     New York Times last year: ``it is naive for us to think that \n     we can grow our nuclear stockpiles, the Russians continue to \n     grow their nuclear stockpiles, and our allies grow their \n     nuclear stockpiles, and that in that environment we're going \n     to be able to pressure countries like Iran and North Korea \n     not to pursue nuclear weapons themselves.''\n       The first problem with that is that it's factually wrong--\n     we are not growing our nuclear stockpiles, we're reducing \n     them, and we have been for years. The second problem is that, \n     notwithstanding our reductions, others are not following \n     suit.\n       One of the first places President Obama chose to lead was \n     to modify our approach to the use of nuclear weapons in his \n     new Nuclear Posture Review. I previously mentioned his new \n     policy of non-use against certain kinds of non-nuclear \n     attacks.\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\n       A second feature of the NPR was to artificially take off \n     the table some necessary options like replacement of nuclear \n     components to make them more reliable and safe. This is \n     leading by example that other nuclear powers aren't following \n     and we shouldn't be doing if we want to ensure that our \n     weapons will do what we want them to do.\n       The Administration's next step was signing the NEW START \n     treaty, with significant reductions to our deployed warheads \n     and delivery vehicles and potential limitations on missile \n     defense. But Russia was going to reduce its numbers with or \n     without the treaty--so we should not conclude their acts were \n     because we led by example. And it remains to be seen whether \n     what we gave up will be worth the ostensible ``reset'' in our \n     relations.\n       And, after NEW START, there is another arms control treaty. \n     Let me quote Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller \n     in a speech titled ``The Long Road from Prague'': ``The \n     second major arms control objective of the Obama \n     Administration is the ratification of the Comprehensive \n     Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). There is no step that we \n     could take that would more effectively restore our moral \n     leadership and improve our ability to reenergize the \n     international nonproliferation consensus than to ratify the \n     CTBT.''\n       Is it true we have acted badly and must atone to restore \n     our moral leadership? Here's what we've done in disarmament \n     already: the U.S. has reduced its nuclear weapons stockpile \n     by 75 percent since the end of the Cold War and 90 percent \n     since the height of the Cold War (this doesn't even include \n     the NEW START figures). The U.S. has not conducted a nuclear \n     weapons test since 1992. It has not designed a new warhead \n     since the 80s nor has it built one since the 1990s. We have \n     pulled back almost all of our tactical nuclear weapons, and \n     in the new NPR, we will retire our sea launched cruise \n     missile.\n       And what has this ``leadership'' gotten us? Has it \n     impressed Iran and North Korea? Has it kept Russia and China \n     and France and Great Britain and India and Pakistan from \n     modernizing (and in some cases growing) their nuclear weapons \n     stockpiles?\n       Russia is, in fact, deploying a new multipurpose attack \n     submarine that can launch long range cruise missiles with \n     nuclear warheads against land targets at a range of 5,000 \n     kilometers . . . just barely missing the threshold to be \n     considered a strategic weapon under the New START treaty. Of \n     course, a tactical nuclear weapon has a strategic effect if \n     it is detonated above a U.S. or allied city.\n       Will Pakistan or North Korea ratify the CTBT just because \n     the U.S. does? Not likely. In fact, both nations continued \n     their nuclear weapons tests after the U.S. unilaterally \n     stopped testing and even after the U.S. signed the CTBT.\n       Have these steps motivated our allies to be more helpful in \n     dealing with real threats like Iran and North Korea and with \n     nuclear terrorism? If we ratify CTBT, would Great Britain \n     suddenly have a new motivation to help us more on Iran? If we \n     cut more nuclear weapons from our stockpile would France now \n     be willing to cut back on its force de frappe?\n       Was Russia willing to discuss its tactical nuclear weapons \n     as part of the current START treaty? Russia's President has \n     said that ``possessing nuclear weapons is crucial to pursuing \n     independent policies and to safeguarding sovereignty.'' In \n     fact, Russia appears to be as difficult as ever, announcing \n     that it will build a nuclear reactor in Syria on the same day \n     that the U.S. announced it will begin nuclear cooperation \n     with Russia.\n       Has all of our work toward disarmament impressed Turkey to \n     play a constructive or obstructive role in reining in Iran?\n       The recent Nuclear Security Summit saw no meaningful new \n     commitments because of our newfound moral leadership. In fact \n     the most the Administration could say for it is 47 nations \n     signed a non-binding communique.\n       And with regard to the Non Proliferation Treaty review \n     conference, which is underway as we speak in New York, will \n     our moral leadership bring us any benefit there? It is not \n     encouraging to see the conference devolve into a discussion \n     of Israel's nuclear weapons program as opposed to Iran's.\n       When countries have cut back their nuclear weapons \n     programs, it was for other reasons, namely, their own \n     security interests or economic requirements. Nations, with \n     the exception of the U.S. it seems, take actions that they \n     perceive to be in their best interests. They do not change \n     their national security posture merely because of U.S. \n     disarmament. They may even observe these steps as weakness \n     and opt to double down on their aggressive outlaw actions as \n     a result.\n       For example, Russia agreed to the limits in the new START \n     treaty, but, as I noted, that was only because it was already \n     going down to those levels, not because of some U.S. moral \n     leadership.\n       Nor did South Africa abandon its nuclear weapons program \n     because of our leadership--it was because of the fall of the \n     apartheid regime.\n       Did Libya end its program because we opted not to go ahead \n     with RNEP or RRW? No, Libya saw 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq \n     enforcing UN Security Council Resolutions on nuclear \n     proliferation and feared it would be next.\n       These same interests, security and commercial, also dictate \n     nations' actions with regard to the nuclear terrorism and \n     proliferation issues. For example, Russia says that an Iran \n     with nuclear weapons is a threat. And it will go along with \n     some sanctions, e.g., sanctions that raise the global price \n     of energy, of which Russia is the world's leading exporter--\n     but it won't go along with sanctions cutting off Iran's flow \n     of weapons, which Russia sells in great quantity.\n       And even a European country like Germany would like the \n     U.S. to remove from that country the tactical nuclear weapons \n     we deploy there for the defense of NATO, but, at the same \n     time, is actually growing its economic links to Iran--and it \n     appears willing only to impose sanctions agreed to by the \n     U.N. and the E.U.\n       Bottom line: there is no evidence our moral leadership in \n     arms control and disarmament will convince countries to set \n     aside their calculations of the impact of nuclear \n     proliferation and nuclear terrorism on their national \n     security, and help us address these threats.\n       The Administration's security agenda is based on the notion \n     of the U.S. making substantive changes to our national \n     security posture in the hopes of persuading others to act, \n     frequently contrary to their economic or security interests.\n       But this good faith assumption that others will reciprocate \n     is not supported by any evidence--it is certainly not \n     informed by any past experience. Before big changes are made \n     to our security posture, the President owes it to the \n     American people to explain exactly how the changes will \n     improve our security. It cannot just be a matter of change \n     and hope. Too much is at stake.\n       I also think the American people will be quite surprised to \n     learn that their nation lost its moral leadership somewhere \n     and that concessions to their security are now necessary to \n     reestablish it.\n       As a complete aside, the most recent example of the Obama \n     Administration's thinking in this regard is the Assistant \n     Secretary of State for Democracy and Human Rights' comparison \n     of the immigration law passed by my state of Arizona to the \n     systematic policy of abuse and repression by the ``People's \n     Republic of China.''\n       As you can tell by now, I am not much impressed with the \n     notion that we can achieve important U.S. security goals by \n     leadership which stresses concession by the U.S. Rather than \n     change and hope, I adhere to the philosophy of President \n     Reagan epitomized in the words ``peace through strength.''\n       A strong America is the best guarantor of a peaceful world \n     that has ever been known. And there is nothing immoral about \n     strength that keeps the peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/19/senate-section/article/S3981-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3981-S3982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ELENA KAGAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today I announced that the Senate \nJudiciary Committee will hold its confirmation hearing on the \nnomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to be Associate Justice on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court beginning June 28.\n  I have reached out to Senator Sessions, the committee's ranking \nRepublican, to discuss the scheduling of this hearing, and we were \nfinally able to meet yesterday. We worked cooperatively to send a \nbipartisan questionnaire to the nominee last week. We joined together \nto send a letter yesterday to the Clinton Library asking for files from \nSolicitor General Kagan's work in the White House during the Clinton \nadministration. I will continue to consult with Senator Sessions to \nensure that we hold a fair hearing.\n  This is a reasonable schedule that is in line with past practice. The \nhearing on the nomination of Justice Kennedy was held just 33 days \nafter his designation. The hearing on the nomination of Justice \nGinsburg was held 36 days after her nomination. And the hearing on the \nnomination of Justice Rehnquist to be Chief Justice was held 42 days \nafter his nomination. When John Roberts was first nominated to succeed \nJustice O'Connor, I agreed with the Republican Chairman to proceed 49 \ndays after his designation even though he had not yet even received his \nanswer to the committee's questionnaire. After Hurricane Katrina, the \ndeath of Chief Justice Rehnquist, and the withdrawal of that initial \nnomination and his nomination, instead, to be Chief Justice, the \ncommittee proceeded just days after his nomination and only 55 days \nfrom his earlier designation. Of course, last year we proceeded with \nthe hearing on the nomination of Justice Sotomayor 48 days after she \nwas designated. Senate Republicans said that hearing was fair and was \nconducted fairly. This year, I am scheduling the hearing to start 49 \ndays after Elena Kagan's nomination.\n  There is no reason to unduly delay consideration of this year's \nnomination. Justice Stevens announced on April 9 that he would be \nleaving the Court. He wrote that he would resign effective the day \nafter the Supreme\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\nCourt concludes its summer session at the end of June. He noted that \n``it would be in the best interests of the Court to have [his] \nsuccessor appointed and confirmed well in advance of the commencement \nof the Court's next Term,'' and I wholeheartedly agree with Justice \nStevens. That is in the best interests of the Court and the country.\n  Since Justice Stevens' announcement in early April, there has been a \ngood deal of work done in preparation. The President announced his \nchoice a month later, on May 10. During that month, much was written \nand said about the eventual nominee who was identified from the outset \nas a leading candidate for nomination. When the President made it \nofficial, Senate Republicans were quick to react. Indeed, one Senate \nRepublican announced on the very day that the President announced his \nselection that the Senator opposed Solicitor General Kagan's nomination \nand would be voting against confirmation. Extreme rightwing interest \ngroups and commentators have been savaging her since before the \nnomination was announced, and that has not subsided. The misstatements \nand harsh characterizations make proceeding sooner rather than later \nall the more important. Solicitor General Kagan deserves the earliest \nopportunity to respond to these attacks and to set the record straight. \nThe American people deserve a process that is fair and thorough but not \nneedlessly prolonged. In selecting this hearing date, I am trying to be \nfair to all concerned.\n  I also want to conclude the process without unnecessary delay so that \nSolicitor General Kagan might participate fully in the deliberations of \nthe Supreme Court in selecting cases and preparing for its new term. I \nwant to complete Senate consideration, as Justice Stevens suggested, so \nthat the new Justice is confirmed well in advance of the commencement \nof the Supreme Court's next term, so that she may organize her \nchambers, select her clerks, and fully participate in the work of the \nCourt.\n  This schedule is also in keeping with the time line Senator McConnell \nrecommended in 2005, when President Bush made his first nomination to \nthe Supreme Court and Senator McConnell, then the Republican whip and \nnow the Senate Republican leader, said that the Senate should consider \nand confirm the President's Supreme Court nomination within 60 to 70 \ndays. We worked hard to achieve that. The final Senate vote on Chief \nJustice Roberts' nomination was 72 days after he was designated. \nJustice Sotomayor was likewise confirmed 72 days after she was named. \nSeventy-two days after the nomination of Elena Kagan will be July 21.\n  Unlike the late July nomination of John Roberts, this nomination by \nPresident Obama was announced on May 10. Unlike the resignation of \nJustice O'Connor, which was not announced until July, the retirement of \nJustice Stevens was made official on April 9. So in this instance the \nvacancy arose almost 3 months earlier than in 2005. After bipartisan \nconsultation, President Obama made his nomination more than 2 months \nearlier than President Bush did in 2005.\n  One of the Republican criticisms of this nomination is that Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan has not been a judge and does not have years of opinions \nto be considered. That should make Senators' preparation for the \nhearing less labor intensive than that for Justice Sotomayor. In \naddition, we thoroughly reviewed and considered her record just last \nyear when the Senate, by a bipartisan majority vote, confirmed her \nnomination to serve as the Solicitor General of the United States, \noften called the ``Tenth Justice.''\n  To delay the confirmation hearing until July, as some have suggested, \nwould mean extending the preparation time from 49 to 63 days. But \nRepublicans complain that there is less to review, nothing like the \nthousands of opinions they complained about last year. Accordingly, we \ncould actually proceed more quickly to the hearing. This last weekend, \nRepublican Senators said that Solicitor General Kagan's answers at the \nhearing were going to be the key. If that is true and they will \napproach the hearing with open minds and listen to her answers to their \nquestions, we should not needlessly delay getting to those questions \nand answers.\n  The hearing is the opportunity for all Senators on the Judiciary \nCommittee, both Republicans and Democrats, to ask questions, raise \nconcerns, and evaluate the nomination. It seems to me that Republican \nSenators are ready to ask questions now. At last week's consideration \nof the nomination of Goodwin Liu to the Ninth Circuit, much of the \ndiscussion from Republican Senators seemed, instead, to be about the \nKagan nomination to the Supreme Court. The Republican Senators say that \nthey want to ask her about her actions as the dean of Harvard Law \nSchool and about her judicial philosophy. It does not take 2 months to \nprepare to ask those questions. They have already raised them. They \nwill surely be prepared to ask them by late June. This is a schedule \nthat I think is both fair and adequate--fair to the nominee and \nadequate for us to prepare for the hearing and Senate consideration. \nThere is no reason to indulge in needless and unreasonable delay.\n  We already have received Solicitor General Kagan's response to the \ncommittee's questionnaire. Senator Sessions and I have sent a letter to \nthe National Archives requesting documents related to Elena Kagan's \nservice in the Clinton administration and there should be no cause for \nconcerns that we will have these records before the committee in light \nof the White House Counsel's request over the weekend for the release \nof thousands of pages of records from that time. We will be prepared to \nproceed to a hearing on June 28, almost 6 weeks from today.\n  The purpose of the hearing is to allow Senators to ask questions and \nraise their concerns. It is also the time the American people can see \nthe nominee, consider her thoughtfulness, her temperament, and evaluate \nher character. I am disappointed that some Republican Senators have \nalready declared that they will vote no on Solicitor General Kagan's \nnomination and have made that announcement before giving the nominee a \nfair chance to be heard. It is incumbent on us to allow the nominee an \nopportunity to be considered fairly and allow her to respond to false \ncriticism of her record and her character. Those who are critical and \nhave doubts should support the promptest possibly hearing. That is \nwhere questions can be asked and answered. That is why we hold \nhearings.\n  President Obama handled the selection process with the care that the \nAmerican people expect and deserve and met with Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. I suggested that he nominate someone outside the \njudicial monastery, whose experiences were not limited to those in the \nrarified air of the Federal appellate courts. The Supreme Court's \ndecisions have a fundamental impact on Americans' everyday lives. One \nneed look no further than the Lilly Ledbetter and Diana Levine cases to \nunderstand how just one vote can determine the Court's decision and \nimpact the lives and freedoms of countless Americans. One need look no \nfurther than the Citizens United decision to know that the decisions of \nthe Supreme Court can drown out the voices of individual Americans in \nfavor of wealthy corporate interests. I believe that Solicitor General \nKagan understands that our courthouse doors must remain open to hard-\nworking Americans.\n  President Obama is to be commended for having consulted with Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle. Now the Senate must fulfill its \nresponsibility. The nominee has returned the Judiciary Committee \nquestionnaire and will be completing her meetings with Senators on the \nJudiciary Committee very soon. I hope that all Senators now will work \nwith me to move forward to consider this nomination in a fair and \ntimely manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/19/senate-section/article/S3982-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3982-S3983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMENDING PRIME MINISTER KOSOR OF CROATIA\n\n  Mr. BEGICH.

Mr. President, today I commemorate the work \nand commitment of the Pujols Family Foundation. We all know Albert \nPujols as one of today's most notable baseball players and, of course, \nthe first baseman for my home team, the St. Louis Cardinals. However, \nin addition to his commitments as a professional athlete, Albert has \nchosen to invest his time and compassion for the past 5 years in the \nPujols Family Foundation. In its efforts to provide education, medical \nrelief, and supplies to impoverished children, the Pujols Family \nFoundation has funded Haitian disaster relief, family-oriented events \nin St. Louis, and mission trips to the Dominican Republic. Through \ntheir efforts and service, the Pujols Family Foundation has become a \nsaving grace for families living with Down's syndrome, disabilities, \nand life-threatening illnesses without means to afford many of the \nnecessities we take for granted.\n  Albert Pujols also uses baseball as a way to bring new joy and relief \nto children in the Dominican Republic. Batey Baseball is a new joint \nventure for 2010 and is spearheaded by Albert Pujols, the Pujols Family \nFoundation, and Compassion International. Its mission is to teach \nresponsibility, teamwork, and leadership to young men in the Dominican \nRepublic through the sport of baseball. Set to launch in the summer of \n2010, this program will bring joy and hope to many young baseball \nenthusiasts in the Dominican Republic.\n  It is a welcome occurrence when I have the honor to come before this \nbody and acknowledge the selfless and tireless work done by Missourians \non behalf of those less fortunate.\n  On behalf of myself and the people of Missouri, I would like to \nrecognize and congratulate Albert Pujols, his wife Derdre, and the \nPujols Family Foundation on their 5 years of service to the people of \nSt. Louis, MO, and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/19/senate-section/article/S3983-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/19/senate-section/article/S3983-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/19/senate-section/article/S3983-4", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:47 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1782.

Res. 535\n\n       Whereas the relationship between the people and Governments \n     of the United States and Mexico is based on trust, mutual \n     respect, and cultural exchanges that have enriched both \n     nations;\n       Whereas our two nations share not just a border, but also \n     common values and common aspirations;\n       Whereas millions of Americans proudly claim Mexican \n     ancestry, and the United States is home to the world's second \n     largest Mexican community;\n       Whereas, when the American people look to their south, they \n     see not only a neighbor, but an ally and a friend;\n       Whereas mutual interests, including border security, \n     economic prosperity, and clean energy, rely on the continuing \n     development and deepening of the United States-Mexico \n     relationship;\n       Whereas drug trafficking and related violence has taken a \n     significant toll on both countries, resulting in the deaths \n     of more than 22,000 people in Mexico in the last 3 years, \n     including a number of law enforcement agents and public \n     officials, highlighting the enormous problem of illegal drug \n     use and gang violence in America;\n       Whereas the Governments of Mexico and the United States \n     have worked together under the principle of shared \n     responsibility to address this scourge through the Merida \n     Initiative and through programs such as cooperative \n     intelligence, border security, and anti-corruption efforts \n     and efforts to stop the flow of weapons and illicit money \n     from the United States into Mexico; and\n       Whereas the future security and prosperity of both nations \n     depends on our continuing ability to work together in the \n     spirit of our common values and long friendship: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) warmly welcomes the President of Mexico, Felipe \n     Calderon Hinojosa;\n       (2) believes that together, the Governments of Mexico and \n     the United States can bring immense benefits to their people \n     and make enormous contributions to addressing the global \n     challenges of the 21st century;\n       (3) looks forward to the continuing progress in relations \n     between the Governments and people of Mexico and the United \n     States; and\n       (4) appreciates the social, economic, and cultural \n     contributions of the Mexican community in the United States \n     and desires closer relations between the people of the United \n     States and the people of Mexico.\n\n  Mr. DODD.
