Madam President, we in this Chamber, a lot of times, talk \nas if no one is listening to what we are saying, as though we are \ntalking to ourselves. But that is not true. The American people are \nlistening and they are watching. That is good. But this morning I have \ngood news and I have some bad news. The good news is, Senate \nRepublicans finally--finally, at long last--have put a detailed plan \ndown on paper. The bad news is, it is not as we had hoped--a plan to \nmake health insurance more affordable, it is not one that makes health \ninsurance companies more accountable, and it is certainly not a plan to \nreverse rapidly rising health care costs and draw down our deficit, \nsuch as the plan that has been submitted to the Senate and is now \nbefore the Senate by the Democrats.\n  Again, the plan we had hoped to receive from the Republicans would be \nto\n\n[[Page S12262]]\n\nmake insurance more affordable, it would be one to make health \ninsurance companies more accountable, and it would be a plan to reverse \nthe rapidly rising health care costs and draw down our deficit. But, \nno, the Republican plan we have waited weeks and months to see doesn't \ndo any of those things. In fact, it is not even about health care at \nall, even though it is on the health care bill, this plan they have \noutlined. The first and only plan Senate Republicans bothered to draft \nis an instructional manual on how to bring the Senate to a screeching \nhalt. We knew that was happening anyway, but they had the audacity to \nput it in writing.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the letter I will be referring to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, here are some of the highlights of the \nRepublican plan laid out in the letter I referred to:\n  Tips on how to force the full reading of all amendments--long \namendments, short amendments.\n  I have no objection to transparency. That is important. Every Senator \nshould know what he or she is voting on, but let's be truly \ntransparent. We all know that those who would ask for such readings \nhave no intention of sitting in this Chamber, listening to the Senate \nclerks. Any suggestion otherwise is simply disingenuous.\n  This document explains how to manipulate points of order. Yes, that \nis what I said, manipulate points of order--a complex but important \npart of the legislative process. Yet these Senators have no intention \nof examining the procedures of the Senate or any constitutional rules.\n  The document says it in plain language. The whole purpose of the \ndocument, dated the day before yesterday--December 1--a ``Dear \nRepublican colleague'' letter, is to set forth how to slow things down, \nas if they needed more help to slow things down. Ninety-one times this \nyear they have already done that. But on this bill--this bill that \naffects every person in America--to put in writing that they are going \nto do everything they can to stop this, to delay this, is beyond \nsomething that I think the American people can comprehend.\n  The document says in plain language that is their intention. It even \ncondones using this tactic ``without cause.'' Do this without any \nreason. Just do it. The rules allow it, so go ahead and do it. It \nstalls things. This letter admits, in no uncertain terms, that the goal \nof this tactic is to delay. I didn't make up the word. It is in here. \nIt is as clear as day.\n\n  But there is more in this plan. It also advises Senators on how to \n``extend consideration of a measure,'' which motions ``may be \nfilibustered,'' and when Senators might ``offer an unlimited number of \nmotions.''\n  Well, as we see in the press, today, anyway, this has caused outrage. \nIt is a catalogue of obstructions--a catalogue of instructions to \nobstruct. But what disappoints me most about this is what isn't here. \nNowhere in this Republican plan is a strategy to lower premiums; not a \nsingle word about how to make sure more of our citizens can afford to \nstay healthy; can't even find one idea for stopping insurance companies \nfrom denying health care to the sick. You see, my Republican friends \nhave been so busy coming up with games and gambits, with ways to \ndistort and delay, with scare tactics and stalling tactics, that they \nhaven't left time to come up with solutions to one of the most profound \ncrises in the history of our country. The Senate might be interested to \nlearn that the architect behind this blueprint is none other than the \nformer chair of the Budget Committee, the senior Senator from New \nHampshire. It is worth noting that this Senator--who, more than any \nother, often speaks publicly about how to properly use citizens' tax \ndollars--has now signed his name to a plan with the explicit goal of \nwasting the taxpayers' time and money.\n  Less than 2 weeks ago, the author of this document, along with every \nsingle one of his fellow Republicans--every one--voted against even \nletting the Senate debate this bill. He didn't even want to give the \nAmerican people the opportunity to watch this debate take place--to \ndiscuss and defend his position. Now he expects us to believe his only \nmotive is making sure the minority party's voice can be heard.\n  No one believes that because it couldn't be any further from what the \nFounders had in mind. They didn't write this esteemed body's rules so \nwe could stare at the hands of the clock--which are right up here--as \nthey rotate around each other without end. So let's not pretend the \nRepublican strategy is anything different than what it is. After all, \nRepublicans certainly aren't trying to hide it.\n  When I see these kinds of political games, I think of many cases in \nNevada and around the country, but, in particular, I think of a woman \nfrom Las Vegas named Alysia. She wrote me a letter when the health care \ndebate was getting underway. She is in her early twenties. I don't know \nif she is a Democrat, an Independent, or a Republican. It doesn't \nmatter. She was born with a kidney disease, a bad kidney disease. She \nhas suffered with it every day of her life, and these days she \ndesperately needs surgery. But she is not going to get surgery.\n  Similar to so many in Nevada and across the Nation, Alysia recently \nlost her job. With her job lost, she lost her insurance and her health \ncare. So Alysia went out and tried to buy a new plan to help her afford \nher care. No one will give her insurance. She can't find a job to get \ngroup insurance.\n  What did the insurance companies tell her--plural? That her kidney \ndisorder is a preexisting condition, and because of that policy of the \ninsurance industry, which is reprehensible, they refuse to cover her. \nThey refuse to cover this young woman at the exact moment she needs it \nthe most. She then tried to go get some help from Medicaid. What did \nshe hear in response? She doesn't qualify because she isn't pregnant, \nshe doesn't have children, and they say she doesn't have a disability.\n  So how can you take a woman such as Alysia out of your mind? I think \nshe is probably following this debate. It means a lot more to her, this \ndebate, than a legislative exercise or a political objective. She will \npick up the newspaper this morning, turn on the news, or go online to \nread about what is happening in the Senate. Why? Because it affects her \nhealth--her pain and suffering. She probably remembers her grade school \ntextbook teaching her that this is the world's greatest deliberative \nbody and she is eager to find out about how those deliberations are \ngoing. She is eager to learn what we are going to do with a system that \nmakes it impossible for her to get health care.\n  Who knows, she might even be watching C-SPAN as we speak. Can you \nimagine being Alysia and going through all that she has gone through, \ncounting on your leaders to right the wrongs that we know exist, and \nthis is what she finds--a Senator writing a letter on how to guide \navoiding the tough decisions that will affect her life and maybe even \nsave her life.\n  It is not hard to imagine. We all know you don't have to have a bad \nhealth history, such as Alysia's, to tell a similar story of your own. \nYou may have had an accident in your early days. You may have diabetes. \nIt doesn't matter. You don't need kidney disease for insurance \ncompanies to take away your health insurance. As it stands now, they \ncan deny you coverage because of high cholesterol, because you have \nallergies or maybe you have had minor surgery or maybe because you are \na woman. Maybe your mom had breast cancer. These are all reasons they \nuse to deny coverage.\n  We all know that, much like our Republican colleagues, insurance \ncompanies will use any excuse in the book to just say no.\n  For many good people in Nevada and throughout the Nation, it is a \npainful, terrible reality. That is one of the many problems our good \nbill fixes.\n  The American people see transparent tricks like this--it is a \nshameful scheme--for what they are. The American people could not be \nimpressed. They are not impressed. I can't decide which should \ndisappoint the American citizens more, that the Senate Republicans are \nhappily wasting time or that they are so eager to admit it. But here is \none thing I do know, this is no way to govern, no way to legislate, \nthis is no way to lead, and especially no way to lead our country, our \nconstituents,\n\n[[Page S12263]]\n\nback to health. The bill before the Senate saves lives, saves money, \nand saves Medicare.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2009.\n       Dear Republican Colleague: As we embark on Senate debate of \n     Majority Leader Reid's massive $2.5 trillion health care \n     reform legislation, it is critical that Republican senators \n     have a solid understanding of the minority's rights in the \n     Senate.\n       I think that we can all agree that the Democrats' bill is \n     the wrong choice for our nation. It will impact one-sixth of \n     our economy, vastly grow the government, and pile tremendous \n     debt on future generations. We are at an important crossroads \n     both for the economy and for the health care system. \n     Therefore, it is imperative that our voices are heard during \n     this debate.\n       We, the minority party, must use the tools we have under \n     Senate rules to insist on a full, complete and fully informed \n     debate on the health care legislation--as well as all \n     legislation--coming before the Senate. As laid out in the \n     attached document, we have certain rights before measures are \n     considered on the floor as well as certain rights during the \n     actual consideration of measures. Every Republican senator \n     should be familiar with the scope of these rights, which \n     serve to protect our ability to speak on behalf of the \n     millions of Americans who depend on us to be their voice \n     during this historic debate.\n       I hope you find the attached information helpful. If you \n     have any questions, please contact my communications office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Judd Gregg.\n\n  Foundation for the Minority Party's Rights in the Senate (Fall 2009)\n\n       The Senate rules are designed to give a minority of \n     Senators the right to insist on a full, complete, and fully \n     informed debate on all measures and issues coming before the \n     Senate. This cornerstone of protection can only be abrogated \n     if 60 or more Senators vote to take these rights away from \n     the minority.\n     I. Rights Available to Minority Before Measures are \n         Considered on Floor (These rights are normally waived by \n         Unanimous Consent (UC) when time is short, but any \n         Senator can object to the waiver.)\n       New Legislative Day--An adjournment of the Senate, as \n     opposed to a recess, is required to trigger a new legislative \n     day. A new legislative day starts with the morning hour, a 2-\n     hour period with a number of required procedures. During part \n     of the ``morning hour'' any Senator may make non-debatable \n     motions to proceed to items on the Senate calendar.\n       One Day and Two Day Rules--The 1-day rule requires that \n     measures must lie over one ``legislative day'' before they \n     can be considered. All bills have to lie over one day, \n     whether they were introduced by an individual Senator (rule \n     XIV) or reported by a committee (rule XVII). The 2-day rule \n     requires that IF a committee chooses to file a written \n     report, that committee report MUST contain a CBO cost \n     estimate, a regulatory impact statement, and detail what \n     changes the measure makes to current law (or provide a \n     statement why any of these cannot be done), and that report \n     must be available at least 2 calendar days before a bill can \n     be considered on the Senate floor. Senators may block a \n     measure's consideration by raising a point of order if it \n     does not meet one of these requirements.\n       ``Hard'' Quorum Calls--Senate operates on a presumptive \n     quorum of 51 senators and quorum calls are routinely \n     dispensed with by unanimous consent. If UC is not granted to \n     dispose of a routine quorum call, then the roll must continue \n     to be called. If a quorum is not present, the only motions \n     the leadership may make are to adjourn, to recess under a \n     previous order, or time-consuming motions to establish a \n     quorum that include requesting, requiring, and then arresting \n     Senators to compel their presence in the Senate chamber.\n     II. Rights Available to Minority During Consideration of \n         Measures in Senate (Many of these rights are regularly \n         waived by Unanimous Consent.)\n       Motions to Proceed to Measures--with the exception of \n     Conference Reports and Budget Resolutions, most such motions \n     are fully debatable and 60 votes for cloture is needed to cut \n     off extended debate.\n       Reading of Amendments and Conference Reports in Entirety--\n     In most circumstances, the reading of the full text of \n     amendments may only be dispensed with by unanimous consent. \n     Any Senator may object to dispensing with the reading. If, as \n     is often the case when the Senate begins consideration of a \n     House-passed vehicle, the Majority Leader offers a full-text \n     substitute amendment, the reading of that full-text \n     substitute amendment can only be waived by unanimous consent. \n     A member may only request the reading of a conference report \n     if it is not available in printed form (100 copies available \n     in the Senate chamber).\n       Senate Points of Order--A Senator may make a point of order \n     at any point he or she believes that a Senate procedure is \n     being violated, with or without cause. After the presiding \n     officer rules, any Senator who disagrees with such ruling may \n     appeal the ruling of the chair--that appeal is fully \n     debatable. Some points of order, such as those raised on \n     Constitutional grounds, are not ruled on by the presiding \n     officer and the question is put to the Senate, then the point \n     of order itself is fully debatable. The Senate may dispose of \n     a point of order or an appeal by tabling it; however, delay \n     is created by the two roll call votes in connection with each \n     tabling motion (motion to table and motion to reconsider that \n     vote).\n       Budget Points of Order--Many legislative proposals (bills, \n     amendments, and conference reports) are subject to a point of \n     order under the Budget Act or budget resolution, most of \n     which can only be waived by 60 votes. If budget points of \n     order lie against a measure, any Senator may raise them, and \n     a measure cannot be passed or disposed of unless the points \n     of order that are raised are waived. (See http://\nbudget.senate.gov/republican/pressarchive/PointsofOrder.pdf )\n\n\n                           Amendment Process\n\n       Amendment Tree Process and/or Filibuster by Amendment--\n     until cloture is invoked, Senators may offer an unlimited \n     number of amendments--germane or non-germane--on any subject. \n     This is the fullest expression of a ``full, complete, and \n     informed'' debate on a measure. It has been necessary under \n     past Democrat majorities to use the rules governing the \n     amendment process aggressively to ensure that minority \n     Senators get votes on their amendment as originally written \n     (unchanged by the Majority Democrats.)\n       Substitute Amendments--UC is routinely requested to treat \n     substitute amendments as original text for purposes of \n     further amendment, which makes it easier for the majority to \n     offer 2nd degree amendments to gut 1st degree amendments by \n     the minority. The minority could protect their amendments by \n     objecting to such UC's.\n       Divisible Amendments--amendments are divisible upon demand \n     by any Senator if they contain two or more parts that can \n     stand independently of one another. This can be used to fight \n     efforts to block the minority from offering all of their \n     amendments, because a single amendment could be drafted, \n     offered at a point when such an amendment is in order, and \n     then divided into multiple component parts for separate \n     consideration and votes. Demanding division of amendments can \n     also be used to extend consideration of a measure. Amendments \n     to strike and insert text cannot be divided.\n       Motions to Recommit Bills to Committee With or Without \n     Instructions--A Senator may make a motion to recommit a bill \n     to the committee with or without instructions to the \n     Committee to report it back to the Senate with certain \n     changes or additions. Such instructions are amendable.\n\n\n   AFTER PASSAGE Going to Conference, Motions to Instruct Conferees, \n                   Matters Out of Scope of Conference\n\n       Going to Conference--The Senate must pass 3 separate \n     motions to go to conference: (1) a motion to insist on its \n     amendments or disagree with the House amendments; (2) a \n     motion to request/agree to a conference; and (3) a motion to \n     authorize the Chair to appoint conferees.

The motions to \n     instruct are amendable--and divisible upon demand--by \n     Senators if they contain more than one separate and distinct \n     instruction.\n       Conference Reports, Out of Scope Motions--In addition to \n     demanding a copy of the conference report to be on every \n     Senator's desk and raising Budget points of order against it, \n     Senators may also raise a point of order that it contains \n     matter not related to the matters originally submitted to the \n     conference by either chamber. If the Chair sustains the point \n     or order, the provision(s) is stricken from the conference \n     agreement, and the House would then have to approve the \n     measure absent the stricken provision (even if the House had \n     already acted on the conference report). The scope point of \n     order can be waived by 60 Senators.\n       Availability of Conference Report Language.

Madam President, this measure was in the majority \nleader's office for 6 weeks. It has only been on the floor of the \nSenate for 3 days. I think it is clearly not the case that the \nRepublicans want to delay a process that we have only now gotten an \nopportunity to participate in, since this has been a strictly partisan \nventure from the beginning. But we will have an opportunity over a \nnumber of weeks to offer amendments. We will have four votes today and \nhopefully we can proceed at a more rapid pace than we got off to in the \nfirst couple of days. Of\n\n[[Page S12264]]\n\ncourse the reason we didn't have votes last night was because there \nwere objections on that side of the aisle. But hopefully we are now \ninto a process where we can go forward without the kind of delay that \nwe had generated by both sides over the last couple of days.\n  Yesterday some of our friends on the other side were at great pains \nto explain one of the core pieces of their health care plan. I am \nreferring of course to the massive cuts in Medicare they plan to make \nas a way of expanding government's reach even further into the lives \nand, more specifically, into the medical care of every American.\n  I have no doubt that our friends were reluctant to call for these \ncuts. But in the middle of a recession, and at a time when more than 1 \nin 10 working Americans is looking for work, it isn't easy to find $1/2 \na trillion lying around. They had to find the money somewhere. And so \nthey set their sights on Medicare.\n  Republicans have been entirely consistent in this debate: Medicare is \nalready in trouble. The program needs to be fixed, not raided to create \nanother new government program. We have fought these senseless cuts \nfrom the outset. And we will continue to fight them.\n  Democrats, meanwhile, have taken a novel approach. They have \napparently decided there is no way to defend these Medicare cuts, so \nthey will just deny they are doing it. It hardly passes the smell test.\n  Here are the facts. According to this bill: Medicare Advantage is cut \nby $120 billion; hospitals that treat Medicare patients are cut by $135 \nbillion; home health care is cut by more than $42 billion; nursing \nhomes are cut by nearly $15 billion; hospice care is cut by $7.6 \nbillion.\n  These are the cuts that our friends on the other side claim not to be \ncuts. This is the plan that our friends on the other side have said \nwill ``save Medicare''--a talking point so plainly contradicted by the \nfacts, it is almost impossible to repeat it with a straight face.\n  One Democrat took this strategy to a new level yesterday when he \ndeclared on the floor that it wasn't even accurate to describe cuts to \nMedicare Advantage as cuts because Medicare Advantage, he said, is not \na Medicare Program.\n  Well, that is apparently news to the Department of Health and Human \nServices, which states on its Web site, in words as plain as the \nalphabet that ``Medicare Advantage plans . . . are part of the Medicare \nprogram.'' And it is news to the millions of American seniors who \ndepend on this popular program for their care.\n  At the moment, Medicare Advantage has nearly 11 million enrollees \nlooking at it another way, or nearly one-fourth of all Medicare \nbeneficiaries are on Medicare Advantage.\n  In recent years, this program has proven to be particularly popular \nwith seniors in rural areas who would otherwise have limited access to \ncare. Seniors have shown they want this plan. And I daresay that if you \nhad asked seniors earlier this year what they expected health care \nreform would look like, it wouldn't have involved massive cuts to a \nprogram that they have shown they like and want.\n  Medicare Advantage has also been proven to help in a particular way \nlow-income and minority seniors. That is one of the reasons minorities \nare more likely to enroll in it. So this program has given a boost to \nhistorically disadvantaged populations and helped give them a greater \nmeasure of dignity toward the end of their lives.\n  These cuts are bad enough. But despite what our friends have said, \nthe Democrat plan for Medicare Advantage doesn't stop here because \ntheir bill also gives the Medicare Commission explicit new authority to \ncut even more from this popular program in the years ahead.\n  The President has repeatedly said that people who like the plans they \nhave will be able to keep them under his plan. He has said people \ncurrently signed up for Medicare Advantage will have the same level of \nbenefits under his plan.\n  Well, common sense tells us that you can't cut $120 billion from a \nbenefits program without affecting benefits, and the independent \nCongressional Budget Office confirms what common sense tells us, and \nthey actually quantify it.\n  CBO says the bill we are debating will cut extra benefits that \nseniors receive through Medicare Advantage by more than half. The fact \nis, cuts to Medicare Advantage are cuts to Medicare. And if it is true \nof Medicare Advantage, it is true of the other Medicare cuts in this \nbill. Democrats can deny these cuts all they want. Seniors aren't \nbuying it.\n  Later this afternoon we are going to have a Bennet amendment, Bennet \nof Colorado, as a side-by-side to Senator McCain's motion, which would \nsend back to committee the Medicare cuts in this bill and ask the \ncommittee to report it back without them. I want to comment briefly on \nthe Bennet amendment and we are going to have more to say on that \nduring the course of today's debate.\n  This amendment is a shell game, a shell game designed to hide the \n$\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts I have been talking about. The Bennet of \nColorado amendment is a shell game designed to hide the \n$\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts I have described. If the Bennet amendment \npasses, the bill will still cut $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare.\n  Let me say that again. If the Bennet of Colorado amendment passes, \nthe bill will still cut $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare. It does not \nprotect Medicare. There is only one way to protect Medicare and that is \nto support the McCain motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is absolutely right to point out the Bennet \namendment is a shell game, charade, and a farce; that there will still \nbe \n$\\1/2\\ trillion in the first 10 years but actually $2.5 trillion over \nthe period 2010 to 2029 to be cut out of Medicare.\n  Earlier the majority leader came to the floor and talked about a memo \nthat I sent around, which is a fairly innocuous memo to our fellow \nMembers, which outlined the rights to fellow Members relative to floor \nactivity, and I sent in my position as Budget ranking member, because \nmost of these issues are tied to the budget, and the covering letter \nsaid we as a minority must use the tools we have under the Senate rules \nto insist on a full, complete, and fully informed debate on health care \nlegislation as well as all legislation that comes before the Senate.\n  I ask the Republican leader, is it not reasonable that we should have \na full, complete, and fair debate on this health care bill?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from New Hampshire, we know this \nbill was produced by Democrats in committee. Then it went to the \nmajority leader's conference room and stayed there for 6 weeks. There \nwere no Republicans in those meetings, not a one. So after being in the \nmajority leader's conference room for 6 weeks, it has been on the floor \nof the Senate for 3 days. This will be the fourth day.\n  To suggest that Republicans don't want to offer many amendments to \nthis massive 2,000-page bill that seeks to restructure one-sixth of our \neconomy is nonsense. The American people will not stand for not having \na free and open amendment process during the course of this debate. \nThis is a debate, I say to my friend from New Hampshire, the American \npeople deserve to have for a considerable period of time. For goodness' \nsake, we spent 4 weeks on a farm bill in the last Congress. F\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Republican leader will yield further, it is ironic, \nis it not, that the majority leader would come to the floor and \ncomplain about an innocuous statement that outlines the rules which \nMembers of the Senate have, a statement which I suspect he actually \nwould pass out to his members for information were they in the \nminority--maybe even in the majority, because they would like to know \nhow the rules work in the Senate--after the majority leader had \ncompletely subverted the rules of the Senate by not taking this 2074-\npage bill through committee so it could be amended, in the open, so it \ncould be amended but, rather, writing it in the back room, some closet \naround here, with three or four Members of the Senate present? Isn't \nthere an ironic inconsistency to his outrage on the fact that we \nsuggested people should know the rules here while he has basically \ntried to go around the rules?\n\n[[Page S12265]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from New Hampshire, nobody is going \nto buy outrage over a mere 40 Members out of 100 Members of the Senate \nhaving an opportunity, for the first time, to offer amendments. The \nmajority, by the way, has the right to do this, and I don't complain \nabout it. They are going to offer an amendment for every amendment we \noffer, so not only did they have the bill in their conference room in \nsecret for 6 weeks, out here on the floor they are going to get 50 \npercent of the amendments we vote on. I don't think they will be able, \nwith a straight face, to convince the American people that somehow the \n40 of us who are asking for an opportunity to amend a bill that all the \nsurveys indicate the American people don't want us to pass is somehow \nunfair.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will ask one more question because I find the irony in \nthe situation so unique. A memo which outlines what the rights are of \nall Members--but Members of the minority specifically because the rules \nare meant to protect the minority from the majority; that is the \ntradition of our Government, of course, which seems to be an affront to \nthe majority at this point--that a memo of that nature, which \nessentially says the minority has certain rights in order for the \ninstitution to function correctly--I am wondering, why did we create \nthese rules in the first place? Wasn't it so we could continue the \nthought of Adams, of Madison, who suggested that the Senate should be \nthe place where, when legislation comes forward which has been rushed \nthrough the House, the Senate should be the place where that \nlegislation receives a deliberative view, where it is explored as to \nits unintended consequences and as to its consequences generally, and \nwhere the body has the opportunity to amend it effectively so it can be \nimproved? Isn't that the purpose of the Senate? And isn't that what the \nrules of the Senate are designed to do, to accomplish the goals of our \nFounding Fathers to have a Senate where the legislation is adequately \naired and considered versus being rushed through in a precipitous way?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It was George Washington who presided over the \nConstitutional Convention who was asked: General, what do you think the \nSenate is going to be like?\n  He said: I think it is going to be like the saucer under the tea cup \nand the tea is going to slosh out of the cup down into the saucer and \ncool off. That is precisely the point the Senator raises, which is the \nSenate is the place viewed to be a body that ought to and correctly \ntakes its time. The House of Representatives passed this massive \nrestructuring of one-sixth of our economy in 1 day with three \namendments--1 day. That is not the way the Senate operates. I can \nremember when our friends on the other side were in the minority. \nSpecifically, I can remember the now-assistant majority leader saying \nthe Senate is not the House--praised the procedures in the Senate. If \never there were a measure, if ever in the history of America there were \na measure that the Americans expect us to take our time on and to get \nit right, it is this one, this massive 2,000-page effort to restructure \none-sixth of our economy and have the government take over all of \nAmerican health where we see, in all of the public opinion polls, \npeople are saying please don't pass this--they want to try to rush it.\n  They want to try to rush it, try to get it through here in a heck of \na hurry, back it up against Christmas. I have said to the majority \nleader, we are happy to be here. We are going to be here Saturday and \nSunday. I did ask for an opportunity for Members to go to church Sunday \nmorning, if they want to, and the majority leader indicated that would \nbe permissible. But after that, we will be here and ready to vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Republican leader for his response. I suspect, \nwere the majority leader in the minority, he would be insisting on \nexactly what the Republican leader is insisting on--a fair and open \ndebate which allows the minority to make its case as to the good points \nin this bill and as to the bad points. The way you make that case is by \nfollowing the rules of the Senate; is that not correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The American people expect and deserve no less than \nexactly what we have been discussing.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/03/senate-section/article/S12265-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes from the \ntime under the control of the managers.\n  For the benefit of all Senators I want to take a moment to lay out \ntoday's program.\n  The time between now and 11:45 is for debate on the amendment by the \nSenator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, the chairwoman of the Subcommittee \non Retirement and Aging of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee.\n  And at the same time, we will debate the side-by-side amendment by \nthe Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski.\n  At 11:45, the Senate will conduct two back-to-back rollcall votes on \nthe two amendments, first on the amendment by the Senator from \nMaryland, and second on the amendment by the Senator from Alaska.\n  Thereafter, we will conduct approximately 2 hours of debate on the \nMcCain motion to commit on Medicare and the side-by-side amendment by \nthe Senator from Colorado, Mr. Bennet.\n  At 2:45, the Senate will conduct two back-to-back votes on the \namendment by the Senator from Colorado, followed by a vote on the \nmotion to commit by the Senator from Arizona.\n  Thereafter, we expect to turn to another Democratic first-degree \namendment and another Republican first-\ndegree amendment.\n  This is the fourth day on this bill, and we are only late this \nmorning coming to our first vote. Even for the U.S. Senate, this is a \nslow pace.\n  I note that some have made plans for delaying this bill in even more \nextreme fashion. As the majority leader noted, on Tuesday, one Senator \ncirculated a list of delaying tactics available under the Senate rules.\n  I presume all Senators know the Senate's rules already. So to send \nthe letter leaves the impression that that Senator would like to urge \nSenators to use some of the delaying tactics stated in the memo.\n  But I urge a more cooperative course. Out of courtesy to other \nSenators who desire to offer amendments. I urge my colleagues to allow \nus to reach unanimous consent agreements to order the voting of future \namendments in a more timely fashion. That is simply the only way that \nwe can ensure that more colleagues will have the time and opportunity \nto offer and debate their amendments.\n  I thank all Senators.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I heard the distinguished minority \nleader earlier in his comments say that one of the reasons they are \nslowing this bill down and having all this debate is it has been a \nstrictly partisan venture thus far. I beg to differ with the minority \nleader.\n  I see our distinguished ranking member of the HELP Committee here on \nthe floor. In the HELP Committee, for the enlightenment of Senators, we \nhad 13 days of markup, 54 hours, 788 amendments were filed, 287 \namendments were considered and debated and voted on or accepted, and \n161 Republican amendments were adopted. No one was denied the \nopportunity to offer any amendment, to discuss them, debate them, and \nget a vote or have it accepted, whatever the case might be. To me, this \nis truly a bipartisan way of proceeding.\n  The minority leader's argument basically goes to the fact that the \npeople of this country overwhelmingly elected Democrats to guide and \nmake changes for the future. One of the biggest changes is in our \nhealth care system. One of the responsibilities of being a majority \nparty is to propose. That is what we have done. We are proposing \nchanges in the health care system. The function of the minority is to \noffer amendments, constructive amendments, offer different ideas, and \nif their ideas are better or if they receive majority approval, then \nthe bill is thus changed. That happened in the HELP Committee. As I \nsaid, 161 Republican amendments were adopted. To me, that is \nbipartisan. That is what we have been doing. What is kind of not \nacceptable is this idea that things are just going to slow down for the \npurposes of delaying and eventually making sure we don't have a bill.\n  Let me say that after all that lengthy debate we had in the HELP \nCommittee, we passed a bill. The same will happen here on the Senate \nfloor. I don't care how many times the minority wants to drag it out \nand slow it down to try to kill this bill, this bill will pass the \nSenate, we will go to conference, and we will have it on the \nPresident's desk early next year.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I appreciate the comments, some of which need correction, \nfrom yesterday and those that have just been made.\n  On a partisan bill, I sat through all of those days in the HELP \nCommittee. That bill was rushed and put together. Senator Kennedy was \nnot able to be involved in that part of it. His staff did it. They did \nit in a hurry. We turned in 159 amendments that were accepted. Most of \nthose were for typos and minor corrections. There were a few that \nactually had some substance to them. That bill was passed on July 15 \nout of committee without a single Republican vote. It wasn't published. \nWe didn't see the final version until September 17. The ones that were \nreally something that could have made a difference were taken out \nwithout the permission of any Republican Senator. That is not \nbipartisan.\n  We talked about how many hours we spent together. If you don't accept \nthings from the minority party, it is not bipartisan. It is still \npartisan. Just spending hours doesn't make any difference.\n  To move on to a different topic, yesterday we were talking about \ncosts. I hope the people take a look at a Wall Street Journal article \nfrom yesterday that says:\n\n       A bill that raises prices but lowers costs, and other \n     miracles.\n\n  We heard all day yesterday that this bill is going to save people a \nlot of money. This article reads:\n\n       We have now reached the stage of the health-care debate \n     when all that matters is getting a bill passed, so all news \n     is good news, more subsidies mean lower deficits, and more \n     expensive insurance is really cheaper insurance. The \n     nonpolitical mind reels.\n       Consider how Washington received the Congressional Budget \n     Office's study Monday of how Harry Reid's Senate bill will \n     affect insurance costs, which by any rational measure ought \n     to have been a disaster for the bill.\n       CBO found that premiums in the individual market will rise \n     by 10% to 13% more than if Congress did nothing. Family \n     policies under the status quo are projected to cost $13,100 \n     on average, but under ObamaCare will jump to $15,200. \n     Fabulous news! ``No Big Cost Rise in U.S. Premiums Is Seen in \n     Study,'' said the New York Times, while the Washington Post \n     declared, ``Senate Health Bill Gets a Boost.'' The White \n     House crowed that the CBO report was ``more good news about \n     what reform will mean for families struggling to keep up with \n     skyrocketing premiums under the broken status quo.'' Finance \n     Chairman Max Baucus chimed in from the Senate floor that \n     ``Health-care reform is fundamentally about lower health-care \n     costs. Lowering costs is what health-care reform is designed \n     to do, lowering costs; and it will achieve this objective.''\n       Except it won't. CBO says it expects employer-sponsored \n     insurance costs to remain roughly in line with the status \n     quo, yet even this is a failure by Mr. Baucus's and the White \n     House's own standards.\n       Meanwhile, fixing the individual market--which is expensive \n     and unstable largely because it does not enjoy the favorable \n     tax treatment given to job-based coverage--was supposed to be \n     the whole purpose of ``reform.'' Instead, CBO is confirming \n     that new coverage mandates will drive premiums higher. But \n     Democrats are declaring victory, claiming that these higher \n     insurance prices don't count because they will be offset by \n     new government subsidies.\n       About 57% of the people who buy insurance through the \n     bill's new ``exchanges'' that will supplant today's \n     individual market will qualify for subsidies that cover about \n     two-thirds of the total premium. So the bill will increase \n     costs but it will then disguise those costs by transferring \n     them to taxpayers from individuals. Higher costs can be \n     conjured away because they're suddenly on the government \n     balance sheet. The Reid bill's $371.9 billion in new health \n     taxes are also apparently not a new cost because they can be \n     passed along to consumers, or perhaps will be hidden in lost \n     wages. This is the paleo-\n     liberal school of brute-force wealth redistribution, and a \n     very long way from the repeated White House claims that \n     reform is all about ``bending the cost curve.'' The only \n     thing being bent here is the budget truth.\n       Moreover, CBO is almost certainly underestimating the cost \n     increases. Based on its county-by-county actuarial data, the \n     insurer WellPoint has calculated that Mr. Baucus's bill would \n     cause some premiums to triple in the individual market. The \n     Blue Cross Blue Shield Association came to similar \n     conclusions. One reason is community rating, which forces \n     insurers to charge nearly uniform rates regardless of \n     customer health status or habits. CBO doesn't think this will \n     have much of an effect, but costs inevitably rise when \n     insurers aren't allowed to price based on risk. This is why \n     today some 35 states impose no limits on premium variation \n     and six allow wide differences among consumers.\n       The White House decided to shoot messengers like WellPoint \n     to avoid rebutting their message. But Amanda Kowalski of MIT, \n     William Congdon of the Brookings Institution and Mark \n     Showalter of Brigham Young have found similar results. In a \n     2008 paper in the peer-reviewed Forum for Health Economics \n     and Policy, these economists found that state community \n     rating laws raise premiums in the individual market by 20.9% \n     to 33.1% for families and 10.2% to 17.1% for singles. In New \n     Jersey, which also requires insurers to accept all comers \n     (so-called guaranteed issue), premiums increased by as much \n     as 227%.\n       The political tragedy is that there are plenty of reform \n     alternatives that really would reduce the cost of insurance. \n     According to CBO, the relatively modest House GOP bill would \n     actually reduce premiums by 5% to 8% in the individual market \n     in 2016, and by 7% to 10% for small businesses. The GOP \n     reforms would also do so without imposing huge new taxes. But \n     Democrats don't care because their bill isn't really about \n     ``lowering costs.'' It's about putting Washington in charge \n     of health insurance, at any cost.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 11:45 a.m. shall be equally \ndivided between the Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, and the \nRepublican leader or his designee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: There is time \nbetween now and the hour of 11:45 a.m. equally divided between the \nRepublican side and the Democratic side; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I assume, then, the normal thing will be \nto go back and forth from one side to the other, the Republican side \nand the Democratic side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That will not be an order unless it \nis propounded.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I think it is perfectly understood.\n  Mr. ENZI. That is our understanding as well.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 7 minutes.\n\n[[Page S12267]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a quick \ninquiry to my friend from Wyoming?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I might inquire of my colleague from \nWyoming if that item the Senator was quoting from about costs in the \nWall Street Journal was a news article or an editorial.\n  Mr. ENZI. That was an editorial by the Wall Street Journal, the staff \nof the Wall Street Journal, confirmed by MIT, Brigham Young, and \nothers.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask if the Chair will remind me when \nthe 7 minutes is up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have to respond to my friend from \nWyoming about doing this in a hurry. He mentioned that we did the bill \nin a hurry in our committee. Actually, it was last November, shortly \nafter the election, when I received a call from Senator Kennedy talking \nabout doing a health reform bill, asking if I would take charge of a \nsection dealing with public health and prevention and wellness. I think \nthen he asked Senator Murray to take over workforce development, \nSenator Bingaman did coverage, and Senator Mikulski did quality \nimprovements. So that was in November.\n  I cannot speak for the others who did the other sections. All I can \nsay is, on our side, in what I did, we had five hearings. We had five \nhearings on public health and prevention and wellness and what ought to \ngo into a bill. I think those hearings commenced in December and went \nthrough about February. Then we worked until June, and we did not start \nour markup until June. So we had almost 6 months of hearings and \nputting things together in the bill before we started a markup. I \nrather doubt that can be said to be rushing anything.\n  But I just want to focus on the vote that is coming up on the \namendment offered by the Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, which \nwill strengthen provisions in the bill concerning preventive health \nbenefits for women.\n  As an initial matter, I am proud of the significant investments the \nbill makes overall in wellness and prevention. It has not been talked \nabout very much. If you read the public press out there, the popular \npress, and watch TV, about the only thing you think is in the bill is a \npublic option and abortion and that is what this bill is about. Well, \nthose may be the hot points and the flashpoints--it makes for good \npress--but I submit that one of the most important parts, if not the \nmost important part, of this bill is what it does for prevention and \nwellness, trying to move our costs upstream, keeping people healthy in \nthe first place.\n  I have said many times, what good does it do us if we are just going \nto pour more money into paying bills for a broken, dysfunctional, sick \ncare system--not a health care system, a sick care system? That is what \nwe have in America today. This bill begins the transformation of moving \nus from a sick care system to a true health care system.\n  The Senator from Maryland has a very important amendment to make \nclear--to make clear--that what is included in the bill is to \nstrengthen the preventive services that basically inure to the women of \nthis country. The Mikulski amendment reiterates the recommendations of \nour bill, and it also points out that the recommendations of the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force is a floor, not a ceiling--it is a \nminimum. In other words, health plans are required at a minimum to \nprovide first-dollar coverage for preventive services recommended by \nthe Preventive Services Task Force, but that is just the minimum. The \nSecretary of Health and Human Services has full discretion to identify \nadditional preventive services that will be part of the essential \npackage offered by health insurance on the exchange.\n  Again, there has been some talk here about this task force, the \nPreventive Services Task Force, that somehow this is a bunch of \nbureaucrats, it is a government-run task force, it has a political \nagenda. I have heard all these things said on the floor in the last day \nor so. Well, in fact, the Preventive Services Task Force is an \nindependent body that evaluates the benefits of clinical preventive \nservices. It makes recommendations--again, no decisions, merely \nrecommendations--about which services are most effective.\n  Who is on this task force? Experts and leaders in primary care who \nare renowned internists, pediatricians, family physicians, \ngynecologists, and obstetricians. And these professionals are not \nlocated in Washington, DC; they are based all over the country. Some \nmay be in one State or another State. They are all over the country, \nand they are experts in these different areas, recognized by their \npeers. They do not sit in an office at Health and Human Services. They \nbring years of medical training and experience to the jobs they do.\n  Does that mean they never make a mistake? No. No one is perfect. No \nSenator is perfect. Neither is every doctor perfect. And neither is any \ntask force always going to make what we might consider to be the \nperfect answer. But our bill does not grant them the authority to tell \ninsurance companies what not to cover. That is clear. But to hear the \ndebate on the floor, you would think it is just the opposite, that the \nPreventive Services Task Force can tell insurance companies what they \ncannot cover. That is not true. Our bill says that those \nrecommendations that are A and B--categorized by the Preventive \nServices Task Force, by these expert doctors around the country--these \nare the ones they say really are key preventive services, have the most \nbenefit. We say in our bill that those services must be covered without \ncopays, without deductibles. That means that is the floor. That is the \nfloor.\n  Again, I might also add that preventive services that are rated by \nthe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and comprehensive \nguidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration are also part of the recommendations to establish that \nfloor.\n  So, again, I would say it is a pretty big floor when you put all \nthose together. Again, it does not establish a ceiling and it does not \nsay what cannot be done. It just says you have to do these basics. That \nis the floor.\n  I do understand the concerns of some that the task force has not \nspent enough time studying preventative services that are unique to \nwomen. Senator Mikulski goes back a long way on this issue. I can \nremember some years ago Senator Mikulski pointing out to me, in my \ncapacity as the then-chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that \nfunds NIH----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 more \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Mikulski said: If you look at the research being \ndone at NIH, it is almost all done on men and not on women. I remember \nthat some years ago, and all of a sudden a lightbulb went off in my \nhead. I said: You are right. So we had to start changing the focus of a \nlot of the research done to focus on the unique situations faced by \nwomen.\n  Well, this was also a concern that was raised in our HELP Committee \nby Senator Mikulski, and we included language to require all health \nplans to cover comprehensive women's preventive care and screenings \nbased on guidelines promulgated by the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration--again, without any copays or deductibles. That was in \nour health bill but unfortunately was not included in the merged bill. \nBut Senator Mikulski's amendment, which we are about to vote on, brings \nus back to the position we had in the HELP Committee bill. I think that \nwas largely supported, if I am not mistaken, on both sides, at least in \nour HELP Committee. At least no one offered any amendment to strike it \nwhen we were debating it in committee. So I assume it was supported \ngenerally by both Republicans and Democrats.\n  By voting for the Mikulski amendment, we can make doubly sure that \nthe floor we are establishing in the bill for preventive services that \nare unique to women also has no copays and no deductibles. Again, that \nis why this amendment is so important.\n\n[[Page S12268]]\n\n  I know our friend Senator Murkowski has a different way of approach. \nI commend her for her involvement and her interest in this issue. She \nhas been a great member of our committee, and I have done a lot of \ngreat work with Senator Murkowski. But I think her amendment misses the \nmark in this way: It asks insurers to use guidelines from provider \ngroups when making coverage decisions. Well, that does not guarantee \nwomen will get any of the preventive services they need.\n  Here is a statement from the American Heart Association and the \nAmerican Stroke Association. It says:\n\n     . . . we are concerned that Senator Murkowski's preventive \n     health services amendment would take a step backwards by \n     substituting the judgment of the independent U.S. Preventive \n     Services Task Force with the judgment of private health \n     insurance companies.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the \nAmerican Heart Association and the American Stroke Association be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement by American Heart Association CEO Nancy Brown on Murkowski \n                Amendment on Preventive Health Services\n\n                             (Dec. 2, 2009)\n\n       The American Heart Association strongly supports requiring \n     health plans and Medicare to provide first-dollar coverage \n     for clinical preventive services that are evidence-based and \n     necessary for the prevention or early detection of an illness \n     or disability. We appreciate that Senator Murkowski's \n     amendment recognizes the value of the guidelines and \n     recommendations made by professional medical organizations \n     (as well as by voluntary health organizations like the \n     American Heart Association). But even these guidelines must \n     be held to the standard of being evidenced based. In \n     addition, we are concerned that Senator Murkowski's \n     preventive health services amendment would take a step \n     backwards by substituting the judgment of the independent \n     U.S. Preventive Services Task Force with the judgment of \n     private health insurance companies. Although we have \n     previously recommended to Congress that the USPSTF membership \n     be expanded to include specialists to broaden the expertise \n     of the Task Force, we believe an expanded USPSTF would be the \n     best entity to objectively and rigorously make \n     recommendations for covering clinical preventive services and \n     do not support eliminating it from this role.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I will have more to say about the \nMurkowski amendment later. But, again, the point is, the Mikulski \namendment is right on point. It should be adopted.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Madam President, I come to the floor today to draw back \nthe curtain a little, I hope, and to widen the lens to talk about the \nissue of the bill before us, not just on this particular amendment but \non what it is going to mean for my constituents in Florida and for the \npeople of this country.\n  I had the opportunity last week to be back home in Florida, in south \nFlorida, in Palm Beach County and Broward County and Miami-Dade County, \nwhere I talked to doctors, hospital administrators, folks who run \nMedicare Advantage plans, as well as everyday Floridians, specifically \nsenior citizens. The responses I heard were nearly unanimous, and that \nwas grave concern about the bill that is being debated on this floor \nand a general confusion as to why the Congress is pursuing the path \nthat it is. The people of Florida do not understand why we are going to \ncut Medicare to create a new program. The people of Florida do not \nunderstand why we are going to raise taxes to create a new program. The \npeople whom I have spoken to in Florida do not understand why we would \nundertake a new $2.5 trillion health care proposal if it was not going \nto reduce the cost of health insurance for the 170 million to 180 \nmillion Americans who have health insurance today.\n  Why are we embarking upon this measure if it is not going to affect \nmost everyday Floridians and everyday Americans who are struggling \nunder the high cost of health insurance? Health insurance premiums have \nincreased 130 percent in the past 10 years.\n  When the President put this proposal forward and when he campaigned \non it, he said his major goal was to reduce the cost of health \ninsurance. When he addressed the Nation in a joint session of Congress \non September 9, he said his plan would reduce the cost of health \ninsurance. But we find out that for at least 32 million Americans, it \nwill raise the cost of health insurance 10 to 13 percent. So at least \nhalf of the goal, if not most of the goal, of his plan for most \nAmericans in this country will not be accomplished. Yet we are going to \ncut nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare, we are going to raise taxes \nby $\\1/2\\ trillion, and we are going to spend $2.5 trillion on this \nprogram, which was admitted to by Senator Baucus yesterday on the \nfloor, which cannot be, under my understanding, in any way budget \nneutral.\n  But I want to speak specifically about the cuts to Medicare. It cuts \n$192 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, ``to \nMedicare's payment rates for most services.'' I think we have to be \nclear here that if you cut providers, you are going to cut services. \nThe very reason we talked about increasing doctor payments in that $\\1/\n4\\ trillion program was so that patients would not receive fewer \nservices, so there would be ample doctors providing services for \nMedicare. It is beyond logic to argue that cutting providers will not \ncut services. What will happen when we cut providers, doctors, nursing \nhomes, home health agencies, hospitals? Fewer and fewer of them will \nprovide benefits, and fewer and fewer of them will take Medicare.\n  The Chief Actuary of CMS believes the cuts in the bill we have before \nus could cause providers to end their participation in Medicare:\n\n     . . . providers for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive \n     portion of their business could find it difficult to remain \n     profitable and might end their participation in the program.\n\n  Every American understands this. If we pay less money to health care \nproviders, they are going to offer less benefits or more and more they \nare not going to participate in Medicare.\n  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found in June of last year \nthat 29 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who were looking for a \nprimary care doctor had a problem finding one to treat them. This is of \ngrave concern to the 3 million Floridians who are on Medicare. If a \ndoctor will not see them, what kind of health care plan is this? These \nseniors, our ``greatest generation,'' have paid into this program their \nwhole life. It is illusory if they can't find a doctor who will treat \nthem.\n  One of my constituents, Earl Bean, from Sanford, FL, recently told \nCNN that he called about 15 doctors when he was trying to find health \ncare, and he was told they were not taking new Medicare patients. So \nwhen we cut $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare, is that going to improve \nhealth care for seniors or is it going to continue to decline health \ncare for seniors? You can't get blood from a stone. It is going to make \nthe situation worse. For anyone to come to this floor and say that it \nwould not is incredible.\n  We have in Florida the second highest Medicare population. When we \ncut $135 billion from hospitals and $21 billion from the \ndisproportionate share fund, which is basically money that goes to \nthese hospitals to provide health care for seniors and the indigent, \nhow are they going to be able to provide that health care? I spoke to \nthe administrator of the North Broward Hospital District and told him \nabout this cut to the DSH funds, and he told me it would be devastating \nto their provision of health care.\n  Then we are going to take a very popular program called Medicare \nAdvantage--more than 900,000 Floridians in my State--and we are going \nto cut it as well. I recently visited the Leon Medical Center and their \nnew facility in Miami Dade County where they provide state-of-the-art, \nfirst-class health care for seniors; not only normal health care but \neyeglasses, hearing aids, dental care, and the constituents who go \nthere love it. They are getting the kind of health care that you would \nhope your senior citizens in your family would get.\n  The principal of the company, Ben Leon, told me they have saved $70 \nbillion in the way they have run their system. He told me if we \ncontinue on this path with these cuts to Medicare Advantage, he will \nnot be able to provide\n\n[[Page S12269]]\n\nthese good services going forward. There are some fixes to grandfather \nfolks in, but all in all people will be cut, and all in all the program \nwill not be as good, and it will decline the health care of seniors in \nFlorida and across this country.\n  We will cut $15 billion from nursing home care and $40 billion from \nhome health agencies. I spoke to a provider of a home health agency \npractice in Florida. He said these cuts will put half of the home \nhealth care agency folks out of business. At a time when we have 11.2 \npercent unemployment in Florida, this health care bill is going to cost \npeople their jobs, and it is going to decline the quality of health \ncare.\n  I am also concerned about this Medicare advisory board. This \nindependent board of nonelected folks is going to have the power to cut \nMedicare by $23 billion over the next 10 years, and it will be up to \nthis body to reinstate those cuts. These people are not elected, my \nconstituents in Florida don't know who they are, but they are going to \nbe responsible for the decline of their Medicare and their health care.\n  The ``greatest generation,'' who fought to protect this country, is \nlooking at this health care bill and wondering why. Folks with health \ninsurance in this country--more than 170 million who are not going to \nsee their health care costs go down but up--are wondering why. \nAmericans who are seeing higher taxes and penalties for not buying \nthese health insurance programs under this bill are wondering why.\n  If we are here to reform health care--and we should be--if we are \nhere to try to make sure the 45 million people in this country and the \nnearly 4 million Floridians get health insurance--and we should be--\nthen why don't we take a step-by-step approach?\n  I am new to this body. My first day here was September 10, so I have \nnot even been here 3 months. But I can tell my colleagues, the American \npeople, if they knew what I know now and could see what I see, would be \nbaffled by this process. There is not a give-and-take on this issue. We \ndidn't all sit down together in a conference room and work this out to \nhave a bipartisan bill. The Democratic leader worked on it with his \ncolleagues but not with us.\n  So now we have a program that cuts Medicare, that raises taxes, that \ndoesn't decrease the cost of health care for the majority of Americans \nand will cost us $2.5 trillion and can't be budget-neutral, at a time \nwhen we have a $12 trillion debt, a debt that requires each of us--each \nfamily--to put $100,000 on our shoulders to be responsible for that \ndebt, a debt where the third largest payment in our budget is for \ninterest payments, and over the next 10 years those interest payments \nwill go up by $500 billion, enough to pay for many of the budgets of \nthe Federal Government----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used his 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Including the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time would the Senator like to consume?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland controls \nthe time, and the Senator from Maryland has 33 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I yield myself a firm 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, health care is a woman's issue. Health \ncare reform is a must-do woman's issue, and health insurance reform is \na must-change issue.\n  So many of the women and men of the Senate are here today to fight \nfor change and to make sure we have universal access to health care. \nWhen we have universal access, it makes a difference in our lives, \nwhich means we have to have universal access to preventive and \nscreening services.\n  My amendment--and, by the way, it is a bipartisan amendment--makes \nuniversal access to preventive and screening services for women \navailable.\n  There is much discussion about whether women should get a particular \nservice at a particular age. We don't mandate that women get a service; \nwe leave that up to a decision made with the woman and her doctor. But, \nfirst of all, they need to be able to have a doctor. So we are for \nuniversal access, and this is why the underlying bill is so important.\n  Then, when you have that, there should also be universal access to \npreventive and screening services, particularly to the top killers of \nwomen, those things that are unique to women. We think about cancer: \nbreast cancer, ovarian cancer, and cervical cancer. Also, women are \ndying at an increased rate of lung cancer. Then there are these other \nsilent killers that have had a lethal effect on women, and that is \ncardio and vascular disease. So we want to guarantee universal access \nto medically appropriate or medically necessary screening and \npreventive services.\n  Many women don't get these services because, first of all, they don't \nhave health insurance; and, No. 2, when they do have it, it means these \nservices are either not available unless they are mandated by States or \nthe copayments are so high that they avoid getting them in the first \nplace.\n\n  The second important point about my amendment is it eliminates \ndeductibles and copayments. So we eliminate two big hurdles: having \ninsurance in the first place, which is the underlying bill, as well as \ncopayments and deductibles. I know of no one in this room who would not \nwant to be on our side on this issue.\n  I wish to acknowledge the role the Senator from Alaska has played, \nMs. Murkowski, as well as Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Senator Snowe, \nand Senator Collins. We, the women of the Senate, have worked on a \nbipartisan basis for years making sure we were included in the \nprotocols at NIH, increasing funding for important research areas to \nfind that cure, to race for that cure and, at the same time, to be able \nto have mammogram standards. What the Murkowski amendment--and by the \nway, she is Murkowski, I am Mikulski. We sound alike, and the \namendments might sound alike, but, boy, are they different.\n  The Murkowski amendment offers information. I think that is \nimportant. That is a threshold matter. You have to have information to \nmake an informed decision. But it does not guarantee universal access \nto these services, and, of course, it does not eliminate the high \npayments and deductibles. So her amendment is flawed. My amendment is \nterrific. My amendment offers key preventive services, including an \nannual women's health screening that would go to a comprehensive \nassessment of the dangers to women, including heart disease and \ndiabetes.\n  We hope when the Senate makes its decision today, it deals with the \nfact that for we women, the insurance companies take simply being a \nwoman as a preexisting condition. We face so many issues and hurdles. \nWe can't get health care. We can't get health insurance because of \npreexisting conditions called a C-section.\n  I am going to be meeting with an insurance company executive later \nwhere his company denied health insurance to a woman who had a \nmedically mandated C-section, and a letter from this insurance company \nsaid: We are not going to give you insurance unless you have a \nsterilization--a coerced sterilization in the United States of America. \nThat is going to be an amendment for another day. But I just wish to \ngive the flavor and the power of what women face when we have to cope \nwith the insurance companies or where there are barriers to our getting \nthese health care screening services.\n  So we want to be able to save lives, and we want to be able to save \nmoney. We believe in universal access, and if you utilize the service \nit is because you have had the consultation with your doctor. We do \nknow early screening and detection does save lives, and, at the same \ntime, it saves money.\n  I will conclude with this: When we look at heart disease and \ndiabetes, not only cancer but early detection of diabetes means, in a \nwell-managed program, under appropriate medical supervision you very \nlikely will not lose that eye, you will not lose that kidney, you will \nnot lose that leg and, most of all, you will not lose your life.\n  So let's not lose the Mikulski amendment. Let's go with Mikulski and \nthank Murkowski for her information, but hers is too tepid and too \nlimited.\n\n[[Page S12270]]\n\n  Madam President, I ask my colleague, one of the great guys who \nsupports us, Senator Cardin, how much time he needs.\n  I yield 5 minutes to Senator Cardin.\n  Mr. CARDIN. First, let me thank my colleague, Senator Mikulski, for \nher leadership on this issue. I strongly support her amendment for the \nreasons she said. This is a very important point about providing \npreventive health services to the women of America, a critically \nimportant part of our strategy not only to bring down costs in health \ncare, but to have a health care system that is fair in America.\n  I have been listening to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ntalk about the underlying bill. They talk about it as if this is a \nstatic situation. Many of the criticisms I hear about the underlying \nbill are criticisms about our current health care system. I can tell my \ncolleagues the people in Maryland, many of whom are finding it \ndifficult to find affordable coverage today, are outraged with what is \nhappening with private insurance companies and the attitudes they are \ntaking.\n  As Senator Mikulski pointed out, they are denying coverage for \npreexisting conditions or imposing arbitrary caps. As has been \nindicated, if we are unable to get this bill passed, what is going to \nhappen in the future? We know costs are going to become even greater, \nmore people are going to lose their coverage, insurance companies are \ngoing to continue their arbitrary practices, and the health care of \nAmericans is in jeopardy.\n  We are already spending so much of our economy on health care, and if \nwe don't take action, it will be a greater part of our economy.\n  But we have some good news. The underlying bill has now been analyzed \nby the CBO; that is the independent scorekeeper. What they tell us is, \nif we pass the underlying bill, for the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans, they are going to find that their health insurance premiums \nwill either stay the same or go down. For the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans, they will have a better insurance product that will cover \nthe types of preventive services Senator Mikulski is talking about, \nwhich are in her amendment.\n  We are not only going to bring down the cost for the overwhelming \nmajority of Americans as to what will happen if we don't pass a bill, \nwe are going to provide better coverage for them. The underlying bill \nwill also reduce dramatically the number of people who don't have \nhealth insurance in America by 31 million. That will make our system \nmuch more effective.\n  I have heard my colleagues talk about what is going to happen with \nMedicare. If we pass the underlying bill, we are going to strengthen \nMedicare. We already have a provision that there cannot be reductions \nin the guaranteed benefits. We pointed out that AARP endorses the bill. \nThey understand there will be additional preventive health care for our \nseniors, and we will help fill the doughnut hole in prescription drugs.\n  When you reduce the number of uninsured, the amount of cost Medicare \nhas to pay for health care in our hospitals is reduced. That is why we \ncan reduce our payments to hospitals in America, because the amount of \nuncompensated care they currently have will be dramatically reduced. I \nhave heard colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about \nMedicare Advantage. I remember when we used to pay the private \ninsurance companies in Medicare a little less than people in \ntraditional Medicare. Then we paid them the same. Now we are paying \nthem more. That is corporate welfare. Medicare Part B premiums are \nhigher than they should be. Taxpayer support is higher than it used to \nbe. We know these benefits that are being paid could be gone tomorrow. \nWe saw the private insurance companies leave the Maryland market and so \nmany other markets. These are reforms that save the taxpayers money and \nstrengthen Medicare for the future.\n  Bottom line: The bill is good for middle-income families. It will \nprovide the insurance reform so they have an insurance product that can \ncover their needs, including wellness and prevention programs. It is \ngood for small business because it offers more choice. I can tell you \nchapter and verse of small companies in Maryland that, today, cannot \nget an affordable product and are seeing 20, 30 percent increases in \ntheir premiums. They need this bill in order to be able to preserve \nhealth care for their employees.\n  This bill, with the Mikulski amendment, will provide the preventive \nhealth care for all Americans that is so desperately needed, which will \nreduce costs, improve quality, and make our health care system more \nefficient and effective in the future, bringing down costs by investing \nin wellness and prevention.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Mikulski amendment and to support \nthe underlying bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  Again, I point out to my colleagues, and to anybody else who may be \nobserving, the volume of this bill. This is 2,100 pages and 21 pounds, \nwhich means it is about a pound per 100 pages. It is $1.2 billion \ndollars per page, $6.8 million per word, and it creates 70 new \ngovernment programs. It gives the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices--in 1,600 or 1,700 instances in this bill--the opportunity to \ncreate, define, and determine things in the bill.\n  This is a big government bill, a massive expansion of the Federal \nGovernment--$2.5 trillion, when it is fully implemented. Of course, the \npaid-fors in the bill--all the things in this bill, not only those \nintended things but also the unintended consequences of the bill--you \nhave some revenue to pay for these things. Where do we get the revenue?\n  In the Reid bill, they decided they are going to raise taxes on small \nbusinesses, individuals and families and they are going to cut Medicare \nby about $\\1/2\\ trillion.\n  What is ironic about that is, a few years ago, the Republicans, back \nwhen we were in the leadership in the Senate, tried to do a budget bill \nthat actually achieved some savings in Medicare and Medicaid, to the \ntune of $27 billion combined. But the Medicare savings in that bill was \n$10 billion. That was over a 5-year period, at $2 billion per year. I \nwish to remind some of my colleagues on the other side about some of \nthe comments they made about that.\n  Senator Reid, at the time--bear in mind this was to reduce Medicare \nby $2 billion per year, $10 billion over 5 years. The now-majority \nleader said:\n\n       Unfortunately, the Republican budget is an immoral \n     document.\n\n  The Senator from West Virginia said this:\n\n       This proposed budget would be a moral disaster of \n     monumental proportions.\n\n  A couple other colleagues in the Senate commented. The Senator from \nMichigan said:\n\n       People who rely on Medicare and Medicaid are going to be \n     hurt by this bill.\n\n  The Senator from Wisconsin said:\n\n       I urge my colleagues to reject this bill, and the \n     irresponsible and cruel budget of which it is part.\n\n  The former Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, said this:\n\n       This bill slashes $6.4 billion from Medicare over the next \n     5 years.\n\n  It was actually $10 billion. My point is simply this: It was $10 \nbillion over 5 years, $2 billion per year. Those were the statements--\noverstatements--about the impact that a $2 billion reduction per year \nin Medicare was going to have on people in this country. Now we are \ntalking about $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts.\n  Where do their cuts come from? They will come from $118 billion from \nMedicare Advantage, which now we have about 11 million Americans \nimpacted by Medicare Advantage. Every State has seniors who have \nsubscribed to that program whose benefits will be cut if this bill is \nenacted. You get it out of hospitals because there are $135 billion in \nreductions and reimbursements to hospitals; $15 billion in reductions \nto nursing homes and reimbursements; $40 billion in reductions to home \nhealth agencies; and $8 billion in reductions to hospices.\n  Those are all the ways this $2.5 trillion expansion of the Federal \nGovernment is to be paid for. I didn't even get into the tax cuts, \nwhich will be a debate for another day.\n  The Medicare cuts in this bill are unlike anything we have seen in \nthe past.\n\n[[Page S12271]]\n\nClearly, when you compare it to 3, 4 years ago, when we were trying to \nachieve $10 billion in savings over 5 years, you thought the sky was \nfalling. Now here they are trying to pay for a $2.5 trillion expansion \nof the Federal Government by cutting $500 billion out of Medicare.\n  The point I also wish to make, because it has been made by the other \nside--by the most recent speaker--is that somehow this recent CBO \nanalysis should be hailed as good news. The corks are popping in the \ncelebration, and people are crowing about the new CBO report because it \nhas such good news for this bill and the impact it will have on people \nwho buy health insurance in this country.\n  What is it they are celebrating? CBO, in its report, essentially said \nthis: 90 percent of Americans are going to see their premiums increase \nor see virtually the same increases as they do today year after year.\n  That is preserving the status quo, not decreasing costs, as promised. \nPresident Obama, when he was running for office in 2007, said when he \ngot a chance to do health care reform, he was going to reduce costs by \n$2,500 for every family in this country and cover everybody.\n  This bill, after spending $2.5 trillion and creating 70 new \ngovernment programs, doesn't cover everybody. There are still 24 \nmillion Americans who don't get covered under this bill, according to \nthe CBO. Furthermore, nobody--I shouldn't say nobody--90 percent of \nAmericans, those who don't get subsidies, don't come out any better. \nThey will still see the year-over-year increases in premiums they have \nbeen seeing for the past several years, and the cost of health care is \ngrowing at twice the rate of inflation. If you assume a year-over-year \nincrease similar to the past several years, in the small group market, \nyou are looking at annual increases of over 6 percent for the cost of \nhealth care--to the point where a family that, today, is paying $13,000 \na year for health insurance, in 2016, will pay over $20,000 a year for \nhealth insurance. So nobody gets any better out of this, except a \nhandful of people who will get subsidies. If you are in the individual \nmarketplace, your premiums go up. According to the CBO, there will be a \n10- to 13-percent increase in premiums in the individual market. If you \nare in the large group market, you will see an almost 6-percent \nincrease a year. If you are in the small group market, premiums will go \nup over 6 percent a year.\n  We are talking about spending $2.5 trillion, cutting reimbursements \nto nursing homes, to hospitals, to home health agencies and hospices, \nand raising taxes on health care providers, medical device \nmanufacturers, prescription drugs, raising the Medicare payroll tax \nwhich, incidentally, doesn't go to preserve or extend the lifespan of \nMedicare or put it on a path toward sustainability but creates a whole \nnew government entitlement.\n  We are going to do all that for what? At best, to keep the status quo \nfor people today; at worst, to increase their premiums by 10 to 13 \npercent. That is the bottom line. That is what this says. That is the \nnew CBO report. That is the CBO report about which the other side is \nsaying this is great news. They are celebrating. It is great news that \npremiums are going to continue to go up at twice the rate of inflation, \njust like in the past, protecting and preserving the status quo as we \nknow it in America today.\n  This bill does nothing about the fundamental issue of cost. It \ndoesn't matter what market you are in--small group market, large group \nmarket--it stays the same, at best, and in the individual marketplace, \nyour premiums will go up 10 to 13 percent. That is the news being \nhailed by the other side as validating the argument for why we need to \npass a 2,100-page, $2.5 trillion monstrosity of a bill with 70 new \ngovernment programs in it.\n  We will vote on the Medicare amendment later. Senator McCain has a \nmotion to commit the bill to essentially take the Medicare cuts out of \nit. I hope my colleagues vote for it. They are arguing it doesn't cut \nMedicare. How can you say that with a straight face? How can you say \nyou are going to find $500 billion to pay for this bill out of Medicare \nand then say it doesn't cut Medicare? Of course it cuts Medicare. Of \ncourse it raises taxes. You can't finance $2.5 trillion of new spending \nunless you find a way to finance it.\n  The way they have chosen to finance this is to hit seniors squarely \nbetween the eyes and cut reimbursements to the providers all across \nthis country that are dealing with the serious health needs our senior \ncitizens are experiencing. In South Dakota, we have a lot of people who \nare employed in the health care industry. I think that is true of every \nState. Even in small towns in South Dakota, in nursing home employment \nyou are talking about almost 6,000 employees. You are going to take $15 \nbillion out of nursing homes, $40 billion out of home health agencies, \n$135 billion out of hospitals, and what we are talking about are huge \nreductions in Medicare, unlike anything we have seen.\n  As I said, to put it into perspective, a few short years ago, when we \nwere in the majority, in a budget trying to reduce Medicare by $10 \nbillion over a 5-year period, it was referred to as ``immoral,'' as a \n``monumental disaster,'' as ``cruel''--$10 billion over 5 years. This \nhas $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts--cuts to Medicare Advantage and \nproviders.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the McCain motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the junior \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Franken.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise to express my support for \nSenator Mikulski's amendment for women's health.\n  This amendment is crucial because it is about prevention. Prevention \nis one of the key ways this bill will transform our system of sick care \ninto true health care. It is common sense. You get the right screenings \nat the right time so you find diseases earlier. It saves lives and it \nsaves money.\n  The Senate bill already has several provisions for preventive care, \nwhich I strongly support. For example, colonoscopies and screening for \nheart disease will be covered at no cost. It is a good start.\n  The current bill relies solely on the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce to determine which services will be covered at no cost. The \nproblem is, several crucial women's health services are omitted. \nSenator Mikulski's amendment closes this gap. Under her amendment, the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration will be able to include \nother important services at no cost, such as the well woman visit, \nprenatal care, and family planning.\n  These preventive services will truly improve women's health. For \nexample, if all women got the recommended screening for cervical \ncancer, we could detect this disease earlier and prevent four out of \nevery five cases of this invasive cancer. This will improve the health \nof our mothers, sisters, and our daughters. This bill and this \namendment will make prevention a priority and not an afterthought.\n\n  Although I respect the efforts of my distinguished colleague from \nAlaska, the Murkowski alternative falls short. The Murkowski amendment \ndoes nothing to guarantee women will have improved access to coverage \nand cost-sharing protections for preventive services. Rather than \nestablish objective, scientific standards about which preventive \nservices should be covered, this alternative only requires insurers to \nconsult with medical organizations when making coverage decisions.\n  While we know the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations \ndo not cover all necessary services, the Murkowski amendment entirely \nremoves even this basic coverage requirement from the bill, leaving \nwomen without any protections under health care reform for essential \npreventive care. This means that important preventive care for women, \nincluding screening for osteoporosis and sexually transmitted \ninfections, may not be covered by insurance plans.\n  In the simplest terms, the Murkowski amendment maintains the status \nquo, and we know the status quo is not working for millions of women \nwho are forgoing preventive care because they simply cannot afford it. \nThe Murkowski amendment continues to leave prevention coverage \ndecisions up to health insurance companies, and that means there would \nbe no guarantee\n\n[[Page S12272]]\n\nthat any health plan will cover basic preventive services at all.\n  Do we want to leave these important decisions up to the insurance \ncompanies? The health of American women is too important to leave in \ntheir hands. That is why I urge my colleagues to support Senator \nMikulski's amendment and vote to make sure women can get the preventive \nscreenings they need to stay healthy. Most important, this amendment \nwill make sure women have access to these lifesaving screenings at no \ncost.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I request another 45 seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, prevention is just one of the ways this \nbill will improve women's health. It also ends insurance companies' \npractice of charging women more because they happen to be women, or \ndenying coverage based on a history of pregnancy, C-section, or \ndomestic violence.\n  We need to pass this bill this year to ensure comprehensive, \naffordable care for women throughout the country. And we need to \ninclude this amendment because I want to be able to look my wife in the \neye, I want to be able to look my daughter in the eye--my son, too--and \nmy future grandchildren in the eye and say we did everything we could \nin this bill to improve women's health. We cannot wait any longer. I \nurge all my colleagues to stand with us and support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, it is interesting, as a practicing \nphysician who has actually cared for women and nobody so far who has \nbeen in on this debate has ever done. I congratulate the Senator from \nMaryland for her care about prevention because we all know that is key.\n  The mischaracterization we heard about this bill is astounding. The \nreason we got in trouble with the Preventive Task Force is because it \ndid something that was inappropriate and did not have the appropriate \nprofessional groups on its task force when it made its recommendation \non breast cancer screening.\n  The Murkowski amendment says we will rely on the professional \nsocieties to make the determinations of what must be available. We have \nheard the Senator from Iowa say health insurance will decide that. That \nis absolutely untrue. Health insurance will not decide it. The \nprofessional societies will decide what will be covered, and the \ninsurance companies must cover it under the Murkowski amendment.\n  The second point is there will not be any objective criteria. The \nobjective criteria doctors practice under today are the guidelines of \ntheir professional societies.\n  Here is the difference between the Murkowski amendment and the \nMikulski amendment: The Senator from Maryland relies on the government \nto make the decision on what will be covered. She refers to the Health \nResources and Services Administration. She refers to the Health \nResources and Services Administration which has no guidelines \nwhatsoever on women's health care right now, other than prenatal care \nand childcare. That is the only thing they have.\n  For whom does HRSA work? HRSA works for the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services. So the contrast between these two amendments could not \nbe any more clear in terms of do we want to solve the problems we just \nexperienced on mammogram recommendations? We can let the government \ndecide, which got us into this trouble, and they will set the practice \nguidelines and recommendations for screening or you can let the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or the American \nCollege of Surgeons or the American College of Oncologists set and use \ntheir guidelines.\n  The choice is simple: The government can decide what care you get or \nthe people who do the care, the professionals who know what is needed, \nwho write the peer-reviewed articles, who study the literature and make \nthe recommendations for their guidelines.\n  Every month I get from the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists their new guidelines. I try to follow them at every \ninstance. The fact is, the Mikulski amendment says government will \ndecide. That is what it says. The government will decide through HRSA. \nThe Murkowski amendment says it is the best practices known by the \nphysicians who are out there practicing. What is the difference? How \ndoes it apply to you as a woman? It applies to you as a woman because \nthe people who know best get to make the recommendations rather than a \ngovernment bureaucracy. That is the difference.\n  If you will recall, under the stimulus bill we passed, we have a cost \ncomparative effectiveness panel, which will surely be in the mix \nassociated with the recommendations. If you look at what the task force \non preventive recommendations said from a cost standpoint, they were \nabsolutely right. From a patient standpoint, they were absolutely \nwrong.\n  The real debate on this bill--the Mikulski amendment is the start of \nthe real debate--is do we have the government decide based on cost or \ndo we have the professional caregivers who know the field decide based \non what is best for that patient. That is the difference.\n  What the Senator from Alaska does, which is necessary, is she says we \nwill rely on the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. We will \nrely on the American College of Surgeons. We will rely on the American \nCollege of Oncologists to determine what should be the screening \nrecommendations for patients.\n  For, you see, what happens with the Mikulski amendment is the \ngovernment stands between you and your doctor. That is what is coming. \nThat is what will be there.\n  There is no choice under the Murkowski amendment for an insurance \ncompany to have the option either to cover or not to cover. They must. \nIt says ``shall'' do that. So the mischaracterizations on what the \nMurkowski amendment actually says and does are unfortunate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, how much time does our side have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 17 minutes 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first, I thank Senator Mikulski for \nher leadership not only on this important amendment but on so many \nissues in health care, issues for women across this country. We are \nhonored to call her dean for all of us as it relates to focusing on the \nissues that are so critical to women and their families.\n  I thank Senator Reid for making this a priority and making this the \nfirst amendment we are offering in this debate.\n  We all know that often women are the ones making health care \ndecisions for their families as well as themselves. They are more \nlikely to be the person making health insurance choices. Women of \nchildbearing age pay on average 68 percent more for their health care \nthan men do. We have so many instances in which insurance companies are \nstanding between women and their doctors right now in making \ndecisions--decisions not to cover preventive services, such as a \nmammogram screening or a cervical cancer screening, decisions to call \npregnancy a preexisting condition so women cannot get health insurance, \ndecisions not to cover maternity care so that women and their babies \ncan get the care they need so that babies can be successful in life, \nboth prenatal care and postnatal care.\n  Women of this country have a tremendous stake in health care reform. \nWe pay more now, if we can find coverage at all, and there are too many \nways in which insurance companies block women from getting the basic \nhealth services they need.\n  This amendment is critically important to make sure that women are \nable\n\n[[Page S12273]]\n\nto get preventive care services without a deductible and without \ncopays. This amendment recognizes the unique health needs of women. It \nrequires coverage of women's preventive services developed by women's \nhealth experts to meet the unique needs of women.\n  Why do we stress that? We stress that because for years we have \nstruggled in so many areas to make sure that women's health needs were \nfocused on and not just health in general. When we look at research \nthrough the National Institutes of Health and what it took to get to a \nplace where research would be done for women on women's subjects or on \nfemale mice or rats rather than male subjects to make sure that the \ndifferences between men and women were considered in research, we have \nmade important steps in that direction. Again, Senator Mikulski was \nleading the way as it relates to having a women's health research \neffort in our country.\n  This is one more step to make sure we are covering women's preventive \nservices developed by women's health experts for the unique needs of \nwomen. That is what this is all about--making sure women have access to \npreventive services such as cervical cancer screenings, osteoporosis \nscreenings, annual mammograms for women under 50, pregnancy and post \npartum screenings, domestic violence screenings, and annual checkups \nfor women.\n  We know more women die of heart disease than actually any other \ndisease. This is something I do not think is widely known. We have even \nheard that many physicians do not realize the extent to which heart \ndisease is prevalent in women. All of us women have worked together on \na women's heart bill and part of that is for screenings. Part of that \nis to make sure we are screening for heart disease and strokes, the No. \n1 killer of women. This would make sure those screenings would be part \nof health care reform.\n  I could go on to list all the different prevention items, but I will \nsimply say that when we are talking about women's health and we are \ntalking about women's lives, this is an incredibly important amendment \nto adopt.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak on the Mikulski \namendment and the Murkowski amendment because I feel very passionate \nabout women's issues. In fact, Senator Mikulski and I have worked \nthroughout my time in the Senate and her time before me on these very \nissues--assuring that women's health care concerns, which are different \nfrom men's in many instances, are a part of any health care coverage in \nour country, and ongoing we must assure the same.\n  I have been an advocate for cancer screening services for women, and \nI was dismayed when I saw the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force a few \nweeks ago issuing new guidelines for cancer screening for women--breast \ncancer screening for women. We have all lived with breast cancer \nthroughout the course of the history of women, but especially in the \nlast probably 25 years the strides that we have made in saving lives \nand in the survivability of women with breast cancer is because we have \nhad early detection. We don't have a cure for breast cancer, and we are \nall fighting for that cure, but until we get it, the first line of \ndefense is early detection.\n  So now we have a new task force recommendation that says everything \nwe have had and enjoyed over the last 25 years in saving women's lives \nis no longer relevant because now, before the age of 50, you don't need \na mammogram, and after the age of 50 it is every other year.\n  Well, I know Senator Mikulski and I agree we do not think that is \nright. Neither did any other woman in the Senate when that was proposed \nyears ago by President Clinton. We all stood up and said no. I am \nstanding up and I am saying no once again, and I am sure every woman in \nthe Senate is, as many women in America are.\n  But the Mikulski amendment doesn't actually fully address the problem \nof having the task force--which is relied on 14 times in the bill \nbefore us--as the arbiter of what is necessary for our government \nprogram and that it then will surely become the private sector standard \nas well. That task force even has money allocated to advertize its task \nforce recommendations. So rather than the Mikulski amendment severing \nthe ties with the task force, the amendment now has another government \nagency that has the same capability to basically interfere between the \nwoman and her doctor, which is where we want the decisions to be made. \nCoverage decisions will be dictated by both the task force and a new \nHealth Resources and Services Administration entry into the mix.\n  While I certainly agree with Senator Mikulski about the importance of \npreventive services for women and insurance coverage decisions, I can't \nsupport her amendment because we still have not one but two government \ntask forces and committees that will be in the middle of these health \ncare coverage decisions. I think the coverage decisions should be made \nby doctors and their patients. That is why I have joined with Senator \nMurkowski in offering the alternative approach. This is what we should \nexpect from any future health care reform, and it is certainly what we \nexpect today.\n  The Murkowski amendment will leave the medical decisions to the \nguidelines established by those who know medical treatment best, which \nis our own doctors. In fact, we have just received a CBO assessment of \nwhat the Murkowski amendment would cost, and it actually says there \nwill be a savings. So rather than the Mikulski amendment, which would \nspend $1 billion over 10 years, the Murkowski amendment would actually \nsave $1.4 billion over 10 years. Why? Because the Murkowski amendment \nrelies on the combined commonsense and clinical judgment of American \nphysicians.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. So, Madam President, I urge a vote for the Murkowski \namendment. I know we have the same goals as Senator Mikulski and her \namendment, but I don't believe the Mikulski amendment achieves the goal \nof having a woman and her doctor make the decisions for her. That is \nthe key that I think is so important in this debate. I urge a vote for \nthe Murkowski amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nthe State of Washington, who has been a real leader on these issues.\n  By the way, Madam President, before the Senator speaks, I want to \nthank Senator Stabenow for a unique courtesy. This is her desk, and as \nmany of my colleagues know, I broke my ankle and I can't get up to \nwhere my desk is at this point. I will, however, in a matter of another \nfew weeks. But she has given me this desk on loan so that I could stand \non my own two feet to debate this amendment, and I wanted to thank her \nfor the courtesy.\n  Madam President, I also want to note something while the senior \nSenator from the Republican leadership is here, and the author of the \namendment. We, the women of the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, have \nworked for women's health. Today, we disagree on what is the best way \nto achieve it by these two amendments. I want to thank my colleagues \nfor setting a tone of civility. I think this has been one of the most \nrational, civilized conversations we have had over this, and I would \nlike to thank them.\n  As the leader on this side of the aisle, in terms of seniority, I \nwould like to extend my hand in friendship and suggest when this bill \nis done, and this amendment is done, we continue to focus on this \nwonderful work that we have done together. We have done things that \nhave saved millions of lives, and so I look forward to continuing that.\n  Madam President, I now yield 4 minutes to the Senator from the State \nof Washington, Mrs. Murray.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Maryland, and \nI would just say that wherever she stands on the floor of the Senate, \nshe leads us all. So we are delighted you are here and thank you so \nmuch for\n\n[[Page S12274]]\n\nyour leadership on this critical issue of making sure women have access \nto quality preventive health care services and screenings which are so \ncritical to women across the country.\n  Madam President, the Senator from Maryland offered this amendment, \nand I worked with her in the committee. She has been a leader on this \nfor many years, and I echo her comments as well that this has always \nbeen an issue. For as long as I have been here--since 1993--the women \nin the Senate, on both sides of the aisle, have stood up to make sure \nthat women's care is part of health care, and we understand we have to \nstand shoulder to shoulder. It is unfortunate at this time that we see \nthis in a little different light, but I agree with Senator Mikulski. We \nwill keep working together throughout our time here to make sure \nwomen's preventive services are covered.\n  I do support the Mikulski amendment and the Mikulski approach. Her \namendment requires all health plans to cover comprehensive women's \npreventive care and screenings at no cost to women. I just wanted to \ncome to the floor for a minute and point out why this is so important.\n  When the economy is hurting, women on the whole tend to think of \ncaring for their families first and not caring for themselves. They \ntake care of their children and their spouses first, and they end up \ndelaying or skipping their own health care in order to take care of \ntheir families. In fact, we know in 2007, a quarter of women reported \ndelaying or skipping their health care because of cost. In May of 2009, \njust 2 years later, a report by the Commonwealth Foundation found that \nmore than half of women today are delaying or avoiding preventive care \nbecause of its cost.\n  That is not good for women, it is not good for their families, and it \nis not good for their ability to be able to take care of their families \nand to take care of themselves. So Senator Mikulski's amendment is \nextremely important, especially in this economic time. We know if women \nget the preventive care and care for their needs, then they are able to \ncare for their families. Yet the situation we find ourselves in today \nis that women are not taking preventive care. They are not taking care \nof themselves. Therefore, when they get sick, they end up in the \nhospital and then their families are in trouble. So we know preventive \nservices can save lives, and it means better health outcomes for women.\n  We have to make sure we cover preventive services, and this takes \ninto account the unique needs of women. Senator Mikulski's amendment \nwill make sure this bill provides coverage for important preventive \nservices for women at no cost. Women will have improved access to well-\nwomen visits--important for all women; family planning services; \nmammograms, which we have all talked about so many times, to make sure \nthey maintain their health.\n  Madam President, I want to emphasize that this amendment preserves \nthe doctor-patient relationship and allows patients to consult with \ntheir doctors on what services are best for them. This has become a \nlarge topic of conversation over the last several weeks, and Senator \nMikulski's amendment makes sure if a woman under 50 decides to receive \nan annual mammogram, this amendment will cover it. She will be able to \nwork with her own doctor and take care of her health.\n  So, Madam President, I come to the floor today to strongly support \nthe Mikulski amendment, to thank her for her leadership, and I hope we \ncan get to and vote on this important issue and move on and pass health \ncare reform.\n  My constituents, when I go home, say: Move on. Get this done. We have \nto take care of this because of our economy, because of the impact on \nsmall businesses, because of the rising costs of premiums, and because \nof the large number of people who are losing their health care \ncoverage. This health care bill is going to make a major difference \nwhen we get it passed, and the American public can take a deep breath \nand say: Finally, our government has moved forward.\n  So let's get past this amendment. I support strongly the Mikulski \namendment. Let's move on this bill and take a major step forward for \nhealth care coverage for all Americans and pass the health care bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                                Abortion\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, may I ask the Senator from Maryland to \nyield for a question about her amendment, No. 2791 to H.R. 3590, the \npurpose of which is to clarify provisions relating to first dollar \ncoverage for preventive services for women?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Of course.\n  Mr. CASEY. Senator Mikulski had a similar amendment in the HELP \nCommittee bill and at that time, I commended the Senator on its \nsubstance as I am a strong supporter of preventive care for women. I \nthank her for offering this important amendment and particularly for \ncalling our attention to the importance of first dollar coverage of \npreventive services for women.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CASEY. Particularly in view of some of the recent controversy \nabout mammograms and coverage, I am particularly grateful that the \nSenator has clarified this with this amendment and allow for the fact \nthat preventive services must preserve the doctor-patient relationship. \nThus, women under 50 may decide with their doctor that they should have \na mammogram screening and this amendment would ensure coverage of such \nservice.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That is correct.\n  Mr. CASEY. There is one clarification I would like to ask the \nSenator. I know we discussed it during the HELP markup and it was not \nclarified at that time and thus I chose to vote against the amendment \nbecause of the possibility that it might be construed so broadly as to \ncover abortion. But I understand that the Senator has now clarified \nspecifically that this amendment will not cover abortion in any way. \nSpecifically, abortion has never been defined as a preventive service \nand there is neither the legislative intent nor the language in this \namendment to cover abortion as a preventive service or to mandate \nabortion coverage in any way. I ask the Senator is that correct?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes, that is correct. This amendment does not cover \nabortion. Abortion has never been defined as a preventive service. This \namendment is strictly concerned with ensuring that women get the kind \nof preventive screenings and treatments they may need to prevent \ndiseases particular to women such as breast cancer and cervical cancer. \nThere is neither legislative intent nor legislative language that would \ncover abortion under this amendment, nor would abortion coverage be \nmandated in any way by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment of \nthe Senator from Alaska, and I have talked with my good friend, the \nSenator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, about a side issue in this overall \ndebate about what is included in the definition of preventive care. The \nSenator from Maryland stated in a colloquy that ``there are no abortion \nservices included in the Mikulski amendment.'' She has stated that in \ncolloquy.\n  I have trouble, however, because I believe a future bureaucracy could \ninterpret it differently. So I asked my friend from Maryland if she \nwould include clear legislative language in this saying simply:\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the \n     Secretary, or any other governmental or quasi-governmental \n     entity, to define or classify abortion or abortion services \n     as ``preventive care'' or as a ``preventive service.''\n\n  I think that clarifies the issue, and it would be my hope that my \ncolleague from Maryland would include that in her language. It is not \nin there, even though there have been statements on the floor. But, as \nwe all know as legislators, it is one thing to say something on the \nSenate floor, and it is one thing to have a colloquy, but it is far \ndifferent to have it written in the base law. This is not in the base \nlaw.\n  So I would urge my colleague, the Senator from Maryland, to include \nthis language. Absent that, I think there is too much room for a \nbroader definition of what preventive care means; that it could include \nabortion services as well, and I would urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the Mikulski amendment if that is the case.\n  On that ground, I think there are other issues involved, and that is \nwhy I think the approach of the Senator from\n\n[[Page S12275]]\n\nAlaska is superior, while maintaining the doctor-patient privilege. I \nthink this is a good debate for us to have, given these recent \ndiscussions. But absent this change, I think there is another issue \nthat is involved that I would urge my colleagues to consider.\n  Madam President, I want to yield back to maintain some time for the \nSenator from Wyoming to be able to speak, so I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, disappointed that the Senate health \ncare debate has gotten off on the wrong foot. The first amendment voted \non would add almost a billion dollars to our budget deficits over the \nnext 10 years. We should make sure health plans cover women's \npreventive care and screenings, but we should also find a way to pay \nfor it, rather than adding that cost to the already mountainous public \ndebt. At a time of record deficits, Americans expect fiscal \nresponsibility from their representatives in Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kirk). Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are waiting for Senator Boxer to come \nto the floor, so if the other side of the aisle has another speaker, I \nknow at the end we hope that Senator Lisa and Senator Barb--I say that \nbecause our last names sound so much the same--could wrap it up.\n  How would the Senator from Wyoming like to proceed? We are waiting \nfor Senator Boxer or for Senator Baucus.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nAlaska so she can actually propose her amendment that we have been \ndebating and take up to 10 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Then I will wrap up.\n  Mr. ENZI. That would still leave us with 2 minutes. If it does leave \nus with 2 minutes, then I would have the Senator from Wyoming use that \n2 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Whatever way it will work and accommodate you while we \nare waiting to see who our speakers are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to start my comments by \nacknowledging my colleague from Maryland and accept her gracious offer \nto continue to work on this issue as it relates to women's health and \nwomen's health services. As has been noted by the Senator from Maryland \nand the Senator from Washington, this is an issue that we women of the \nSenate have come together on repeatedly, to work cooperatively. While \nwe do have, some would say, somewhat dueling amendments here, I think \nit is important to recognize the goals we are both seeking to attain \nhere are certainly right in alignment. We are just choosing different \nmeans to get there. But I appreciate, again, the civility and \ncooperation from not only Senator Mikulski but the other women of the \nSenate on this very important issue.\n  I wish to reiterate a couple of points about my amendment that I made \nyesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I fear the microphone of the Senator \nfrom Alaska is not working.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Is that better?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That is so much better. I want to hear about the \namendment and continue our conversation.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. The Senator just missed all the kind remarks I \ndirected to her attention.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent she be extended an additional 2 \nminutes. No, I withdraw that request.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I will make sure those comments that were made for the \nRecord will be delivered to the Senator personally.\n  I want to reiterate some points I made yesterday about my amendment \nand I will also share with my colleagues, I know the Senator from Texas \nmentioned it as well, the CBO score we received late last evening. It \nprovides us with a score showing a cost savings of $1.4 billion over \nthe next 10 years. I think this is significant, as Members, certainly \nfrom the other side, raised the importance of fiscal discipline and our \nfiduciary responsibility here. Importantly, the CBO indicated the \nprovisions on the second page which prevent the Secretary from using \nthe recommendations of the USPSTF to deny coverage would cost money \nwhich means we are protecting certain benefits and that is very \nimportant.\n  The amendment we will have before us, the Murkowski amendment, is one \nthat allows or requires a level of transparency with the recommended \nhealth screenings, prevention services that are deemed necessary not by \nsome task force that is appointed by folks within the administration, \nnot by some commission that has political relationships. What we are \nurging is that the health screenings, the preventive services, be \ndetermined by those who are actually in the field, those \npractitioners--those who are engaged in oncology, OB/GYNs. We need to \nbe looking to the experts. We need to be looking to that peer-reviewed \nscience. We don't need to be looking to those entities that have been \nbrought together by a government entity or by the Secretary. We need to \nbe looking to the likes of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, \nthe American College of Surgeons, the American College of Radiation \nOncology, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. We need to \nlook to their recommendations.\n  Again, as I mentioned yesterday in my comments, if you go to their \nWeb sites, if you look to their specific recommendations, they will \ngive guidance, guidance that, again, is based on their practice in \noncology, their practice as an OB/GYN. Look to what they set out as the \nguidelines for cervical cancer screening, for mammograms, and let that \ninformation be made available publicly through the pamphlets, the plans \nthat come together from the insurance companies. But allow them--allow \nme, as a consumer of health care, me as a consumer looking for the best \nplan for me and my family--to know what those guidelines are, not from \na government task force but from those who are the real experts. I \nthink this is the transparency that health care shoppers are looking \nfor.\n  Some have suggested: Lisa, your amendment doesn't require the \ninsurance companies to provide any prevention or screening services. \nThere is no mandate in there. If we do not have a mandate, then the \ninsurance companies are not going to provide health care prevention and \nscreening services.\n  I think we need to ask the question here, what is the point of \nprevention? It is to prevent more expensive care in the future by \npreventing the chronic and more acute illnesses. So should not the \ninsurance companies want to utilize more preventive services, utilize \nmore screenings, more wellness services, in order to keep down the \ncosts of care based on the judgment of the doctors, based on the \njudgment of the professionals, and not necessarily those who, again, \nare part of a government entity?\n  I know within my staff I have a member who is on the FEHBP plan, but \nthey contact her on a somewhat regular basis about her diabetes care, \nensuring she is taking her medications, getting the necessary \npreventive services offered by her insurer for her particular \ncondition.\n  It has been mentioned by several of my colleagues that this USPSTF is \nnot such a bad group of guys, they are not just these nameless, \nfaceless bureaucrats. I think it is important to recognize, and even \nthe American Heart Association has recognized it, that the Preventive \nServices Task Force is limited to only primary care doctors and not \nspecialists such as the oncologists, the cancer doctors who see \npatients every day battling cancer. These doctors who are providing \nAmericans with their suggestions on what services are necessary for \ncancer screenings, but yet these doctors are not part of this task \nforce, have again shone the spotlight on what happens when you have a \ngovernment entity or government task force that is basically the one \nsaying this is what is going to be covered, this is not what is going \nto be covered. In my amendment, we specifically provide that the \nrecommendations from USPSTF cannot be used to deny coverage of an item \nor service by a group health plan or health insurance offeror. I think \nthat is very important.\n  I think it is also important to recognize that what we do in my \namendment is make sure the health plans consult the recommendations and \nguidelines of the professional medical organizations to determine what \nprevention benefits should be covered by these health insurance plans \nthroughout the country.\n\n[[Page S12276]]\n\nWe also require plans to provide this information directly to the \nindividuals. You get to see it for yourself. You get to make that \ndetermination. So what that means is the doctors and the specialists \nwill be recommending what preventive services to cover, not those in \nWashington, DC.\n  My amendment ensures that the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nshall not use any of the recommendations, again made by the task force, \nto deny coverage. We also include broad protections to prevent \nbureaucrats at the Department of Health and Human Services from denying \ncare to patients based on comparative effectiveness research. And \nfinally, we have a provision that ensures the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services may not define or classify abortion or abortion services \nas preventive care or as preventive services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I appreciate that. I think my amendment is \nstraightforward. I think it is a good compromise and again it is a \nclear differential between what we are going to do to allow a woman to \nhave full choice with her doctor as opposed to government telling us \nwho we should be seeing.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2836 to Amendment No. 2786\n\n  Mr. President, I ask consent to call up my amendment, No. 2836.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski] for herself, Mrs. \n     Hutchison, and Mr. Johanns, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2836 to amendment No. 2786.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To ensure patients receive doctor recommendations for \n preventive health services, including mammograms and cervical cancer \n screening, without interference from government or insurance company \n                              bureaucrats)\n\n       On page 17, strike lines 11 through 14.\n       On page 17, line 15, strike ``(2)'' and insert ``(1).''\n       On page 17, line 20, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(2)''.\n       On page 17, between lines 24 and 25, insert the following:\n\n     ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary \n     shall not use any recommendation made by the United States \n     Preventive Services Task Force to deny coverage of an item or \n     service by a group health plan or health insurance issuer \n     offering group or individual health insurance coverage or \n     under a Federal health care program (as defined in section \n     1128B(f) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(f))) \n     or private insurance.\n       ``(b) Determinations of Benefits Coverage.--A group health \n     plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or \n     individual health insurance coverage shall, in determining \n     which preventive items and services to provide coverage for \n     under the plan or coverage, consult the medical guidelines \n     and recommendations of relevant professional medical \n     organizations of relevant medical practice areas (such as the \n     American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American College \n     of Surgeons, the American College of Radiation Oncology, the \n     American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and \n     other similar organizations), including guidelines and \n     recommendations relating to the coverage of women's \n     preventive services (such as mammograms and cervical cancer \n     screenings).

The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am going to speak very briefly on the \npending subject and then let the sponsor of the amendment, that is the \nMikulski amendment, finish up here. I think it is very telling--I know \nthis point has been made before but I think it bears repeating--the \nAmerican Heart Association, American Stroke Association has written and \nreleased to the Senate this letter. I will read the most important part \nhere. Basically they say they strongly support requiring health plans \nand Medicare providing first dollar coverage for clinical preventive \nservices that are evidence based and necessary for the prevention or \nearly detection of an illness or disability. We all agree with that.\n  They go on then to comment on the Murkowski amendment, saying they \nappreciate the Murkowski amendment recognized the value of the guidance \nand recommendations but they go on to say that even these guidelines \nmust be held to a standard of being evidence based.\n  I might say, I run across this over and over again in the medical \nprofession--medical experts. We need to keep moving more and more \ntoward evidence-based medicine.\n  This statement from the American Heart Association, American Stroke \nAssociation, goes on to say:\n\n       In addition, we are concerned that Senator Murkowski's \n     preventive health services amendment would take a step \n     backwards by substituting the judgment of the independent \n     U.S. Preventive Services Task Force with the judgment of \n     private health insurance companies.\n\n  Frankly, it is a point I very much agree with. I don't think we want \nthe judgment of private health insurance companies making these \ndecisions. I think it is appropriate the sponsor of the amendment \nfinish. She is doing a very good job.\n  Mr. ENZI. I will yield our final minute to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, my wife Bobbi was diagnosed with breast \ncancer by a screening mammogram in her forties. It is that screening \nmammogram that has saved her life. By the time of the mammogram, the \ntumor had spread and she has had two operations and two full bouts of \nchemotherapy. I do not want a government bureaucrat making a decision \nfor the women of America if they should be allowed to have screening \nmammograms. It saves lives--1 in 1900, for women in their 40s.\n  The Reid bill empowers bureaucrats to decide what preventive benefits \nwill be allowed for American women. The amendment from the Senator from \nMaryland does the same--bureaucrats, not the physicians who are doing \nthe treating. That is why I support the amendment of the Senator from \nAlaska, because that amendment says the Federal Government cannot use \nrecommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, \nrecommendations from bureaucrats, to deny care to anyone including \nseniors on Medicare--anyone in America. That is how this decision \nshould be made, not by government bureaucrats.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time is there on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  As we get ready to conclude the debate on both the Mikulski as in \nBarbara Mikulski and Murkowski as in Lisa Murkowski amendments, I want \nto first say a word about the Senator from Alaska. We have worked \ntogether on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. We \nhave worked together as women of the Senate, to provide access to \nwomen's health services. Not too long ago, when I had my awful fall, \nshe gave me much wisdom and counsel and practical tips because she \nherself had broken her ankle. To us, when you say to Senator Lisa or \nSenator Barb, ``Break a leg,'' it has a whole different meaning. I \nagain thank her for all her work. I have great respect for her. I look \nforward to our continued working together.\n\n[[Page S12277]]\n\n  But I do sincerely disagree with her amendment because what her \namendment does is, it guarantees, really, only information. It does not \nguarantee universal access to preventive and screening services.\n  It also does not remove the cost barriers by eliminating the high \ndeductibles for the copayments when you go to get a preventative or \nscreening service. It tells insurance companies to give information on \nrecommended preventative care. That is a good thing, but it is a \nthreshold thing. You need to have universal access to the service.\n  In addition, we do not mandate that you have the service; we mandate \nthat you have access to the service. The decision as to whether you \nshould get it will be a private one, unique to you. We leave it to \npersonalized medicine. So in the poignant case of the wife of the \nSenator from Wyoming, it would have been up to the doctor, the \nphysician, to get her the service she needed.\n  It is not only I or one side of the aisle that is opposing the \nMurkowski amendment. The American Cancer Society, the American Heart \nAssociation, and the American academy of GYN services oppose it.\n  My amendment is a superior amendment because it guarantees universal \naccess to preventative and screening services. It also eliminates one \nof the major barriers to accessing care by getting rid of high payments \nand deductibles. It doesn't say you will have a mammogram at 40 \nbecause, again, we are substituting ourselves for the task force; it \nsays you will have universal access to that mammogram if you and your \ndoctor decide it is medically necessary or medically appropriate.\n  Vote for Mikulski. Don't vote for Murkowski. And please, on this one, \nget it straight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 2791 offered by the Senator from Maryland, \nMs. Mikulski, as amended.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 61, \nthe nays are 39. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the \nadoption of this amendment, amendment No. 2791, as amended, is agreed \nto. Under the previous order, the motion to reconsider is considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2836\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate, \nequally divided, prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 2836, \noffered by the Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Lisa \nMurkowski amendment. Though well-intentioned, it does not guarantee \nuniversal access to preventive and screening services for women. It \ndoes not remove the cost barriers of high payments and codeductibles. \nIt is opposed by the American Cancer Society and the American Heart \nAssociation. It primarily provides information on those matters.\n  We salute her intention, but we think her amendment is too limited, \nand, to quote the American Heart Association, it would be an actual \n``step backwards'' in the area of making preventive services available, \nparticularly not only in the matter of cancer but in heart and vascular \ndisease--the emerging No. 1 killer for women.\n  I urge defeat of the Murkowski amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nensure we do not have government entities that are making those \ndecisions we as individuals working with our doctors feel is best.\n  The intent behind this amendment is to ensure that those medical \nprofessional organizations, whether it is the American Society of \nClinical Oncology or the American College of Surgeons or the American \nCollege of Radiation Oncology or the American Society of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists--those who are in the practice, those who are making \nthe recommendations--these are the individuals we want to know are \nbeing consulted, not some entity that has been created by those of us \nin the government or by some administration, by some Secretary.\n  So what we propose with this amendment is an insurance offering, if \nyou will.

Madam President, this afternoon I voted \nagainst the amendment offered by my colleague, the senior Senator of \nMaryland, Ms. Mikulski.\n  I voted against this amendment with regret because I strongly support \nthe underlying goal of furthering preventive care for women, including \nmammograms, screenings, and family planning. Unfortunately, the \namendment did not incorporate language I suggested to specifically \nclarify that abortion would not be covered as a future preventive care \nservice. I appreciate the assurances from Senator Mikulski in a \ncolloquy on the floor that abortion would not be covered as a \npreventive service, but words do not supersede the language in the \nlegislative text. I do\n\n[[Page S12278]]\n\nlook forward to ways in which Congress can further preventive care \nservices for women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2826 to Amendment No. 2786\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I have an amendment No. 2826 at the desk. \nI would like to call it up at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Bennet], for himself, Mr. \n     Harkin, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Brown, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \n     Wyden, Mr. Begich, Mr. Bayh, and Mrs. Shaheen, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2826 to amendment No. 2786.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To protect and improve guaranteed Medicare benefits)\n\n       On page 1134, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n   Subtitle G--Protecting and Improving Guaranteed Medicare Benefits\n\n     SEC. 3601. PROTECTING AND IMPROVING GUARANTEED MEDICARE \n                   BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) Protecting Guaranteed Medicare Benefits.--Nothing in \n     the provisions of, or amendments made by, this Act shall \n     result in a reduction of guaranteed benefits under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act.\n       (b) Ensuring That Medicare Savings Benefit the Medicare \n     Program and Medicare Beneficiaries.--Savings generated for \n     the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act under the provisions of, and amendments made by, this Act \n     shall extend the solvency of the Medicare trust funds, reduce \n     Medicare premiums and other cost-sharing for beneficiaries, \n     and improve or expand guaranteed Medicare benefits and \n     protect access to Medicare providers.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I was paying very close attention to the \nfloor debate over the last few days, and at times I am beginning to \nwonder what bill it is we are debating. Only in Washington could an \neffort to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund be viewed or \ndistorted somehow as being unfair or bad for seniors.\n  We know--and it is in print in the CBO report--this bill doesn't take \naway any senior's guaranteed Medicare benefits. We know the bill \nextends Medicare solvency for 5 additional years. How does it do that? \nIt does it in a way that is different from the way government usually \ndoes business, which is either adding or cutting from a program. It \nchanges the way we deliver medicine in this country, and it does it in \na way that protects senior benefits, and it extends the life of \nMedicare.\n  The attacks on this bill and my amendment have nothing to do with \nthose facts. The sad part is that there are ideas on every side of this \ndebate that are worth considering. We should be debating those ideas \nrather than claiming something that is just not true about the bill.\n  These Washington tactics of trying to shift health care reform back \nto some committee to languish is exactly why nothing ever gets done \naround here. The almost unbelievable part of this is that the opponents \nof my amendment say the health care bill hurts seniors. Yet the bill \nand our amendment is being supported by the AARP, the Alliance for \nRetired Americans, Center for Medicare Rights, and the National \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.\n  What are the opponents of my amendment actually saying--that AARP and \nother senior advocates don't know what they are doing? They know what \nthey are doing, and they also know what is in the bill. The AARP has \nseniors' best interests in mind, and they want what is best for \nMedicare in the long run. This bill makes tremendous strides to a more \nsolvent, more stable Medicare Program for years to come.\n  Unfortunately, in the hopes of eventually trying to kill the bill, \nthere are people who are making claims that are frightening our \nseniors--meant to frighten them--here and also in Colorado, where \npeople have been calling on their phones convinced that somehow I want \nto cut their benefits. Nothing could be further from the truth. I \nbelieve strongly in the sacred trust we have created with our seniors. \nThat is why I introduced this amendment. Seniors are looking for simple \nclarity, and health care reform can help their lives.\n  This amendment says, in the clearest and most unambiguous of terms, \nas directly as we can say it, that nothing in this bill will cut \nguaranteed Medicare benefits. All guaranteed Medicare benefits stay \nintact for every senior in Colorado and all across the country. Seniors \nwill still have access to hospital stays, to doctors, home health care, \nnursing homes, and prescription drugs.\n  The second part of the amendment goes further and says clearly and \ndirectly to seniors that we will use this bill to further protect and \nstrengthen Medicare. We will extend the life of the Medicare trust \nfund. We will lower premiums or cost share, increase Medicare benefits, \nand improve access to providers. You don't need to believe me. Look at \nthe CBO. These improvements will be paid for with money saved in \nMedicare under this bill.\n  What is so regrettable about the debate, and so tragic, is, if we \ndon't actually get this done, Medicare would be bankrupt in just 7 \nyears--in 2017. In the Senate bill we are now considering, we extend \nthe trust fund's solvency by 5 years. We lower premiums for seniors by \n$30 billion over 10 years. That is real money back in the pockets of \nour seniors. We eliminate copays that seniors now have to pay for \npreventive care. That means when seniors go to the doctor for a \ncolonoscopy, they would not have to make the copay like they have to \nunder current law. When they go to get a mammogram, the same is true. \nWe know preventive care like that saves lives and also money.\n  Most seniors live on a fixed income. Free preventive care is the best \nway to encourage seniors to seek important medical precautions. More \npreventive care is proven to save lives and lower health care costs.\n  Mr. President, health care reform will cut the cost of brand-name \nprescription drugs in half for those who are stuck in the gap of \ncoverage between initial and catastrophic coverage. We eliminate the \n20-percent cut physicians would otherwise see next year, making sure \nseniors can continue to see their own doctor.\n  Opponents of health care reform don't have a plan to protect seniors \nand strengthen the Medicare Program. I have heard more criticism about \nthe number of pages in the bill than I have heard about a responsible \nalternative that would extend the life of Medicare and make the other \nbenefits that are in this bill.\n  I wanted to come to the floor with a simple and straightforward \nmessage to seniors: We will protect Medicare. This bill does. We will \nmake sure nobody touches your guaranteed benefits. This bill does. We \nwill make sure Medicare is around for future generations. This bill \ngets us started in that direction. That is why I have introduced this \namendment and why I support health care reform.\n  Everything I have said today is entirely consistent with the findings \nof the CBO, the nonpartisan organization that advises this Chamber. \nThis legislation makes explicit the commitment that all of us share to \nthe seniors across the United States of America. It is my hope that \nonce this amendment passes, we can get beyond the debate we have had \nover the last 72 hours and get on to the substantive aspects of the \nbill.\n  I urge support for my amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, over the past several months I have \ncome to the floor on a couple of occasions to remind my colleagues and \nthe American people about the unsustainable fiscal crisis confronting \nthis country.\n  Our national debt has exceeded $12 trillion for the first time in \nhistory. In fact from 2008 to 2009 alone, the Federal debt will \nincrease 22 percent, boosting the country's debt-to-income ratio--or \nnational debt as a percentage of GDP--from 70 percent last year to 86 \npercent this year. We have not seen this kind of debt to GDP ratio \nsince the Second World War 65 years ago.\n  The American people know that this is unsustainable, but my Senate \ncolleagues from on the other side of the aisle continue to ignore this \nreality. I pledged that I would continue to cry ``the emperor has no \nclothes'' until we did something to address this crisis.\n  I should explain. Most people know the story, ``The Emperor's New \nClothes,'' by Hans Christian Anderson.\n\n[[Page S12279]]\n\n  In the tale, an emperor goes about the land wearing a nonexistent \nsuit sold to him by a new tailor who convinced the monarch the suit is \nmade of the finest silks. The tailors--two swindlers--tell the emperor \nthat the threads of his robes will be so fine that they will look \ninvisible to those dimwitted, or unfit for their position. The emperor \nand his ministers, themselves unable to see the clothing, lavish the \ntailor with praise for the suit, because they do not want to appear \ndimwitted or incompetent.\n  Word spread across the kingdom of the emperor's beautiful new robes. \nTo show off the extraordinary suit, a parade was formed. People lined \nthe streets to see the emperor show off his new clothes. In this case, \nthe health care reform bill before the Senate.\n  Again, afraid to appear stupid or unfit, everyone pretends to see the \nsuit. It is only when a child cries out ``the emperor wears no \nclothes'' does the crowd acknowledge that the emperor is, in fact, \nnaked.\n  Like the little boy crying out, those of us on this side of the aisle \nare pointing out this bill is fiscally not responsible.\n  Yet, while not addressing our current health care challenges, the so-\ncalled health care reform bill we are debating also creates new \nprograms at a time when we aren't paying for the one we already have, \nand it adds $2.5 trillion to what we are already spending.\n  I learned as a mayor and as a Governor, if you cannot afford what you \nare doing, how can you take on new responsibilities?\n  We could be using this opportunity to fix our health care system by \nfinally working to lower health care costs and pass those savings on to \ncitizens who are already overburdened by an expensive health care \nsystem.\n  Yet instead of commonsense incremental reforms that increase access \nto affordable, quality health care, reduce the costs of health care for \nall Americans, and lower our national health care spending, we have \nthis bill before us.\n  Unfortunately, the bill violates the medical principle, first, do no \nharm. Instead, it is more of the same--more spending and more taxes--on \nan already struggling economy, this at a time when we are currently \nwitnessing the worst recession this country has experienced since the \nGreat Depression.\n  The legislation we are considering when fully implemented, as I \npointed out, spends $2.5 trillion to restructure our health care \nsystem. Yet it fails to rein in the cost of health spending in the next \ndecade. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to health care; that is, the cost of health \ncare paid for by the Federal Government, would actually increase. In \nother words, we are adding more on to this extraordinary debt we have--\nunfunded mandates we have--in terms of Medicare.\n  The bill's proponents will tell you it is paid for. But as David \nBroder points out in his November 22 Washington Post editorial:\n\n       While CBO said that both the House-passed bill and the one \n     Reid has drafted meet Obama's test by being budget neutral, \n     every expert I have talked to says the public has it right. \n     These bills, as they stand, are budget-busters.\n\n  And that is what many people are hearing right now from their \nconstituents, particularly many of those individuals who are taking \nadvantage of the Medicare Advantage Program.\n  Furthermore, as former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin pointed out \nin the Wall Street Journal, this bill uses ``every budget gimmick and \ntrick in the books.''\n  What are these gimmicks? Most troubling to me and what my colleagues \non the floor have been discussing for the last few days is what the \nbill does to the Medicare Program.\n  I think we need to be honest with the American people. The Medicare \nProgram is already on shaky footing. Despite $37 trillion in unfunded--\nunfunded--future Medicare costs and the prediction that the Medicare \ntrust fund is expected to be insolvent by 2017, this bill calls for \n$465 billion in cuts to Medicare, not to fix the program but, as I \nsaid, to create new programs.\n  For example, this health care bill fails to acknowledge the $250 \nbillion that is necessary to reform the Medicare physician payment \nformula to ensure that our Nation's seniors will be able to see the \ndoctor of their choice in the future. I have heard it firsthand from \nfamily and friends that in some places in Ohio, Medicare beneficiaries \nalready face delays for physician services.\n  Right in my hometown, I have had doctors tell me: George, if I have \nsomebody before they are Medicare eligible and they go on Medicare, I \nwill take care of them. I am not taking anymore new Medicare patients \nbecause of the reimbursement system. I heard the same thing in terms of \nMedicaid.\n  We have a problem out there. Sadly, my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle do not want to be honest with the American people and include \nthe cost of the physician payment fix in the bill. It should be there. \nLet's be honest about it. Let's be transparent. It is another example, \nI think, of the smoke and mirrors and budget gimmicks and tricks that \nformer CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin mentioned.\n  Like I said, we must fix our health care system to help millions of \nAmericans who find themselves without insurance and those struggling to \npay their health insurance premiums. We must increase competition in \nthe private market, make it easier for small businesses and individuals \nto purchase insurance and reform our medical liability system. I call \nthis malpractice lawsuit abuse reform. We should have done that a long \ntime ago. But the fact is that the trial lawyers do not want that to \nhappen. So we are doing nothing about a problem that is causing \nphysicians to give unnecessary tests that are driving up the cost of \nhealth care in this country.\n  Most important, we need to focus our efforts on jobs, jobs, jobs, \njobs, jobs because one of the best things we can do to increase health \ncare coverage is to help businesses start to hire again. I need a job. \nOne of the reasons I need a job is when I have a job, in most \ninstances, I have some form of health care. We have a lot of people who \nare being dropped off. We need more jobs. We should be concentrating on \nthat if we want to up the number of people who can get health care.\n  To repeat, we do not need to create another set of government \nprograms that spends an additional $2.5 trillion to build a new \nentitlement system when we cannot afford the one we have now. That is \nthe biggest thing with me. If you cannot afford what you have, how can \nyou take on more? When we do that, we are being fiscally irresponsible. \nWe should deal with what we have. It is amazing to me. If you look \naround the country, States are cutting their expenses and they are \nraising taxes. And what are we doing in Washington? We are taking on \nmore expensive programs we cannot afford. That is what I think is \ntroublesome to me as a debt hawk.\n  We need to understand what we are doing. The American people are \npaying attention and they know that the emperor has no clothes when it \ncomes to doing something about our unsustainable fiscal crisis.\n  We are losing our credibility and our credit worldwide. They know it \nis immoral to be putting this debt on the backs of our children and \ngrandchildren. I believe this health care bill does that exactly. It \nexacerbates our current fiscal situation.\n  There are lots of good things out there, a lot of good things we all \nwould like to do. But just like a family, if you cannot afford what you \nare doing now, how can you afford to take on more responsibility in \nterms of debt?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I think it is important to focus on the \nfiscal difficulties we have today, but I think it is also important to \nrecognize the probable causes of these huge deficits: two wars, \nunfunded, no attempt to fund them, spent simply by running up the \ndeficit; tax cuts, which were unfunded and which did not ultimately \ngenerate the kind of sustained economic growth and job growth that \ntheir supporters advertised, and then the Medicare Part D program, an \nentitlement program which was also completely unpaid for.\n  Today we have people talking about entitlement reform, how that is a \nkey aspect of health reform. But so many of my colleagues on the \nRepublican side supported President Bush when he\n\n[[Page S12280]]\n\nproposed the Medicare Part D program, a worthy program in concept, but \nin the context of not paying for it, it is a concept that is costing us \ngreatly today.\n  Additionally, it is particularly ironic at this moment, because we \nare considering a McCain motion that would report this health care bill \nback to the committee with the instructions to restore $400 billion in \nspending, roughly, over 10 years. I cannot think of anything more \ncontrary to the notion of entitlement reform.\n  What we have tried to do in this bill is to restructure Medicare so \nthat it will continue providing quality health care, but also recognize \nthe high costs we are facing going forward and the general economic \nclimate we face today. Again, let me remind you, in January 2001, the \nunemployment rate was about 4.6 percent. When President Obama took \noffice, it was double that and growing and continuing to grow.\n  We have seen some effects to limit this growth, but it is still a \ncritical issue. Again, this reform package is designed not only to deal \nwith the quality of health care, accessibility to health care, and \naffordability of health care, but it is designed to, over the long \nterm, begin to rein in costs that are absolutely out of control.\n  Those suffering the most from this course are the American people \nand, in some respects, small business men and women. Their health care \ncosts are going up faster than any other costs, and in many instances \nfaster than wages, and it is unsustainable.\n\n  If in my State of Rhode Island we do not take effective action, we \nwill see within several years premiums reaching $24,000 to $30,000 a \nyear for a family of four. We cannot sustain that.\n  If someone is interested in taking the very difficult step of \nentitlement reform, they would reject the McCain motion. But there are \nother reasons to reject the amendment, as well. First, the funding that \nhas been eliminated from the current health care system and the system \ngoing forward, has been eliminated because it does not improve care. \nThis is particularly true in Medicare Advantage.\n  This was a program that was developed and sold essentially to the \nAmerican people as cost containment for Medicare. This was one of the \nproposals that would rein in out-of-control health care costs by giving \ninsurance companies the ability to manage more effectively.\n  Of course, what we have seen is a significant increase in payments to \nMedicare Advantage payments over traditional Medicare. Of course, these \ninsurance companies can manage health care very well as long as they \nare receiving very significant premium payments from beneficiaries. \nBut, those premiums do not essentially go to better health care. It \ncertainly goes, however, to better profits for the insurance companies.\n  Indeed, with Medicare Advantage there is a rebate given to each \ninsurance company. This is not the case with traditional Medicare. The \nrebate was designed essentially to provide, again, lower cost access to \nhealth care benefits for the consumers of Medicare Advantage.\n  The GAO found that 19 percent of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries \nactually pay more than traditional Medicare for home health care and 16 \npercent pay more for inpatient services. Here is the irony. We are \npaying the insurance companies more, but the beneficiaries of Medicare \nAdvantage are, indeed, are also paying more. So there is no cost \nsavings in this regard, in this program at least.\n  The other point, which is I think critical and I alluded to, is that \nfor the same services you receive in Medicare Advantage, there is, on \naverage, a 14-percent increase overall for those similar services in \ntraditional Medicare.\n  We have to, I think, take tough steps to eliminate these over-\npayments, but steps that will enhance the quality of care for seniors, \nand that is what is being done in this bill. While some of these \nresources are being used to help redesign a system for all Americans, \nthere will also be significant improvements for seniors, for care that \nis more effective and efficient, and less costly.\n  Let me suggest something else. We are all paying right now for the \ncost of uninsured Americans. It has been estimated that every private \ninsurance plan in this country is paying--every individual payer, \nbusinesses or individual--about $1,000 a year for uncompensated care. \nThat is the cost hospitals shift from their uncompensated care on to \nthe insurance providers, the carriers, and that is translated into \nhigher premiums for all Americans.\n  Under this legislation, the hospitals will now see patients \npresenting themselves with an insurance card. Mr. President, over 94 \npercent of Americans, it has been estimated, will be covered under our \nproposal. So instead of showing up for free care, they will be under an \ninsurance plan. The hospitals will benefit. Medicare, Medicaid, and the \nwhole health care system will benefit.\n  Again, this is one of the changes that would be reversed by the \nMcCain motion.\n  Also, we have taken steps so that hospitals will be much more \neffective in managing their patient flow. Readmissions will hopefully \nbe reduced by some of the provisions in this legislation.\n  There are many things we should do and will do, but I believe we can \nsuccessfully balance expanding our coverage system, protecting quality \nof care, but also recognizing, as has been suggested, the fiscal \nimplications not just for the moment but going forward. I suggest if \nsomeone is serious about entitlement control, serious about the fiscal \nimplications of this legislation or any other legislation, they will \nnot simply order the committee to restore these cuts. They would do \nsomething much more proactive and, indeed, support what I believe are \nsensible, sound proposals to provide quality, to ensure that over the \nlong run, Medicare is more solvent.\n  In fact--the final point--the legislation before us would extend the \nlife of Medicare, the solvency of Medicare over at least 5 years. So \nfor those people who say we are trying to end Medicare, their solution \nis simply to let it go bankrupt apparently in 2017 or to simply ignore \nit and let it find its own fate.\n  We can do better. I urge rejection of the McCain motion. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nWyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor also to talk about \nMedicare and what I see to be significant cuts in the Medicare Program. \nI practiced medicine in Wyoming for 25 years, taking care of families \nfrom across the State and many of these wonderful folks who are on \nMedicare. They depend on Medicare for their health care. They depend on \nMedicare. Patients depend on it, the hospitals depend upon it, the \nphysicians, the nursing homes, the home health care agencies--all of \nthem depend on Medicare for their health care.\n  I listened to my close friends from across the aisle come to the \nfloor as well, and they seem to be trying to convince the American \npublic that the 2,074-page bill which weighs over 20 pounds actually \ndoes not cut Medicare. I heard the chairman of the Finance Committee \ntalk about it on the floor; I have heard it from the majority leader.\n\n  The health care reform plan we are looking at on this floor cuts $464 \nbillion from Medicare, and I have a list of all the Medicare cuts in \nthis bill, page after page, column after column. When you add them all \nup, it cuts $135 billion from our hospitals--from our hospitals--that \nare providing the care. We have heard about some of the cost shifting \nfrom the Senator from Rhode Island. Cost shifting occurs. Medicare is \none of the biggest deadbeats when it comes to paying for hospital \nservices, and it is why hospitals end up shifting more costs to people \nwho have health insurance, and why, for those people, their premiums \nwill go up if this bill becomes law. So $135 billion cut from \nhospitals.\n  The bill cuts $120 billion from a program called Medicare Advantage. \nThere are 11 million Americans in this country who are on Medicare \nAdvantage. They know who they are. They know it is a program that has \nworked well for them. People ask me what the difference is. Why would \nsomebody want to be on a program called Medicare Advantage? Well, there \nis an advantage to those seniors who depend upon Medicare for their \nhealth care if they are on Medicare Advantage. The No. 1 advantage is, \nit actually helps coordinate care.\n\n[[Page S12281]]\n\n  We know one of the best ways to help people keep down the cost of \ntheir medical care is to find problems early and to get early \ntreatment. So find the problem and treat it before it gets too bad. \nWell, Medicare Advantage does both preventive care as well as \ncoordinated care. One of the big problems with Medicare is, it will pay \na lot for doing something to someone, but it will not pay much for \nhelping someone stay healthy. But now all of a sudden we are going to \ncut $120 billion from Medicare Advantage, which actually works on \nprevention and on coordinated care.\n  Then there is $42 billion from home health care agencies that will be \ncut. Those are the folks who come into someone's home and help them \nstay out of the hospital. The advantage of home health care is to allow \npeople to get care at home and not need to be in the hospital, but \nsuddenly we are looking at $42 billion in cuts on Medicare for home \nhealth care agencies.\n  Then let's take a look at nursing homes: $15 billion in cuts for \nnursing homes--those facilities taking care of people on Medicare--\nwhich, to me, means they are actually cutting it from the people who \ndepend on Medicare for their nursing home needs.\n  As an orthopedic surgeon, I have taken care of many people, such as a \ngrandmother who breaks her hip. She doesn't need to go into a nursing \nhome permanently, but what she needs to do is to go there for a short \nperiod of time for rehabilitation, where she can get better and get \nstronger. She is not ready to go home, and she does not need to stay in \na hospital, but she needs to be in a nursing home for a period of time \nto get rehabilitated and then to get ready to go home and go back to an \nindependent life. There is a gap in time, and nursing homes help with \nthat. They are wonderful as a way to give somebody an opportunity to \ngain their strength. In our country, such as it is now, so many \ngrandparents are living in communities where, perhaps, their children \nor grandchildren are no longer living or they can't go and live with a \nson or daughter, but they need additional help and so they go to a \nnursing home.\n  So for that patient who has broken a hip--the type of patient I have \ntaken care of in the hospital--this bill is going to end up cutting \nfrom the hospital $135 billion from Medicare for that patient. It will \nend up cutting nursing homes by $15 billion, for patients who rely on \nnursing homes as they recover from their hip surgery. Then once they \nget home and get ready for an independent life, a lot of times they can \nbenefit from home health care--someone coming into the home and \nchecking on them, giving them medications, making sure they are doing \nall right, checking their wound, and a number of different things--this \nbill will cut $42 billion from home health care agencies; again, \ncutting the services to people who depend upon those services for their \nhealth care needs.\n  Then there is an $8 billion cut from hospice providers, people who \ntake care of our patients--my patients--in the final stages of their \nlife. At a time in their life when their body may be riddled with \ncancer or they just need a place to go and be treated with respect and \nto be cared for, we are cutting $8 billion in this bill from the \nhospice providers--people who are there and helping people in the final \nstages of their life.\n  When I look at this, I say: How in the world can my colleagues on the \nother side say they are not cutting Medicare for our seniors? I read \nthrough the bill and there is $135 billion from hospitals, $120 billion \nfrom Medicare Advantage, $40 billion from home health care agencies, \nalmost $15 billion from nursing homes, and $8 billion from hospice \nproviders, for a total of $464 billion for this country's seniors. I \ndon't think we should pass this bill. Of course, there is another $500 \nbillion in taxes. It is a huge and hugely expensive bill.\n  To me, this is absolutely nothing but robbing our folks who are on \nMedicare to start a whole new government program. I am worried seniors \nall around the country are going to have less access to doctors, \nespecially in rural and in frontier States, such as Wyoming. I am \nconcerned they are going to see community hospitals and home health \ncare agencies and nursing homes--skilled nursing facilities--struggling \nto keep their doors open.\n  It is time for this Congress, for this Senate to listen to America's \nseniors. Let's listen to the administration's own chief actuary. \nRichard Foster, the chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, said if these Medicare cuts take effect, then many \nproviders ``could find it difficult to remain profitable and might end \ntheir participation in the program.'' They may say: I don't want \nanything else to do with Medicare. I am closing my doors to Medicare \npatients.\n  We cannot have that in this country, but I believe that is what this \nbill does. Even the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said these \nMedicare cuts could ``reduce access to care or diminish the quality of \ncare.'' Is that what this Senate wants, to reduce access to care or \ndiminish the quality of care?\n  How many experts does it take to convince the majority party that \ncutting Medicare to pay for a brandnew government program is \nirresponsible? We all agree Medicare is going broke. The trust fund \nwill run out of money in the year 2017. It has more than $37 trillion \nin unfunded liabilities. The Presiding Officer knows that in his State, \nas well as in mine, Medicare's physician payment formula, which calls \nfor doctors to face a more than 40-percent cut over the next 10 years, \nis a system that is broken. The Reid bill does nothing to fix this \nproblem. Instead, it takes $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare to create a \nbrandnew entitlement program. It punishes a group of people in order to \nbenefit another. To me, that is not reform. It will only make the \nsystem worse.\n  That is why I support the motion we will be voting on today, the \nMcCain motion. It says we are not going to finance a new government \nprogram on the backs of our Medicare patients, on the people who depend \nupon Medicare for their health care. It instructs the Finance Committee \nto write a bill that doesn't cut hospitals, that doesn't cut home \nhealth care, that doesn't cut Medicare Advantage, and that doesn't cut \nhospice for our seniors who depend upon those services. A vote for the \nMcCain motion gives us a chance to get this right.\n  I do want health care reform. I just don't want this bill. This is \nthe wrong prescription for our country. I don't believe we have to take \nthe money out of Medicare and then spend it on a brandnew entitlement \nprogram. I go home to Wyoming every weekend--and I know other Members \ngo home and listen to their constituents--and what I hear from the \npeople in Wyoming is: Don't cut my Medicare. Don't raise my taxes. \nDon't make things worse for me in this economy. I certainly can't \nafford it. The people of Wyoming want practical, commonsense health \ncare reform; reform that drives down the cost of medical care, improves \naccess to providers and creates more choices.\n  It is clear this bill has a very different plan in mind. It is not \ntoo late to work together for meaningful reform. We do not have to \ndismantle the current health care system and build it up in the image \nof big government and then try to say this is reform. The American \npeople are telling us what kind of changes they want, and that is why I \nwill be voting for the McCain motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Wyoming would \nbe available to answer a question.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I will, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am thankful to my good friend and neighbor to my State.\n  Is it true the CBO letters say the Senate bill will extend the life--\nextend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund? Is that true?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I don't have that letter with me, but everything I look \nat says this will gut Medicare, make it go broke sooner, and it will be \nbad for seniors.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't have the letter in front of me, but in all \ndeference and respect to my good friend from Wyoming, the CBO says the \nexact opposite. It is the conclusion of the Congressional Budget Office \nthat this legislation will help seniors by extending the solvency of \nthe Medicare trust fund by, I guess, 4 to 5 years. That is black and \nwhite. If I had the letter in front of me, I could read it to him, but \nthat is a\n\n[[Page S12282]]\n\nfact. This legislation will extend the solvency of the Medicare trust \nfund by another 5 years.\n  So instead of being insolvent in the year 2017, under this \nlegislation, that is extended to the year 2022. That is a fact. At \nleast the fact is that is what CBO concludes in their letter. That is a \nfact.\n  Second, as a caring physician, does the Senator think that we as a \ncountry should try to find a way to provide health insurance for so \nmany Americans--some of them lower income--who don't have health \ninsurance in our country? Because, after all, we are the only \nindustrialized country in the world that doesn't find a way to make \nsure its citizens have health insurance.\n  As a physician who sees patients, many of whom can't pay their bills \nand defer medical treatment because they do not have health insurance, \nI am wondering if the Senator believes this country should try to find \na way where its citizens have health insurance.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The Senator absolutely believes we need to find a way \nto make sure all the citizens of this country have insurance, and there \nare ways to do it: allowing people to buy insurance across State lines. \nThat doesn't take a 2,000-page bill. There are ways to do it to help \nget down the cost of care that give individuals incentives to buy their \nown insurance, giving tax breaks to those individuals. We could do \nthings with tort reform, such as the loser pays rule. We could allow \nsmall groups to join together to have a better ability to bargain and \nget the cost of insurance down.\n  So this Senator absolutely believes we need to find a way to get \neveryone insured. There are people who need help who don't have help, \nand we need to find a way to do that, but it is not this 2,000-page \nbill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will ask this question, and then I will finish because \nI know my colleagues want to speak.\n  One of the basic underpinnings of this legislation is that we should \nchange the way we reimburse providers, moving away from quantity and \nvolume and more toward quality. I am curious--and this is not an \nantagonistic question. I am just trying to get a physician's point of \nview because so many doctors I talk to think that although it creates a \nlittle uncertainty, probably that is the right thing to do--to move our \nreimbursing based on quality, coordinated care, and focusing on the \npatient rather than our current system, which reimburses more on \nquantity and the number of services provided, et cetera.\n  Is that something the Senator thinks we should pursue in this \ncountry?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The current system is broken, Mr. President. The \nreimbursement system focuses more on doing things than on helping \npatients stay healthy and get better. Medicare has done a terrible job \nof that over the years, in terms of giving incentives for people or \neven for paying for preventive services. They have not done that over \nthe years.\n  This is an illustration of how the system is broken. It is now \nDecember--the end of the year--and it is the busiest time of year for \nme as a physician in Wyoming because people have met their \ndeductibles--those who have insurance have met their deductibles for \nthe year--and they come into the office and say: Is it now time for my \noperation? I have to get it done before the 1st of the year because my \ndeductible has been used up, and I want to have my operation so I am \nnot going to have to pay for it.\n  In this country, we have the incentives all wrong in terms of health \ncare. We do need health care reform.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I don't think this bill is the way to do it, which is a \ngovernment takeover of the health care system.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have to address that one. My colleagues \nwant to speak, but I think it is worth repeating over and over again: \nThis legislation is designed to retain the uniquely American solution \nto health care--roughly half public, half private. It is designed to \nmake sure patients can still, as they should, choose their own doctor, \nany doctor they want--primary care doc, specialist, no gatekeepers and \nall that stuff. The doctors are totally free and should be free to make \ntheir own decisions, after consultation with their patients, as to what \nprocedure makes sense or doesn't make sense.\n  In addition to that, frankly, more competition with the exchanges. \nThis legislation, frankly, is rooted almost entirely on maintaining the \ncurrent free market system in health care. There is some insurance \nmarket reform, which I think everybody agrees with, which is denying \npreexisting conditions as a basis for denying coverage, and there is a \nmodest expansion of Medicaid for lower income people who just can't get \nhealth care, but otherwise this is legislation which is rooted in the \ncurrent American system.\n  We have a good system. It works. This is just designed to make it \nwork a little better by making sure it reimburses, as the Senator from \nWyoming wants, based more on quality. He didn't mention this, but I \nknow he agrees, also insurance market reform so those patients who come \nto him don't have to wait until the end of the year in the future as \nthey have in the past.\n  But I want to get it very clear, this is no ``government takeover.'' \nThat is a scare tactic. It is not accurate. It is basically maintaining \nour current system.\n  I would now like to yield 10 minutes to my good friend from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I am going to speak on something other than health care. \nI thank my friend from Montana for yielding.\n\n\n                Confirmation of Federal Reserve Chairman\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, what I want to touch upon is my strong \nbelief that Ben Bernanke should not be reappointed for a second term as \nChairman of the Federal Reserve. In that regard, I placed a hold on his \nnomination.\n  Everyone in this country understands we are in the midst of the worst \neconomic crisis since the Great Depression. We are looking at 17 \npercent of our people being either unemployed or underemployed. We are \nlooking at average length of unemployment being longer than it has been \nsince World War II. We are looking at a situation where, over the last \n8 or 9 years, median household income has declined by over $2,000. We \nare looking at a situation where, according to USA Today, September 18, \n2009:\n\n       The incomes of the young and middle aged, especially men, \n     have fallen off a cliff since 2000, leaving many age groups \n     poorer than they were even in the 1970's.\n\n  What we are seeing is a long-term trend resulting in the collapse of \nthe middle class, an increase in poverty, a growing gap between the \nrich and everybody else. Then, to make a very bad situation worse, as a \nresult of the greed, irresponsibility, and illegal behavior of Wall \nStreet, we are now in a terrible economic decline.\n  The American people voted overwhelmingly last year for a change in \nour national policies and for a new direction in the economy. After 8 \nlong years of trickle-down economics that benefited the very wealthy at \nthe expense of the middle class and working families, the people of our \ncountry demanded a change that would put the interests of ordinary \npeople ahead of the greed of Wall Street and the wealthy few. What the \nAmerican people did not bargain for was another 4 years for one of the \nkey architects of the Bush economy, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben \nBernanke.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve--and the Federal Reserve itself--\nhas four main responsibilities. I want the American people to determine \nwhether they believe the Fed has, in fact, succeeded in fulfilling \nthese obligations. Here they are, four main responsibilities:\n  No. 1, to conduct monetary policy in a way that leads to maximum \nemployment and stable prices. Maximum employment? When you have 17 \npercent of your people unemployed or underemployed, I do not think the \nFed or all of us, any of us, have succeeded in that area.\n  No. 2, to maintain the safety and soundness of financial \ninstitutions. Obviously, that has not been the case either.\n  No. 3, to contain systemic risk in financial markets.\n  No. 4, to protect consumers against deceptive and unfair financial \nproducts.\n  Not since the Great Depression has the financial system been as \nunsafe,\n\n[[Page S12283]]\n\nunsound, and unstable as it has been during Mr. Bernanke's tenure. More \nthan 120 banks have failed since he has been Chairman, and the list of \ntroubled banks has grown from 50 to over 416.\n  Mr. Bernanke has failed to prevent banks from issuing deceptive and \nunfair financial products to consumers. Under his leadership, mortgage \nlenders were allowed to issue predatory loans that they knew consumers \nwould be unable to repay. This risky practice was allowed to continue \nlong after the FBI warned, in 2004, of an epidemic in mortgage fraud.\n  Here is what the bottom line is. The bottom line is that the key \nresponsibility of the Fed is to maintain the safety and soundness of \nour financial institutions, and they failed. They failed. As a result \nof the greed and speculation on Wall Street--which the Fed should have \nbeen observing, which the Fed should have acted against, which the Fed \nshould have warned the American people and the Congress about--they did \nnothing and our financial system went over the edge.\n  Then, after not doing their jobs as a watchdog, not fulfilling their \nobligation to protect the safety and soundness of our financial system, \nthe financial collapse occurred, and what happened? What the Fed did is \nprovide not only--not only did Congress put $700-plus billion into the \nbailout, the Fed provided several trillion dollars of zero-interest \nloans to large financial institutions. When I asked Chairman Bernanke \nwhich financial institutions received these zero-interest loans, the \nanswer was: I am not going to tell you. Not going to tell you.\n  The reason Congress, against my vote, bailed out Wall Street is they \nwere too big to fail. Large financial institutions were too big to \nfail. Since the collapse, three out of the four largest financial \ninstitutions have become even larger. So the systemic danger for our \neconomy is even greater today than it was before the bailout.\n  The American people want a new Wall Street. They want a Wall Street \nwhich begins to respond to the needs of small business, so we can begin \nto create jobs, not just to Wall Street's outrageous executive \ncompensation.\n  Let me suggest some of the things I think a Fed Chairman should be \ndoing, things Mr. Bernanke is not.\n  No. 1, today, bailed out financial institutions are charging \nconsumers 25 or 30 percent interest rates on their credit cards. The \nFed has the power to stop that, to put a cap on interest rates. That is \nwhat they should be doing.\n  The Fed has the power to demand that bailed-out institutions provide \nloans at low interest rates to small and medium-sized businesses so we \ncan begin to create the kinds of jobs that are desperately needed in \nthis country. That is not what Mr. Bernanke has done.\n  The Fed has the power now to do what is taking place in the United \nKingdom, something that many economists are demanding, and that is to \nstart breaking up these large financial institutions which are too big \nto fail. In my view, if an institution is too big to fail, it is too \nbig to exist. We have to start breaking them up, not allow them to get \neven larger. The Fed has chosen not to do that.\n  We need transparency at the Fed. I am the author of a GAO audit of \nthe Fed, which now has 30 cosponsors, which I hope we will pass. But at \nthe very least, if the taxpayers of this country are putting at risk \ntrillions of dollars being lent out to large financial institutions, we \nhave a right to know which institutions are receiving that money and \nunder what terms.\n  Let me conclude by saying this: This country is in the midst of a \nhorrendous economic crisis. Millions of families all over this country \nare at their wit's end. They are suffering. They are trying to figure \nout how they are going to keep warm this winter, how they are going to \npay their bills. The time is now for a new Fed, for a new direction on \nWall Street, for a Wall Street which is helping our productive economy \ncreate decent-paying jobs, not a Wall Street based on greed, only for \nthemselves, whose goal in life is to make as much money as possible for \ntheir CEOs.\n  We need a new Fed, we need a new Wall Street, and we surely need a \nnew Chairman of the Fed. My hope is that President Obama will give us a \nnew nominee and not Mr. Bernanke.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask how much time is remaining on each \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the majority side, 9 minutes 20 seconds; on \nthe minority side, 23 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 9 minutes--how many seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Now 9 minutes 11 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 9 minutes 11 seconds to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am deeply saddened that my Republican colleagues have, \nnow we see very clearly, resorted to fear tactics in their desperate \nattempt to preserve a dysfunctional, costly, status quo medical system \nthat we have in this country today. Republicans, in their attempt to \nstrike fear in seniors across the country, are trying to convince the \npeople that they have changed from the party that has always opposed \nMedicare to now being Medicare's staunchest defenders. But we all know, \nif it were up to our friends on the other side of the aisle, there \nwould be no Medicare. They fought its very creation. Don't take my word \nfor it, take one of their standard-bearers who ran for President. \nSenator Bob Dole, who was here when we created Medicare, Senator Dole, \na friend of mine--I have a good deal of admiration for Senator Dole--\nsaid, ``I was there, fighting the fight, voting against Medicare--one \nof twelve--because we knew it wouldn't work in 1965.'' He said that in \n1995 when he was running for President. He was proud of the fact that \nhe and Republicans had opposed the establishment of the Medicare \nsystem.\n  You might say: That was then, what about recently? Here is the former \nSpeaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. He said, ``We believe it's going \nto wither on the vine,'' speaking of Medicare.\n  Now my friends on the other side of the aisle--listening to them, you \nwould think they were the biggest supporters of Medicare forever, when \nthey opposed it from its very beginning.\n  Now we hear all the stuff about Medicare Advantage. If, in fact, we \nare going to be cutting a little bit out of Medicare Advantage, they \nwould like to tell you that somehow this is going to ruin Medicare. If \nthat were true, why would the National Committee to Preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare, AARP, the alliance for retired Americans, groups \nthat represent tens of millions of seniors--why would they stand with \nus in support of our bill and not with the Republicans, who want to gut \nthe very provisions we have in there that will strengthen and preserve \nMedicare?\n  Do people really believe our Republican colleagues care more about \nseniors than these groups that actually represent seniors?\n  The truth is, when we talk about Medicare Advantage, we are talking \nabout private insurance companies who promised that through competition \nthey were going to deliver better quality health care to seniors at a \nlower cost. It all sounded good. But what has happened since Medicare \nAdvantage has come in? The reality is, Medicare is now paying on \naverage 14 percent more to these private plans than it would cost to \ncover the same beneficiaries under traditional Medicare. In some cases, \nit is as high as 50 percent more. That is $12 billion a year more than \nif these beneficiaries stayed in Medicare. Basically, we are giving a \n$12 billion subsidy to these companies.\n  Again, don't take my word for it. This is from a June 2009 MedPAC \nreport:\n\n       We estimate that in 2009, Medicare paid about $12 billion \n     more for enrollees of [Medicare Advantage] plans than it \n     would if they were in [fee-for-service] Medicare.\n\n  A $12 billion slush fund. We are saying we are going to reduce some \nof those subsidies. I hear my friends on the other side: My gosh, \nMedicare is going to take away all these benefits, and all that other \nkind of stuff. Not necessarily. Right now we know, according to CBO, \nour bill will lower seniors' Medicare premiums by $30 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  Then the other side says: But if you cut these Medicare Advantage \npayments, you will see their benefits cut.\n\n[[Page S12284]]\n\n  That is absolutely not true. All Medicare plans, whether traditional \nMedicare or private, must offer all required Medicare benefits. Here is \nthe kicker. If, in fact, there are some cuts made in Medicare \nAdvantage, then these private companies that are making $12 billion in \ntheir slush fund, maybe rather than cutting benefits, maybe they will \ndecide to cut their CEO salaries from $12 million a year to $10 million \na year. Maybe they will decide instead of three or four corporate jets, \nthey only need one. Maybe they will start reducing some of the profits \nthey are making, huge profits they are making off of the taxpayers and \noff of Medicare payees right now.\n  Again, if we cut the Medicare Advantage Program, I guess my friends \non the other side would say, No. 1, they can continue to pay their CEOs \n$12 million a year salaries. They can continue the corporate jets. They \ncan continue to have fancy buildings. They can continue to have \noutrageous profits. But they will have to cut Medicare. That is what \nthe other side is saying.\n  We are saying: No, cut the CEO salaries. Cut the enormous profits. \nCut those corporate jets. Cut all of that stuff you are using the slush \nfund for, but keep the benefits for Medicare.\n  As I said, under present law they cannot cut the basic Medicare \nbenefits. No senior anywhere in America will lose their core Medicare \nbenefits under our bill. Let's be clear about that. If they did, AARP, \nthe National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and \nthe National Alliance for Retired Americans would never be supporting \nour bill.\n  Lastly, according to an economic survey done at Boston University, \nthey extensively analyzed Medicare Advantage payments and found that \njust 14 percent of the additional funds these private plans have \nreceived have gone to benefit Medicare enrollees. The vast majority of \nthe payments, 86 percent, go to profits, CEO salaries, corporate jets, \nall these other things, or some of it may go to things such as gym \nmemberships, spa memberships. I raised the point the other day. Why \nshould my Medicare beneficiaries in Iowa have to pay more in Medicare \nso that a Medicare beneficiary, say, in Arizona can go to a spa and \nhave it paid for by Medicare Advantage, paid for by the subsidies of \n$12 billion that we give them that come both from taxpayers and from \nMedicare recipients right now? I don't think it is fair for my seniors \nin Iowa to have to pay for that.\n  A lot has been said about all the people who are in the Medicare \nAdvantage plans. I looked up the figures. Right now, nationally, only \n18.6 percent of all enrollees are in Medicare Advantage, a little less \nthan one out of five. In my State, in Iowa, it is 10 percent, 1 out of \nevery 10. Why is that? We don't have a lot of spas in Iowa. We don't \nhave those fancy things like they have in Florida and Texas and Arizona \nand California, wherever else all this stuff is going. What my seniors \nneed is the peace of mind of knowing that Medicare is going to be there \nfor them in the future. They need to know they are going to get the \nbenefits we have put in this plan that are in our bill and that will \nhelp Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Here is what they are. AARP says:\n\n       The new Senate bill makes improvements in the Medicare \n     program by creating a new annual wellness benefit, providing \n     preventive benefits and, most notably for AARP members, \n     reducing drug costs for seniors who fall into the dreaded \n     Medicare doughnut hole.\n       The bill also makes improvements on age rating, a \n     discriminatory practice that allows insurers to charge \n     exorbitant age-based premiums to older Americans.\n       Finally, AARP strongly supports provisions in the Senate \n     bill to strengthen long-term services and supports. We also \n     applaud inclusion of provisions to improve access to Medicaid \n     home and community-based services.\n\n  All is in our bill, all of which would fall if we adopt the McCain \namendment. I urge colleagues not to listen to the rhetoric from the \nother side. Listen to those who really do represent seniors. Make sure \nwe preserve and protect the basic Medicare functions for seniors and \nfor those who are about to retire. You will not get that through \nMedicare Advantage. If Medicare Advantage wants to exist and compete on \na level playing field, God bless them. Go ahead and get it done. That \nis what we were promised when Medicare Advantage came through here. I \nremember. Competition. But what we found is, we had to cough up an \nadditional $12 billion to subsidize them.\n  It is time for us again to say no to the fearmongers, to those who \nare trying to strike fear in seniors. It is time to stand up, support \nthe Bennet amendment, which makes very clear that any savings that come \nfrom Medicare has to go back into Medicare. That is the way it ought to \nbe. That is what is in this bill. The Bennet amendment makes that \ncrystal clear. The McCain motion does away, basically, with all of the \nprotections, all of the things we have worked so hard for since 1965 to \nprovide. The McCain motion, when you strip away all the verbiage, \nreally what it does is, it basically takes us back to pre-1965 when we \ndidn't even have Medicare. That is the kind of intent behind it.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator for his incredible leadership on this \nissue and the public option, affordability, and on prevention and \nwellness.\n  I have listened to the debate with Senator McCain and others on \nMedicare. It seems what they are protecting is not Medicare but the \nhuge insurance company subsidies when President Bush moved to privatize \nMedicare. It used to be the insurance companies told us they could do \ntheir part of Medicare, one-fifth, one-sixth of Medicare; that they \ncould do it more efficiently even though insurance companies have a 15-\n, 20-percent administrative cost overhead and Medicare's is 3 or 4 \npercent or 2 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds the Senator, the majority \ntime has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Much of what they are trying to protect is insurance \ncompany subsidies, not Medicare benefits which their party has opposed \nfor much of the last 40 years, including its creation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I said earlier, what they are talking about in \npreserving these benefits and this subsidy for Medicare Advantage is \nthe big CEO compensation packages, the corporate jets, the fancy \nbuildings, the high profits, somewhere between 30 percent and 200 \npercent profits made by these companies that are providing Medicare \nAdvantage. That is what the Republicans are trying to protect, not the \nMedicare recipients.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened with some interest to the \ncomments made when I came on the Senate floor. I simply want to make \nthis one observation about Medicare Advantage. President Obama promised \nthat Americans who have coverage they like would not lose the coverage \nthey have. There are a number of Americans who have Medicare Advantage. \nThey like it, and they want to keep it. This Congress is about to say: \nNo, you can't. This Congress, through this bill, if it passes, is going \nto eliminate Medicare Advantage. Frankly, the people who go after \nMedicare Advantage because they like it are going to be the ones who \nare disadvantaged. They are going to be the ones who will see President \nObama's pledge violated.\n  Frankly, I don't think they much care about how much an executive is \npaid or what happens in the company. They care that they have coverage \nthey like, coverage they are paying for, coverage they have chosen, and \nthey are being told by the Federal Government they cannot have what \nthey want.\n  There is another aspect to this that I would like to explore in the \ntime I have. We keep hearing so much about the CBO and all of the \nscores the CBO is pointing out along with rhetoric that says we can't \nafford to wait, we need a solution now, the status quo is unacceptable. \nI would like to point out that the status will remain quo for 4 years \nif this bill passes. In the budget smoke and mirrors that have been put \ninto this bill in order to make it look as if it costs less money, they \nmake the effective date in 2014, so there will be 4 years after the \npassage of this bill where Americans will not see any kind of change in \ntheir plans. What they\n\n[[Page S12285]]\n\nwill see is an increase in their premiums. They will see an increase in \ntaxes.\n  Why do I say that? Between January of 2010 and January of 2014 there \nwill be four open seasons in which plans can be changed. As the taxes \nstart to hit, as the costs start to hit, those companies that are \ninvolved in offering these plans will say: OK, we have to get ready for \nthe expenditures. What do we do? We have four open seasons in which to \nchange our plans before this thing hits.\n  Obviously, that cannot be scored by CBO because CBO does not know \nwhat changes will be made. But do we really think we can go through \nfour open seasons with no change whatsoever in the face of this \nenormous change that will hit in January of 2014? Do we really think \neverything is going to remain static? That is what the CBO computers \nare. Do we really think the $500 billion they want to take out of \nMedicare to help pay for this will not be hashed over again and again?\n  One of two things will happen. No. 1, the Democrats will blink in the \nface of the anger of senior citizens and say: We really didn't mean it. \nYes, the bill cuts Medicare by $500 billion, but we really didn't mean \nit. We have 4 years in which to fix it; that is, 4 years in which to \nreplace that $500 billion. Of course, when that $500 billion is \nreplaced, if that is the way they decide to go, then we will know that \nthe numbers we are getting out of CBO are completely phony. Then we \nwill know the statement that this bill is revenue neutral is a \nnonstarter. Then we will know there was never any intention to try to \ndeal with this cost.\n  Suppose future Congresses stand firm and say: Yes, we are going to \nstand firm in this 4-year period. We are going to stand firm against \nthe anger of senior citizens who are seeing their Medicare benefits get \ncut. We are going to take the $500 billion out of Medicare. Then we \nwill see the promises that are being made around here--that there will \nbe no cut in Medicare services--all disappear.\n\n  I hear people say: We are not cutting benefits. We are just cutting \npayments to providers. That statement is being made over and over again \non the other side of the aisle: We are not cutting benefits. We are \ngoing to take that $500 billion away from the providers, but the \nbenefits will remain the same.\n  In my State, I have plenty of providers that are on the edge, right \nnow, financially. They are on the edge of going out of business, right \nnow, financially because of the cuts that have been made in Medicare in \nthe name of cutting down payments to providers.\n  What happens to the people who are in a nursing home that is \ncurrently dependent upon Medicare payments in order to survive if they \ncome in and say: All right, we are not going to do anything to the \nbenefits these people are entitled to in this nursing home, we are just \ngoing to cut enough payments to the nursing home that the nursing home \ngoes out of business. What happens to the people who are in the nursing \nhome under that circumstance? Well, they are going to have to go \nsomeplace else and there is going to have to be money to pay for them \nto go someplace else and the money is going to have to flow through \nMedicare someplace else and then we are back to the first option I \ntalked about, which is we were not serious when we said we were going \nto take $500 billion out of Medicare. We were not serious. In order to \nmake sure you do not lose your benefits, we are going to have to start \nreinvesting in some of these providers. We have seen providers go out \nof business because of the cuts into Medicare. We need to start putting \nthat money back into Medicare. Then we are back into the circumstance \nwe have been talking about all along: This thing is not paid for.\n  One final point I wish to make: We had a hearing today with the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve. Ben Bernanke is up for reappointment \nand, of course, the entire conversation was about the economy and what \nis the future of the economy. There were a number of people who had a \nconversation about the past, but I wished to focus on the future.\n  I pointed this out to the Chairman and asked for his comments with \nrespect to the future of our economy. Most of my constituents do not \nunderstand what I am about to say. Frankly, most of the people in the \npress do not understand it, and maybe even some Members of this body do \nnot understand it. When we talk about the Federal budget, two-thirds of \nthe Federal budget is beyond the control of this Congress. Two-thirds \nof the Federal budget is on autopilot, unless this Congress changes \nentitlements.\n  Somebody says: Well, what does this word ``entitlement'' mean? Why do \nyou talk about entitlements? Entitlement means, by law, these \nindividuals are entitled to this money, whether we have it or not. The \nFederal Government has made a contract with them. All right, it is a \nsocial contract rather than a legal contract, but it is as binding \npolitically where the Federal Government has to spend the money, \nwhether it has it or not.\n  Indeed, that is what we have seen in fiscal year 2010. The budget we \npassed said revenues are going to be $2.2 trillion and entitlement \nspending is going to be $2.2 trillion, which means every function of \nthe government--our Embassies overseas; our troops, wherever they may \nbe; education; national parks; whatever it is--every dime will have to \nbe borrowed in fiscal year 2010, every single dime because every penny \ncoming into the Federal Government is already programmed to go out, \nwithout coming through the Congress. It does not go through the \nappropriations process. We do not get to vote on it. People are \nentitled to receive this money, and it is going to go out there.\n  What are we talking about? We are talking about creating a new \nentitlement, a very expensive new entitlement. How are we going to pay \nfor it? According to this bill, we are going to pay for it by \ntransferring money from an existing entitlement. Anyone who thinks that \nis what is going to happen, in the face of the anger that is being \ngenerated by people who read about this, believes a fairytale.\n  The whole notion of trying to balance the cost of this tremendous new \nentitlement by somehow a bookkeeping entry that says we will take it \nout of the Medicare account and we will put it in this account, and the \ncomputers that do not think--the computers simply compute--will say: \nWell, then, if you put it in this account, then this account is revenue \nneutral. But the government's account is not revenue neutral. This \nthing is going to cost $500 billion, wherever we get the money. It is a \ncynical ploy, smoke and mirrors of the worst kind, in a budgetary bait \nand switch, to say we are going to take this out of Medicare.\n  I hear from my constituents--I hear from people who are not my \nconstituents who recognize me as a Senator in airports and other \nplaces--as they say, increasingly: Do not pass this bill. We see it in \nthe polls, but we see it in the passion of the people who come up to us \nand let us know how firmly they are opposed to this bill. The American \npeople do not want it, and the American people are right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to also make a statement \nrelated to the amendment that is being presented by the Senator from \nColorado. Speaking for several Members on my side--hopefully, for all \nthe Members on my side--we are very concerned, as I think we have all \nmade clear by now, that the Medicare savings in this bill are being \nused not for preserving Medicare but, instead, are being used to \nfinance the creation of a new Federal entitlement program.\n  My understanding of the purpose of the amendment of the Senator from \nColorado is to indicate that Medicare savings will be used for \nextending the solvency of Medicare and the trust fund, reducing \nMedicare premiums and other cost sharing for beneficiaries, and to \nimprove or expand Medicare benefits and access to providers.\n  Nobody can argue with that purpose the Senator has expressed or his \namendment expresses. But the concern on our side that we have with this \namendment is it does not require that the savings from Medicare would \nonly--with emphasis upon the word ``only''--be used for that purpose.\n  As the Congressional Budget Office has made clear, the cuts in \nMedicare in this bill are not being used solely for Medicare, as the \nSenator's amendment suggests, but, instead, are being used\n\n[[Page S12286]]\n\nmostly to fund the creation of an entirely new and separate subsidy \nprogram. For the Senator to accomplish what he intends to accomplish \nwould require entirely different language to ensure that savings from \nMedicare in this bill would only be used to protect Medicare benefits \nfor seniors, as the law now expresses.\n  The right approach would include language making sure seniors have \nthe same access as they have today, to home health services, skilled \nnursing facilities and services, hospice care, hospital services, \npreventive benefits, and the benefits provided in the Medicare \nAdvantage Program. So the Senate, it seems to me, should also ensure \nthat Medicare savings in this bill are not being siphoned off to \nfinance a new and separate entitlement program.\n  It is very clear to me--and I hope we are able to make it clear to \npeople, all 100 Senators--that the Bennet amendment, as written, does \nnot protect Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not think I have any time, but I ask \nunanimous consent that as to the time I do have after 2 o'clock, I can \ntake 2 minutes of that so I can ask a question of my good friend from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I might ask my friend from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, a question, if he is available for a question. I am taking \ntime.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will take a short minute to respond to \na question. But our side has 7--\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I understand. I do not want to cut into that time at all.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Could we discuss this maybe a little bit later, what \nyou brought up?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am taking it off my time, not your time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. OK.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Is it true the Congressional Budget Office said this \nbill, over 10 years, is not only deficit neutral but actually decreases \nthe budget deficit by about $130 billion? Is that true? Is that what \nthe Congressional Budget Office said?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is true. But I do not think the Senator wants to \ngo down that road because, do not forget, there are 6 years of \nprograms, of expenditures, and there is 10 years of revenue coming in. \nIf you want to play that game, you can pay down the entire national \ndebt.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Well, I do not know--to be totally fair and respectful to \none of my very best friends in the Senate--to cover that point, isn't \nit also true the Congressional Budget Office said in the second 10 \nyears this bill will reduce the budget by one-quarter percent of GDP? \nIsn't that also true, according to the Congressional Budget Office?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I cannot respond to that because I do not know that for \nsure. So I do not want to respond. But if you tell me, I tend to \nbelieve everything you tell me.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We trust each other. We both trust each other. That is \nwhat the letter says.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my colleagues \nand I--the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander; the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Coburn; Senator LeMieux from Florida; Senator Enzi; and \nSenator Crapo--be allowed to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 3 minutes 42 seconds; and \nthen, on top of that, at 2 o'clock, the Senator from Arizona controls \n17\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you. I will let those minutes run together, if \nthere is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to begin our conversation with a \nbrief comment about the American Association of Retired Persons, known \nas the AARP, that has now come out against this amendment, incredibly.\n  It is a fascinating history of that liberal Democratic group because, \nin 1993, when we had some savings in Medicare, the AARP said:\n\n       If we're talking about Medicare cuts alone as a way of \n     financing health reform, we would fight that with all our \n     strength--we've gone as far as we can go down that road.\n\n  The AARP, on $6.4 billion Medicare cuts in 2005, said: ``Strongly \nOpposes.'' They said the:\n\n       . . . conference agreement . . . undermines the critical \n     protections built into both the Medicaid and Medicare \n     programs. Instead of . . . shared sacrifice to achieve \n     budgetary savings. . . .\n\n  Every time there has ever been a savings in Medicare or Social \nSecurity in any way, shape, or form, the AARP has come out against it, \nexcept now when there is the most massive cut in Medicare in history \nand a transfer of those funds to a vast new $2.5 trillion entitlement \nprogram. It was described as $2.5 trillion just yesterday by the \nchairman of the Finance Committee.\n  I say shame on the AARP. I say to my friends, especially those who \nare under the Medicare Advantage Program, the 330,000 in my State, for \nwhom, admittedly, they are going to cut their Medicare Advantage \nbenefits, take your AARP card, cut it in half, and send it back. They \nhave betrayed you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the chart behind me shows the cuts in \nMedicare that are in this bill. We have heard all sorts of arguments. I \nhave a few rhetorical questions for my colleagues and my friend, the \nPresident of the United States.\n  There is no question Medicare Advantage costs too much. I have agreed \nto that with the chairman of the Finance Committee. But you cannot say \nthat coordinated care does not improve the care of seniors, and that is \ngoing to be cut. You cannot say that eyeglasses and hearing aids are \nnot going to be cut, and they do improve the care. You cannot say to \nseniors who cannot afford a supplemental policy, who have Medicare \nAdvantage, they are not going to lose some of their care. They are. In \nfact, 2.6 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office, are \ngoing to lose that very care--not some of it, all of it. They are going \nto lose that advantage under this legislation. The answer to the \nquestion, will this impact seniors care, is yes. We have heard these \ncuts aren't going to impact anybody or the only people they are going \nto impact are the insurance companies. Well, I am all for impacting the \ninsurance companies, but I don't want to impact patients negatively.\n\n  So we have cuts to Medicare, including hospitals, of $134.7 billion; \nhospices, $7.7 billion; nursing homes, $14.6 billion; Medicare \nAdvantage, $120 billion; home health agencies, $42.1 billion; and then \nyou say you are not going to do anything to impact the care of seniors. \nMy colleague from Iowa, whom I love, disputed my statement about the \nfact that the life expectancy is going to go down under this bill. He \nhas never practiced medicine a day in his life. I know what goes on \ninside hospitals. When you cut $130 billion out of the hospitals, the \ntime you are going to wait for me, the time you wait after you push \nyour call button is going to get extended and the complications from \nthat are going to result in decreased quality of care and shortened \nlife expectancies. There is no question about it.\n  So we can play the game, but the real thing Americans ought to know \nis almost $500 billion of spending on Medicare patients today is going \nto go by the wayside to be spent on a new entitlement, on a brandnew \nentitlement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. If the Senator from Oklahoma will respond to a question, \nhe is a physician, and he has very well pointed out how the cuts to \nMedicare Advantage will reduce benefits to senior citizens. The impacts \non the hospitals and home health care and the skilled nursing \nfacilities and so forth will be reduced services. I am aware of a June \n2008 report from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, \nwhich said 29 percent of Medicare beneficiaries they surveyed who were \nlooking for a primary care physician had trouble finding one who would \ntreat them. A similar survey in Texas showed that in that State, only\n\n[[Page S12287]]\n\n58 percent of the State's doctors would be willing to take a new \nMedicare patient, and only 38 percent of the primary care doctors \naccepted new patients.\n  So my question is, in addition to the reduction of benefits, in \naddition to the reduction of access to hospitals and skilled nursing \nfacilities and so forth, won't these cuts and the impact on Medicare \nalso represent a lack of ability by Medicare recipients to literally \nfind physician care?\n  Mr. COBURN. There is no question, to answer my colleague from Idaho, \nthat if it doesn't eliminate the ability, it will deny by delaying the \nability. Care delayed is care denied. All you have to do is read all of \nthe tragedies that have gone on in this country for people who have \ndelayed care which has resulted in large complications for that \nindividual.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to raise a point as the accountant \naround here. You have mentioned some ways to cut Medicare to pay for \nthis. Actually there are only two ways you can pay for a government \nprogram. You have to do it through cuts or through taxes. I don't think \nthere is anybody in America who believes you can do $1 trillion worth \nof new programs and have them all paid for, unless you steal somewhere. \nThat is what we are doing from Medicare. We say that is not going to \naffect Medicare. If you eliminate the DSH payments which are part of \nthis, it is going to put some Wyoming hospitals out of business. I can \nassure you that if those seniors can't go to a hospital in their town, \nthey are going to consider that a benefit cut. They are going to be \nupset, and they ought to be.\n  The same with nursing homes. If you cut back on nursing homes, the \npeople who have to move to another town for a nursing home--because all \nof our towns don't have more than one nursing home--puts quite a burden \nnot only on the patient who isn't going to get to see their family as \nmuch, but also on the family who has to travel a long way to see the \npatient. So I don't think we ought to be paying for the new programs by \ndoing this when Medicare needs an extended life.\n  I am always fascinated when they explain that this will extend the \nlife of Medicare because, yes, if you cut payments to everybody, that \nmaybe saves money and extends the life of it, if we did that. Is there \nanybody who thinks we are going to cut the doctors over the next 10 \nyears by $250 billion? No, we are not going to do that. We never have.\n  Mr. COBURN. Would the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. My one criticism of my colleagues in writing this bill is \nI think there is money we can save in Medicare. It is called waste, \nfraud, and abuse. A Harvard professor who studies this says there is at \nleast $125 billion a year in fraud. We have had several studies that \nsay it is anywhere from $100 billion to $175 billion a year. There is \nnothing in this bill to eliminate fraud. What we are doing is we are \ntaking care from seniors instead of taking the money from the \nfraudulent actors in the health care system.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if I may say to the Senator from \nArizona, I greatly appreciate his making this amendment, because there \nis so much said here on the Senate floor that must be hard for many \npeople to follow. But one thing I believe everybody agrees on is there \nare going to be $465 billion in cuts to Medicare over the next 10 \nyears, period. Everybody agrees with that. The President of the United \nStates has said we are going to pay for this new health care bill with \none-half from Medicare cuts and one-half from taxes. Everyone agrees \nwith that.\n  What Senator McCain's amendment is saying is two things--and Senator \nMcCain, let me see if I characterize properly your amendment, because \nit is a very simple amendment, as I read it. It is saying, send it back \nto the Finance Committee and say, bring the health care bill back \nwithout the Medicare cuts, without these cuts to hospitals, cuts to \nhospices, cuts to nursing homes, cuts to Medicare Advantage, and cuts \nto home health agencies.\n  Second, if we are going to take money from grandma's Medicare, let's \nspend it on grandma. Let's take the savings we find in Medicare and \nabsolutely make sure we spend it on Medicare, which the trustees have \nsaid is likely to go broke between 2015 and 2017.\n  Did I correctly characterize the Senator's amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. And does the Senator recall a few years ago when the \nRepublicans suggested saving $10 billion over 5 years in Medicare, the \nmajority leader said that was immoral, and that other Democratic \nSenators thought it was awful? If $10 billion in savings to try to make \nMedicare stronger is immoral, what is spending nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion \non a new program called?\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I wonder if I could ask a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I have a question for my colleague from Tennessee. I am \nnew here. This is all new to me. I thought the goal was to reduce \nhealth care costs while trying to provide health care for more \nAmericans. We are taking money out of health care for seniors to create \na new entitlement program. We are taking money out of nursing homes, \nhome health care, hospitals, and a program called Medicare Advantage \nthat people in my State I know enjoy very much. How does it make sense \nthat we are taking money out of Medicare to start a new health care \nprogram?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Well, if I may say--and then I think maybe others \ncould respond--if you are going to spend $2.5 trillion a year, you have \nto get the money from somewhere. What the Democratic health care bill \ndoes is get it three places. One is from seniors, one is from taxes, \nand one is from the grandchildren of seniors; that is, debt. It comes \nfrom those three places.\n  What we heard earlier this week was the Congressional Budget Office \nsaying the total effect of that $2.5 trillion is that for most \nAmericans, premiums would continue to go up as they already are, and \nthat for people who go into the individual market they will go up even \nmore--they will go up even more--except there will be some subsidies \nfor a little over half of those people, and where is the subsidy money \ncoming from? It is coming from Medicare. So that is the answer to the \nquestion.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. It would seem to me--and again, I am new to this \nprocess--that 100 Senators would vote for Senator McCain's proposal \nbecause everyone in this Chamber believes we should strengthen \nMedicare. Who could be for taking money out of Medicare if we don't \nneed to? These are two separate issues. Shouldn't every Senator in this \nChamber say let's send this back to the Finance Committee so those cuts \ncan be restored and we can start over and take a step-by-step approach? \nThat only seems fair to me.\n  Perhaps my colleague from Oklahoma could comment on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  We are in trouble in Medicare in this Nation. Everybody knows it. We \nhave made promises. The unfunded liability on Medicare is $79 trillion. \nFor us to take $\\1/2\\ trillion, no matter what the Enron accounting \nsays afterward, the fact is we are going to reduce that; we are going \nto make that worse. We may not make it worse next year or the year \nafter, but we are going to make it worse. It is going to be worse for \nseniors, but it is also, as the Senator from Tennessee said, going to \nbe extremely worse for the seniors' kids and grandkids. Not only have \nwe done that, we have raised the taxes in Medicare on a certain group \nof people and we are going to take that money and not put it in \nMedicare; we are going to take that money, a Medicare tax, and create a \nnew entitlement.\n  So the Senator from Florida is absolutely right. If you vote against \nthe McCain motion you are saying you want to cut $\\1/2\\ trillion out of \nMedicare and that it will have no effect whatsoever on the care.\n  I remind the Senator from Florida, there are 1 million people on \nMedicare Advantage in the State of Florida, 1 million people who are \ngoing to lose benefits under this bill. One million people in the State \nof Florida will lose benefits under this bill.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Oklahoma, \nwho is a physician himself, if one of the\n\n[[Page S12288]]\n\neffects of cuts in Medicare is to make it more difficult for people who \nare on Medicare to see a doctor. It is like giving somebody a bus \nticket and not having a bus.\n  I have been reading in the newspapers, for example, in the Washington \nPost last month, that the Mayo Clinic, which is often held up as an \noutstanding example of a clinic that keeps costs under control, has \nannounced it no longer will accept Medicaid patients from Nebraska and \nMontana, and some Mayo clinic facilities in Arizona and in Florida are \nbeginning to say no more Medicare patients.\n  Is this what the Senator from Oklahoma thinks could be happening at \nother hospitals and centers, even very good ones such as the Mayo \nClinic where they allegedly keep costs at a reasonable level?\n  Mr. COBURN. I think that is entirely possible. I don't know that to \nbe factual as of yet. What I do know is we are going to have 44 million \nbaby boomers in the next 12 years jump into Medicare and we are cutting \nMedicare. We are going to have 44 million baby boomers jump into \nMedicare. I am one of them. We are going to cut the amount of available \nfunds from Medicare under this bill.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to ask the Senator from Idaho what he \nthinks will happen with these Medicare cuts as they affect jobs and the \neconomy. That is one of the biggest things on people's minds right now, \njobs and the economy. We are concentrating on something here where we \nare going to maybe make a difference, even though CBO says it won't be \nmuch of a difference.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for that question, \nbecause as we have already reviewed, there will be major cuts in \nbenefits to Medicare, to the Medicare Advantage Program. There are \ngoing to be major reductions in access to Medicare, in terms of access \nat hospitals and skilled nursing homes and facilities and home hospice \nand other care.\n  But one of the other things we haven't focused on--and it is kind of \ninteresting that today is the big White House jobs summit--what is \ngoing to happen as a result of these Medicare cuts. In addition to the \nreduction of access and care and benefits to seniors, we are going to \nlose jobs. I have had in my office here representatives of nursing and \nhome health care facilities from Idaho who have told me that if this \nbill is adopted, a number of those facilities are simply going to have \nto go out of business or they are going to have to dramatically reduce \nthe services they provide, meaning that the nurses and the other \ncaregivers who work there will no longer have jobs. That is part of the \nway our senior citizens will lose access because there will simply be \nfewer places, fewer physicians, fewer facilities that will take \nMedicare patients with this kind of an attitude of the Federal \nGovernment toward funding of Medicare.\n  In the end, what do we have? We have a massive expansion of \ngovernment, $2.5 trillion for a massive new entitlement program, along \nwith which come these incredible government controls over the economy, \nas well as the creation of a new government insurance company, funded \nby $\\1/2\\ trillion, almost, of Medicare cuts, $\\1/2\\ trillion in taxes, \nand a massive debt, an unfunded mandate pushed on to the States.\n  That is one of the reasons why I think the Senator from Arizona was \nso wise in bringing this motion as the first step in focusing on one of \nthe first fixes that needs to be made to this bill. Let's step back. \nLet's not pay for a brandnew $2.5 trillion entitlement program on the \nbacks of our senior citizens.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is controlling the \ntime, and there is 3 minutes 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I mentioned the AARP and their opposition \nto this amendment. There is an organization called 60 Plus that has \nmillions of supporters and members. They also feel very different from \nthe AARP. Their message is:\n\n       Soon you [the Senate] will vote on the McCain motion to \n     commit with instructions. The motion would commit it to the \n     Senate Committee on Finance--\n\n  Et cetera.\n\n       I and the 5.5 million supporters of 60 Plus urge you to \n     support this motion. The Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act is nothing of the sort. It would cut Medicare by \n     $500 billion. These cuts would harm seniors who have paid \n     into the program and expect it to be there to help them with \n     their health care needs. At 60 Plus, we pride ourselves on \n     advocating for the best interests of seniors. That is a \n     ``yes'' vote on this motion.\n\n  Let's pay attention to 60 Plus.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have a question. Does 60 Plus sell supplemental \ninsurance policies to seniors?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't believe so.\n  Mr. COBURN. But AARP does. I wonder why people want seniors off \nMedicare Advantage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Most people believe this would be a windfall of tens of \nmillions of dollars for AARP if the legislation is passed as presently \ncrafted.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. How many Medicare Advantage members are there, for \nexample, in Arizona? Is it a small program or a large program?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Our figures are that 330,000 people in my State of \nArizona are on Medicare Advantage. I noticed yesterday, when the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee and the Senator from \nConnecticut were talking, they were disparaging the entire program, \nsaying how it wasn't any good, talking about the cost overruns and \nsaying it was a bad program. They have opposed it from the start.\n  So the message to the 330,000 Americans in Arizona who are on \nMedicare Advantage is that they are out to get you.\n  Mr. CRAPO. According to the Senator from Tennessee, it is my \nunderstanding that nationwide it is about one-quarter of all Medicare \nbeneficiaries. About one in four Medicare beneficiaries in America will \nsee their benefits cut. All Medicare beneficiaries will see their \naccess cut. So these problems we are talking about are not just limited \nin their impact.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will respond again. There are cost problems with \nMedicare Advantage, but those cost problems can be fixed. Those cost \nproblems can be brought under control. But the fact is, to do away with \na program that allows them a choice in how they receive their care is, \nof course, again, an effort to have the government make the decisions \nfor people, which flies in the face of everything we stand for and \nbelieve in.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I may say to the Senator from Arizona, I have heard \nour friends on the other side say Republicans are scaring seniors about \nMedicare cuts. Mr. President, it is not Republican Senators who are \nscaring seniors about Medicare cuts; it is the Democratic health care \nbill that is scaring seniors, because there are $\\1/2\\ trillion of \nMedicare cuts that will pay for half of this program, and they are \noutlined on this chart, as the Senators have discussed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Arizona has \nexpired. The senior Senator from Montana has 15 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will yield myself about 10 minutes. The Senator from \nTennessee says this is going to hurt seniors. Let's ask the senior \norganizations what they think about that.\n  Let's also look at this organization called 60 Plus. What does the \nAARP say in the letter to Senator Reid, dated December 2? It talks \nabout this legislation:\n\n       The legislation before the Senate properly focuses on \n     provider reimbursement reforms. . . .\n\n  I am sorry all my colleagues have fled the Senate. I would like for \nthem to stay and listen to this. I would like to hear their response. \nBut they have just fled the Senate after making sound bites.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am here.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will take my time. The AARP letter, dated December 2, \nstates:\n\n       The legislation before the Senate properly focuses on \n     provider reimbursement reforms. . . .\n       Most importantly, the legislation does not reduce any \n     guaranteed Medicare benefits.\n\n  That is AARP. All this is scare talk about ``grandma.'' With all due \nrespect to my friend from Tennessee, he says that. He has been using \nthat phrase a lot. But AARP says that grandma is fine. AARP says:\n\n       Most importantly, the legislation does not reduce any \n     guaranteed Medicare benefits.\n\n  It doesn't reduce any benefits, according to AARP. Going on:\n\n\n[[Page S12289]]\n\n\n       AARP believes that savings can be found in Medicare. . . .\n\n  The savings in Medicare will extend the solvency of Medicare. I am \nsure my friend from Tennessee knows the actuary said this legislation \nextends the solvency of Medicare, helps Medicare. The benefits go on \nlonger than the status quo. Also, it does so, according to AARP, by \neliminating waste and inefficiency and aggressively rooting out fraud \nand abuse. The last sentence is:\n\n       We therefore urge you to oppose the McCain amendment to \n     recommit. . . .\n\n  The AARP says this hurts seniors, the McCain motion to commit. I \nthink the job of the AARP is to figure out what is best for seniors. \nThat is their conclusion.\n  It is not just AARP's view. There is another letter. This is from the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. They say \nbasically this legislation doesn't cut Medicare benefits. Again, this \nis the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. \nThey say, rather, this legislation includes provisions to ensure that \nseniors receive high-quality care and the best value for their Medicare \ndollars. That is a very reputable senior organization. AARP is a very \nreputable senior organization. The National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security and Medicare is a very reputable organization. That is \nwhat they say.\n  Who is this 60 Plus association I have heard referred to? Let me just \ntell my colleagues what 60 Plus really is. I will read this. This is \nfrom Wikipedia, and it may not be accurate. It says this about 60 Plus:\n\n       The 60 Plus Association is an American conservative \n     advocacy group based in Arlington, Virginia, that bills \n     itself as the conservatives' alternative to the AARP.\n\n  That makes good sense because over the years it has sought to \nprivatize Social Security. 60 Plus, over the years, has sought to \nprivatize Social Security. They want to end the Federal estate tax. \nThey also want to strengthen gun rights, but that is not relevant.\n\n       According to the AARP--\n\n  And this is a bit biased--\n\n     the 60 Plus Association employed the talents of conservative \n     direct mail mogul Richard A. Viguerie to solicit new members.\n\n  We all know who Viguerie is. 60 Plus is a very conservative \norganization. I don't think they are real interested in senior \ncitizens. They have different fish to fry. Also, AARP criticized 60 \nPlus as being partisan because its issues and causes mirror those of \nonly one of two major parties, the Republican Party.\n\n       A final criticism leveled by the AARP [about 60 Plus] is \n     that because it lists no dues-paying members and [get this] \n     receives the majority of its contributions from the \n     pharmaceutical industry, the group is simply a front \n     organization for the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters in opposition to the \nMcCain amendment, in support of the Bennet amendment, and the Wikipedia \ninformation printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Alliance for Retired Americans,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2009.\n       Dear Senator, The Alliance for Retired Americans, on behalf \n     of its nearly four million members throughout the nation, \n     opposes the motion by Senator John McCain to commit the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care America Act, H.R. \n     3590, to the Finance Committee. We urge its prompt defeat by \n     the Senate.\n       The McCain motion to commit would seriously undermine \n     important, substantive, and positive changes in the health \n     care needs of older Americans contained in the bill, none \n     more important than proposed Medicare improvements. In fact, \n     the McCain motion would increase health care burdens on \n     Medicare beneficiaries in several instances. The McCain \n     motion would, for the first time, subject Medicare Part D \n     prescription drug premiums to means testing, causing a rise \n     in premiums for many older Americans. In addition, the motion \n     to commit would halt indexing to Medicare Part B physicians \n     services premiums, causing even more seniors to pay higher \n     premiums, which currently can be as much as $300 per month. \n     Furthermore, the McCain motion would continue the wasteful \n     Medicare Advantage overpayments that currently threaten the \n     financial stability of the Medicare Trust Fund.\n       The Alliance supports provisions in the Patient Protection \n     and Affordable Care Act that improve health care for older \n     Americans such as allowing Medicare beneficiaries to keep \n     their choice of doctors, lowering prescription drug costs, \n     eliminating copayments for preventive screenings, expanding \n     access to long-term supports and service, and providing \n     assistance for pre-Medicare eligible early retirees. All of \n     these improvements will not be possible should the McCain \n     motion pass.\n       The legislation does not cut Medicare benefits. With the \n     expected rising costs of Medicare, the legislation slows the \n     rate of the program's growth without reducing benefits. The \n     McCain motion would actually undercut fiscally responsible \n     attempts to meet the challenges of providing health care for \n     older Americans.\n       The Alliance for Retired Americans is committed to enacting \n     legislation that improves the quality of life for retirees \n     and all Americans. Defeat of the McCain motion to commit the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to the Finance \n     Committee will directly benefit our members and more than \n     forty million older Americans. If we can be of assistance, \n     please contact Richard Fiesta, Director of Government and \n     Political Affairs, at the Alliance.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Barbara J. Easterling,\n       President.\n     Ruben Burks,\n       Secretary-Treasurer.\n     Edward F. Coyle,\n       Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 2, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid: AARP supports moving forward on health \n     care reform, and we remain committed to enacting legislation \n     this year that protects and strengthens Medicare, improves \n     the delivery of health care and provides affordable insurance \n     for all. Accordingly, we oppose the amendment offered by \n     Senator McCain to recommit H.R. 3590 to the Senate Finance \n     Committee.\n       As we have said from the outset, AARP supports a balance of \n     revenues and savings with shared responsibility from \n     individuals, employers and the government. With respect to \n     Medicare, AARP supports policies to eliminate waste, fraud \n     and abuse--and to improve the quality, value and \n     sustainability of the program for current and future \n     beneficiaries. The legislation before the Senate properly \n     focuses on provider reimbursement reforms to achieve these \n     important policy objectives. Most importantly, the \n     legislation does not reduce any guaranteed Medicare benefits.\n       AARP believes that savings can be found in Medicare through \n     smart, targeted changes aimed at improving health care \n     delivery, eliminating waste and inefficiency, and \n     aggressively weeding out fraud and abuse. Such changes will \n     help strengthen Medicare's long-term financing without \n     increasing costs for beneficiaries that make health care less \n     affordable. Medicare provides critical health security to \n     older Americans, and it is important that Medicare continue \n     to deliver high quality care. As health care costs, including \n     Medicare costs, continue to skyrocket, it is essential that \n     we make changes to improve health care delivery, improve \n     Medicare's financing, and ensure maximum value for our \n     Medicare dollars. We believe that Medicare changes in this \n     bill begin to move us down this path, without reducing \n     guaranteed Medicare benefits.\n       With these savings, the legislation before the Senate takes \n     important steps to improve access to preventive services for \n     Medicare beneficiaries. However, more should be done to \n     strengthen Medicare--including closing the Medicare Part D \n     coverage gap, or ``doughnut hole,'' as pledged by the \n     President.\n       We therefore urge you to oppose the McCain amendment to \n     recommit, and we remain firmly committed to working with you \n     to strengthen Medicare and enact comprehensive health care \n     reform this year that improves access and affordability of \n     health care for all.\n           Sincerely,\n     Addison Barry Rand.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 3, 2009.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Committee to \n     Preserve Social Security and Medicare's millions of members \n     and supports, I am pleased to endorse the amendment of \n     Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado which clarifies that H.R. \n     3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, would \n     improve the Medicare program as part of health care reform.\n       Senator Bennet's amendment puts into law two of the most \n     important criteria the National Committee has been using when \n     analyzing health care reform proposals. First, it states \n     explicitly that the legislation would not reduce any of \n     Medicare's guaranteed benefits. Second, it ensures that \n     savings from Medicare would be used to improve Medicare. \n     Improvements in H.R. 3590 include extending the solvency of \n     the Medicare trust funds by five years, reducing the amount \n     of future increases in premiums, eliminating cost-sharing for \n     preventive benefits, making prescription drugs more \n     affordable, and ensuring access to Medicare providers.\n       Protecting Medicare and Social Security has been the \n     National Committee's key mission since our founding 27 years \n     ago and remains our top priority today. Our members are no \n     different than seniors all over this country who are nervous \n     about rising out-of-pocket health care costs and are \n     concerned about the Medicare savings in health care reform \n     legislation. This is a legitimate concern, but it is \n     important to put these savings\n\n[[Page S12290]]\n\n     in perspective. The federal government will spend almost $9 \n     trillion on Medicare in the next decade. The proposed savings \n     of nearly $500 billion mean that the growth in spending will \n     be reduced by about two percent over the next 10 years by \n     eliminating wasteful spending and outright fraud.\n       The H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act, includes savings that are designed to protect Medicare \n     beneficiaries and improve the Medicare program. Senator \n     Bennet's amendment expressly prohibits any reductions in \n     guaranteed Medicare benefits and makes sure all savings are \n     reinvested back into Medicare. I urge you to support the \n     Bennet amendment which is important to Medicare beneficiaries \n     and the solvency of the Medicare program.\n           Cordially,\n                                              Barbara B. Kennelly,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2009.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the millions of members and \n     supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social \n     Security and Medicare, I am writing to express our opposition \n     to the amendment offered by Senator McCain which would \n     recommit H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act, to the Senate Finance Committee with instructions \n     to remove important Medicare provisions.\n       Much of the rhetoric from opponents of health care reform \n     is intended to frighten our nation's seniors by persuading \n     them that Medicare will be cut and their benefits reduced so \n     that they too will oppose this legislation. The fact is that \n     H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \n     does not cut Medicare benefits; rather it includes provisions \n     to ensure that seniors receive high-quality care and the best \n     value for our Medicare dollars. This legislation makes \n     important improvements to Medicare which are intended to \n     manage costs by improving the delivery of care and to \n     eliminate wasteful spending.\n       The National Committee opposes any cuts to Medicare \n     benefits. Protecting the Medicare program, along with Social \n     Security, has been our key mission since our funding 25 years \n     ago and remains our top priority today. In fact, these \n     programs are critical lifelines to today's retirees, and we \n     believe they will be even more important to future \n     generations. But we also know that the cost of paying for \n     seniors' health care keeps rising, even with Medicare paying \n     a large portion of the bill. That is why we at the National \n     Committee support savings in the Medicare program that will \n     help lower costs. Wringing out fraud, waste and inefficiency \n     in Medicare is critical for both the federal government and \n     for every Medicare beneficiary.\n       The Senate bill attempts to slow the rate of growth in \n     Medicare spending by two to three percent, or not quite $500 \n     billion, over the next 10 years. However, it is important to \n     remember that the program will continue growing during this \n     time. Medicare will be spending increasing amounts of money--\n     and providers will be receiving increased reimbursements--on \n     a per capita basis every one of those years, for a total of \n     almost $9 trillion over the entire decade. Even with the \n     savings in the Senate bill, we will still be spending more \n     money per beneficiary on Medicare in the coming decades, \n     though not quite as much as we would be spending if the bill \n     fails to pass.\n       America's seniors have a major stake in the health care \n     reform debate as the skyrocketing costs of health care are \n     especially challenging for those on fixed incomes. Not a \n     single penny of the savings in the Senate bill will come out \n     of the pockets of beneficiaries in the traditional Medicare \n     program. The Medicare savings included in H.R. 3590, the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, will positively \n     impact millions of Medicare beneficiaries by slowing the rate \n     of increase in out-of-pocket costs and improving benefits; \n     and it will extend the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by \n     five years. To us, this is a win-win for seniors and the \n     Medicare program.\n       The National Committees urges you to oppose the motion to \n     recommit the bill to the Finance Committee with instructions \n     to strike important Medicare provisions from health care \n     reform legislation.\n           Cordially,\n                                              Barbara B. Kennelly,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          60 Plus Association\n\n                            [From Wikipedia]\n\n       The 60 Plus Association is an American conservative \n     advocacy group based in Arlington, Virginia, that bills \n     itself as the conservatives' alternative to the AARP, \n     (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons). Over \n     the years, it has sought to privatize Social Security, end \n     the federal estate tax, and strengthen gun rights. Current \n     issues include opposing health care reform proposals; \n     opposing federal energy standards; opposing the General \n     Motors bailout; and opposing tax increases on those earning \n     more than $250,000 per year. 60 Plus is a member of the \n     Cooler Heads Coalition, an climate change denial \n     organization.\n       According to the AARP, the 60 Plus Association employed the \n     talents of conservative direct mail mogul Richard A. \n     Viguerie, to solicit new members. The AARP has also \n     criticized the 60 Plus Association as being partisan because \n     its issues and causes mirror those of only one of the two \n     major United States parties, the Republicans. A final \n     criticism leveled by the AARP is that because it lists no \n     dues-paying members and receives the majority of its \n     contributions from the pharmaceutical industry, the group is \n     simply a front organization for the pharmaceutical industry.\n       The organization's website provides positive reviews of its \n     work by conservative politicians and commentators, including:\n       ``The 60 Plus Association has helped provide the \n     organization and momentum needed for repeal of the federal \n     estate or death tax. I commend the Association for its \n     efforts to abolish this unfair and burdensome tax.''--Rep. \n     Ralph M. Hall (R-TX)\n       ``Small business leaders recognize how counter-productive \n     this tax really is. That's why they endorsed repeal of the \n     death tax and why my bill is supported by the 60 Plus \n     Association.''--Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ)\n       ``Jim Martin (who, by the way, gave George W. [Bush] his \n     first political job) is the head of Washington, DC-based, The \n     60 Plus Association and one of the country's most vocal \n     defenders of the tax rights of seniors.''--Mona Lipschitz, \n     News Editor ``Talkers Magazine'' ``Sources'' Column March \n     2001.\n\n\n                               Leadership\n\n       60 Plus is led by its President James L. Martin, a 73-year-\n     old veteran of the U.S. Marines. Martin has previously led \n     several conservative advocacy groups, and also was chief of \n     staff for six years for former Republican congressman and \n     senator, the late Edward Gurney of Florida. Martin also \n     served as a member of President George W. Bush's health and \n     human services transition team.\n\n\n                                Funding\n\n       In 2001, 60 Plus received a total of $275,000 from the \n     Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the \n     group Citizens for Better Medicare, itself largely supported \n     by the pharmaceutical industry, and three drug companies \n     (Merck, Pfizer and Wyeth-Ayerst) plus another $300,000 from \n     Hanwha International Corp., the U.S. subsidiary of a Korean \n     conglomerate with chemical and pharmaceutical interests--\n     amounts that made up about 29 percent of its revenue. ``We're \n     not a front for anybody,'' James L. Martin, the chairman of \n     60 Plus, told the AARP Bulletin. ``I get money from lots of \n     sources. I've received money from the pharmaceuticals--I wish \n     it was more.'' 60 Plus does not provide any explanation of \n     its funding on its website.\n       In 2003, President Jim Martin told the British Medical \n     Journal that 60 Plus had 225,000 members, whom he would not \n     disclose for privacy purposes. However, according to the \n     organization's IRS Form 990, 91 percent of its $11 million in \n     2002 revenue came from one undisclosed source. The Public \n     Citizen watchdog group suspects that the pharmaceutical \n     industry was that source. According to the Washington Post, \n     in 2002, 60 Plus received an unrestricted educational grant \n     (which can be used as most needed) from the Pharmaceutical \n     Research and Manufacturers of America. As recently as 2001, \n     60 Plus has not reported any member dues as revenue on its \n     past tax returns, reported the AARP Bulletin.\n       60 Plus also earns income from sponsoring life insurance \n     and health screening for its members.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n       On August 7, 2009, 60 Plus released a TV ad to be aired on \n     cable networks to inform viewers about the proposed U.S. \n     health care reform legislation. Media Matters for America \n     watchdog group found that the ad was largely false and used \n     ``scare tactics'' to discourage voters from backing reform. \n     To publicize the ad's launch, 60 Plus issued a press release \n     titled ``Massive Medicare Cuts Await Elderly Says New Ad From \n     Seniors Group'' that read in part, `` . . . The healthcare \n     proposal touted by the Obama Administration means massive \n     Medicare cuts in order to pay for healthcare `reform'.'' 60 \n     Plus provided no evidence of these supposed ``massive \n     Medicare cuts.''\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think it is pretty clear that the main \norganizations that care about seniors support this bill. Another \norganization--60 Plus--I don't know what they think. I guess they \noppose it because they want to privatize Social Security, and they get \nmost of the money from the pharmaceutical industry. I don't think they \ncare about senior citizens, frankly, and certainly not as much as these \nother organizations.\n  I think it is also important to point out that this legislation is \ndeficit neutral over not just the first 10 years but over the next 10 \nyears. It is more than deficit neutral. This legislation generates a \n$130 billion surplus the first 10 years and, as we all know, reduces \nthe budget by a quarter of GDP over the next 10 years. So this is not \nirresponsible; it is very fiscally responsible. It is strongly \nsupported by the senior organizations that care for seniors. I might \nsay, too, it is not raiding Medicare at all. It is strengthening the \nMedicare trust fund and it extends the solvency of the trust fund.\n  Therefore, I think, clearly, as AARP says, we should oppose the \nMcCain amendment, which hurts Social Security beneficiaries, does not \nhelp them.\n\n[[Page S12291]]\n\n  I yield such time as the Senator from Illinois needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If \nthe chair would advise me when I have used that time.\n  I found it interesting, as I am sure the Senator from Montana has, to \nlisten to all of the Republican Senators who have come to the floor to \ndefend Medicare. I am sure the Senator from Montana has the same memory \nI do--that when it was created, it was created by the Democratic side \nof the aisle, with the general opposition of the Republican side of the \naisle. They said it was socialized medicine, too much government, and \nit would fail. Now they are coming riding to the rescue of Medicare. We \nhave a right to be skeptical about the arguments they are making.\n  Imagining these Republican Senators defending Medicare is trying to \nimagine a fish riding a bicycle. I cannot put it in my mind. But they \nare doing it. The Senator who sponsored this motion to commit, Senator \nMcCain, just a year ago, in the course of his Presidential campaign, \ncalled for eliminating $1.3 trillion in spending from Medicare and \nMedicaid. Now he comes to the floor and says this bill, which would \nreduce costs in Medicare by less than half of that amount over a 10-\nyear period of time is irresponsible and the death knell of Medicare.\n  What is the real story? The real story is the Republican side of the \naisle is defending the private health insurance companies--companies \nmaking generous profits from Medicare Advantage. This is a program \noffered by private health insurance companies to replace government-run \nMedicare. It turned out, in many instances, to have failed miserably. \nIt costs more money because these private health insurance companies \nare taking profits out of the Medicare Advantage Program. So they have \npleaded with the other side of the aisle to come to their rescue. They \nhave sent in their best troops on the other side of the aisle, headed \nby the senior Senator from Arizona, who has said the first thing I will \ndo is to protect these private health insurance companies and their \nrights to overcharge seniors in Medicare for Medicare Advantage.\n  He talks about the people now receiving Medicare Advantage, who may \nbe disadvantaged and see a different policy in the future. What the \nSenator from Arizona and others don't dwell on is that everybody under \nMedicare today pays $90 a year more into Medicare to subsidize the \nprivate health insurance companies that offer Medicare Advantage. This \nis a tax--a tax--which the Senator from Arizona is trying to preserve. \nIt is a tax on Medicare recipients.\n  The Senator from Arizona was right a year ago. We can take an honest \nlook at Medicare and Medicaid and take money out of the system without \ndisadvantage to the people involved.\n  I want to say to the Senator from Arizona and others that once we \nhave dispatched his motion to commit, he will have a chance to vote for \nSenator Michael Bennet's amendment. It could not be clearer. It has two \nparts. It says--repeating what this bill says, it says unequivocally:\n\n       No provision in this Senate bill can reduce any Medicare \n     benefit guaranteed by statute.\n\n  Next paragraph:\n\n       Savings in Medicare from the bill will go to extend the \n     life of the Medicare trust fund, lower part B premiums, or \n     cost sharing, expands benefits, improves access to providers.\n\n  We know, and the seniors across America know, that left unattended \nand uncared for, Medicare may go broke in just a matter of 7 or 8 \nyears. This bill before us will extend the life of Medicare for at \nleast 5 years. It will put Medicare on sound footing which every senior \nand their families want to have. That is why AARP, the largest \norganization of senior citizens across America, has urged Members of \nthe Senate in both parties to oppose the McCain motion to commit. That \nis why I stand today with the Senator who is chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and say to my Republican friends, with their newfound love \naffair with Medicare, that they should reject the 60 Plus organization, \nthis ``wise counsel'' they turned to that came up with the idea of \nprivatizing Social Security.\n  How would you like to have had all your Social Security money in the \nstock market over the last 2 years? Boy, there is a great idea. Stick \nwith this 60 Plus group if you like the notion of privatizing Social \nSecurity. Stick with AARP if you want Medicare to be strong, on sound \nfinancial footing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think it is appropriate to remind people \nof some of the provisions that are in this bill.\n  To repeat, because some people have listened to some of this debate \nand some have not and some might be tuning in right now, the fact is, \nwithout reform, without this legislation, Medicare is expected to go \nbroke in the next 8 years. That is according to the Medicare trustees \nreport. With this legislation, that is extended for at least 5 more \nyears. That protects seniors. This legislation protects seniors. \nWithout reform, that is, without this bill, costs will rise and seniors \nwill be forced to bear more and more of the burden out of their own \npockets. This legislation adds benefits for seniors. It does not take \nit away, as the other side implies.\n  Without reform, seniors will struggle to afford prescriptions in the \ndoughnut hole. I remind my colleagues that this legislation will cut \nthe cost of brand-name prescription drugs in half for seniors during \nthat gap, the so-called doughnut hole.\n  It will also help provide more benefits in terms of annual wellness \nvisits. When seniors go to the doctor for a colonoscopy, mammography, \nor other preventive screenings, they will not have copays, as is \ncurrently the case today. That is an added benefit this legislation \nprovides for seniors.\n  Also, this legislation helps seniors who are eligible for both \nMedicare and Medicaid with access to home, community-based \nalternatives. A lot of our seniors would like that additional benefit. \nThat is all in this legislation.\n  This legislation provides more benefits for seniors, not fewer. This \nlegislation protects seniors; it does not harm them. This legislation \nextends the solvency of the trust fund rather than not.\n  I might also say--and I think the Senator from Illinois made a very \ngood point--currently, seniors who are paying a Part B premium are \nreally paying a $90 tax per year for those persons who are in Medicare \nAdvantage. We know Medicare Advantage is overpaid. The Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Coburn, agreed with me when I asked him just yesterday if \nMedicare Advantage was overpaid. He said, yes, it is overpaid by a very \nlarge margin. This legislation can adjust that overpayment.\n  I might also say, too, that the groups I mentioned support this \nlegislation. But the main point I want to make is this: There are so \nmany fundamental provisions in this legislation that really have not \ncome out much in debate, a little esoteric but under the heading of \n``delivery system reform.'' We must begin to change the way we \nreimburse doctors and hospitals so we are focusing much more on quality \nof care rather than quantity of care. Some of that is already happening \nin America without legislation. Basically, it is the nature of \nintegrated systems. We all talked about them. I know Senators on the \nother side of the aisle also agree with this new trend where hospitals, \ndoctors, nursing homes, and other groups get together and they \ncoordinate their care. Their care is much more patient focused. We have \nto move much more in that direction.\n  This will go a long way once it starts kicking in--it is going to \ntake maybe 3 or 4 years to finally have an effect--toward eliminating \nthe waste in our current system. Estimates are we have between $200 \nbillion to $300 billion to $800 billion annually in waste in the \nAmerican health care system. That is the reason health care costs are \nso high for family, businesses, governments, whatnot. We have to begin \nto get that under control, and this legislation does that.\n  If we do not pass this legislation, we will be postponing the day \nwhen we have to begin to get some of these excessive costs under \ncontrol, and then the problem will be much more difficult. An ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound of cure in medicine. It is also true in \nlegislation. Clearly, now is the\n\n[[Page S12292]]\n\ntime to exercise a little ounce of prevention by starting to curb \nexcessive costs, and this bill does that.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, with a mother who is covered by \nMedicare, I remain committed to protecting seniors' access to Medicare, \njust as I have throughout my public service, which is exactly why I am \nopposed to the McCain motion to commit. Mr. McCain's purpose is not to \nprotect Medicare but to frighten our Nation's seniors so that they too \nwill oppose health care reform. I have noted that he has taken his \nscare tactics to a new level by recording his voice for an automated \nphone call into my State claiming to seniors that these Medicare \nsavings are going to cut their benefits. He urges them to call me. I \nbelieve the seniors in my State know me better than that. They know \nthat I have worked my entire career in this body to protect Medicare.\n  I have cosponsored the Bennet amendment as an extra safeguard to \nensure our seniors that this bill does not cut the guaranteed Medicare \nbenefits that they receive today and that any savings generated from \nmaking the Medicare Program more efficient will go back into \nimprovements to the program.\n  If we do nothing, the Medicare Program will be broke in just 8 years. \nThis bill restores the program's solvency beyond 2022. It will reduce \npremiums and copays for seniors; ensure seniors can keep their own \ndoctors; cut the billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse that \noccur annually; provide new prevention and wellness benefits for \nseniors; lower their prescription drug costs; and help them to stay in \ntheir own homes rather than going to nursing homes if that is what they \nwish to do.\n  So what about the $500 billion in Medicare cuts Republicans say \nseniors should be worried about? Well, what they are not saying is that \npart of the reason Medicare is insolvent is the fact that private \ninsurers under the Medicare Advantage Program are overpaid by 14 \npercent on average. A typical couple pays $90 more per year in Part B \npremiums to pay for Medicare Advantage overpayments, even if they are \nnot enrolled in these plans. This bill curbs those overpayments, saving \nover $118 billion, by for the first time requiring competitive bidding \nof Medicare Advantage plans against one another. Furthermore, Medicare \nand Medicaid subsidies to hospitals that help them cover the cost of \nthe uninsured will be reduced since hospitals will have less need for \nthem once millions more Americans have health insurance. That is \nanother $43 billion. Provision after provision is specifically designed \nto ensure greater value in Medicare, all while the Republicans are \nusing fear tactics to score political points.\n  I have heard from many seniors in Arkansas, recently, and over the \nyears, about their satisfaction with Medicare. It is not a perfect \nprogram, and as a Senator it is my job to ensure that Congress continue \nto improve upon the program as needed so that it can continue to meet \nthe needs of our Nation's seniors. Rightly so, seniors in my State are \nconcerned about the misinformation spreading that we will cut their \nbenefits and allow bureaucrats to ration their care. Organizations such \nas AARP, the Alliance for Retired Americans, and the National Committee \nto Preserve Social Security and Medicare have stood up to say enough \nwith the misinformation campaign. Today I add my voice to that chorus.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I opposed Senator McCain's attempt to \nsend the bill back to committee because it would have effectively ended \nthe current debate on health care reform. Moreover, while I have \nconcerns about some of the offsets in the bill--such as cuts to hospice \nand home health care--it would be fiscally irresponsible to throw out \nprovisions that cut down on wasteful spending and reward quality, as \nthe McCain motion would have done. Those provisions are key to helping \nto put Medicare on the path to long-term fiscal sustainability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The next 10 \nminutes is evenly divided between the Senator from Colorado and the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Iowa is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as I stated earlier, the Bennet \namendment, as written, does not protect Medicare. So I have a \nmodification I would like to present that ensures Medicare savings in \nthis bill are not being siphoned off to finance a new and separate \nentitlement program.\n  To that end, I ask unanimous consent to modify the amendment by \nadding the following before the period at the end of subsection (b):\n\n       . . . and furthermore that, notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act or amendment made by this Act, net \n     Medicare savings specified in the most recent estimate \n     available from the Director of the Congressional Budget \n     Office before enactment are appropriated to the Secretary and \n     shall be used for such purposes and to maintain Medicare \n     policies for home health services, skilled nursing facility \n     services, hospice care, hospital services, and benefits \n     provided by the Medicare Advantage program, as under the \n     provisions of such Title as specified on the day before the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  End of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, under current law, if less \nis spent for Medicare providers, the benefits inure to the Medicare \ntrust fund beneficiaries.\n  Although I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Iowa, this \nis a stunt, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Then if I may?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to make very clear that \nthis objection confirms that the Bennet amendment does not protect \nMedicare as the other side claims that it protects Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this motion sends the legislation back to \nthe Finance Committee for a short period of time with instructions to \nreport back with cost offsets other than Medicare cuts. The motion says \nwe should retain the provisions in the legislation addressing fraud and \nabuse and retain those savings to strengthen the Medicare trust fund. \nInstead of cutting over $450 billion from Medicare providers and \nbeneficiaries, the committee should do what it should have done in the \nfirst place--protect seniors' benefits and access to providers. It is \nmuch needed.\n  Mr. President, I say to my friends, let's save seniors who have paid \ninto the Medicare Program their whole lives from these damaging cuts. I \nhope my colleagues will vote in favor of this motion. Let's use \nMedicare savings to save Medicare, not to fund a whole new $2.5 \ntrillion entitlement program. I urge a vote in favor of the motion.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to sum up the debate over Medicare \nin the Senate health bill and on the motion and amendment before us.\n  Only in Washington, DC, could an effort to extend the life of \nMedicare somehow be distorted as being bad for seniors. We know from \nthe Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan organization that \nsupports both sides of the aisle, that this Senate bill does not take \naway any seniors' guaranteed Medicare benefits. It extends Medicare \nsolvency for 5 additional years. My amendment simply confirms these two \nfacts.\n  I am the first person who would insist we have an open process for \nthis debate. I think there are ideas on each side of this debate on \nthis bill that are worth considering and should be considered. But it \nis why I find it so confounding that opponents of my amendment want to \nsend the entire bill back to committee so debate stops. How can we \nreturn home to the people of our States and admit to them we just gave \nup and sent health care back to the committee for another round?\n  The people who do not want change are the people who are content to \nleave it the same and do not have a theory about how to extend \nMedicare. They would have seniors believe the bill is bad for seniors. \nYet AARP, the Alliance for Retired Americans, the Center\n\n[[Page S12293]]\n\nfor Medicare Rights, and the National Committee to Preserve Social \nSecurity and Medicare beg to differ. They disagree. They agree with \nthis amendment and with the underlying bill. Senior advocacy \norganizations, grassroots organizations with their ears to the ground \nhearing the voices and concerns of seniors, support health care reform, \nand they agree that with my amendment, this bill strengthens Medicare \nand preserves seniors' benefits.\n  With the Senate bill finally reaching the floor, seniors are looking \nfor simple clarity on how health care reform can help their lives. \nNothing in this bill will cut guaranteed Medicare benefits, and this \nbill will extend Medicare solvency for 5 additional years. It actually \nmakes the system work better instead of cutting or adding to a program. \nIt actually changes the way Medicare works so it will be stronger and \nmore stable.\n  People may disagree with the prescription, but as a general matter \neverybody knows the status quo is unsustainable, and this bill helps \nseniors. It eliminates the copay seniors have to pay for preventive \ncare. We know preventive care saves lives and it saves money.\n  As we close debate on my amendment and the alternative motion to \ncommit the bill to committee, I urge all the Members of this body to \nconsider the consequences of inaction. My amendment affirms what the \ncurrent Senate bill does to help seniors and strengthen Medicare. We \nall know even more can be done, so let's continue this debate and \nreject the motion to commit the bill back to the Senate committee.\n  I urge every Member of this body to support my amendment. Please vote \nyes on the Bennet amendment and protect our seniors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 1 minute 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator from Arizona has yielded back his time. We \nmight as well yield back our time, and we can vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona yielded back his \ntime. The Senator from Montana yields back his time. All time is \nyielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2826.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Motion To Commit\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the motion to commit offered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask my colleague if he wishes to go \nfirst? Whatever he wants to do. It is his motion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Please go ahead.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the McCain motion is next. Unless we act \ntoday and pass health care reform, the Medicare trust fund runs out of \nmoney in 2017. There are two ways to keep Medicare solvent: find \nefficiencies so Medicare spends less or increase revenues going into \nthe trust fund--two ideas. Our bill would make Medicare Advantage more \nefficient. We would introduce competitive bidding----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order? We have a Senator \nspeaking here. May we have order?\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  We extend the trust fund for 5 more years. That is in this bill. Yes, \nMedicare Advantage plans would not be overpaid as much, but those plans \ncould pay for greater efficiency by cutting their profits or cutting \ntheir executives' pay. They could do that. Nothing says they have to go \nafter beneficiaries.\n  Our bill does nothing to reduce the guaranteed Medicare benefits. To \nthe contrary, our bill would improve Medicare benefits. It would help \nseniors on the prescription drug doughnut hole and add new preventive \nbenefits such as annual wellness visits. The bill would help ensure \ndoctors would be available to treat Medicare patients. We would prevent \nthe 21-percent cut in doctor payments under current law. For all those \nreasons, the American Association of Retired Persons supports reform \nand opposes the McCain motion.\n  I urge my colleagues to support reform and oppose the motion to \ncommit.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this motion proposes to send the \nlegislation back to the Finance Committee to remove the nearly $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in cuts that will severely impact all seniors who are eligible \nfor Medicare. As the Senator from Montana mentioned, the system is \ngoing to go broke in 7 years. So what does this legislation \ncontemplate? That we take $\\1/2\\ trillion out of their savings and use \nit to fund a $2.5 trillion new entitlement program. What does that do \nfor the Medicare trust fund? Nothing.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this motion and send it back \nto the Finance Committee. Do the right thing for the seniors of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be \nin a period of debate only between now and 4:30. It is my understanding \nthere has been an agreement that at 4:30 we will all go to the \nclassified room in the Visitor Center to listen to what the \nadministration has to say about Iraq and Afghanistan. I haven't had a \nchance to clear this with the Republican leader, but for the next hour \nwe will remain in a period of debate only and come back and offer the \namendment after we finish with the classified briefing.\n  We have not yet had agreement to recess at 4:30. I ask unanimous \nconsent that we recess from 4:30 until 5:30 for a classified briefing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish to continue discussing the health \ncare legislation we just voted on. We had a series of votes dealing \nwith the Medicare issue. I wish to start my remarks by turning to the \nSenator from Mississippi, Mr. Wicker, and ask him if he has comments he \nwishes to make.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding to me. I \nthink it is important for us all to understand where we are now. We \nhave had a debate about the Medicare issue. The Senate had an \nopportunity, with the McCain amendment, to protect Medicare from the \nalmost one-half trillion dollars in cuts the Reid bill proposes to do \nto Medicare. We said no to that opportunity and instead passed the \namendment offered by Senator Bennet of Colorado which in sum total does \nabsolutely nothing. What we have done now with the Bennet amendment is \nsay that along with apple pie and motherhood, we also love Medicare, \nand we want everybody to know that. But the substantive effect of what \nwe have now done is nothing.\n  I have this challenge to the managers of the bill on the other side \nand to the Democratic leadership: Now that Bennet has passed and McCain \nhas been defeated, I challenge them to take this bill, send it back to \nCBO and CMS and have the independent analysts there look at it again. \nThey will be duty bound to come back with the facts. The facts will be \nthat the almost one-half trillion dollars cut in Medicare is still \nthere.\n  Now that the McCain motion to commit has been defeated, and the sham \nof the Bennet amendment has been passed, there are still the same cuts \nto hospitals, there are still the same cuts to Medicare Advantage and \nto all the senior citizens who depend on that and who were told during \nthe campaign their coverage would not be taken away from them if they \nliked it. The cuts to nursing homes are there. The cuts to home health \nare there. And the cuts to hospice are still there.\n  Send the bill back to CBO. We can continue debating it. We will not \nhave to miss out on one bit of rhetoric that we have already had. But \nask the independent analysts: Are the Medicare cuts still there? They \nwill be duty bound to come back to us and say: Yes, the same cuts that \nwere there before are current in the bill now.\n  We have accomplished absolutely nothing today to protect Medicare.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several of my colleagues \nand I may engage in a colloquy during the time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I wish to follow up on the comments of Senator Wicker from \nMississippi because it is very critical that the American public \nunderstand what has happened in the Senate.\n  When you talk about health care reform, the vast majority of \nAmericans have a couple of ideas in mind. First and foremost, they want \nto lower health care premiums and costs. That is what Americans think \nabout primarily when they think about the need for health care reform.\n  They also want to see better access to quality health care and make \nsure those who are uninsured have access to health care, and those who \nare underinsured have access to health care, and that we all have \naccess to quality health care. That is what this debate should be \nabout.\n  But, instead, the legislation we see before us does not achieve that. \nDoes it reduce the cost of health care? No. It drives up the cost of \nhealth care. It raises taxes hundreds of billions of dollars. It cuts \nMedicare by hundreds of billions of dollars. It grows government by \n$2.5 trillion of new spending. It forces the most needy in our society \ninto a failing Medicaid system. It imposes a damaging unfunded mandate \non our struggling States. It still leaves millions of Americans \nuninsured and establishes massive government controls over our health \ncare economy, including the creation now of a government insurance \ncompany.\n  We have been focusing in the debate on one part of this for the last \nlittle while; that is, the Medicare cuts. Mr. President, $464 billion \nof the revenue to pay for this massive new entitlement that is being \ncreated is to come from Medicare, and it is nothing other than a direct \ntransfer of assets in the United States from America's seniors in the \nMedicare system to a new government entitlement program.\n  There are other cuts. There are details of these cuts that I will put \nup right now on a chart.\n  The debate we have been having over the last, oh, almost 3 or 4 days \nnow, is whether we should commit the bill back to the Finance Committee \nso these Medicare cuts can be removed. We just had two votes. One was \nwhat I will call a cover vote. It said we do not want to cut Medicare \nbenefits and we should make sure that anything we do protects Medicare. \nIt did not have any detail in it, but it passed 100 to nothing because \nit does nothing. It does not change what is in the bill. By the way, as \nI said, that vote just passed by 100 to nothing.\n  The second vote we took failed. Was the vote 40 to 60? I do not \nrecall the exact vote. What would that amendment have done? That \namendment would have put the bill back into the Finance Committee and \nrequired that we take out the Medicare cuts.\n  So let no one be confused, after the first round now in the Senate, \nwe still see this in the bill--a transfer of $464 billion from the \nMedicare Program to the establishment of a new entitlement program. I \ndo not believe that is what Americans had in mind when they were \ntalking about reform of health care.\n  There has been a study that came out--OK. I have the exact vote here. \nIt was not 40 to 60. It was 42 to 58, but it was defeated, in any \nevent, and now we still have the cuts to Medicare in the bill. Well, we \nare going to continue debating this issue.\n  I myself have an amendment that will send--for the skilled nursing \nhomes--the bill back to Finance to correct the cuts for the skilled \nnursing homes. There are others who will try to address some of the \npieces of this legislation to see if we can't find a way to fix and \nrestore the strength and stability of the Medicare system.\n  Everyone admits we need to reform Medicare. But until this bill, none \nof us thought we were talking about taking from Medicare in order to \ncreate a massive new entitlement program, with the government control \nthat comes along with it.\n  What do these cuts do? I am going to start out with the hospitals, \nthe hospice services, the nursing homes, and the home health agencies. \nThe reduction in Medicare spending on these medical providers will \nbasically result in lower access to care for our seniors. I have had \nrepresentatives in my office of both skilled nursing facilities and \nhome health agencies who have talked to me about what this means to \nthem. They have pointed out that the last time Congress did something \nlike this, we lost, in Idaho, 30 percent, for example, I believe it is, \nof our home health agencies. They are not there anymore. If we have \nthese kinds of deep cuts in the future, we are going to lose more of \nour home health care agencies.\n\n[[Page S12295]]\n\n  One of the owners said to me--he put it this way: If you reduce the \nallocation of income to home health agencies, I have to either reduce \nemployment, which means not hire as many nurses and medical providers, \nor I have to close parts of my building and stop operating as many \nrooms in the building, or do something to reduce costs.\n  What that means is that seniors will have less access. But that is \nnot all this bill does. In addition to reducing the access for \nhospitals, hospice service, nursing homes, and home health agencies, it \nalso cuts Medicare Advantage deeply.\n  Quickly, what is Medicare Advantage? Medicare Advantage is a program \nthat about one out of four American seniors participate in in Medicare. \nIt is an opportunity which Congress started a few years back to try to \nlet the private sector become a part of the delivery system in \nMedicare. In other words, to put it simply, private sector insurance \ncompanies can contract with the Federal Government to provide Medicare \nservices to Medicare beneficiaries, so it is the private sector getting \ninvolved in health care delivery rather than the government simply \ndelivering the health care through a single-payer system. That, in a \nquick summary, is what Medicare Advantage was all about.\n  What we found was that it was phenomenally successful because the \nprivate sector was able, through its management, to not only provide \nthe statutorily required Medicare coverage but additional benefits, \nvery critical additional benefits, such as preventive health care, \ndental coverage, vision coverage, and things such as that--things that \nmake a big difference in the lives of our seniors and enables some of \nthose who cannot buy additional coverage for those things Medicare does \nnot cover to get access to it through Medicare Advantage.\n  That is why in my State 27 percent of all of the Medicare recipients \nhave moved to Medicare Advantage. It is the most popular part of \nMedicare in America today, and it is growing faster than any other part \nof Medicare because it is delivering more to the Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  This bill slashes $120 billion from it, some of us believe because \nthere is a bias against the private sector delivery of health care. But \nfor whatever reason, the Medicare Advantage portion is where the cuts \nare focused.\n  Let's put up the next chart.\n  When we had the issue before the Finance Committee, we had the head \nof CBO before us, and I asked him a question about the cuts to Medicare \nAdvantage. We had a colloquy between us at that point, and I asked:\n\n       So, approximately half of this additional benefit--\n\n  In other words, these additional things that Medicare Advantage has \nbeen able to provide to our seniors under Medicare--\n\n       So, approximately half of this additional benefit would be \n     lost to those current Medicare Advantage policyholders?\n\n  And his response was:\n\n       For those who would be enrolled otherwise under the current \n     law, yes.\n\n  The point being, not only will we lose skilled nursing facilities, \nhome health care, hospice care, and hospital care, and access to that \ncare, we are also going to see senior citizens lose benefits. Again, \nwhat is the purpose? The purpose is not to shore up Medicare. In fact, \nit will take $464 billion--taxpayer dollars that are allocated to \nMedicare in our current system--and transfer that straight over to the \nestablishment of a new entitlement program.\n  I want to let my colleague from Nevada comment on this for a minute, \nbut before I turn it over to my colleague from Nevada, I wish to point \nout that as we approach this issue, the question of why would we \ntransfer $464 billion out of the Medicare system to a new government \nentitlement program, one of the reasons is because the President \npledged he would not sign a bill that did not reduce the deficit.\n  As I said earlier, this bill grows the spending in the Federal \nGovernment by approximately $2.5 trillion over the first full 10 years \nof its implementation of spending. The only way to cover that increase \nin the size of the government is to either raise more taxes or to cut \nspending somewhere, and what the bill does is both. It raises taxes--\nwhich we are going to be talking about in future days--and it cuts \nspending. The place where it cuts spending is Medicare. That is why \nwhat we see is increased taxes, cuts in Medicare, growth of government, \nand the establishment of a new Federal entitlement program, with all of \nthe accompanying accoutrements of Federal control, including a new \ngovernment owned and operated insurance company.\n  I see my colleague from Nevada standing and turn to him for his \ncomments on this issue.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. First of all, I think my colleague from Idaho has made \nsome excellent points about, truly there will be cuts that are going to \nhappen in Medicare. And do not just take the politicians' word for \nthese cuts. Listen to the CBO Director. He is the nonpartisan, I \nrepeat, nonpartisan, official scorekeeper. When asked direct questions, \nby not only the Senator from Idaho but others, he absolutely says the \nbenefits, especially under Medicare Advantage, will be cut.\n  In my home State of Nevada, tens of thousands--I think about 200,000 \naltogether--of seniors have voluntarily chosen Medicare Advantage over \ntraditional Medicare. The reason? Very simple. There are extra benefits \nin Medicare Advantage. You hear the Democrats talk about the doughnut \nhole in Medicare Part D, which is prescription drug coverage. Well, \nthere is not a doughnut hole under most of the Medicare Advantage plans \nbecause the private sector, through its efficiency, has been able to \nfill that doughnut hole. In other words, they get complete coverage of \nprescription drugs through their Medicare Advantage plans.\n  Also, under Medicare Advantage, they get additional preventive health \ncare services. They also get vision and dental. And depending on the \nplan, depending on its makeup, there are different types of benefits to \nattract seniors to certain plans. It is no wonder that about one out of \nfour seniors in America have voluntarily signed up for Medicare \nAdvantage. Nobody forced them into this system. They voluntarily chose \nthis system.\n  If you think about it, seniors do not like change. For most seniors, \nthey like what they have. They do not like to change. For one out of \nfour seniors to have voluntarily changed, there has to be something \npretty attractive about Medicare Advantage.\n  There are some real attractive things for seniors in Medicare \nAdvantage plans. That is why when you actually poll seniors regarding \nMedicare Advantage, the vast majority of them are thrilled with the \ncoverage they have. They do not want to lose benefits. Who would want \nto voluntarily lose benefits?\n  But with the $120 billion cut in Medicare Advantage the Democratic \nmajority has put in this bill, about half of the benefits in Medicare \nAdvantage plans will be cut. Isn't that correct, I ask my friend, the \nSenator from the State of Idaho?\n  Mr. CRAPO. The Senator from Nevada is correct. In fact, I am just \nthumbing through here to get the exact statistics. But the bottom line \nis, the CBO indicated, I think it was something like from an average \nnumber of $140 or so of extra benefits--that it would go down to about \nhalf of that. So they would get about half of those extra benefits.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. That is per month?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Per month.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. So $140 per month. According to CBO, about half of those \nbenefits would be cut under this plan, isn't that correct?\n  Mr. CRAPO. That is correct.\n  Mr. WICKER. If the Senator would yield on that point.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WICKER. We have three Republicans standing now saying this, and \nwe have had quoted some official independent sources. Let me quote a \nDemocrat, Representative Michael McMahon of New York:\n\n       Medicare Advantage, which serves approximately 40 percent \n     of my seniors on Medicare, would be cut dramatically.\n\n  That is why that Democrat from the State of New York voted no on the \nplan when it was before the House of Representatives. So you don't have \nto take our word for it, from a partisan standpoint. Democrats are \nsaying no because of the Medicare cuts and the cuts to Medicare \nAdvantage--drastic cuts.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The Senator from Idaho and I serve on the Finance \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S12296]]\n\nwhere a large portion of this bill was written. We both heard Democrats \non the other side of the aisle complaining about cuts to Medicare \nAdvantage. Yet when I look in this bill, the total dollar figure in \ncuts to Medicare Advantage is the same as what came out of the Finance \nCommittee; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. CRAPO. The Senator from Nevada is correct. I have in front of me \nthe exact numbers right now from CBO that were provided in the Finance \nCommittee markup. During the markup, CBO estimated that the value of \nthe extra benefits offered by Medicare Advantage plans will drop from \n$135 a month to $42 a month, based on the cuts contained in that bill, \nwhich are essentially the same level of cuts we now see in the bill \nbefore us on the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Let me make a couple other general points about this \nbill. I think we have pretty well covered the fact that Medicare \nAdvantage is going to take a severe hit. Medicare overall, that \nincludes hospice care, hospital care, nursing home care, home health--\nall of them are taking severe cuts. More than likely, those cuts are \ngoing to come, if the government doesn't rescue those cuts in the \nfuture, from benefits to seniors.\n  If the government decides not to have those cuts in the future, then \nthe deficit is going to go up. You can't have it both ways. You can't \nhave both a deficit-neutral bill and not have the cuts in Medicare. In \nother words, you are going to either have the cuts in Medicare or you \nare going to have ballooning deficits into the future.\n  There are several other problems with the bill that I would like to \npoint out. First of all, we know it is over 2,000 pages; there is \nincredibly complex language in those over 2,074 pages. It places \nbureaucrats in charge of health care decisions instead of creating a \npatient-centered health care system that says the doctor-patient \nrelationship is where most of the health care choices should be made. \nAs a matter of fact, according to the National Center for Policy \nAnalysis, in almost 1,700 places in this bill it authorizes the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to ``make, create, determine, or \ndefine'' things regarding health care policy. Mr. President, 1,697 \ntimes, to be exact, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nbasically makes health care policy--not doctors, not health care \nproviders; bureaucrats in Washington, DC.\n  You mentioned before there were $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes and \nabout $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts. We know this bill will lead to \nmillions of Americans having increased premiums.\n  We have talked a lot about what is wrong with the bill, however, many \non this side of the aisle have offered positive solutions. We have \ntalked about allowing small businesses to join together to take \nadvantage of purchasing power that big businesses have. We have talked \nabout allowing people to buy insurance across State lines. Some States \nhave less expensive plans than others. You can buy your auto insurance \nacross State lines. Why shouldn't we be able to buy our health \ninsurance across State lines?\n  Mr. CRAPO. If I could interrupt, my understanding is, the Republican \nbill in the House, which has both ideas in it and which was evaluated, \nwhat it would do to the cost of health care and health care insurance \npremiums, that those ideas would actually reduce health care premiums \nby, I think, 5 or 6 or 8 percent. I don't remember the exact number, \nbut the point is, those ideas would hit the reason Americans want \nhealth care reform; that is, reduce the cost of health care coverage.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I am glad the Senator from Idaho made that point, because \nthe No. 1 problem with health care in the United States is not quality. \nWe have the finest quality system--by almost any measure, the finest \nquality health care system in the entire world. The problem is that it \nis too expensive. We should be going after costs. This bill does not do \nthat. This bill actually raises premiums for tens of millions of \nAmericans. That isn't the direction we should be taking health care.\n  Another idea the vast majority of people on this side have supported \nis medical liability reform. Once again, in the Finance Committee, we \nasked the question--I, personally, asked the question of the CBO \nDirector: How much money would medical liability reform--the common one \nI offered and Senator Hatch offered--how much would that save between \nthe government and the private sector? He said: Over $100 billion. \nWell, that is not chump change; that is a significant amount of money, \n$100 billion. Add that to buying across State lines, add that to small \nbusiness health plans, add that to incentivizing healthy behaviors--add \nthat to the elimination of preexisting conditions. I think Republicans \nand Democrats alike agree, if you have insurance and you have played by \nthe rules and you get a disease, your insurance should not be taken \naway or denied. We should eliminate preexisting conditions for those \nthat have played by the rules. We shouldn't allow insurance companies \nto unexplainably increase rates. We should take a step-by-step, \nincremental approach to health care reform instead of gutting Medicare, \nas the Senator from Idaho has talked about, to create a new government \nentitlement program. That is what we are saying on this side of the \naisle. However, it seems to be falling on deaf ears on the other side \nof the aisle.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I know my colleague from Mississippi wants to make a \ncomment or two, but may I ask, Mr. President, how much time remains for \nour side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, if I could just maybe take 1 minute of \nthat time and then y colleagues can wrap it up.\n  I wish to emphasize what a devastating effect these Medicare cuts are \ngoing to have on rural America. Once again, I wish to quote some of my \ncolleagues from the other end of the building because it shows the \nbipartisan opposition we have against these cuts from rural America.\n  Mike Ross, a Democrat from Arkansas, said:\n\n       With more than $400 billion in cuts to Medicare, it could \n     force many of our rural hospitals to close, providing less \n     access and care for our senior citizens.\n\n  Representative Larry Kissell of North Carolina:\n\n       From the day I announced my candidacy for this office, I \n     promised to protect Medicare.\n\n  So he voted no on the bill in the House of Representatives.\n  Ike Skelton said:\n\n       The proposed reductions to Medicare could further squeeze \n     the budgets of our rural health care providers.\n\n  Finally, Representative Boucher, a senior Democrat from Virginia, \nsaid:\n\n       The plan could place at risk the survival of our regions' \n     hospitals.\n\n  Unless these Medicare changes are taken out of the bill, this bill \ndevastates health care for senior citizens in rural America.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you very much. I wish to use the remainder of our \ntime to speak for a minute about what this bill does to different costs \nin our country. I think the point we made in this colloquy is, after \nthe votes we just took, let no one be confused; the $464 billion of \ncuts to Medicare remain in the bill.\n  Let's talk about the question of the cost curve. There has been a lot \nof talk about what has become known as the cost curve. It has been said \nby everybody we need to bend the cost curve down. Some are saying this \nbill bends the cost curve down. Well, which cost curve are they talking \nabout? Are they talking about the size of government, the growth of \ngovernment? No. If you take the first full 10 years of the growth of \nspending in this bill--which, by the way, is delayed for 4 years--if \nyou start when the spending starts and take the first full year, 10 \nyears of spending, the new spending, the growth of government is about \n$2.5 trillion. I don't see how anybody could say that cost curve is \nbending down. It has skyrocketed.\n  Well, would it be the cost of health care, which I think is the cost \ncurve Americans were thinking about, health care insurance and the \nquality of health care that is provided? Well, CBO just came out with \nits report that analyzed that issue and there are a number of \nindependent groups that have analyzed it and they all pretty much say \nit is not going to reduce the cost of health insurance. It is not going \nto reduce the cost of health care. In fact, for\n\n[[Page S12297]]\n\nthe neediest in America, those who are in the individual market, it \nwill drive up the cost of their insurance and not by just a little bit, \nby around 10 to 13 percent. For those in the small group area, it will \ndrive up theirs--not as much--by about 1 to 3 percent. For those in the \nlarge group area, there is a possibility that theirs might taper off a \nlittle bit; the estimate is somewhere between zero impact and 2 percent \nreduction.\n  But is that what we are talking about in America, 30 percent of the \npeople in this country seeing their health care insurance costs go up \nand the rest seeing theirs remain basically stable? That is not the \ncost curve reduction I thought Americans were talking about in health \ncare reform.\n  So then what other cost curve could they be talking about? Well, \nthere is a lot of talk about the deficit. Sometimes they try to shift \naway from the cost of health care to the cost of the bill to the people \nof America, and they say the deficit is reduced. Well, how can you say \nthat? There is only one way you can say that and that is if you accept \nthe budget gimmicks in the bill. If you raise taxes by around $500 \nbillion and if you cut Medicare by $464 billion, then you can say this \nmassive expansion of government is somehow covered and that the deficit \nwon't grow.\n  Well, I think we have talked about the Medicare cuts part of this. We \nare going to talk about the tax increases, which are hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of new taxes in the future, but what did I mean \nwhen I said you can only say the deficit goes down if you accept the \nbudget gimmicks?\n  This bill starts the collection of revenues and the cuts out at the \nfront end but doesn't start the spending for 4 years, so you have 10 \nyears--in the 10-year window we are looking at, we have 10 years of \nrevenue and 6 years, basically, of spending. Sure, if you only count 6 \nyears of the spending side of the bill against 10 years of its \ncollection side, you are going to be able to make that deficit look a \nlittle better.\n  In addition, there are major expenditures we all know are going to \nhave to be done in health care, such as the SGR fix for physician \ncompensation in Medicare, that are not even in the bill, an expense we \nknow over 10 years is around 200 billion to 250 billion of extra \ndollars; simply not there, not counted. Well, if you want to show a \ndeficit reduction, you certainly want to leave out of your bill a lot \nof the spending you are going to do in the future. It is gimmicks such \nas these, it is tax increases, and it is Medicare cuts that allow one \nto say the deficit goes down.\n  In conclusion, the reality is, this bill will increase the growth of \ngovernment by $2.5 trillion for a full 10-year measure, increase taxes \nby hundreds of billions of dollars, cut Medicare by hundreds of \nbillions of dollars, create a Federal insurance company, create massive \nFederal controls over the health care economy, push the neediest of the \nuninsured not into an insurance policy but into a failing Medicare \nsystem, and push an unfunded mandate of tens of billions of dollars \nonto our States. That is not the kind of health care reform we need. As \nmy colleague from Nevada indicated, there are reforms that do make a \ndifference that will reduce the cost of health care, that will cut down \nthe spiraling costs of health care insurance, and will not require us \nto have such an intrusion of the Federal Government into the management \nof our economy.\n  It is time for us to slow down and start, step by step, to address \nthe kinds of reforms that will reduce the cost of insurance and the \ncost of health care and that will help us to increase access to quality \ncare in America. We can do it, and we have a number of very good ideas \non the table we will be exploring in greater detail in future days as \nwell that will help us to do it.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of our time.\n  May I ask how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The minority has no time.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I think it would be instructive to stop \nall this rhetorical talking past each other on Medicare Advantage and \nexplain a little bit about how we got to where we are in this \nlegislation.\n  I don't know the exact year, but I think it was back in the 1980s \nsometime, up to a certain point Medicare was basically paid fees for \nservices. That is the basic Medicare model. The service was provided \nand there are certain set rates for that service. Then, in the 1980s, \nprivate companies thought maybe they could be more efficient, private \ninsurance companies. So they came to Congress and said: We can do a \nbetter job in compensating Medicare based on fee for service, so let's \nset up something called Medicare Advantage, private entities.\n  So Congress said: OK, competition is a good thing. So we did that. \nCongress did that. We basically set the rates to be paid to Medicare \nAdvantage plans at 95 percent of fee for service. After all, the plan \nsaid they could do it more cheaply and they could compete. So we said: \nOK, that sounds like a good idea. We will pay you 95 percent of what \notherwise would be paid under fee for service. That continued for a \nwhile.\n  In 1997, the plan said: Gee, we need a little more money. So Congress \nsaid: All right. And we gave a little more money to Medicare Advantage \nand basically said, OK, that will pay the 95 percent. But if you are \nnot doing so well and making money at 95, we will set kind of a higher \nfloor, according to certain areas of the country, and you could choose \nwhatever enables you to have the greatest compensation.\n  The big change occurred in 2003, in the Medicare Modernization Act, \notherwise known as the drug bill. It was the legislation that created \ndrug benefits for seniors. As we all know, frankly, when Medicare was \ncreated, it didn't have an outpatient drug benefit because drugs \nweren't comparatively as important then as they are today. Today there \nare miracle drugs that help in a lot of ways. We created the drug \nbenefit in 2003.\n  The Congress did something else then. Many Members of Congress were \nconcerned that Medicare Advantage might not offer the plans in rural \nparts of America, that there wouldn't be enough incentive for Medicare \nAdvantage to go to rural America to offer the drug benefits--not only \nthe drug benefits but other benefits they provided. Congress, frankly, \ngave a lot of money to Medicare Advantage plans so there could be at \nleast two plans operating in all parts of the country. Give them enough \nmoney and they will go; that was the theory. Guess what happened. We \ngave them a lot of money and they went.\n  We have reached the point now where Medicare Advantage is, by \neverybody's estimate, quite dramatically overpaid, as the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Coburn, said when I asked him yesterday whether Medicare \nAdvantage plans are overpaid. He said, ``Yes, they are definitely \noverpaid.''\n  MedPAC, which advises us on Medicare reimbursement, said to us that \nwe are way overpaying Medicare Advantage plans. I hear figures of from \n14 to 18 percent overpayment. It depends on what part of the country \nyou are in. Let's be conservative and say it is 14 percent in fee for \nservice, that they are overpaid. MedPAC is an independent advisory \ngroup that helps us figure out what in the world we pay hospitals, \nnursing homes, home health agencies, etc. We are not the experts. We \nneed help. MedPAC said to the Congress that we are overpaying them big \ntime.\n  We decided let's figure out a way to reform the system. How about a \nlittle competition? Right now, Medicare Advantage plans are paid what \nis called a benchmark, depending upon the fee for service in their \ncertain area. We all know fee for service is much less in rural \nAmerica, and I am sure in the home State of the occupant of the chair. \nFee for service is much higher in other more urban States and so forth.\n  As it turned out, under the benchmarks for fee for service, they were \nway overpaying in States where fee for service is so high, and not \nquite as much overpaid where fee for service is so low. That is a nutty \nsystem in the current law today.\n  What we are doing in this legislation is, basically, we are saying: \nLook, let's introduce a little competition. We are saying: Let's get \nrid of the benchmark-type fee for service. It is out of whack in \ndifferent parts of the country. What are we going to do? We say: OK, we \nwill divide the country into geographic areas. In your area, wherever \nyou might be, Uncle Sam--or Medicare--will pay the average competitive \nbid\n\n[[Page S12298]]\n\nfor that area. The average cost you bid for that area is what we are \ngoing to pay, which eliminates this big disparity between States and \nmakes it much more fair so that reimbursement is based much more on \nwhat it actually costs in a certain area, but it is competitively bid. \nThat is what we are trying to do.\n  Is that a good thing to do? I think most of us think so. Is it \nperfect? I don't know for sure, but we are trying our best to make this \na better system, a better program than we currently have. As a \nconsequence, we are going to save some money, and there will be \ncompetition. Most of us think competition is often a pretty good thing. \nThat is what this is, I remind my colleagues. As a consequence, we are \nnot going to be overpaying Medicare Advantage plans anymore. The amount \nwe reduced the payment to is in line with what MedPAC says we should \npay, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.\n  We are trying to be responsible and reasonable with taxpayer money, \nseniors who pay into Medicare. The point is often made that, gee, this \nwill hurt Medicare Advantage, hospitals, and so forth. I think it is \nworth reminding all of us that a meeting occurred at the White House, I \nthink, 4 to 6 months ago, when all of the so-called providers--the \nhospitals, insurance companies, including Medicare Advantage plans--all \ngot together with the President and said: Mr. President, we agree this \ncountry needs health care reform. They all agreed.\n  Let's move back in history a little bit. When President Clinton \nattempted health care reform, all those groups were opposed to health \ncare reform. This time, they are pretty much in favor of it because \nthey know if we don't fix it, it is going to collapse.\n  Back to that meeting. What did they say? They said: Mr. President, we \nhave all gotten together and we think we can contribute. We can cut \ncollectively $2 trillion in payments that go to us over the next 10 \nyears.\n  That is what they said. That is pretty interesting. Thank you very \nmuch. So we are working together to get health care reform.\n  Why do you think they would agree to $2 trillion? They got their \ncalculators out and got their financial officers together and said: \nGee, if everybody has health care--remember, 46 million Americans don't \nhave health insurance--if everybody had health insurance, hospitals, \nMedicare Advantage plans said: Hey, we can make some money because \neverybody has health insurance.\n  So that was the deal. They will have a little lower margins, but they \nwill make it up on volume. That is why they said to the President: We \ncan cut $2 trillion that otherwise would be reimbursements to us.\n  In this legislation, did we reduce the rate of increase over 10 years \nby $2 trillion? No. Did we decrease the rate of increase in \nexpenditures by half of that or $1 trillion? No. Do we reduce the rate \nof increase of health care expenditures down to, say, $450 billion, \nclose to $500 billion? Yes, that is what we did. About one-quarter of \nthe industry said they could voluntarily contribute. Are they squawking \ntoday? No. Why? Because they got a pretty good deal. They know they can \ncontinue to provide services and the hospitals are going to do well and \nhome health care agencies will do well. I will add that the profit \nmargin for home health agencies is about 17 percent. That is pretty \ngood. So we are cutting them a little bit. The profit margin for \nnursing homes--Medicare payments to nursing homes--is about 15 percent. \nWe are cutting that a little bit. But they are still making money and \nstill will do well. In fact, their average rate of growth over the next \n10 years is going to be in excess of 5 percent a year. Wall Street \nanalysts say these outfits are doing pretty well. You don't see their \nstocks going down.\n  We are trying to do what is right and to reform Medicare Advantage, \nas I just outlined it. It is a pretty fair attempt at reform. Also, we \nwill reduce payments to hospitals and other providers in an amount that \nthey can live with--not be happy with but an amount they are OK with, \nand where they know they can still make money. That extends the \nsolvency of the Medicare trust fund another 5 years because those \nproviders are not being paid as much as they would otherwise be paid.\n  I hear Senators crying crocodile tears about how seniors are going to \nbe cut, and so forth. Frankly, with the changes we made, I think it is \nvery fair, and it will extend the solvency of the trust fund. There is \nnot one dime of guaranteed Medicare benefits that will be cut--not one \nthin dime--in this legislation. It is true that because Medicare \nAdvantage--the rate of growth of increase in Medicare Advantage plans \nis trimmed back a little, perhaps there will not be as many extra \nbenefits--not the guaranteed benefits but extras, fringe benefits, like \ngym memberships and things like that. Don't forget, that is not because \nthat is a decision made by Medicare or by Congress; that is a decision \nmade by the executive offices of these private companies. I am not \nsaying they should do this. They could trim salaries, overhead, and \nthey could have a little less return to stockholders, and they could \ncut down administrative costs. There are various things they could do, \nwhich doesn't have to be passed on to reductions in fringes. Let's keep \nthings in perspective as to what is actually going on.\n\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I appreciate what the Senator \nhas just done. This is an area where I think there is a lot of \nconfusion and misunderstanding. A lot of it begins with just the \nbranding, the title of something. This was, frankly, a revelation to \nme, going back a number of weeks ago. I heard the words ``Medicare \nAdvantage.'' I thought this has to be part of the regular Medicare \nProgram because it has that title.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Most people did.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will correct me if I am wrong, this is not \ntraditional Medicare; this is a private plan, right?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct. To be totally fair, the other side likes \nto trot out this Medicare pamphlet that includes Medicare Advantage. I \nthink that is misleading and not accurate. As the Senator says, these \nare private plans.\n  Mr. DODD. In looking back a few years ago, the original reason--and I \ndon't recall the debate as well as my colleague, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, does. As I remember, the original idea behind this \nwas--and he said this already, but it deserves being repeated--this was \na way of cutting costs, reducing expenditures. In a sense, we were sold \nthis idea on the fact that we could do this better, more efficiently, \nat far less cost.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely. That was the rationale.\n  Mr. DODD. That is why we supported trying this idea. A couple of \nthings happened since then. One, I think the overpayments, on average, \nare around 14 percent.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct. It depends on the part of the country.\n  Mr. DODD. So, on average, it is 14 percent in overpayment. Is it also \ntrue that roughly 80 percent of Medicare beneficiaries don't get any of \nthese benefits?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. And that the average Medicare couple over the age of 65 is \npaying, I am told, about $90 a year more in Medicare payments for \nbenefits they don't get.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Exactly.\n  Mr. DODD. So here we have 75 to 80 percent of the beneficiaries of \nMedicare paying more money and not getting the benefits for a program \nthat costs more than 14 percent more, and it is a private plan.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. With great considerable administrative costs and profits \nthat otherwise could go to seniors.\n  Mr. DODD. Our bill does something that I think our friend from \nOklahoma, Senator Coburn, pointed out that is absolutely critical, \nwhich is that competitive bidding did not exist in the original.\n  Who was setting these rates originally during this period of time? \nHow did these rates get set? Did Congress set them?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Congress did. Congress set the benchmarks.\n  Mr. DODD. Is it true that if these Medicare Advantage plans come in \nunder the benchmark bid, they actually get a piece of the savings? Is \nthat correct as well?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. So there is an incentive to trim the cost of the \nadministration of the program. It is also true the plans get bonus \npayments for care, coordination, and quality, and plans can use these \nbonuses to improve benefits?\n\n[[Page S12299]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct. Under this legislation, we say--frankly, \nunder the earlier Medicare Advantage plans, HMOs had some coordinated \ncare, but the other half, the private fee for service, preferred \nprovider organizations did not have coordinated care.\n  We are saying in the legislation that if you are in the Medicare \nAdvantage plan, which includes a whole list, and you provide \ncoordinated care, we are going to give you a bonus.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly.\n  Mr. WICKER. I realize we do not have much time. I have a quick \nquestion. I was listening to the debate on television. I understood the \nSenator to say Medicare Advantage is not part of Medicare. My question \nis: I have here the Medicare handbook for 2010, ``Medicare and You.'' \nIt says right on page 50:\n\n       Medicare Advantage Plans (Part C). A Medicare Advantage \n     plan . . . is another health coverage choice you may have as \n     part of Medicare.\n\n  My question to the Senator is--to my friends on the other side of the \naisle: Is the Medicare handbook inaccurate and, if so, will you be \ncalling CMS, Medicare, and be asking them to change what they say \nexplicitly on page 50 of the Medicare handbook?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is a very interesting question. When I was told \nabout the handbook, that is what I thought I was going to do, is call \nup Medicare and say that is misleading and it is inaccurate because it \nis misleading and it is inaccurate.\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. These are private companies.\n  Mr. WICKER. Even though Medicare put it in their handbook, has had it \nfor several years, it is wrong?\n  Mr. DODD. They are wrong. It is a private health care plan. It is a \nprivate health care plan. Medicare is a public plan. Medicare Advantage \nis not Medicare, and it is certainly not an advantage, given the \noverpayments that occurred.\n  Mr. WICKER. Isn't it in part of the Medicare legislation?\n  Mr. DODD. It is a private plan. My colleague understands that, I \nhope. Medicare Advantage is a private plan. You know that, of course, \ndon't you? I assume you know that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It has officers, a board of directors.\n  Mr. WICKER. I know this. It is in the handbook. I want my two friends \nof the majority party to get it out of there. We thought all along it \nis part of Medicare and the millions of senior citizens who rely on \nthis and who were told in the campaign, if you are satisfied with your \ncoverage, you don't have a thing to worry about, they are going to be \nable to keep their coverage. Under the Democratic legislation, they \nwould not be allowed to keep their coverage under this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. If I can reclaim my time, 80 percent of older Americans are \npaying $90 more a year for this. Do they have any say in this? They \ndon't get any of the benefits. Why are they writing a check for $90 a \nyear to pay a private plan from which they get no benefits? What about \nthem? Don't they deserve something in all this?\n  Mr. WICKER. The question I had was: Is this a part of Medicare?\n  Mr. DODD. It is not.\n  Mr. WICKER. I realize my friends have a difference of opinion. The \nauthorities for Medicare who put this publication out year after year \nsay Medicare Advantage is part of Medicare. It is Part C. I think it is \ndisingenuous for my friends to say it is not.\n  Mr. DODD. The only reason it is part of it is it is subsidized. This \nplan gets subsidized by the American taxpayers. That is the only \nqualification that puts it under the Medicare umbrella because our \ntaxpayers are writing a check to a private company. That is why it gets \nincluded as part of Medicare. Other than that, it is a private plan.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is a semantic question. When you see the operational \neffects, as my good friend from Connecticut said----\n  Mr. WICKER. One other question. Is it a semantic question to ask: Are \nthe American seniors who are currently enjoying Medicare Advantage \ngoing to be disallowed from this program? The answer is yes, under this \nbill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This legislation, if I may say, expressly states there \nwill be no reduction in what is called guaranteed benefits under \nMedicare. No reduction, whether it is under Medicare Advantage, whether \nit is under fee for service--whatever it is, no reduction whatsoever.\n  To be fair to my good friend, I used the words ``guaranteed \nbenefits.'' Guaranteed benefits are the usual benefits seniors think of \nwhen they are under Medicare. They go to a doctor, hospital, so on.\n  We have given, unfortunately, so many additional dollars to the so-\ncalled Medicare Advantage plans--way above what they should have \nreceived. MedPAC agrees. Senator Coburn totally agrees they have been \npaid way too much. They have taken advantage of that advantage by \ngiving additional benefits, in addition to the guaranteed benefits. \nThose additionals are things such as gym memberships--a lot of extra \nstuff that, frankly, is not part of Medicare, is not directly related \nto health.\n  I might say, too--I have said this a couple, three times and I will \nsay it again--a reduction in the increase of payments to Medicare \nAdvantage, the effect of those reductions is a decision made by the \nofficers of that company. They could take those reductions and apply \nthem anywhere. They could reduce their salaries. They could reduce \ntheir admin costs. They could take other actions that would reduce the \nrate of growth, the rate of return of their stockholders. They do not \nhave to take it out of the beneficiaries. That is their choice. They do \nnot have to.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Medicare Advantage decides how to use their extra payments \nto provide benefits. They decide; Congress does not. There is nothing \nin the legislation that forces plans to reduce benefits at all, rather \nthan reducing profits.\n  Medicare Advantage is one of the profitable business lines of the \nprivate insurance. In fact, the New York Times on November 2--just \nabout a month ago--reported:\n\n       Humana, the health insurer, posted on Monday a 65 percent \n     jump in third-quarter profits--\n\n  We are talking about private health care. These are profits, a 65-\npercent jump in profits off this plan--\n\n     as bulging membership and premiums from Medicare Advantage \n     overcame a lackluster commercial segment.\n\n  I appreciate the fact that people are getting eyeglasses and things. \nThat is wonderful. But we need to be clear about this. These are not \nthe guaranteed benefits, and 80 percent of Medicare beneficiaries get \nnone of these advantages and yet pay more so other people under this \nprivate health care plan--because it is subsidized by the American \ntaxpayers--get them.\n  Again, now we are going to put competitive bidding in place. Our bill \nallows, under these plans, if they follow and do some of the \nincentives, to actually share in some of the profits. We are not \ntalking about eliminating all of this plan. We are trying to make it \nwork better for people under the bill.\n  We have to be honest what we are talking about. This is a private \ninsurance company that is subsidized by the American taxpayers. It is \nnot what, traditionally, people think of Medicare.\n  Mr. WICKER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WICKER. The chairman, when he is calling HHS to change the \nhandbook, also needs to tell them to change their Web site, where it \nsays Medicare Advantage is part of Medicare.\n  Can the Senator from Connecticut guarantee that under this \nlegislation, the benefits to Medicare Advantage recipients will not be \ncut? Can he make this guarantee?\n  Mr. DODD. What I wish to say and what I wish to ask my colleague--\n  Mr. WICKER. The reason he cannot make this guarantee--\n  Mr. DODD. Let me claim my time. There is not a single guaranteed \nbenefit under Medicare that is cut in this bill. Not one. I defy any \nMember of this body to identify a guaranteed benefit under Medicare \nthat gets cut. You cannot find one. Do we cut out gym memberships and \nthings such as that? Yes, that may happen. But on the guaranteed \nbenefits--operative word is ``guaranteed''--under guaranteed benefits, \nthere is not a single cut to a benefit. That is why an organization \nrepresenting 40 million Americans that endorsed the Bush prescription \ndrug plan, by the way, in 2003--hardly a partisan organization as some \nhave suggested today--has basically opposed\n\n[[Page S12300]]\n\nthe McCain motion and has endorsed the legislation before us today. \nThat organization, I say to my good friend, would never be endorsing a \nbill that was going to cut guaranteed benefits under Medicare.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wish to say something else to put this in perspective. \nThat is according to analysis of Medicare Advantage plans from \nOppenheimer Capital Fund, dated November 12 of this year, between 2006 \nand 2009. Their estimate is, Medicare Advantage accounted for nearly 75 \npercent of the increase in gross profits among the larger Medicare \nplans in the industry.\n  Let me say this:\n\n       . . . Medicare Advantage . . . has been a huge driver--\n\n  Quoting from the Oppenheimer Capital Fund--\n\n     a huge driver of earnings growth for the industry in recent \n     years. Between 2006 and 2009, we estimate that Medicare \n     Advantage accounted for nearly 75 percent of the increase in \n     gross profits among the larger plans in the industry, \n     highlighted by an estimated gross profit increase of $1.9 \n     billion in 2009, relative to commercial risk earnings gains--\n\n  That is basic health insurance, not Medicare Advantage plans but \nbasic health insurance--\n\n     of nearly $600 million. Medicare Advantage probably won't be \n     as much of a contributor in 2009--\n\n  But it is going to be a very large contributor in 2009 because of \nadvantages they get.\n  Mr. WICKER. It is clear the Senator does not like Medicare Advantage. \nIt is also clear no guarantee can be made that Medicare Advantage \nbenefits will not be cut under this legislation. It is also clear there \nare tens and tens of millions of American senior citizens who like \ntheir Medicare Advantage, notwithstanding the Senator from Montana, and \nthey stand to lose those benefits under this legislation.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me point out, one of the things we have not talked \nabout, I say to my friend from Mississippi, under our legislation, this \nbill protects seniors in Medicare Advantage from plans that care more \nabout profits than seniors, trying to pass the buck. Under our bill, it \nallows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to kick out any plan \nunder Medicare Advantage that significantly increases their premiums or \ndecreases their benefits. Under existing law, that would not happen; \nunder our bill, it does.\n  It is not about being hostile to Medicare Advantage. It is being \nrealistic about all this and trying to make the tough decisions we have \nto make about trying to stabilize Medicare, seeing to it we are going \nto have protections in premium reductions and cost savings, as well as \nincreasing access and quality.\n  All we are trying to point out is, when you have a Medicare Advantage \nplan that has run as poorly as this one has, at great cost we now \nlearned--14 percent above, on average; some places it is 50 percent \nabove average--where is the equity. By the way, I say to my friend from \nMississippi, it is a private health care plan that receives subsidies \nfrom the American taxpayers, where 80 percent of seniors today pay more \nand get nothing for it. Where is the equity in this? There is no equity \nin this. Why should 80 percent of that population pay $90 or more a \nyear, on average, for a benefit they don't get? Where is the equity?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might add, too, to remind us all, this legislation \nprovides additional benefits for all seniors, including Medicare \nAdvantage recipients--additional benefits. What are they? No copayment \nfor certain preventive care--mammograms, for example, colonoscopies, \nscreening benefits that are not in existence today. There are a whole \nhost of other things that are additional.\n  This legislation provides additional benefits to Medicare Advantage \nmembers that are not there today.\n  When I say ``guaranteed benefits,'' I am talking about the usual \nbenefits seniors think of under Medicare. It is hospital care, it is \nnurses, it is all medically necessary physician care, diagnostic \ntesting, supplies. It is home health care, preventive care, skilled \nnursing, hospice--all the things that are basically related to health \ncare.\n  The only thing that might be trimmed back a little is, I call them \nthe fringe stuff, the excesses, such as gym memberships. I wish I had \nthe whole list because some of them are not related.\n  As I said earlier, they may not be cut. They don't have to be. It is \nup to the private companies whether to cut. I have nothing against \ncompanies making profits. They should make profits. It is our \nresponsibility as Senators to make sure the reimbursement rates \nMedicare pays providers are fair and reasonable and not excessive. We \nhave been told they are excessive. So we are trying to find a way to \nmake it fairer.\n  Mr. WICKER. This segment of debate will end at the bottom of the \nhour, so it is almost over. I appreciate my friends yielding. This \ndebate will continue for days, weeks. I say to my friends, there are \nMembers on their side of the aisle who have come before this body and \nsaid these Medicare Advantage cuts are unacceptable. I think they are \ngoing to have to have a lot of convincing too. Democratic Members of \nthe House have also come forward. I am not convinced. I don't think \nthey are convinced.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me say to my colleague again that here \nwe have two organizations representing 43 million seniors in our \ncountry, and these are organizations that don't just write letters on \nthe fly. They have staffs that examine proposals here, and that is all \nthey do. We have AARP, which is an organization that is highly regarded \nand well recognized, representing 40 million seniors in the country, \nand the Commission to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, which \nrepresents an additional 3 million, and that is all they do. This is a \ntotally nonpartisan examination. These two organizations, representing \nalmost 50 million of our seniors, have examined this bill in detail--\nevery dotted ``I,'' every semicolon, every comma, every proposal--and \nhave done exhaustive research, and they have said: This is a good bill. \nThis bill is deserving of support.\n  We received a letter today from them. They are not Democrats. They \nare not Republicans. They are not trying to get an advantage over \nanybody. They are examining whether this bill stabilizes and \nstrengthens Medicare, puts seniors in a stronger position, is going to \nsee to it that we can extend the life of the program and provide \nguaranteed benefits that are needed, and their answer was a resounding \nyes--yes, this bill is deserving of our support.\n  Again, I appreciate the political debate here, but at some point we \nhave to step back and let those whose job it is to analyze our \nsuggestions and our ideas--just as AARP supported President Bush 6 \nyears ago with his prescription drug bill. They didn't join Democrats \nor Republicans; they liked the idea--still do--and supported it. Today, \nthey are not supporting us as Democrats. They would reject this bill \nout of hand if they thought we did something adverse to the interest of \ntheir membership. But they said: No, this is a good bill, deserving of \nsupport. The two largest organizations in this country representing \nseniors have said: Get behind this bill. Let's support our seniors. \nLet's make Medicare stronger and strengthen it. And this bill does it.\n  That is why we should be joining together, not fighting over this. \nMedicare Advantage is a private health care plan subsidized by the \nAmerican taxpayer. Eighty percent of the seniors don't get the \nAdvantage. That is why we are creating these changes in this bill.\n  I applaud my colleague from Montana, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, who did incredible work, along with his staff and other \nmembers, in producing this product.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/03/senate-section/article/S12300-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I intend shortly to call up an \namendment once the procedural posture is clarified and has been cleared \non the Republican side, an amendment to protect the Social Security \nsurplus and the CLASS program savings in this act. When I do, I will \nthen ask for its immediate consideration, but at the moment, that is \nstill being worked out from a parliamentary standpoint, so my words \nwill come in advance of that.\n  I wish to describe the amendment for my colleagues. It is a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution that demonstrates the Senate's commitment to \nmeaningful deficit reduction in this legislation while also protecting \nboth the Social Security surpluses generated by the legislation and \nsavings generated from a significant element of the bill, the long-term \nvoluntary insurance program created by the Community Living Assistance \nServices and Supports Act, what we call the CLASS Act. The amendment \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that surpluses generated by this bill \nfor the Social Security trust fund be reserved for Social Security and \nthat the savings for the long-term insurance program created by the \nCLASS Act be reserved for the CLASS program.\n  The CBO has estimated that this bill will save $130 billion over the \nfirst 10 years and roughly $650 billion over the next 10 years. This \namendment stands for the proposition that these impressive savings will \nbe protected vis-a-vis the CLASS Act and the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  I wish to speak in particular today about the CLASS Act. This act \ncreates a voluntary insurance program for seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities. This program will enable them to afford long-term care \neven after they have exhausted coverage offered by Medicare or their \nprivate insurer. Let me make clear that this is not a mandatory \nprogram. It does not increase taxes on anyone. It is a completely \nvoluntary program that offers an additional insurance option for the \ndisabled. Without such insurance, disabled people often cannot afford \nthe massive costs of long-term care. Under current law, they are often \nforced to sell their homes or otherwise what is called ``spend down'' \ntheir assets until they meet a poverty threshold before they can begin \nreceiving the help they need.\n  Certain colleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued that \nthe CLASS plan would lead to a financially unstable entitlement program \nand would rapidly increase the Federal deficit. That is simply not \naccurate. The CLASS plan is fully self-sustaining and actuarially \nsound, funded by the premiums paid by those individuals who voluntarily \nopt into this insurance plan. There are no taxpayer dollars involved.\n  After individuals pay premiums for 5 years, they become eligible to \nreceive a cash benefit of no less than $50 per day to assist with the \nvarious costs associated with the onset of a disability or long-term \nhealth condition. These benefits could be used to pay for \ntransportation to work, for instance, or the construction of a \nwheelchair ramp or the hiring of a personal aide--the sorts of things \nthat so often make the difference between somebody remaining an \nindependent and productive member of society and requiring the support \nof assisted living or nursing home care.\n  I think we can all agree that it is in everyone's best interest to \ntry to provide this kind of assistance to people when an unexpected \ndisability begins to affect their lives, to allow them the support they \nneed to continue as best they can in their homes, in their apartments, \nwith their families, at their jobs, and remain, as I said, both \nindependent and productive.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that this plan is \nfiscally solvent. In fact, it projected that the program would be \nsolvent for at least 75 years.\n  There was a helpful amendment offered in the HELP Committee when we \nconsidered and debated and passed that piece of legislation. The \namendment was offered by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, \nyour colleague, Senator Gregg, the ranking member on the Budget \nCommittee. It passed unanimously, and it ensures and requires that the \nprogram be actuarially sound for 75 years.\n  CBO has projected that, in fact, it would be solvent for at least 75 \nyears. CBO further estimated that the program would reduce the deficit \nby $72 billion over 10 years, saving $1.6 billion for Medicaid during \nthe first 4 years of the program. So it has a substantial fiscal \nupside.\n  I am surprised that our colleagues on the other side are criticizing \nthis element of the bill. It seems to run contrary to the findings that \nhave been made by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It is \ncertainly a stark contrast to their tolerance for their own Medicare \nPart D Program, the pharmaceutical program the other side touted so \nproudly, which is different from the CLASS Act in many respects: It was \nvastly expensive; it was completely unpaid for; it was a massive \nhandout to the pharmaceutical industry, containing within it the, to \nme, appalling proposition that the government was forbidden by law, \nforbidden by a previous Congress, to negotiate with the pharmaceutical \nindustry over the price of drugs and had to take it or leave it, \nwhatever the pharmaceutical industry charged. Frankly, it is \nirresponsible to put the government into that situation. It is fiscally \nirresponsible, and it is irresponsible from a management point of view. \nIt is irresponsible in more ways than I can name. Yet they happily went \nthat way, the path of fiscal irresponsibility, when it suited the \npharmaceutical industry. Of course, in order to do so, they had to \nleave a hole in the Part D pharmaceutical program for seniors to fall \ninto, what the Presiding Officer knows well and what my colleagues know \nwell as the dreaded doughnut hole that has caused so many unsuspecting \nseniors so much surprise, chagrin, fear, anxiety, and misery. Now, \nhaving been the architects of that program, they criticize the CLASS \nAct even though the CBO has found it to be fiscally sound.\n  It seems there is an enormous double standard between programs \ndesigned for the benefit of, say, the pharmaceutical industry, or \nperhaps the insurance industry, and the standards they would apply to \nprograms that benefit people who suffer from the onset of a \ndisability--regular Americans, regular families. This is something that \nhappens to people across this country all the time.\n  That is really the most important effect of the CLASS Act. As good as \nit is on deficits, as much as the CBO has confirmed that it is to our \nfiscal advantage to proceed with the CLASS Act, the most important \neffect is not on deficits, it is on people.\n  It is on families. This insurance program will allow disabled people, \nyoung and old, to live more financially secure and productive lives, \nfree from the fear that medical expenses will impoverish or bankrupt \nthem, able to make those investments in their own adaptation to their \ndisability so they can maintain the lifestyle, the job, and the home \nthey are accustomed to and comfortable with. Studies show that less \nthan a quarter of private long-term care insurance policies provide a \nlifetime of benefits. The CLASS Act fills an important void that has \nbeen left by the public sector for people who seek this protection and \nthis insurance on a paid-for basis. The CLASS plan is a win-win for \nreducing costs in our health care system and protecting Americans who \nrequire long-term care. Our current system plain fails to protect those \nwho aren't healthy or wealthy enough for private market coverage. It \nfails to create an opportunity for individuals to plan and save for \ntheir future lifetime care needs. It fails to provide a sustainable \nsafety net for individuals who require long-term services and supports \nto keep the familiar aspects of their life around them--job, family, \nhome, hearth.\n  I will shortly ask that my colleagues support the amendment when it \nis called up. It will put the Senate on record as protecting Social \nSecurity. It will put the Senate on record as protecting the CLASS Act \nsavings scored by CBO. It will put the Senate on record as supporting \nthe impressive deficit reduction in the bill. I look forward to \nfavorable consideration when we have a parliamentary agreement on \ncalling it up.\n\n[[Page S12302]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the proposal of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, but I think it needs to be put in its proper context. This is a \nsense of the Senate. It has no legal implications. The CLASS Act, as \nproposed in the underlying bill, was described by the Senator from \nRhode Island but not fully. The way the CLASS Act works, it is an \ninsurance program theoretically where people in their thirties and \nforties and fifties can buy insurance to cover their retirement years \nwhen they have to go into some sort of long-term care facility and may \nbe institutionalized. People are paying into this program for decades, \nmaybe four decades, maybe their thirties right into their seventies or \ntheir twenties into their sixties. The cost of this program does not \nactually start to be incurred until these folks move into a long-term \ncare facility or a managed care facility type of situation for their \nretirement years where they need skilled nursing assistance of some \nsort.\n  There is a huge amount of premium that comes in under this program \nearly which goes against virtually no expenses, because this is a \nbrandnew program. It is a startup program. It is created by the Federal \nGovernment. It is a government insurance program much like Social \nSecurity and Medicare. The practical effect of that is that money will \ncome in for years to the Federal coffers. In the first 10 years of this \nbill, it is estimated around $90 billion will come in. In the second, \nas we move out in the second 10 years, the total over those two periods \nof 10 years is about $212 billion. Then more money will come in in the \nthird 10 years, probably somewhere in the vicinity of $300 billion to \n$400 billion potentially. None of this will be spent on the purposes of \nthis insurance, because almost everybody who is paying in for these \npremiums is going to be too young to go into one of these \ninstitutionalized care facilities during those first three decades.\n  So what happens is that the Federal Government gets this large \nwindfall of money from these people who are paying their premiums and \nspends it, spends it on something else--education, roads, highways, \narts, whatever is the decision on where to spend the money. It gets \nspent. That is the way the Federal Government works. It doesn't have \nany place to put this money and keep it safe. It comes in, and it gets \nspent. When these people retire, when they do go into a situation where \nthey need assisted living of some sort, then the government gets the \nbill. Not us, not those of us who are here. We will be long retired by \nthen, everybody in this Chamber, except maybe Senator Bennet from \nColorado who is rather young and vibrant. The rest of us will probably \nnot be around to take advantage of this. It will be our children and \ngrandchildren who will end up with that bill.\n  That bill will be staggering. We are talking hundreds of billions, if \nnot trillions, of dollars of outyear costs as a result of this type of \nprogram; much like Social Security which basically has nothing in the \ncoffers today, even though trillions of dollars have been paid in, but \nwhich has a lot of obligations. The same thing with Medicare. That was \nan insurance program which was supposed to have money in the coffers. \nNot there. In fact, it goes into negative cashflow and will be \ninsolvent beginning in 2010. There is no money when these folks retire \nand need it. It will have been spent.\n  This amendment, well intentioned as a statement, has absolutely no \neffect on that series of events. That money will still be spent under \nthis amendment. After this amendment is passed--and I presume it will \nbe passed; it is a nonevent amendment having no purpose other than a \npolitical statement--CBO will still score this bill as spending that \nmoney, absolutely score this bill as spending that money, the $90 \nbillion for the next 10 years, the $212 billion for the next 20 years, \nthe $400 billion after that. That is my guess. The third 10-year \nperiod, my guess is $500 billion. When we get out there 30, 40 years \nfrom now and these people expect to get their insurance paid, then when \nour children get the bill for that insurance, it becomes a tax on them, \na direct tax on their earnings. It will affect their lifestyle, their \nearning capacity, their ability to buy a home, to send a child to \ncollege, to buy a car. This money will be spent under this bill.\n  One of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who is pretty \nrespected around here on financial matters I believe referred to this \nCLASS Act proposal as a Ponzi scheme. That is not too far off. \nBasically, we are taking the money from these folks who buy into this \ninsurance program today. We are spending it on something we want to \nspend it on as a Congress today, whether it is something worthwhile \nsuch as a road or education or our national defense, but we are \nspending it. We are leaving the people who paid that premium out to \nlunch unless 30 or 40 years from now, when they go into that situation \nwhere they need that insurance, the country is strong enough and our \nkids are making enough money to pay for the cost of that program. That \nis a real gamble for them, and that is called a Ponzi scheme, which is \nexactly what this is. This bill, this sense of the Senate, although a \ngood political document because it allows Members to wander around \ntheir districts and say: I voted to protect the CLASS Act dollars, I \nvoted that it not be accounted for under this bill, that was a sense of \nthe Senate. In actuality, it has no effect at all in that area.\n  All the money that comes into this, insurance money, is going to be \nspent somewhere else. And the CBO will still score this bill as taking \ncredit for that insurance under this program. It is Bernie Madoff \naccounting one more time under this bill. You would think after a while \npeople would get embarrassed--really, it would become embarrassing \nafter a while. When you match up 10 years of tax increases, 10 years of \nMedicare cuts, to 5 years of programmatic spending and claim you have a \nprogram that is fully paid for and is only an $840 billion program, \nwhen you know that if the program, the entire bill is fully phased in, \nit is $2.5 trillion in cost. It isn't $500 billion in Medicare cuts \nwhen this thing is fully phased in, it is $1 trillion in Medicare cuts. \nIt isn't $500 billion of tax increases in this bill and fee increases \non small businesses mostly or on provider groups, it is over $1 \ntrillion of increases. You would think after a while people would be \nembarrassed about the manipulation of numbers in that way. But that \ndoesn't seem to occur. Yet we get this proposal that says, OK, let's do \nit again. Let's claim we are doing something we are not doing. Let's \nclaim we are protecting the dollars that come in under this new CLASS \nAct proposal, assuming this program goes into place. Let's claim we are \nsegregating them somehow so the people who pay their hard-earned \ndollars and buy into this CLASS Act think they are getting something \nfor it, when in fact that will not happen at all, is not going to \nhappen at all. That money is going to be spent the day it comes in. In \nfact, it is already spent. We are already borrowing so much and \nspending so much in this government right now. We already have an \nobligation of debt that will spend this money.\n  I guess everybody can walk away feeling good about this amendment, \nbut substantively, it has no impact at all.\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. THUNE. My understanding is as to the CLASS Act, to make the \ndeficit situation with the enactment of this bill look better, they \nargue they are actually going to reduce the deficit as a result of this \nbill because of the revenues that come in early from the CLASS Act. I \nthink the Senator from New Hampshire has accurately described this. You \nget a short-term infusion of revenues and another long-term liability \nwhich is why the Senator from North Dakota described it as a Ponzi \nscheme of the highest order, something of which Bernie Madoff would be \nproud. I guess my question to the Senator would be, how does this \nimpact deficits in the long run and the debt in the long run? There was \na lot of discussion around here, probably more rhetoric than action, \nabout doing something to reduce the deficit and deal with the debt that \ncontinues to pile up and accumulate and at some point will be handed \noff to future generations. This Ponzi scheme, as it has been described \nby the Senator from North Dakota on\n\n[[Page S12303]]\n\nthe other side, in the form of the CLASS Act does seem in the short \nterm to understate the fiscal impact of the cost of this health bill \nwhich, as the Senator from New Hampshire has described, is $2.5 \ntrillion. But could the Senator elaborate on what happens in the \noutyears? You talked about the impact down the road when all the bills \ncome due. You get all the revenue in the short term, and then some time \ndown the road that revenue gets spent and you are stuck with all these \nliabilities. How is this going to affect deficits and debt in those \nyears in the future when our children and grandchildren will have to \npay for it?\n\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator has asked a very pointed and appropriate \nquestion, because the answer is pretty startling. The point I think \nmost people don't understand is that this money gets spent as it comes \nin. In other words, let's say over the next 30 years, younger people \npay into this new alleged insurance program, accurately described as a \nPonzi scheme. All that money that comes in will be spent on other \nactivities of the government and, therefore, the other activities of \ngovernment will be allowed to grow fairly dramatically. There will be a \nlot of money here. You are talking potentially $1 trillion over the \nnext 30 years.\n  Those expenditures, which will have occurred as a result of this \nmoney coming in, which will have nothing at all to do with paying for \nthe cost of the health care which these people who buy into this CLASS \nAct think they are getting--in other words, long-term care insurance, \nit has nothing to do with that--it will be on, as I said, education, \nroads, national defense, whatever we spend it on around here. Those \nexpenditures will be built into the baseline forever. They will presume \nthat there is going to be revenue to pay for them. What happens when \nthat generation that has bought into the CLASS Act starts to actually \nneed the money it is alleged it is going to get? Two things happen. The \nyounger generation is going to have to pay taxes to cover that cost \nbecause the money will not be there. There will be no money in the \nkitty, none, zero. There will be zero money in the kitty, the alleged \nkitty to pay for this insurance program. Second, ironically, the \ngovernment will have been grown by all the money that came in and was \nspent on new programs. So you are basically going to double down on the \ncost here.\n  Our children and our grandchildren are going to have to pay twice, \nnot only to pay for the long-term care which allegedly has been \npromised to these people under these insurance programs but also to pay \nfor all the new spending that will occur as a result of spending the \npremiums which were supposed to be saved for these programs. So they \nare going to get hit twice. The implications are, quite honestly, \nstaggering.\n  We already know we have a $38 trillion unfunded liability in \nMedicare. We know, when you combine Medicare, Medicaid, and Social \nSecurity, we have a $60 trillion unfunded liability. If you calculate \nin the cost of the CLASS Act on top of that, you are adding potentially \ntrillions more of unfunded liability, which will all have to be paid by \nour children and our grandchildren.\n  At the essence of this bill, there are a number of problems, but the \nproblem I find most inappropriate in the way we are doing this is we \nare creating a government which our kids cannot afford under any \ncircumstance. We are absolutely guaranteeing that our children are \ngoing to have a lower standard of living than we had because of the \nburden we are going to put on them as a result of these expansive new \nprograms, which we know cannot be afforded in the outyears.\n  We already know we cannot afford the government we have in the \noutyears. We already know the public debt is headed above 80 percent of \nGDP by 2019. So the Senator from South Dakota has touched on a core \nissue. What is the real cost of this? Well, it is extraordinary. As I \nsaid, it hits the next generation twice. First, they will have to pay \nthe taxes to pay for the program that was put on the books, which is \nallegedly there, plus they will have to pay to support all the programs \nwhich the money that came in was supposed to be preserved for.\n  Mr. THUNE. I say to my colleague from New Hampshire, it is the \nclassic definition of a Ponzi scheme, which, as I said, is how it has \nbeen described not just by the chairman of the Budget Committee from \nNorth Dakota but also by others who have looked at this. Editorial \npages in newspapers across this country have looked at this CLASS Act \nand said it does not add up, and it does not add up. I think Ponzi \nscheme is a good description.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has correctly outlined the impact this \nwill have on future generations, on deficits and debt, and spending and \nthe growth of government. That is why it is such a bad idea to include \nthis. The sense of the Senate resolution is simply that. It has no \nlegal binding effect on spending. It simply is sort of a political \nstatement that makes everybody feel better, but in the end it is going \nto be our kids who pay.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator from South Dakota touched on another \npoint. The sense of the Senate, basically, confirms the fundamental \nflaw of the CLASS Act. The fact that you would think a sense of the \nSenate is necessary pretty much proves that everybody around here \nunderstands there is a big game going on with the CLASS Act. The \nproblem is, of course, the sense of the Senate has no effect of law \nand, therefore, the problems the CLASS Act creates in the area of \nspending, the revenues that come in for the purpose of something other \nthan what the CLASS Act alleges people are buying when they pay for \nthat insurance, will still exist, and the CBO will still score the \nCLASS Act as benefiting the budget situation, when it should not be \nscored that way at all.\n  As I said, this is a nice resolution from a political standpoint, but \nsubstantively it has no effect on correcting the problems which the \nCLASS Act generate in the area of fiscal policy.\n  I understand there is a unanimous consent request that somebody \nwishes to offer. I was asked if I would listen to it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask the assistant leader, is he offering a unanimous \nconsent request? I will yield the floor for the purposes of a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \namendment in order be one offered by Senator Whitehouse of Rhode \nIsland, which is at the desk; that the other matter in order during \ntoday's session be a Hatch motion to commit regarding Medicare \nAdvantage; that no other amendments or motions to commit be in order \nduring today's session; and that the time in sequence following this \nunanimous consent request--I do not want to disadvantage the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, but if it is our turn on this side of the aisle, I \nwould ask that Senator Whitehouse first be recognized for the purpose \nof calling up his amendment and then I be recognized next, for no more \nthan 15 minutes; and at that point it is my understanding Senator Hatch \nhas asked for the floor for 1 hour on his motion.\n  If there are any other requests, I would be glad to add them to the \nunanimous consent request at this point.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, my only concern would be \nthat will take us past 7 o'clock, so you may want to adjust the time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am going to finish this as soon as I have gone through \nmy preliminary work here. I also ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 8 p.m., this evening, be equally divided and controlled between \nSenators Whitehouse and Hatch or their designees; that it be in order \nduring this time for Members to engage in colloquies, as long as those \nMembers entering into the colloquy remain on the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is it my understanding, then, the order of recognition \nwill be Senator Whitehouse, the assistant leader, and then Senator \nHatch?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2870 to Amendment No. 2786\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I now call up amendment No. 2870, an \namendment to protect the Social Security surplus and CLASS program \nsavings in this act and ask for the amendment's immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S12304]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Whitehouse] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2870 to amendment No. 2786.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To promote fiscal responsibility by protecting the Social \n        Security surplus and CLASS program savings in this Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE PROMOTING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Based on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, \n     this Act will reduce the Federal deficit between 2010 and \n     2019.\n       (2) CBO projects this Act will continue to reduce budget \n     deficits after 2019.\n       (3) Based on CBO estimates, this Act will extend the \n     solvency of the Medicare HI Trust Fund.\n       (4) This Act will increase the surplus in the Social \n     Security Trust Fund, which should be reserved to strengthen \n     the finances of Social Security.\n       (5) The initial net savings generated by the Community \n     Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) program are \n     necessary to ensure the long-term solvency of that program.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the additional surplus in the Social Security Trust \n     Fund generated by this Act should be reserved for Social \n     Security and not spent in this Act for other purposes; and\n       (2) the net savings generated by the CLASS program should \n     be reserved for the CLASS program and not spent in this Act \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I yield the floor to the distinguished \nassistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the profound \nand eloquent statements from my friend and colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Judd Gregg. He has frequently invoked the name of \nthe Ponzi family, though I am not personally familiar with them. I \nbelieve they have had some skeletons in their closet by virtue of the \nreferences that have been made. But I will tell him that what he said \nabout the CLASS Act is inaccurate.\n  I know that Senator, I see, is leaving the floor. I hope he does not \nmiss out on this conversation. But--\n  Mr. GREGG. I was just wondering if the Senator would yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the Ponzi family from Chicago?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, they are not. I think they are from New England--\nPatriots' fans.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from New Hampshire, if he would \nyield, if he is familiar with Doug Elmendorf and the Congressional \nBudget Office and the letter of November 18, 2009, to the majority \nleader, Harry Reid, in relation to the deficit impact of the CLASS Act.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the assistant leader asking me that question. \nRegrettably, I am not immediately familiar with it. I have probably \nseen it, although I apologize for not being immediately familiar with \nit. Therefore, I presume the assistant leader is going to remind me or \nat least reacquaint me with its terms. I would note the term ``Ponzi \nAct'' did not come from me. It came from the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would just say, it is unfortunate the Senator from New \nHampshire has not seen this letter because if he had had an \nopportunity--and it is impossible to read everything--if he had had an \nopportunity to read that letter, I do not think he would have made the \nspeeches he just made on the floor about the CLASS Act because the \nCongressional Budget Office tells us that in the first 10 years, the \nCLASS Act will reduce the Federal budget deficit by $72.5 billion; in \nthe second 10 years by a substantial amount, though somewhat less than \n$72.5 billion; and in the third 10 years--30 years out--it is \nanticipated it will add to the deficit, but, in the words of the letter \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office, by a very small amount over that \nnext decade.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator would allow me to comment on that one \npoint?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be more than happy to allow that.\n  Mr. GREGG. I fully agree with that analysis. The first 30 years of \nthe CLASS Act will generate revenues. It will add to the Federal \nTreasury and will--and that was the purpose of my discussion; that is \nthe point I made--during the first 30 years of this proposal, younger \npeople will be paying in and very few people will be taking out because \nthey will not have yet qualified for the insurance because they will \nnot be old enough to go into assisted living.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reclaiming the floor, I would just say, if I understand \nwhat the Senator said, he is concerned that in the year 2040, this \nprogram may not work as effectively as we had hoped it would work. I \ntrust in the wisdom of future Members of the Senate and the House, if \nthat is necessary, to modify the program.\n  But it certainly is worthwhile for us to at least reflect on what \nthis program is. It is a voluntary, self-funded insurance fund for \nlong-term care for American citizens. It was one of the visions of \nSenator Kennedy as part of health care reform, understanding we are \nliving longer and many times need help in our late years in life and it \ncan be expensive and deplete a family's savings. Senator Kennedy said: \nLet's try to put together a voluntary program where you can pay in and \nhave, in fact, long-term care insurance available to you, if you need \nit.\n  The fact that this program is virtually solvent for 30 straight years \nis an indication of the wisdom of that idea and the way it is planned.\n  I might add one other thing. We just finished a motion to commit on \nthe floor relative to Medicare, and many of us argued that the bill \nbefore us, the bill that represents health care reform in this debate, \nprotects Medicare and guarantees the basic benefits of Medicare. Those \non the other side of the aisle protested and said: No, it does not.\n  Well, then, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado offered an amendment \nwhich said, pointblank and clearly, nothing in this bill will, in any \nway, diminish guaranteed Medicare benefits, and a surplus generated \nhere will be to give a longer life to the existing Medicare Program. \nThe Bennet of Colorado amendment passed 100 to nothing, so not only \ndoes the bill originally protect Medicare, the Bennet amendment \nrepeated that, and all the Republicans voted for it. Yet they continue \nto come to the floor and say: We do not believe what we voted for. We \nbelieve this bill is going to hurt Medicare.\n  The same thing is true with the CLASS Act because Senator Whitehouse, \nwho was on the floor momentarily, came forward and said: I will put it \nin writing. We are going to put it in writing that the surplus in the \nCLASS Act program cannot be used for other purposes and has to be saved \nand used for the purposes stated here for long-term care insurance. I \nthink the Whitehouse amendment is likely to get another 100 votes.\n  So every time we address a concern from the Republican side of the \naisle, and say the bill addresses that concern or a separate amendment \naddresses that concern, they protest: It is not enough. We need more. I \nthink they protest too much.\n  I would also say I am troubled today, as I have been for several \nweeks, by the position taken from the Republican side of the aisle \nabout health care reform. For about 13 or 14 days, this bill, in its \nentirety, has been available to the American people. You can find it by \nGoogling ``Senate Democrats'' and it will direct you to our Web site \nand you can click on this bill, H.R. 3590, and read it, page after \npage--all 2,074 pages of it. That is the way it should be.\n  There was a lot of angst and worry last August in townhall meetings: \nWell, are you going to get this bill sneaked by us? Are we going to get \na chance to read it? Everybody has a chance to read it. But then I \nwould recommend to those who are searching the Internet to read health \ncare reform bills that if you want to find the Republican health care \nreform bill, look for ``Senate Republicans'' and go to their Web site \nand you will be able to click on ``health care reform bill'' and you \nwill find the Democratic health care reform bill because, \nunfortunately, there is no Republican health care reform bill. They \nhave not offered one. They have had a year to prepare\n\n[[Page S12305]]\n\nit. They have had plenty of ideas they have expressed on the floor. \nThey have been critical of our efforts. They have offered literally \nhundreds of amendments in committee, and yet they cannot come up with a \nbill.\n  It leads you to conclude this is not an easy task. It is not easy at \nall. It certainly is not easy to produce a bill such as this one, the \nDemocratic bill, which generates, over the first 10 years, a $130 \nbillion Federal surplus in our Treasury. This bill adds more in terms \nof surplus and deficit reduction than any bill in the history of the \nSenate. In the second 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office says \nthere will be another $650 billion in savings on our deficit.\n  So for those who argue if we pass this bill we are going deeper in \ndebt, they ignore the Congressional Budget Office, that referee that \ntakes a look at all the bills and tells us that over the span of 20 \nyears, we are going to reduce our deficit by some $700 billion or $800 \nbillion, just by virtue of this bill. Republicans have been unable to \nproduce a bill that reduces the deficit, when it comes to health care, \nby a penny. They come here and criticize what we have done, but they \ncan't produce a bill. All the great legislative minds on their side of \nthe aisle, and we have been waiting patiently for them to produce a \nhealth care reform bill. They can't or they don't want to. Maybe they \nlike the current health care system. Maybe they think this is the way \nAmerica should be.\n\n  Well, many of us don't believe that, and a lot of Americans don't \neither. There are a lot of good parts of our system we want to protect, \nbut there are many parts that need to be changed. We need to make \nhealth care and health insurance more affordable for families and \nindividuals and businesses. This bill does.\n  We just had another report from the Congressional Budget Office that \nsaid yes, the cost of premiums will be coming down for many Americans \nas a result of this bill. We also understand that some 50 million \nAmericans don't have health insurance at all. This bill will reach the \nhighest level of protection for health insurance in the history of the \nUnited States. Ninety-four percent of people in this country will have \nthe peace of mind and security of health insurance--a dramatic \nincrease. The Republicans have been unable to come up with any proposal \nthat moves us toward more coverage for people who don't have health \ninsurance.\n  This bill also has many provisions to finally give consumers across \nAmerica a chance to fight back when the insurance companies say no, and \nthey do all the time. People who need critical surgical procedures and \nmedicines, people who need the kind of care their doctors recommend end \nup fighting with the clerk at an insurance company. This bill, the \nDemocratic health care reform bill, gives these families a fighting \nchance against these health insurance companies. I have yet to see the \nfirst bill coming from the Republican side of the aisle in the course \nof this debate that would give our families a chance against these \nhealth insurance companies.\n  I wish to also say when I finish speaking, and we finish on this side \nof the aisle, the Senator from Utah will come and speak. I understand \nit is the Medicare Advantage Program he will speak to. Now, the \nprevious motion to commit by Senator McCain of Arizona said: Send this \nbill back and make sure you take out any reference to savings in the \nMedicare Advantage Program. That was defeated. The vote was 42 to 58. \nThere were two Democrats who joined the Republicans. They needed 60 \nvotes; it didn't make it. I take it the Senator from Utah may offer \nanother motion to commit relative to Medicare Advantage. I expect it to \nhave the same fate, but he has his chance to argue his point of view, \nand he may be persuasive to more Members on this side of the aisle. \nUnfortunately, although we are good, close friends, and I bask in his \nwisdom on a daily basis, he is not going to change my mind on this \nissue because the Medicare Advantage Program is a program that needs to \nbe changed.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about this program. We started years ago \nwith the health insurance industry telling us: Government cannot do a \ngood job when it comes to insurance. Let us show you how private health \ninsurance companies can sell a Medicare policy more cheaply than the \ngovernment. And we invited them to do it.\n  Over the course of the years, some of them did. They showed some \nsavings, and they demonstrated to us they could provide Medicare at a \ncost lower than the government. But then things changed, and the health \ninsurance companies kept coming back and saying: Well, we actually need \nmore money now to provide the same benefits in Medicare that the \ngovernment provides.\n  At last count, the Medicare Advantage Program costs 14 percent more \nto provide the same Medicare benefits as the government program. So \nthese leaders in the private sector who were going to teach us a lesson \nabout how to sell insurance ended up failing their own lesson plan, and \nnow this Medicare Advantage Program has turned out to be a flatout \nsubsidy to the health insurance industry--$170 billion over 10 years. \nIn other words, the Medicare Program is paying more for Medicare than \nwhat it has to pay so it can subsidize health insurance companies which \nare turning multimillion-dollar profits and giving bonuses to their \nCEOs.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle think we need to preserve this; \nthat we need to preserve this subsidy, make sure we protect the profits \nof the health insurance companies, and we need to protect Medicare \nAdvantage. Well, as Senator Dodd has said so frequently on the Senate \nfloor, Medicare Advantage is neither Medicare nor an advantage.\n  I believe, and most agree, it is time for this party to end. These \nprivate health insurance companies didn't keep their word, didn't keep \ntheir promise, and because of that we are in a situation--a \npredicament--where we are asking other people covered by Medicare to \nsubsidize the profits of these private health insurance companies. What \ndoes it cost every Medicare recipient in America to provide this \nsubsidy and profits to these private health insurance companies under \nMedicare Advantage? Ninety dollars a year, on average.\n  So those who are defending the Medicare Advantage Program as we \ncurrently know it and don't support the reforms in this bill are also \nsupporting a $90 annual tax on Medicare recipients. My fiscally \nconservative Republican friends who run against taxes every chance they \nhave should reflect on the fact that they are protecting a tax on \nMedicare recipients. That, to me, is indefensible.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the assistant majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I just wanted to ask the distinguished assistant \nmajority leader to yield for a question through the Chair. Since the \ndistinguished assistant majority leader was here at the time, and I am \nnewer to this body and was not here at the time when the Medicare \nAdvantage Program was originally proposed, I wonder if the \ndistinguished assistant majority leader would remind us of what the \npromises and assertions were that were made by the private insurance \nindustry at that time as they sought this foothold to get their hands \non this Medicare population.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It was very basic, I would say to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland through the Chair. They just said: Now, listen. When it comes to \ninsurance, the government never gets it right. The bureaucrats who work \nfor the government, those Federal employees, don't get it right. We do \nthis for a living. We can show you how to provide Medicare benefits and \nsave money. So, please, would you just step aside? The private health \ninsurance companies are going to demonstrate to you how much money we \ncan save.\n  Initially, there were some savings; I will say that in fairness. But \nover the years, they got greedy, and their greediness led in most \nrecent times to--I think in 2003, if I am not mistaken, with the \nMedicare prescription drug program, when they came in and these same \nprivate health insurance companies said: Now we really need subsidies \nto keep offering our wonderful programs, now they tell us they are \ncharging 14 percent more than basic Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has used 15 minutes.\n\n[[Page S12306]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank Senator Durbin for his recollection and Senator \nWhitehouse for his question and the comments and understanding of this. \nMy recollection was back 10 years ago when it passed it was the \ninsurance companies that said: We will do it 5 percent cheaper. We will \nsave taxpayers 5 percent. But as soon as they did that, as soon as \nPresident Bush was elected in 2000, I remember they started lobbying \nCongress for more insurance subsidies. It sort of peaked in 2003 with \nthe prescription drug deal giveaway where the drug companies and the \ninsurance companies both got huge government subsidies. They formed the \ndoughnut hole, and seniors ended up paying a lot more so the drug and \ninsurance companies could get subsidies. Then that is when the tax was \nincreased, that $90 tax, if I recall.\n\n  Am I right about that, that originally it was actually a good thing \nfor taxpayers, but then during the Bush years the insurance company \nlobby was able to increase that tax on the other 80 or 85 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries, the people who were in what was called fee for \nservice, who would go to the doctor, go to the hospital and submit to \nMedicare and not do it through a private insurance company? Is that \nwhat has happened?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Ohio that is exactly what \nhappened because what we have is that in order to pay for the subsidy, \nthe private health insurance companies that are selling Medicare \nAdvantage, they had to take the money out of the Medicare system, which \nmeant less money for everybody else. It translated into $90 a year more \nfor every Medicare recipient to pay for the subsidy, for the private \nhealth insurance companies that are protected by Medicare Advantage.\n  Mr. BROWN. If the Senator from Illinois would yield, so these \nsubsidies then went directly to the insurance companies and then the \ninsurance companies--they had to live under the Medicare laws, of \ncourse--but these insurance companies then began to insure generally \nsome healthier people so they could make more money, right?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right.\n  Mr. BROWN. In those days, the insurance companies--Senator Whitehouse \nhas talked often about this, as has Senator Harkin who is standing here \nnow too--that the insurance companies' business model has been to hire \na lot of bureaucrats. They say they are more efficient than Medicare, \nbut surely they are not. Their administrative costs are 15 percent and \nMedicare is 5 percent. But they hire all of these bureaucrats to keep \npeople from buying policies if they are sick--a preexisting condition--\nand then they hire a second group of bureaucrats on the other end to \nmake sure those people who submit bills for their health care, their \nclaims, that 30 percent of them are initially denied. So they hire \nbureaucrats on both ends to restrict care, add a lot of administrative \ncosts.\n  Medicare, I don't think, prohibits people for a preexisting \ncondition, right? They don't do anything like that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. No. I would say to the Senator from Ohio the difference \nis obvious. With Medicare, anyone who shows up age 65 is eligible for \ncoverage, no questions asked, other than your age and whether you have \ncontributed over the course of your lifetime. These health insurance \ncompanies cherry-pick the healthiest people they can, then try to deny \ncoverage where they can as well, and that is how they make their \nprofits.\n  Mr. BROWN. They are pretty good at it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So good at it that they are one of the most profitable \nsectors in the American economy, and virtually everybody knows somebody \nthey work with or someone in their family who has had a bad experience \nwith a health insurance company in America. That is the reality we are \nfacing today.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, if I could ask the Senator to yield \nfor a question, it would appear, then, that not only is there this \nsubsidy that goes to the private insurance industry, funded by a tax on \nall other Medicare recipients, but those private insurance companies \nare actually doing their level best to try to pick out a \ndisproportionately healthy Medicare-eligible population, so what we end \nup doing is not only paying more for Medicare Advantage but also for a \nhealthier population. So it is a double subsidy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Make it a triple whammy because the third impact, of \ncourse, is that the healthier people are not part of Medicare. Those \nleft in Medicare are sicker and more expensive, so the government-run \nprogram ends up being more expensive because those private health \ninsurance companies cherry-pick out the healthiest people they can \nfind.\n  There are those who want to defend Medicare Advantage who think it is \ngreat that we would pay $170 billion in subsidies to these companies \nover a 10-year period of time. This bill moves us away from that and \nsays if these private health insurance companies can't basically \ncompete and match what government Medicare offers, then it is time for \nthem to get out of the business and get out of the way. I don't see why \nin the world we are arguing about a subsidy for private health \ninsurance companies when they already make so much money.\n  So I would at this point yield the floor. I know Senator Hatch has \nasked for an hour to speak on his motion. I believe it is a motion to \ncommit. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague who has \nbeen making these extraordinary arguments on the Senate floor. I will \nspend a little bit of time chatting about those in just a minute.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send a motion to commit with instructions \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] moves to commit H.R. 3590 \n     to the Committee on Finance with instructions to report the \n     same back to the Senate with changes that do not include \n     cuts in payments to Medicare Advantage plans totaling \n     -$120 billion.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I always enjoy my colleague from Illinois. \nHe is as good a populist speaker as we have in the Senate. No matter \nwhat comes up, he can talk about it.\n  I get a big kick out of him saying there are not any Republican \nbills. Well, there are six of them. You can get a hold of those bills. \nThe problem is, we only have 40 votes, and we know it.\n  The fact is, the more I thought about it, I thought to myself, where \nare the printed bills that we always have on our desks? Where is the \nDemocratic printed bill? I am sure it is somewhere. Usually when we \ndebate any bill on this floor, we have the bill printed and put on our \ndesks. Maybe it has been printed, but it isn't on our desks, and I \nthink there is a good reason for it. It is 2,074 pages long. It is \nenough to make you barf.\n  When you stop and think about it, why do we need 2,074 pages when 85 \npercent of persons basically like the health insurance they have? The \nother 15 percent, if you break it down, you get down to about 7 million \nto 15 million people who need our help.\n  By the time you knock off those who work for a company that provides \nhealth insurance but they don't choose to take it because they would \nrather have the money or you take the approximately 11 million people \nwho qualify for CHIP, the Child Health Insurance Program, or Medicaid, \nbut aren't enrolled; or you take those who earn over $75,000 a year and \njust won't buy it but can afford it, or you take those undocumented \nworkers or others who are legal aliens who for some reason do not have \ncoverage, you get down to about 15 million people, at most. We can \nsubsidize them, and we wouldn't have to throw our whole system out into \nthe trash can--a system that 85 percent of the American people \nbasically thinks is working relatively well for them.\n\n  It seems crazy to me. Why are we doing that? Fifty percent of the \npeople in this country basically don't pay\n\n[[Page S12307]]\n\nFederal income taxes as we sit here. The upper 50 percent pay 97 \npercent of all income taxes. The bottom 50 percent pay about 3 or 4 \npercent, at the very most. Think about that. What are we going to do--\ngo to 60 percent so that one side can keep the numbers here so they can \nstay in majority control? Are we going to get people to be more \nresponsible for their own health care?\n  On top of it all, they want a government plan. Why do they want that? \nMedicare is the government plan. For all intents and purposes, it is \nvery well-intentioned, but it has $38 trillion in unfunded liabilities \nas we sit here--mainly because the Federal Government is running it. If \nthe State governments ran it and we had 50 State laboratories, I doubt \nseriously we would be in this terrible fix. We are saddling our \nchildren and grandchildren and great-grandchildren with tremendous \ndebt. What is their answer? We are going to take $464 billion--almost \n$500 billion--out of Medicare, and we are going to put it towards \nmaking our health plan deficit neutral.\n  They have used every accounting and budgetary gimmick they can to get \nthis plan below $1 trillion, because they charge taxes from the day it \nis passed, but the plan is not implemented for 4 years--until 2014. \nThat way, they can try to indicate to the American people that they are \nbringing the cost of the bill in at under $1 trillion. That is a lot of \nmoney because today we are spending $2.4 trillion on health care, run \nprimarily by the Federal Government--two-thirds of which is run by the \nFederal Government. I might add that there are estimates that $1.2 \ntrillion of that $2.4 trillion is wasted money. Yet we are going to add \nanother $2.5 trillion, which is what this bill really costs if you \nextrapolate it out over 10 years and not just from 2014 to 2020. We are \ngoing to spend another $2.5 trillion, if you extrapolate it out. No \nwonder the American people are so up in arms. They ought to be. We are \ngoing to be spending $5 trillion on health care if my friends are \nsuccessful in what they are doing. They know we have 40 votes, at most.\n  I have been here a long time. Senator Lugar and I are the most senior \nRepublicans on the floor of the Senate. We came at the same time. I \nhave to say that, having been here all these years, we have never \nreally had a fiscally conservative majority in the Senate, except \nthrough great Presidential leadership--Reagan, Bush 1, even President \nClinton on occasion, and Bush 2. We have always had enough liberals on \nour side to go with the liberal Democrats so we have never really had a \nfiscally conservative majority. It would take 60 votes to get this \ncountry under control, from a spending standpoint.\n  I appreciate the comments of my friend from Illinois about Medicare \nAdvantage, but he is just plain wrong. Medicare Advantage has made a \ntremendous difference in the lives of almost 11 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries. He failed to mention that the program has given choice \nto every Medicare beneficiary across the country, regardless of where \nthey live. Medicare Advantage saves beneficiaries' dollars. Seniors \nhave lower copayments, cost sharing, and deductibles through Medicare \nAdvantage Programs. That is why many lower income seniors participate \nin the Medicare Advantage Program. Up to 25 percent of all seniors \nparticipate. Why? Because it works for them.\n  I was on the Medicare modernization conference committee. We came up \nwith it because beneficiaries living in rural America did not have \naccess to Medicare HMO plans before Medicare Advantage was created. If \nmy friends will take the time to listen to my statement on Medicare \nAdvantage, I believe they will find it insightful and it will rebut \nmost everything they are saying.\n  Mr. President, the motion I just sent to the desk is to commit the \nReid health care bill to the Finance Committee in order to eliminate \nthe Medicare Advantage cuts of $120 billion contained in this \nlegislation.\n  I know I mentioned this point over and over again, but it bears \nrepeating. Throughout the health care debate, we have heard the \nPresident say he is not going to mess with Medicare. Unfortunately, \nthat is not the case with the Reid bill we are currently considering. \nTo be clear, the Reid bill cuts Medicare by $465 billion to fund a new \ngovernment program. Unfortunately, our seniors and the disabled will \nsuffer the consequences as a result of these reductions.\n  Throughout my Senate service, I have fought to strengthen, preserve, \nand protect Medicare. I think most Republicans have, in spite of what \nmy colleagues say on the other side. Unless we are pouring money down \nthe drain, they do not believe we are doing anything. Medicare is \nalready in trouble today. The program faces serious challenges in the \nfuture. The Medicare trust fund will be insolvent by 2017. The program \nhas more than $37 trillion in unfunded liability. The Reid bill will \nmake this situation much worse.\n  Look at the cuts to Medicare. Hospitals, cut $134.7 billion in this \nbill. Where are they going to get that money? How are we going to keep \nhospitals going in the future? Hospices, cut $7.7 billion. Nursing \nhomes, cut $14.6 billion. I have been to all kinds of nursing homes in \nthis country, and they have a rough time. We are going to take over $14 \nbillion from nursing homes, and they are critical to our senior \ncitizens. For Medicare Advantage, $120 billion is coming out of the \nprogram. Home health agencies, $4.1 billion. So there is $135 billion \nfrom hospitals, $120 billion from Medicare Advantage, about $15 billion \nfrom nursing homes, more than $40 billion from home health care \nagencies, and close to $8 billion from hospice providers.\n  These cuts will threaten beneficiaries' access to care as Medicare \nproviders find it more and more challenging to provide health services \nto Medicare patients. And what is their argument? They say it is the \nawful insurance companies causing these problems. No, it is the awful \nFederal Government causing these troubles. It is the awful bureaucracy \nand the awful Federal Government that dominates all of our lives. If \nthis bill passes, ``Katy, bar the door.'' Our lives will be completely \ncontrolled by the Federal Government on one-sixth of the American \neconomy.\n  Today, I want to focus my comments on the Medicare Advantage Program. \nIt has been totally distorted by my colleagues, in my opinion--I am \nsure not intentionally. They would never do that.\n  By the way, here is the bill. This is not the printed version; this \nis the bill. It is no small bill. It is one of the largest I have seen \nin my time here.\n  Mr. President, I am strongly opposed to the deep cuts--$120 billion \nover 10 years--that the Reid bill would impose on the benefits of \nalmost 11 million Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare beneficiaries who \ncurrently are enrolled in the Medicare Advantage Program.\n  While they knock Medicare Advantage, they are pushing people toward \nthe AARP Medigap insurance program. AARP makes hundreds of millions and \nbillions of dollars off senior citizens. It is small wonder that AARP \nsupports this monstrosity of a bill. It is in their best financial \ninterest.\n  As we consider the serious threat these cuts pose to seniors, I want \nto point out that during the Finance Committee markup this fall, we saw \nSenator Bill Nelson from Florida, and other Democrats, work to \npartially mitigate the impact of the bill's Medicare Advantage funding \ncuts. This effort, while taking very small steps, clearly demonstrated \nthat a number of our Democratic colleagues recognize the value offered \nby Medicare Advantage plans and the danger of enacting the deep cuts \nproposed by the pending bill. Unfortunately, only a limited number of \nStates would benefit from the Nelson amendment, so most Medicare \nAdvantage beneficiaries are not protected from the cuts. But they \nrecognize how important this program is.\n  I also recall that 6 years ago, when Congress enacted the Medicare \nModernization Act, we intentionally provided new funding to stabilize \nthe Medicare health plan program. This was one of the few issues on \nwhich there was strong bipartisan agreement during the 2003 Medicare \ndebate. I was here. I was on the conference committee. I happened to \nbring about that Medicare Modernization Act. In fact, in June 2003, \nseveral of our colleagues, including the Senator from New York and \nSenator Kerry from Massachusetts--great Democrats--offered a bipartisan \namendment on the Senate floor to provide additional funding for \nbenefits under the Medicare Advantage Program. Why would they do that \nif it\n\n[[Page S12308]]\n\nis such a lousy program? Now, all of a sudden, it is a lousy program \nbecause they want the money to be used for a massive, new government-\nrun program. Back then, they wanted additional money for Medicare \nAdvantage, recognizing how important the program was.\n  Later that year, as the Medicare conference committee completed its \ndeliberations, a bipartisan group of 18 Senators signed a letter urging \nthe conferees to provide a meaningful increase in Medicare Advantage \nfunding. This letter was signed by a diverse group of colleagues, \nincluding Democratic Senators such as Dianne Feinstein from California, \nChristopher Dodd from Connecticut, Ron Wyden from Oregon, Frank \nLautenberg from New Jersey, Patty Murray from Washington, Arlen Specter \nfrom Pennsylvania, Mary Landrieu from Louisiana, and Maria Cantwell, \njust to mention a few. It was bipartisan. They recognized how important \nthis program was, and they recognized we were trying to solve major \nproblems for people, especially in rural areas.\n  I think it would be worthwhile to reflect back on the 2003 debate and \nremember the reasons this issue inspired such strong bipartisan \nconsensus. You don't hear it at all from that side at all--after the \nprogram has proven its efficacy and that it works. We supported the \nMedicare Advantage plan 6 years ago. It was the right thing to do for \nbeneficiaries. The same logic holds true today.\n  We owe it to the beneficiaries to provide a strong, adequately funded \nprogram that provides them with high-quality health care choices. Every \nMedicare beneficiary can go into Medicare Advantage if they desire, \nunder current circumstances.\n  During the Finance Committee's consideration of the Baucus health \nbill, I offered an amendment to protect extra benefits currently \nenjoyed by Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. Unfortunately, the \namendment was defeated. In other words, the President's pledge assuring \nAmericans they would not lose their benefits was not met by either the \nFinance Committee bill or the Reid bill currently being considered by \nthe Senate.\n  Here is how supporters of the Finance bill justified the Medicare \nAdvantage reduction: They argued that the extra benefits that would be \ncut, such as vision care and dental care for these poor people, reduced \nhospital deductibles, lower copayments and premiums, were not statutory \nbenefits. They claim they were not statutory benefits offered in the \nMedicare fee-for-service program.\n  Therefore, those extra benefits did not count, although a quarter of \nthe Medicare beneficiaries were getting them from Medicare. But try \ntelling them that they did not count to a Medicare Advantage enrollee \nwho has been receiving these additional benefits.\n  I want to talk about the differences between fee-for-service Medicare \nand Medicare Advantage. Because of the gaps in traditional Medicare, it \nis incumbent for most beneficiaries to buy a Medigap policy which wraps \naround the Medicare benefit. Guess who provides these Medicare \npolicies, among others, but really in a big way. Why, the AARP.\n  On average, these policies cost a couple hundred dollars a month. In \ncomparison, the average monthly premium in a Medicare Advantage plan is \n$54 in 2009. These plans also fill in the coverage gaps of Medicare.\n  Moreover, almost half of all Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are in \nplans that charge no monthly premium. Let me say that again. If you \nhave to buy a Medigap policy for traditional fee-for-service Medicare, \nyou will have to buy a policy that costs a few hundred dollars a month \ncompared to Medicare Advantage plans which cost beneficiaries on \naverage $54 a month in 2009. This is why several studies have shown \nthat Medicare Advantage is one of the most popular choices for the low-\nincome elderly because they do not have to buy a Medigap policy.\n  This week we have had Members on the other side of the aisle claim \nthat Medicare Advantage is not part of Medicare. That is how far they \nhave gone to distort the record. Again, I hope nobody was doing that \nintentionally and that it is a lack of knowledge about the Medicare \nprogram. Keep in mind, we have Members on the other side of the aisle \nwho claim Medicare Advantage is not part of Medicare. It is absolutely \nunbelievable. I invite every Member making this claim to turn to page \n50 of the 2010 Medicare handbook. It expressly says:\n\n       A Medicare Advantage Plan . . . is another health coverage \n     choice you may have as part of Medicare.\n\n  That argument has been not only fallacious but should never have been \nmade. The bottom line is simple. If you are cutting Medicare Advantage \nbenefits, you are cutting Medicare. I raised this point yesterday, but \nI want to raise it again.\n  Yesterday the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, my friend \nSenator Dodd, mentioned that the bureaucrat-controlled Medicare \ncommission will not cut benefits in Part A and Part B. Once again, my \nfriends on the other side are only telling you half the story. So much \nfor transparency. On page 1,005 of this bill I can hardly lift, it \nstates in plain English:\n\n       . . . include recommendations to reduce Medicare payments \n     under C and D.\n\n  Let me translate that in English for everybody. That means the \ncommission can cut Medicare Advantage, which is Medicare Part C, and \nthe Medicare prescription drug benefit which is Medicare Part D.\n  Making sure that we take enough time to discuss a 2,074-page bill \nthat will affect every American life and every American business is the \nsacred duty of every Senator in this Chamber. We must take the time to \nfully discuss this bill, and it is going to take some time, believe me.\n  I have heard several Members from the other side of the aisle \ncharacterize the Medicare Advantage Program as a giveaway to the \ninsurance industry. Let me say a few words about the creation of \nMedicare Advantage.\n  I served, as I said, as a member of the House-Senate conference \ncommittee which wrote the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. So did \nthe distinguished Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus. Among other things, \nthis law created the Medicare Advantage Program. When conference \ncommittee members were negotiating the conference report, several of us \ninsisted that the Medicare Advantage Program was necessary in order to \nprovide health care coverage choices to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  At that time, there were many parts of the country where Medicare \nbeneficiaries did not have adequate choices in coverage. In fact, the \nonly choice offered to them was traditional fee-for-service Medicare, a \none-size-fits-all government-run health program, which I might add, did \nnot work well. By creating the Medicare Advantage Program, we provided \nbeneficiaries with choice in coverage and then empowered them to make \ntheir own health care decisions as opposed to the Federal Government. \nWe gave them the empowerment to make their own decisions. That is \nunique around here. There will not be any empowerment if this bill \npasses. In fact, there are almost 2,000 decisions that the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services has the authority to make. You might like the \ncurrent Health and Human Services Secretary today, but what if a good \nconservative gets in that position? Of course, it is very difficult \nbecause a good conservative would be filibustered.\n  Today every Medicare beneficiary may choose from several health plans \nbecause of what we did through the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. \nWe should have learned our lessons from legislative changes made in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 when we cut payments for Medicare HMOs. \nThese plans collapsed, especially in rural areas, because Washington--\nour wonderful people here in Washington--decided to set artificially \nlow payment rates. In fact, in Utah, all Medicare HMOs eventually \nceased operations because they were operating in the red.\n  I fear history could repeat itself if we are not careful. During the \nMedicare Modernization Act conference, we fixed the problem. We \nincreased reimbursement rates so that all Medicare beneficiaries, \nregardless of where they live, be it in Fillmore, UT, or New York City, \nhad choice in coverage. Again, we did not want beneficiaries stuck with \na one-size-fits-all government plan which, by the way, this monstrosity \nis.\n  Today Medicare Advantage works. Every Medicare beneficiary has access \nto a Medicare Advantage plan if they\n\n[[Page S12309]]\n\nso choose. One-quarter of them have so chosen, and it has worked \namazingly well. Close to 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries \nparticipating in the program are satisfied with their health coverage, \nbut that could all change should this health care reform legislation \ncurrently being considered become law. Choice in coverage has made a \ndifference in the lives of more than 10 million Americans nationwide. \nBeneficiaries in every State have benefitted from Medicare Advantage.\n  Let me show you some things here. Since this is very difficult to \nread on television, let me go through all these States. These charts \nshow the number of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in each state.\n  Alabama has 181,304 people on Medicare Advantage; Alaska, 462; \nArizona, 329,157; Arkansas, 70,137; California, 1,606,193; Colorado \n198,521; Connecticut, 94,181; Delaware, 6,661; the District of \nColumbia, 7,976. How about Florida--946,836, almost 1 million people on \nMedicare Advantage. Good reason. It works. Georgia, 176,090; Hawaii, \n79,386; Idaho, 60,676; Illinois, 176,395; Indiana, 148,174; Iowa, \n63,902 people enrolled in Medicare Advantage.\n  Let's proceed further. Kansas, 34,867 people enrolled in Medicare \nAdvantage; Kentucky, 110,814; Louisiana, 151,954; Maine, 26,984; \nMaryland, 56,812; Massachusetts, 199,727; Michigan, 406,124; Minnesota, \n284,101; Mississippi, 44,772; Missouri, 195,036; Montana, 27,592; \nNebraska, 30,571; Nevada, 104,043; New Hampshire, 13,200; New Jersey, \n156,607; New Mexico, 73,567; look at New York, 853,387; North Carolina, \n251,738 people enrolled in Medicare Advantage who love the program; \nNorth Dakota, 7,633; Ohio, 499,819. Gee whiz, that is a lot of people \nwho are satisfied with Medicare Advantage. Oklahoma, 84,980; Oregon, \none of the most liberal States in the Union, 249,993; Pennsylvania, \n864,040; Puerto Rico, even 400,991; Rhode Island, 65,108; South \nCarolina, 110,949--these are senior citizens--South Dakota, 8,973; \nTennessee, 233,024; Texas, 532,242; my own State of Utah, 85,585; \nVermont, only 3,966, but 3,000 people, 4,000 people in Vermont; \nVirginia, 151,942; Washington, 225,918; West Virginia, 88,027; \nWisconsin, 243,443; and Wyoming, 3,942.\n  These are people who benefit from Medicare Advantage who would not \nlike to lose their current health coverage.\n  This choice in coverage has made a difference in the lives of more \nthan almost 11 million people, 11 million individuals nationwide and \nfamilies who benefit from this program. The extra benefits I mentioned \nearlier are being portrayed as gym memberships as opposed to lower \npremiums, copayments, and deductibles.\n  Let me read some letters from my constituents. These are real lives \nbeing affected by the cuts contemplated in this bill. You should see \nsome of the beautiful handwriting. Some of it is very shaky but \nbeautiful, to me anyway.\n  From Cedar City, UT:\n\n       Senator Hatch, I am writing you to request your help in \n     preserving our Medicare Advantage plans from being cut.\n       My Medicare Advantage plan provides me with benefits and \n     savings that traditional Medicare did not provide.\n       I like my plan very much. It allows me my choice of \n     Doctors, Hospitals and various specialists if needed.\n       I do not want to see a single national Health Care Plan.\n       I do not want cuts in Medicare Advantage Programs.\n       Senator Hatch, when you go to Washington, DC, please do not \n     cut our Medicare Advantage Programs.\n       Vote to maintain our present system. Thank you for your \n     service.\n       Sincerely. P.S.--I speak for my husband, too.\n\n  I bet.\n  Here is another one:\n\n       Honorable Senator Hatch: Please do not vote for any bill \n     which would compromise my Medicare Advantage plan. I am 92 \n     years old, and of necessity worked until I was 87, and have \n     taken pride in being self supporting. I had to retire six and \n     a half years ago because of pancreatic cancer. Amazingly, I \n     recovered and live an active, useful life. My Medicare \n     Advantage plan makes the difference between living with self \n     respect and having to depend on others. Once again, I beg of \n     you--don't deprive me of my self respect. Let me keep my \n     Medicare Advantage plan. Sincerely.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       Dear Senator, we understand our President and Congress \n     wants to eliminate the Medicare Advantage program for the \n     elderly.\n       We were both on Blue Cross/Blue Shield program for several \n     years, costing us hundreds of dollars each year. Since we \n     joined the Medicare Advantage program it provides dental, \n     fitness, vision, and full medical coverage. The cost of this \n     program has saved us hundreds of dollars.\n       Please don't let them take this program from the elderly \n     who are on low fixed incomes and will cause us further \n     problems. We ask you for your support to save the Medicare \n     Advantage program.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       Dear Senator Hatch, it has again been brought to my \n     attention that the Administration is seriously considering \n     cutting the funding to the Medicare Advantage program. I \n     would like to encourage you to oppose these funding cuts \n     because of the negative repercussions seniors and those with \n     disabilities will suffer if they lose a program due to \n     insufficient funding.\n       [Medicare Advantage] health plans give individuals the \n     freedom to afford the care they need. The premiums and out-\n     of-pocket costs are allowing recipients to save money on \n     regular doctor visits as well as medication. These savings \n     are essential for someone on a low fixed income like many of \n     the individuals who participate in the program.\n       If Congress continues to cut the [Medicare Advantage] \n     program, beneficiaries will not only be forced to pay higher \n     premiums and higher out of pocket costs but will also lose \n     the unique benefits that the [Medicare Advantage] health \n     plans offer, such as disease management and preventive care, \n     which reduce their daily discomforts and help them avoid \n     unnecessary hospital visits.\n  What about this one?\n\n       As a retired voter in your state, I would ask you to please \n     do all that you can to eliminate the proposed cut in Medicare \n     Advantage funds in the proposed Senate bill. You have \n     demonstrated the sensitivity for the elderly in our state. I \n     hope you continue to take our needs as fixed income residents \n     into consideration.\n\n  How about this?\n\n       I am greatly concerned about efforts to reduce benefits to \n     the Medicare Advantage plans. I am a member of the Humana \n     plan. It has been working for me because of the low premiums, \n     low deductibles and co-pays, wellness and enhanced preventive \n     benefits, and coordinated care and disease assistance \n     programs. I have been unemployed for over a year now for \n     several reasons, among them my age, I am sure. I received a \n     monthly $527 social security check as my only income. I can \n     survive only because I am living with my son and family. \n     Please do what you can. Thanks so much.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       Dear Senator, I realize times are tough, but my medicare \n     advantage plan through DMBA is a real blessing to me. I'd \n     like to think that with all the talk of health care change, \n     that plans that are working now would not be abandoned, or at \n     least replaced with something as good, or better. Please \n     think carefully and with sincere prayer, about the \n     consequences to old retired people like me, before you vote \n     on these issues. Thank you.\n\n  He recommends that I pray--which I do--about this.\n  Here is another one:\n\n       We like the Medicare Advantage Plan. Seniors need to have a \n     choice in health care, and help in keeping that program. \n     Medicare seems to always be cutting benefits for seniors. \n     Have you talked to seniors lately? Doctors are not accepting \n     anyone on Medicare and turn them away. This is an issue that \n     needs to be addressed in health care. Keeping the Medicare \n     Advantage Plan helps doctors accept a patient that has \n     Medicare. Without an additional supplemental plan, seniors \n     are in trouble with health care physicians. Please don't \n     cause more suffering for seniors by cutting the Medicare \n     Advantage programs.\n\n  Here is one:\n\n       Senator, we implore you to not allow the Medicare Advantage \n     Plan to be compromised. As seniors, on fixed incomes, my \n     husband and I find the monies, which have soared in 2009/2010 \n     to allow us to participate in the Medicare Advantage Plan. \n     Please see that this plan will remain available to all \n     seniors with the same coverage. Sincerely.\n\n  Here is one:\n\n       As retired, fixed income, senior citizens we benefit by and \n     rely on a Medicare Advantage Plan. We cannot afford the \n     premiums that the Medigap insurance would cost if the \n     Advantage Plans were not available. If not for our Advantage \n     Plan, we would now be financially destitute because of the \n     cost of my husband's health care these last 2 years. Without \n     our Advantage Plan, we would not be able to afford yearly \n     physical exams and preventive care. We also benefit from the \n     Silver Sneakers exercise program as part of our plan. Senator \n     Hatch, we urge you in any new health care plan, to: Keep \n     Medicare Advantage Plans available; provide no government \n     option/single payer; give no health care for illegals; fix \n     the existing health system before adopting something new.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       Medicare Advantage Plans work great. Please don't let \n     President Obama take them from us.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       We are Republicans from the State of Utah. Our concerns \n     have to do with the\n\n[[Page S12310]]\n\n     Medicare Advantage Program as offered currently to senior \n     citizens and participants in Medicare. Part of this plan \n     includes our participation in the Silver Sneakers Program \n     which gives us the opportunity to use the local recreation \n     center in Roy, UT. Our current Medicare Advantage Program \n     covers the cost of the Silver Sneakers Program. Daily use of \n     the Roy Recreation Center would be prohibitive to us if we \n     had to carry the burden of the cost of this program. Thus, we \n     encourage you to keep in mind these concerns as any health \n     plan is proposed in Congress over the next few months. Thank \n     you for your consideration in this matter. Please let us know \n     your position in this matter.\n\n  How about this one?\n\n       I would like you to support the medicare advantage system \n     and vote against any cuts to the advantage system. I am a \n     member of the Humana Advantage program and very happy with \n     the program. They provide additional benefits over Medicare \n     with no additional cost, which is a direct financial \n     advantage to seniors.\n\n  Let me just read one more. I have so many of these I could go on for \nhours, but let me just read one more.\n\n       I'm very concerned about the President's determination to \n     do away with ``Medicare Advantage.'' My coverage is with \n     DMBA, which is a nonprofit. It is my understanding DMBA \n     actually pays some medical expenses over and above what \n     Medicare authorizes. In addition, they administer the whole \n     plan, which means I don't have to deal with Medicare \n     directly. I feel that the amount of premium I pay to DMBA is \n     worth these benefits. I'm willing to bet that Medicare costs \n     will increase, if they have to start spending time dealing \n     with seniors who currently have this kind of third party \n     intervention. If there are really 10 million seniors who have \n     ``Medicare Advantage,'' how can any of the members of \n     Congress vote to eliminate it? Thanks, so much, for your time \n     and efforts.\n\n  Well, I think that last letter kind of sums it up. How can anybody \nvote to do away with the Medicare Advantage Program?\n  Just to be clear, the SilverSneakers Program--which has been much \nmaligned by the other side, who helped to enact the program, and who \ntalk about prevention and care all the time--is one that has made a \ndifference in the lives of many seniors because it encourages them to \nget out of their homes and remain active. It has been helpful to those \nwith serious weight issues and valuable to women suffering with \nosteoporosis and joint problems.\n  In fact, I have received several hundred letters telling me how much \nMedicare Advantage beneficiaries appreciate the program. I would like \nto read a couple of those letters at this time, if I can. I will just \nread a few of them because there are many letters.\n\n       I recently have suffered from a heart attack and now \n     receive treatment as a member of the Silver Sneakers. Being a \n     part of the Silver Sneakers has helped my life immensely. The \n     treatment I receive at the Silver Sneakers has readily \n     increased my quality of life after my heart attack. I hope \n     the funding for Silver Sneakers is not cut.\n\n  Well, that is Medicare Advantage. Here is the last I will read on the \nlist.\n\n       I would like to express to you the need for the \n     SilverSneakers program to continue. I have participated in \n     this program for about 3 years now. I cannot begin to tell \n     you the difference it has made since joining the program. I \n     have not felt better health wise since joining the \n     SilverSneakers program. My overall wellbeing both physically \n     and mentally have improved. I go to the gym 3 times a week. I \n     look forward to this physical activity. I feel physically \n     better and my joints and body are in better shape than ever. \n     I feel I have improved my immune system and go to the doctor \n     less than when I did not participate in this program. I am \n     retired with a fixed income and it would be difficult for me \n     to have to pay for a gym membership if this program were to \n     be eliminated. So I ask you to please consider keeping this \n     program.\n\n  Look, the SilverSneakers Program is a prevention and wellness \nprogram, and almost all of us--if we are really honest about it--would \nadmit that if we could get our seniors out there walking and exercising \nand doing the things that will help them to stay vibrant, alert, and \nphysically well, it would save us billions of dollars. It is a very \nwell-thought-out program, but it is a small part of Medicare Advantage. \nI thought I would cover it since it has been so maligned by some. If \nyou read at least the HELP bill, there are a lot of provisions on \nwellness and prevention.\n  Well, in conclusion, I cannot support any bill that would jeopardize \nhealth care coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, and I surely believe \nif the bill before the Senate becomes law, Medicare beneficiaries' \nhealth care coverage could be in serious trouble.\n  I have been in the Senate for over 30 years. I pride myself on being \nbipartisan. I have coauthored many bipartisan health care bills since I \nfirst joined the Senate in 1977. As much as anyone in this Chamber, I \nwant a health reform bill to be enacted this year. Every Republican \ndoes. But we want it to be bipartisan. We want it to be something both \nsides can support, such as the CHIP bill, which had a huge bipartisan \nvote. This is one-sixth of the American economy. If it doesn't get 75 \nto 80 votes, it is a lousy bill. I want it to be done right. History \nhas shown if it is done right, it needs to be a bipartisan bill that \npasses the Senate with a minimum of 75 to 80 votes.\n  We did it on the CHIP bill and on Hatch-Waxman. We did it on a whole \nraft of bills in which I have been a major player. There has never been \na bill of this magnitude affecting so many American lives that has \npassed this Chamber on an almost straight party-line vote, or maybe \njust a straight party-line vote.\n  The Senate is not the House. This body has a different constitutional \nmandate than the House. We are the deliberative body. We are the body \nthat has, in the past--and should today--worked through these difficult \nissues to find clear consensus. True bipartisanship is what is needed. \nIn the past, the Senate has approved many bipartisan health care bills \nthat have eventually been signed into law. I mentioned a few: the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 which included the CHIP program--that was a \nHatch-Kennedy bill--the Ryan White Act, I named the bill after Ryan \nWhite who died from AIDS, with his mother sitting right in the \naudience. I stood on the Senate floor and named it the Ryan White Act. \nAnd the Orphan Drug Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the \nHatch-Waxman Act, which created the modern generic drug industry. These \nare just a few of the success stories. I could go through many, many \nothers.\n  If the Senate passes this bill in its current form with a razor-thin \nmargin of 60 votes or thereabouts, this will become one more example of \nthe arrogance of power being exerted since the Democrats secured a 60-\nvote majority in the Senate and took over the House and the White \nHouse.\n  I dream someday of having the Republicans having 60 votes. I tell you \none thing, I think we would finally have the total responsibility to \nget this country under control, and I believe we would be successful. \nThere are essentially no checks or balances found in Washington today, \njust an arrogance of power with one party ramming through unpopular and \ndevastating proposals one after the other.\n  Let me talk now about other negative impacts of this bill, at a time \nwhen we are in a terrible recession, with the current unemployment rate \nat 10.2 percent. And if you take away some of the part-time and some of \nthe other statistics, we are at an effective 17 percent unemployment \nrate.\n  The Reid bill is a job killer. It has a disproportionate impact on \nsmall businesses. This 2,046-page bill contains nearly one-half \ntrillion dollars in new taxes, fees, and penalties that will \ndisproportionately affect small businesses, which are the job-creating \nengine and the lifeblood of our economy. Seventy percent of all jobs \nare created by the small business sector, and actually more if you \nreally look at it.\n  According to a recent National Federation of Independent Businesses \nSurvey, at least 50 percent of small businesses pay taxes at the \nindividual level through owners that report income of more than \n$200,000 and will be hit hardest under the Democratic tax-and-spend \nplan with their mandate--their job-killing employer mandate--in this \nbill. This is small business. This is not the large corporate world. It \nis small business where most of the jobs are generated. Every dollar \nlost to new taxes on these businesses will be a dollar taken away from \njob creation.\n  The Reid bill includes a job-killing employer mandate. More \nspecifically, it contains a $28 billion new tax penalty on employers \nfor failing to provide coverage. Economists and CBO both agree that \nthis will hurt employee wages and job creation. That is economists and \nCBO--the Congressional Budget Office. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, although this new tax is levied on the employers, it is \nthe ``workers in those firms who would ultimately bear the burden of \nthose fees'' in the form of reduced compensation.\n\n[[Page S12311]]\n\n  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has stated that the \nemployer mandate will have a disproportionate impact on hiring \npractices for low- and moderate-income families. This is the most \nimportant segment in need of help.\n  The Reid bill increases the Medicare payroll tax. In fact, it imposes \na $54 billion payroll tax increase at a time when we as a nation are \nstruggling with an unemployment rate of 10.2 percent and an \nunderemployment rate that I have been speaking about of 17.5 percent.\n  In addition, the Reid bill fails to lower premiums. Instead of \nlowering skyrocketing health care premiums for small businesses across \nthe Nation, this $2.5 trillion bill, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, will largely maintain the status quo of 5 percent to 6 \npercent yearly increases in premiums for small businesses. Why? A \ncombination of heavyhanded regulations and a laundry list of new taxes \non everything from health plans to prescription drugs, to medical \ndevices which, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, will \nsimply be passed on to the consumers.\n  The Reid bill creates another brandnew Washington-run plan. This \nWashington-run plan comes at a time when families and businesses with \nprivate insurance are already paying as much as $1,800 a year more in \npremiums, which is nothing more than a hidden tax to make up for the \nunderpayment by government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid to \nhealth care providers. It is no secret some doctors are not willing to \ntake Medicare patients and even Medicaid patients because of the \nreimbursement rates, among others things, because of the bureaucracy--\nthe bureaucratic problems. Creating another government-run program will \nonly increase this hidden tax on families and small businesses to keep \nthe private coverage of their choice, and I believe it is important for \nmy colleagues to hear what businesses are saying about the Reid bill.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business, the premier small \nbusiness organization in the country, says:\n\n       The Senate Bill Fails Small Business.\n\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce:\n\n       U.S. Chamber stresses disappointment with Senate health \n     bill.\n\n  The National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors:\n\n       Wholesaler-Distributors say ``No'' to the Reid Health Bill.\n\n  The Small Business Entrepreneurship Council:\n\n       Small Business Group Says Reid Health Bill More of the \n     Same: More Taxes, Mandates, Big Spending and Nothing to Help \n     Lower Health Insurance Costs.\n\n  The Associated Builders and Contractors--great employers in this \ncountry:\n\n       ABC Critical of Senate Democratic Health Care Bill.\n\n  The National Association of Manufacturers:\n\n       NAM says Congress is Taking Health Care Reform in the Wrong \n     Direction.\n\n  The Independent Electrical Contractors sent a letter of opposition to \nevery Senator.\n  The International Franchise Association:\n\n       Franchise Businesses Oppose Senate Healthcare Reform \n     Efforts.\n\n  There is a better way to handle health care reform. For months, I \nhave been pushing for a fiscally responsible and step-by-step proposal \nthat recognizes our current need for spending restraint, while starting \nus on a path to sustainable health care reform. There are several areas \nof consensus that can form the basis for sustainable, fiscally \nresponsible, and bipartisan reform. We have a lot ideas over here for \nreforming the health insurance market for every American by making sure \nno American is denied coverage simply based on a preexisting condition; \nprotecting the coverage for almost 85 percent of Americans who already \nhave coverage they like by making that coverage more affordable. This \nmeans reducing costs by rewarding quality and coordinated care, giving \nfamilies more information on the costs and choices of their coverage \nand treatment options, discouraging frivolous lawsuits, and promoting \nprevention and wellness measures.\n  By the way, the other side is not willing to do anything on tort \nreform that some estimate may be costing us as much, in unnecessary \ncosts, as $300 billion a year.\n  Giving States flexibility to design unique approaches to health care \nreform. Utah is not New York and New York is not Utah.\n  As we move forward on health care reform, it is important to \nrecognize that every State has its own unique mix of demographics and \neach State has developed its own unique institutions to address its \nchallenges and each has its own successes. I believe in 50 State \nlaboratories, where the States may be given the money by the Federal \nGovernment, but they solve their own problems with their own \ndemographic needs and fitting their own demographic needs, rather than \na one-size-fits-all big Federal Government program which is what this \nbill creates.\n  There is an enormous reservoir of expertise, experience, and field-\ntested reform in the States. We should take advantage of those \nexperiences by placing States at the center of health care reform \nefforts so they may use approaches that best reflect their needs and \nchallenges.\n  My home State of Utah has taken important and aggressive steps toward \nsustainable health care reform. The current efforts to introduce a \ndefined contribution health benefit system and implement the Utah \nhealth exchange are laudable accomplishments. A vast majority of \nAmericans agree that a one-size-fits-all Washington solution is not the \nright approach. That is what this bill is bound to foist on us.\n  Unfortunately, the path we are taking in Washington right now is to \nsimply spend another $2.5 trillion of taxpayer money to further expand \nthe role of the Federal Government. I do not know many people who \nbelieve that is what we should do. I wish the majority would take a \nstep back, put their arrogance of power in check, and truly work on a \nreal bipartisan bill that all of us can support, or at least a good \npercentage of us can support--not just one or two Republicans.\n  The first step in achieving bipartisanship is to support my motion to \ncommit this bill so Medicare Advantage beneficiaries may keep the \nbenefits they currently enjoy through Medicare Advantage plans. To me, \nit is only fair that the legislation we are currently considering hold \ntrue to the President's promise to the American people that if they \nlike what they have they may keep it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my motion to commit so that promise \nwill also apply to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries who have benefitted \ngreatly from what we did in a bipartisan way just a few years ago. I \nmight add, some of these outside groups have a stake in killing it \nbecause they can make more money on senior citizens. It is not hard to \nsee why they are behind this great big, huge 2,074-page monstrosity of \na bill. No wonder they don't place this bill on every desk. Maybe they \nwill. When they do, they will probably put two pages on one sheet so it \nwill look a little bit smaller.\n  But it ought to be on every desk. We can even thumb through it while \nwe are debating and while others are talking. Think what that would do \nfor all of us Members of the Senate if we thumbed through some of the \nthings we are doing to America. Remember, this is one-sixth of the \nAmerican economy. We could wreck our country with this bill if we pass \nit. By passing it, we would turn our future 100 percent over to the \nFederal Government that has already put these two wonderful programs, \nMedicare and Medicaid, almost in bankruptcy. Those programs can be \nbetter, there is no question. But they are run by Washington, so \nnaturally we are going to call on taxpayers, over and over again, to \nfund the excesses these bureaucracies in Washington impose on all of \nus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I know the Senator from Pennsylvania wishes to speak \nvery shortly, and I will yield to him when he is present on the floor. \nBut I did wish to react to two points that were made by the very \ndistinguished Senator from Utah. I say that with true sincerity. He has \nbeen a friend to me since I have been in the\n\n[[Page S12312]]\n\nSenate. He sets a very valuable standard in this institution for \ncollegiality and dignity and bipartisanship and scholarliness, and he \ncomes from an extremely distinguished career, prior to his \ndistinguished career in the Senate, as a lawyer, a leader of the Utah \nbar.\n  But I do think that, as easy as it is to make fun of a 2,074-page \nbill, the House bill, which is not significantly different in scale \nfrom this bill, was reviewed. If you look at the substantive language \nin it--in a bill, of course, there is a lot of language that simply \nconnects things into place and is tables and indexes and things such as \nthat. If you look at the actual language you would read if you were \ninterested in the substance of the bill on the House side and do a word \ncount on it, it has fewer words than a ``Harry Potter'' novel. I don't \nthink it is too much to expect that Members of the Senate should be \nprepared to leaf through the equivalent of a ``Harry Potter'' novel \nwhen they are embarking on as significant an effort and endeavor as we \nare in reforming the health care system. I think it was about 256,000 \nwords, if I am not mistaken. It is smaller print, admittedly, than a \n``Harry Potter'' book because of the way in which the bill is presented \nin its traditional format. It is very few words per page, so it looks \nbig and one can make very entertaining demonstrations with it on the \nfloor. When you actually get down to reading it, it is about the same \nas plowing through--actually less than plowing through a ``Harry \nPotter'' novel, and I don't think that should be too much to expect.\n  I also suggest the reason for the lack of current bipartisanship on \nthis bill might very well be the arrogance of power of the Democratic \nmajority--it might be. But I would suggest the facts might also support \na different hypothesis. If you look back at the history of the \ndevelopment of this bill, it began on a very bipartisan note. It began \nwith Senator Baucus's ``prepare to launch'' program at the very \nbeginning of the year, a full-day, bipartisan effort to begin to focus \non the delivery system reform issues. It began with a bipartisan group \nnegotiating in the Finance Committee. It began with a HELP Committee \nbill that allowed for 161, I believe was the number, Republican \namendments in a very open and completely bipartisan process.\n  Then along came August and the townhall meetings and the beginning of \nthe radicalization of the Republican Party. We heard, out of that \nprocess, charged buzz words such as ``death panels,'' ``socialized \nmedicine,'' ``benefits for illegal immigrants,'' ``rationing of \ncare''--all these words that incite and inflame passions but make no \nreasoned case and advance no helpful alternative.\n  We saw those words and those arguments presented with a crudeness and \na venom that are frankly new to American politics; for example, the \nPresident portrayed with a Hitler mustache. I don't recall, for 8 \nyears, President Bush ever being portrayed with a Hitler mustache. Poor \nPresident Obama comes in and within his first months people are running \naround America portraying him with a Hitler mustache because we want to \nreform health care.\n  Certainly, there are a great number of us who believed President Bush \nwas less than truthful when he came and spoke to us about Iraq and \nother subjects, but nobody yelled out ``You lie.'' In President Obama's \nfirst appearance, he was heckled from the floor of the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  This September, after the tea bag group and after the townhall death \npanel group had become active, 179 Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives of the Congress of the United States voted to support \ntheir heckler comrade.\n  Something changed with the radicalization of the Republican Party, \nand I am not the only one to have noticed this. A very well-regarded \nPhiladelphia columnist wrote recently of the Republican right:\n\n       If they can get some mileage . . . nothing else matters.\n\n  The columnist went on to decry what he called ``the conservative \nparanoia'' and ``lunacy'' afoot in our national debate.\n  The editor of the Manchester Journal Inquirer editorial page wrote of \nthe GOP, which he called ``this once great and now mostly shameful \nparty,'' that it ``has gone crazy,'' that it is ``more and more \ndominated by the lunatic fringe,'' and that it has ``poisoned itself \nwith hate.'' He concluded, they ``no longer want to govern. They want \nto emote.''\n  The respected Maureen Dowd of the New York Times, in her column \neulogizing her friend, the late William Safire, lamented the ``vile and \nvitriol of today's howling pack of conservative pundits.''\n  A Nobel Prize-winning economist has said:\n\n       The takeover of the Republican Party by the irrational \n     right is no laughing matter. Something unprecedented is \n     happening here, and it's very bad for America.\n\n  A well-regarded Washington Post writer with a quarter century of \nexperience covering government and politics, married to a Bush \nadministration official--we are hardly talking about commentary from \nthe leftward fringe--has noted about the House health care bill and the \narguments surrounding it ``the appalling amount of misinformation being \npeddled by its opponents.'' She called it a ``flood of sheer factual \nmisstatements about the health-care bill.'' She noted that ``[t]he \nfalsehood-peddling began at the top'' of the Republican Party. Her \nultimate question was this:\n\n       Are the Republican arguments against this bill so weak that \n     they have to resort to these misrepresentations and \n     distortions?''\n\n  Even the respected head of the Mayo Clinic has recently described the \nhealth care antics we have witnessed as ``mud'' and ``scare tactics.''\n  It is possible, as the distinguished Senator from Utah suggests, that \nthe reason bipartisanship is elusive is because Democrats have been \ngripped by the arrogance of power. But as somebody who has been witness \nto intense efforts to try to recruit Republican support for this bill, \nthe evidence at least as well supports the theory that something has \nhappened to the Republican Party in the past months, as the radicalized \nRepublican right has emerged and taken over and provoked all of these \nresponses from respected, neutral, seasoned veterans observing the \npolitical scene. I suggest that is at least a possibility.\n  I would like to change topics for a moment, given that Senator Casey \nis not present, and make an additional point that I believe merits \nmention. I will yield as soon as he appears to have arrived.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a second?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to have a few minutes to wrap up.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Of course. How long would the Senator wish?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think I can do it in less than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nUtah right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Would the Senator yield back for one moment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Surely.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I had the opportunity to be on the floor yesterday, \nand the time was all under agreement. My time was concluded, and I was \nleaving the floor. The Senator from Utah had the occasion to offer some \nvery kind words about me. Because of the procedural posture we were in, \nI did not have the chance to reply or respond at that time. This is the \nfirst time we have been on the floor together since then, when I have \nhad the chance to have the floor, and I do want to let him know how \nmuch I value what he had to say. I know there are very well-established \nstandards of protocol here in which we say nice things about each \nother, but I felt that what he had to say was not just protocol but was \nsincere and heartfelt, and it really does mean a lot to me and is \nreciprocated on my part.\n  I think Senator Hatch brings enormous, as I said earlier, dignity, \nerudition, principle, collegiality--many good characteristics to the \nfloor. He is a force for good in this body, and I am delighted to have \nhim count me a friend.\n  I yield him the next 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague. I appreciate the eloquence of my \ndear friend. I am going to find fault with some of the things he said, \nbut I have to say I am grateful to have the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island with us. He is one of the great additions to the Senate, \nin my opinion, a\n\n[[Page S12313]]\n\nvery good lawyer who has had tremendous experience in State government. \nIt is amazing to me that he is supporting this awful bill, this \nmonstrosity of a bill. But I can live with that. I have seen a lot of \ndecent, honorable people be deceived by their desire on the Democratic \nside to continue to build the Federal Government at the expense of the \nStates and everybody else. I will say this: I really enjoy my \ncolleague. I have a lot of respect for him.\n  I have to take issue with his ``Harry Potter'' comments. Just think \nabout that. I like the fact that the distinguished Senator from Rhode \nIsland compares this bill here to a ``Harry Potter'' novel. That is, \nperhaps, pretty appropriate because both of them are what I consider to \nbe works of fantasy and fiction. This thing has 14 pages as a table of \ncontents alone. Notice how my voice goes up as I am holding it; it puts \nthat much pressure on your speech diaphragm. I just wish it was as \nvaluable and would be as valuable to the American people as the ``Harry \nPotter'' novels have been.\n  Let me say one last thing before I close and leave the floor. I \nappreciate my colleague. I appreciate his graciousness in all ways. We \nhave worked closely together on the Intelligence Committee and the \nJudiciary Committee and in many other ways. I think he is one of the \ngreat additions to the Senate. In spite of his dogged determination in \nsupport of this awful bill, I still think greatly and very highly of \nhim.\n  Let me make a few things clear to my Democratic colleagues. I am not \na great believer that we should follow polls at all, but I think it is \ninteresting to see what the American people are thinking. My colleagues \nseem to think that some of these people who did the tea parties and \nsome of these other things are rightwing crazies. I know a lot of them. \nThey are really good people. They are up in arms, and they are really \nupset. They are people from all walks of life. Some of them are very \nfar right. Some of them are far left. The fact is, they are sincere. \nThey feel what is going to happen here is a denigration of the country.\n  Unfortunately, I feel the same way. The more we rely totally on the \nFederal Government, the worse off this country will be. My colleagues \nlove the Federal Government. I love it too. I would love to keep it in \nits place. It is much easier to control things when you control them \nthrough Washington. However, it is also a way of stifling good ideas if \nyou do not have the best benefits of the 50 State laboratories that our \nFederalist system actually provides.\n  I noticed in a recent Gallup poll, 53 percent of the Independents are \nopposed to this bill. Gallup has been polling for years, is it not \nRepublican or Democratic. These are Independents. Thirty-seven percent \nsupport the bill. These are not radical Americans, these are \nIndependents. They are just tired of the tax-and-spend policies of \nWashington, DC. There are people in both parties who are guilty of \npushing for those types of policies.\n  I have to say Democrats are much better at spending Federal dollars \nthan Republicans in the sense that they spend a lot more of them. \nDemocrats are not better in watching them either.\n  Even a Kaiser poll, which is anything but conservative, had 59 \npercent of the people in this country opposed to this bill.\n  If I were a Democrat, I would be a little concerned about the \nIndependents. They are not crazies. They are not people who are out of \nline. And neither are these conservatives who are up in arms.\n  I recently met with a number of the tea party representatives in \nUtah. They are fiscal conservatives. They are very concerned. I also \nmet with representatives of the so-called 912 Group. They are more \nconcerned with social issues as well as economic issues. They are well-\nintentioned, well-thought-out people who are sick and tired of what is \nhappening here in Washington. The only way they can really get their \nideas heard is by raising cane about it. Frankly, I think they are \nright to do so.\n\n  We all better stop and take a look at these things and see if we can, \nas honest, decent Democrats and honest, decent Republicans, get \ntogether to come up with a bill that has broad bipartisan support of at \nleast 75 to 80 Senators. I would like it to be more. But that is what \nwe need to do. This current bill is not the way to get there.\n  I thank my colleague for his gracious remarks about me. I feel \nexactly the same about him. He is a good colleague, a wonderful \nattorney, and a great addition to the Senate. I intend to work with him \nin every way I can. I just think if he would just tell his side: We are \ngoing to sit down, we are going to work this out, I think we would get \nit done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nIowa as well as the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. Whichever \none of them would like to proceed, I am prepared to yield. It looks as \nif it will be the distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  I had the very great honor of serving on the HELP Committee during \nthe time that the HELP Committee section of this bill was prepared. One \nof the most vital and important elements of this bill is its new focus \non wellness and prevention to help Americans stay healthy so that it \ntruly is health care and not just sick care, so that the medical \nestablishment is not incented to add more and more tests and procedures \nbecause that is what they get paid for but won't have an e-mail contact \nor won't have a phone call to help talk a patient through something \nbecause they can't get reimbursed.\n  The potential value of wellness and prevention in this country is \nastonishing. It has been underinvested in because the people who are \nresponsible for making those choices really don't get the benefit of \nthem under our present perverse system.\n  The Senator from Iowa has shown great leadership. He is now chairman \nof the HELP Committee, but he certainly chaired, through the committee \ndeliberations, the health and wellness portions. It was my honor to \nwatch him in action and see the astonishing results he achieved.\n  I yield the floor to him and ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Iowa, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Casey, be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry: What rule are we under right now? \nHow much time do we have? Are we under any time constraints?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator controls \nthe time until 8 p.m., approximately 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I wish to thank my colleague for all \nthe work he did in our committee. I am sorry he is not still on our \ncommittee. I wish he were. But a lot of the good work we have in our \nbill is due to Senator Whitehouse's involvement in the development of \nthis bill. He was a great member of our committee, and as the chairman, \nI sure wish he would come back. That is all I can say.\n\n  I say to the Senator, thank you for all the great work you did on \nthis bill and especially all the wonderful work you did on getting us \nthe public option that we had in our bill that was adopted by the House \nbut also all the great work you did on making sure we had a robust \nprevention and wellness program in our bill. I have always said that \nthe best way to bend the cost curve is to keep people healthy in the \nfirst place and keep them out of the hospital.\n  So I thank my colleague for all his great work on the bill.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage my friend from \nPennsylvania in a little discussion on one part of the bill that was \nmentioned earlier today but really has not received much attention. I \nthink there are some misconceptions about what it does. It is called \nthe CLASS Act.\n  Basically, the CLASS Act is a bill that was championed by Senator \nKennedy for many years. It has its genesis in the kind of convoluted \nsystem we\n\n[[Page S12314]]\n\nhave now in how we provide for people who become disabled.\n  Either through their work, through an accident, through illness, or \nwhatever, people become disabled. As you know, we have a portion of \nthat under the Social Security system, disability insurance. But, in \nfact, it does not take care of any kind of long-term care. So Senator \nKennedy, for many years, championed the idea of giving people the \nability to set aside some money during their working years that would \nbe sort of like Social Security. It would vest, and then, if, God \nforbid, they became disabled, they would then have a certain monthly \nincome that would enable them to live in their own homes, live in their \nown communities, and to ease some of the burdens of their disability.\n  Before he passed away, Senator Kennedy talked to all of us on the \ncommittee about his dream and his hope that we would have this \nincorporated in our health reform bill.\n  Well, we did this in the HELP Committee. We brought it forward. We \nhad it scored. We know exactly how it operates. As we will make clear, \nI am sure, in our colloquy, it is a program that can be paid for. It is \nvoluntary, as we said. It will stand on its own two feet. It is not \nanother entitlement program, as I heard someone say here earlier today. \nIn fact, it has to be self-financing by the premiums people pay in \nduring their working years. It is an affordable, long-term care \nprogram. Again, it will allow families to plan for any possibility of a \nchronic illness, without having the fear of being put in a nursing \nhome. As I said, it is voluntary.\n  The CBO gave us a scoring on this that it was actuarially sound for \n75 years--actuarially sound for 75 years. What that means is that the \npremiums paid in and the benefits paid out will be kept in proper \nalignment. It will be fully solvent.\n  Quite frankly, Mr. Gregg, the Senator from New Hampshire, on our \ncommittee, basically talked about this, and here is what he said:\n\n       I offered an amendment, which was ultimately accepted, that \n     would require the CLASS Act premiums to be based on a 75-year \n     actuarial analysis of the program's costs. My amendment \n     ensures that instead of promising more than we can deliver, \n     the program will be fiscally solvent and we won't be passing \n     the buck--or really, passing the debt--to future generations. \n     I'm pleased the HELP Committee unanimously accepted this \n     amendment.\n\n  Well, we did, and that is why I make the point that this is not \nanother entitlement program, as was said here earlier today.\n  Even better, the CBO believes the CLASS Act will save Medicaid $1.4 \nbillion in the first 4 years alone--$1.4 billion in the first 4 years \nalone--as a result of families who will be paying into and then using \nthe CLASS benefit instead of Medicaid to similarly pay for the help \nthey need to remain at home. That is really what people want. People \nwant to stay in their own communities. They do not want to have to go \nto a nursing home.\n  The CLASS Act would provide money for assisted transportation, in-\nhome meals, help with household chores, professional help getting ready \nfor work, adult daycare, professional personal care. Now, will it pay \nfor all those things? No, it will not pay for all those things, but it \nwill give you enough of a basic support so that, coupled with other \nthings, you would be able to stay at home and maybe even go to work. \nYou may be disabled, but you may not be so disabled you cannot do some \nwork; therefore, you need a little bit of help at home to get out in \nthe morning and go to work or maybe you just need some personal \nassistance care that would enable you to stay in your own home rather \nthan going to a nursing home.\n  So that is why this amendment is so important. It is voluntary, long \noverdue. I think it will begin to give people the peace of mind of \nknowing if they pay into this system, after it vests--after 5 years of \nvesting--they will then be able to access this program in case they get \ndisabled.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague and my friend from Pennsylvania is \non the floor, a strong supporter of the CLASS Act and what we are \ntrying to do here in terms of giving people the ability to maintain \nthemselves if, God forbid, they should become disabled. I will be \ndelighted to yield whatever time he needs to the Senator from \nPennsylvania and engage in any colloquies he would like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend, Senator \nHarkin, who is now the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, taking over for Senator Kennedy. I know he feels an \nobligation not only to get this health care bill passed, but he also \nfeels an obligation to the American people, as I think most people in \nthis Chamber do, when it comes to health care. In particular, I commend \nSenator Harkin for his great support for this legislation over a long \nperiod of time, and in particular for the CLASS Act.\n  One of the best moments in our deliberations this summer was when \nSenator Harkin told a story about a relative of his. In a few moments, \nif he would tell that story, it brought home to me how important this \nprogram is and how it relates to the American people and what they do \nnot have now, especially those Americans with disabilities.\n  When I step back and look at this program, a couple of things come to \nmind--a couple of themes, really. One is the word ``dignity,'' the \ndignity of work. So many Americans--by one estimate, 5 million \nAmericans--under the age of 65 are living in our country who have long-\nterm care needs, and there are over 70,000 workers with severe \ndisabilities in the Nation today, who need daily assistance to maintain \ntheir jobs and their independence. So we are talking about a program \nwhich allows them to continue working with a disability. It allows them \nto overcome or surmount the barrier that is in front of them. Why would \nanyone not want to support this kind of a program, just in that brief \ndescription? But it is a lot more than that. It is about the dignity of \nwork. It is about having independence, the ability to continue to work \neven with a disability. But it is also a very strong program for other \nreasons as well.\n\n  One is, as Senator Harkin said so well--and Senator Kennedy led us on \nthis program for many years, advocating for this approach--one \nimportant feature of this, as Senator Harkin says, is it is voluntary. \nIt is a voluntary, self-funded--self-funded--insurance program with \nenrollment for people who are currently employed. So we are talking \nabout enabling and helping people to work and maintain their dignity \nand contribute to our economy. That is what we are talking about here. \nWe are not talking about some government program we are going to create \nthat no one knows what the results will be. We know exactly what this \nwill do for millions of Americans.\n  Let me make a couple of points before I turn again to our chairman, \nSenator Harkin.\n  First of all, there have been a lot of arguments made on the other \nside that we do not need this. Boy, I have not heard an alternative, \nwhich is true in a lot of the debates in the last couple of days. We \nhear a lot of criticism and critiques, some of them grossly inaccurate. \nBut I am still waiting--still waiting--to hear an alternative, another \nidea. We do not hear much about that.\n  But the other side made a lot of points about cost and the budget and \nhow you pay for programs such as this. Well, let's just turn to the \nfirst chart on my left.\n  Medicaid pays for a majority of long-term care in the United States \nof America. For long-term care, 40 percent of it is paid for by \nMedicaid. A lot of people think of the Medicaid Program, which I guess \ncovers about 60 million Americans, roughly. We should think about long-\nterm care. People do not often think about Medicaid as being connected \ndirectly to long-term care for older citizens, those who fought our \nwars, who worked in our factories, who raised our families, who gave us \nlife and love, and all they ask for in the twilight years of their \nlives is a little help with their health care. Plenty of them are given \nskilled care in nursing homes, and for many of those who are in nursing \nhomes, they have skilled care, and they have a good experience. For \nsome, it is not so good. They would rather be able to stay at home. \nThey would rather be able to have opportunities to be provided some \nhelp at home. So they want the kind of dignity I spoke about earlier. \nThe same\n\n[[Page S12315]]\n\nis true of those who might be a lot younger but who have disabilities \nand want to continue working. They want to continue working.\n  Here is another way to look at this: Projected Medicaid spending on \nlong-term services and supports is unsustainable because if nothing is \ndone, Medicaid services for older citizens in America alone will rise \nby 500 percent by 2045. You do not have to be--I am certainly not an \nexpert on how these costs are going up, but you do not have to be an \nexpert to know that in the year 2000, you are at this level, and by the \nyear 2045--not that far in the future--you are going to be over at \nabove $200 billion. So Medicaid long-term services and support spending \nfor those who happen to be aged 65 or older: $200 billion by 2045. So \nthis is going up. This is when you do not do anything to meet a health \ncare challenge. If we want to just keep this number going up, well, \nlisten to the other side and just not enact any kind of a program.\n  Let me do one more chart, and then I will turn to Senator Harkin for \na discussion about this.\n  We hear a lot about spending and savings and how we are going to pay \nfor health care. Well, if we want to pay for a part of this health care \nbill--and a big part of the challenge--we should enact the CLASS Act \nbecause Medicaid savings from this act, as you can see here: $1.6 \nbillion just over the first 4 years. We are not talking about 10 years \nor 20 years or 40 years; we are talking about, in 4 years, you get $1.6 \nbillion in savings--over the first 4 years of the implementation of the \nCLASS Act--starting in 2016.\n  So this is affirmative in the sense that it ensures people's dignity. \nIt allows people to work even with a disability. And it is also \nfiscally responsible. And those who benefit from it are paying into it, \nand it is voluntary. No one has to do it. It is voluntary.\n  We have heard a lot of arguments, I say to Senator Harkin, but I \nthink we know from the work he did, working so many years with Senator \nKennedy on these issues and working in the committee this summer, as \none of our leaders--with Senator Dodd chairing the hearings this \nsummer--and now as the chairman of the committee, the Senator has been \ninstrumental in getting not just this legislation moving forward but \nespecially on the CLASS Act, and I am grateful for him taking on this \nresponsibility. I want to get the Senator's sense of what he hears from \npeople in Iowa and his own experience with why this is so essential for \nthe American people.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend and my colleague from Pennsylvania for \nlaying out why this is so important, the fact that we are actually \ngoing to get savings for Medicaid from this. That is helping the \nStates. That helps the States a lot. So we get a lot of bangs for the \nbuck, as one might say, with the CLASS Act that we have in this bill.\n  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania I think one of the biggest \nconcerns people have--they may not express it when they are younger, \nbut once they start working and they start having a family and they see \none of their friends, a relative, someone in their neighborhood, become \ndisabled--and believe me, it happens in our neighborhoods, it happens \nto our friends--they see that and they wonder, Maybe but for the grace \nof God there go I, but what would I do if something like that happened \nto me? How would my family, my children function? Where would the money \ncome from?\n  So to be able to have the peace of mind, to know there is a program \nwhereby they can put some money aside every month, voluntarily, for 5 \nyears, and then after that, they would then be able to access money if \nthey got disabled--talk about a great insurance program. Talk about the \npeace of mind this would provide for people.\n  As I said, as we both have pointed out, this is actuarially sound for \n75 years. So it seems to me that for all of these reasons, including \nthe savings in Medicaid for the soundness of the program, but also for \nthe peace of mind for people who are working, to know they now have a \nprogram, something they can access, that will provide them--again, I \ndon't want to sell this for more than it is. This is not something that \nwill make someone 100 percent whole from their earnings. We are not \ntrying to tell people that. What this will give them is up to $75 a day \nto help them with all of the things I pointed out: maybe getting up, \ngetting ready to go to work; maybe it is personal attendant services. \nIt could be a whole host of different things that will enable them to \nlive in their home, in their community, and, yes, maybe even be able to \ngo to work every day.\n  My friend from Pennsylvania referred to the story I told earlier this \nsummer, and I like to tell it because I think it illustrates what we \nare talking about here. I have a nephew, Kelly, my sister's boy. Well, \nhe is not a boy anymore; he is an older man now, I guess you might say. \nHe became disabled at a very young age, age 19, a severe paraplegic, \nbut he was able to go to school, go to college. He was able then to \nlive by himself in his own home. He had a van with a lift. He could get \nhis wheelchair up there and punch the button and the doors would open \nand the thing would come down and he would get in the van. He had use \nof his hands. He could drive to work. He was able to start his own \nsmall business. But every morning he needed a nurse to come into the \nhome, get him ready to go to work, get him up, get him going, get him \nout the door. Every night when he came home, he would stop and do some \nshopping on the way, come home to his own house where he lived, in his \nown community, among his family. His family was close by. They would \nhave a nurse every evening do his exercises with him, keep his arms \nstrong, do all of his other internal things that needed to be done, \nmake sure he could get to bed. It happened every day. But because of \nthat, he was able to live a full life, and he still is. Kelly is still \nan active man. But that was--gee, I am trying to remember now. I have \nto think. That was in 1979, 30 years ago. Kelly must be about almost 50 \nyears old now. I never thought about that. I always think of him as a \nkid. But he was able to do that, and he has lived a full life. He has \nbeen able to work, live by himself, do all kinds of wonderful things.\n  How was he able to afford this? Was his family wealthy? Not a bit, \nnot at all. In fact, his mother died shortly after the accident \nhappened. My sister, who had breast cancer, died at an untimely, young \nage. But the way Kelly was able to do all this was because he got \ninjured in the military. He got injured while he was onboard a ship off \nthe coast of Vietnam. So the VA paid for all of this and is still \npaying for it--for his personal services--so that he can live by \nhimself and get out the door and go to work. I have seen what that has \ndone for him.\n  I thought to myself: Well, if we can do this for veterans, what about \nother people in our society who, through no fault of their own or \nthrough an accident or whatever, become disabled. I thought about how \nmuch Kelly was able to earn during his lifetime, the fact that he paid \ntaxes, had his own business. You know, that was a pretty darn good deal \nfor the taxpayers of this country.\n  In a small way, that is what we are trying to do here. That is what \nwe are trying to do, to build a system for someone who gets injured, \nbecomes disabled, has some support mechanisms so they can also live a \nfull, rich, and happy quality life without having to go to a nursing \nhome. That is what this is all about.\n  As I said before, I say to my friend, it has so much to offer. I \ncan't imagine there would be any real opposition to this--voluntary, \nactuarially sound. It provides a stipend to help people if they become \ndisabled.\n  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania it seems to me of all the things \nwe have been discussing on this health reform bill so far, to me this \nis one of the most important. This is one of the most important parts \nof this health reform bill. We have never done it before. It is long \noverdue. It will be good for our families. It will be good for \nbusinesses. It will help our States because of the cutbacks and they \nwon't have to pay so much into Medicaid.\n  I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for his strong support of this. I \nsay to my friend Ted Kennedy: We are going to get it done. It is going \nto happen. We are not going to let this bill get through and go to the \nPresident without having this in it. It is going to be there. There is \nno doubt about it. We are going to make it work, just as the Veterans' \nAdministration worked for my nephew Kelly.\n\n[[Page S12316]]\n\n  I yield back to my friend from Pennsylvania. Actually, he asked me a \nquestion and I kind of got off a little bit there on telling my \nstories.\n  Mr. CASEY. I am glad the Senator told that story. For me, this \nsummer, beginning to learn about the details of the CLASS Act, it was a \nway, through the life of the Senator's nephew, to be able to tell the \nstory about why it was so important. I was thinking as you were talking \nabout the program and the CLASS Act itself and your own personal story \nand why it makes so much sense.\n  Sitting here to my left on the floor is Connie Garner. She has worked \nfor years on this legislation with Senator Kennedy. She would know \nbetter than I, and Senator Harkin would know better than I. Ted Kennedy \nnot only liked this and fought hard for this program, but he wasn't a \nguy who just liked interesting ideas, he wanted them to work.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. CASEY. There are times we will be talking about the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program in this legislation. That is a program that \nhad its origin in government, and there is a lot of government \ninvolvement in that program. I support it and will fight to the end of \nthe Earth for it. This program, the CLASS Act, the program that results \nfrom the CLASS Act, is different. It is a hybrid. It is in many ways a \ncreative way to provide these kinds of services for people with \ndisabilities. It is not a government entitlement program. It is a \nprogram that doesn't confer rights or an obligation on government \nfunding, nor does it affect the receipt of or eligibility for other \nbenefits. It stands on its own financial feet, which is the point that \nSenator Harkin made. Why wouldn't we do this?\n  This wasn't just dreamed up this summer. Senator Kennedy, Senator \nHarkin, Connie Garner, and plenty of other folks were working on this \nfor a lot of years. This is the result of years of work, not a couple \nof weeks or months. So they worked on this to get it right, and we have \nit right. It makes sense fiscally and it makes sense in terms of the \ndignity of people's work, the dignity of people able to stay in their \nhome and be provided basic services.\n  All of our families are affected by this. At some point or another, \nyou are going to have a loved one who wants to work but has a \ndisability, maybe; or needs long-term care services and doesn't want to \nleave the home. Everyone is affected by that. There is not a Member of \nthe Senate on either side who isn't going to be affected personally \nsome day by this challenge. All we are saying is we have a way to make \nit a little easier for folks. As Senator Harkin said, it doesn't solve \nall of the problems, but it helps provide the kind of services we \nshould have the right to expect.\n\n  We have this figured out. Some of these things we can figure out \nbecause of all of the work that was done over many years. This program, \nthis voluntary self-funded program is one way to do it. Senator Harkin \nhas been a leader on this and we are grateful for that leadership.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator would yield again to me, two other things. \nI am glad the Senator mentioned Connie Garner who again, with Senator \nKennedy, has worked so many years on this, and has her own personal \nstory to tell regarding this, a very poignant story. But I now want to \nthank Connie for all of her wonderful work on this and shepherding this \nthrough. She is probably sitting over there wishing we had said this \nand that, because we probably forgot something she knows better than we \nknow. But we do our best, Connie. We do our best with what we have, \nanyway, to try to explain this. But I thank Connie for all of her great \nwork and leadership in getting this to this point.\n  I wonder if I might impose upon the Senator, if I might--not digress \nbut talk about one other part of the picture here we are talking about, \nin terms of covering people with disabilities. We have been talking \nabout the CLASS Act, which is prospective. It looks ahead; it provides \nthe mechanism whereby middle-class families can plan for the future \npossibility of an illness or a disability by putting this money away \nevery month. We have talked about that. But one might ask the question: \nWhat about those who are disabled now? What is happening to them, the \nmillions of Americans who are already living with a disability? Well, \nin 1990, we passed the Americans With Disabilities Act. We began to \nbreak down a lot of barriers in terms of people with disabilities and \naccessing daily living, accessing employment, transportation. But what \nhappened was a few court cases started interfering with this. There was \none court case in particular called the Olmstead decision 10 years ago. \nIt came out of Georgia. It was a case in Georgia. It went to the \nSupreme Court. The Supreme Court said that based upon the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act, a State had to provide the least restrictive \nenvironment for a person with a disability.\n  Well, this was wonderful because the only option for many people with \ndisabilities right now is to go to a nursing home. In fact, our Federal \nlaws are basically skewed toward putting people in nursing homes.\n  Let me explain. Right now, about the only support a person with a \nsevere disability has is through Medicaid. As you know, through \nMedicaid you have to spend down until you become poor and then you get \naccess to Medicaid. But under our laws, Medicaid must pay for you, if \nyou are disabled, and then you qualify--they must pay for you to be in \nan institution or nursing home. They must. They have to pay for you. \nIf, however, you are a person with a disability and you say: But I \ndon't want to live in a nursing home; I would like to live--like my \nnephew Kelly--in my own house with my friends, in my own neighborhood, \nMedicaid doesn't have to pay for it, and in most cases it does not pay \nfor that. In the vast majority of cases, it doesn't pay for that.\n  So their beginning movement was in the mid-1990s to provide for \nfunding for individuals with disabilities so they can live in their own \nhomes in the community and not have to go to the nursing home. Well, \nthat bill never--it was called MCASSA, the Medicaid Community Attendant \nSupport and Services Act.\n  I always like telling people, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, \nwhile we sponsored it over in the Senate, the first sponsor of it in \nthe House was the Speaker at that time who had taken over, and his name \nwas Newt Gingrich. To this day, he is still supportive of that. A few \nyears ago, I talked to him, and he was still a strong supporter of \nMCASSA. It later became the Community Choice Act. We could never get it \nenacted into law.\n  It is a part of this health care reform bill in this way: It provides \nthat if a State implements this Community Choice Act, which would allow \npeople with disabilities to live in the community rather than in a \nnursing home, it will then get a bump up. It will get a 6-percent \nincrease in its Federal match for Medicaid.\n  As you know, now the Federal Government provides some and the State \nprovides some for Medicaid. It is roughly 60/40. It varies a little, \nbut that is roughly it, 60/40. Well, that means that a State now that \nwould do this would not have to come up with its 40 percent; it would \nonly have to come up with 34 percent. So it is an incentive for States \nto begin to implement the Supreme Court decision of over 10 years ago \nthat people with disabilities have a right to live in the least \nrestrictive environment. Again, Medicaid, right now, as I said, will \nprovide only for nursing home care. States are obligated to pay for \nthat. They must.\n  Again, this also is a part of what the elderly in this country are \nconcerned about too. A lot of them say that if they become disabled, \nthey don't want to go to a nursing home, but that is their only option \nunder Medicaid. So that explains why the second biggest priority in \npoll after poll for seniors in this bill, after strengthening \nMedicare--which we do--is changes to the health care system that will \nallow them to get the help they need to stay at home rather than going \nto a nursing home.\n  Again, you might say, why is this so important? Well, a couple of \nstories. Two women who brought the Olmstead case, Lois Curtis and \nElaine Wilson, when asked at a hearing what it changed for them, \nbecause they were no longer institutionalized, both spoke of things \nthat we kind of take for granted: They had new friends. They could meet \nnew people. They could attend family celebrations. They said:\n\n[[Page S12317]]\n\nWe could make Kool-Aid whenever we wanted to. Simple things. They could \ngo outside and walk in the neighborhood. They got a little dog, and \nthey could walk the dog in the neighborhood--something they could not \ndo in the nursing home. That is another part of the bill--very closely \naligned with the CLASS Act, but it pertains to those people with \ndisabilities right now.\n  We know, again, from data and statistics we have that by paying for \npersonal care services and home care services--and you might say that \nis really expensive. But we know from data that we get three for one. \nIn other words, for every one person in a nursing home, for what that \ncosts, we can provide community and home-based services for three \npeople. That is three people for every one in a nursing home. So in a \nway, yes, it costs money, but for every person we get out of a nursing \nhome, we can pay for three living in the community. Again, that is not \nto mention the kind of quality of life I just mentioned.\n  This bill for the first time creates the community first choice \noption, which gives States an extra share of Federal money--6 percent--\nif they agree to provide personal care and services to all eligible \npeople in their State--I mean those eligible for institutional care. If \nthey provide that to them, then they get a bump up. And only by making \npersonal care services available on an equal basis to all those \neligible can we satisfy the promise of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct and really meet the Supreme Court mandate in the Olmstead decision.\n  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, there are two aspects of the \nbill. One is the CLASS Act, which looks ahead and provides that peace \nof mind that people know they can have that access. Then we provide for \npeople with disabilities who are living out there, fearful that the \nonly thing that will happen to them is they will have to go to a \nnursing home. Now we are going to say to States: You provide community- \nand home-based services, and we will give you more money to do so \nthrough your Medicaid Program. Hopefully, with that, the States will \nbegin to move more rapidly to fulfill the mandate of that Supreme Court \ndecision.\n  I thank my friend for yielding me this time to explain that.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Friday, \nDecember 4, after any leader remarks, the Senate then resume \nconsideration of H.R. 3590 with debate only in order until 11:30 a.m., \nwith no amendments, motions to commit, or any other motion, other than \na motion to reconsider a vote, if applicable, in order during this \nperiod, except those that are currently pending, with the time after \nthe leader time equally divided and controlled between the leaders or \ntheir designees, with the majority controlling the first portion of \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RUPERT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of \nJeffery D. Rupert, who served as executive assistant to the U.S. \nCapitol Police Board from August 2003 to December 2009.\n  Pursuant to Public Law 108-7, section 1014(c) Congress established \nthe position to act as a central point for communications and enhance \nthe Police Board's work. In his capacity as the first executive \nassistant to the board, Mr. Rupert built the job from the ground up, \ndeveloping policies, initiating procedures, and establishing an \narchival system which will serve as a historic chronicle of board \nsecurity decisions.\n  Mr. Rupert contributed greatly to the safety and security of the \nCapitol Complex during his tenure, which included board support for two \nPresidential inaugurations, two dozen joint sessions of Congress, and \nother major special events and demonstrations.\n  Additionally, Mr. Rupert's regular daily duties enhanced the overall \neffectiveness and efficiency of the board's oversight activities. \nWhether he was coordinating a meeting or writing legal analysis, Mr. \nRupert paid great attention to detail.\n  His more than 6 years of work were critical in supporting \npreparations for potential terrorist attacks and included a vast span \nof expertise in law enforcement, safety, and security issues. He served \nthe USCP and the Capitol Police Board honorably in the aftermath of the \nricin attacks.\n  Mr. Rupert served as a liaison with other congressional and executive \nbranch entities to include the Department of Homeland Security, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the \nDepartment of Defense, and many other agencies. As a liaison, Mr. \nRupert provided information concerning national level issues including \ncontinuity of government and continuity of operations for the U.S. \nCongress. His personal and professional contacts ensured seamless \nsharing of vital intelligence, and the Capitol community was well \nserved during his stewardship.\n  I understand Jeff has accepted a high-ranking position at the \nPentagon. On behalf of the entire Senate, I wish Jeff the very best in \nhis future endeavors and offer him heartfelt thanks for his service to \nCongress and the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/03/senate-section/article/S12317-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12317-S12318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Private first Class Kimble A.

According to initial reports, Private First Class \nHan died of injuries sustained when an improvised explosive device \ndetonated near his vehicle.\n  Private First Class Han was assigned to the 569th Engineer Company, \n4th Engineer Battalion, Fort Carson, CO.\n  Private First Class Han enlisted in the Army in January of 2008 and \nby December was assigned to the combat engineers. He exhibited an \nastounding sense of devotion to duty in service to our great Nation. He \nreceived numerous recognitions, medals and ribbons for his service, \nincluding the National Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign \nMedal with Campaign Star, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, \nArmy Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon and Combat Action Badge. \nAs a result of his heroic service, Private First Class Han was \nposthumously promoted to specialist.

Mr. President, I want to comment today on the \nconfirmation earlier this week of the Honorable Jacqueline Nguyen to be \njudge on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia. Unfortunately, I was delayed in my return from Alaska, and \nI was unable to be here for the vote. Had I been here, I would have \nproudly cast my vote along with the rest of my Senate colleagues to \nconfirm this highly qualified and well-respected jurist. Upon her \nconfirmation, Judge Nguyen made history by becoming the first \nVietnamese-American to serve as a U.S. district court judge in U.S. \nhistory.\n  I applaud the judge's unanimous confirmation by the Senate as an \nexample of what we do all too infrequently, I am afraid--recognizing a \npublic need and to acting appropriately and expeditiously to address \nit. I commend the President for heeding the recommendation by our \ncolleagues from California and nominating a woman of obvious talent. \nThe President nominated Judge Nguyen, I am sure, because he perceived \nin her a combination of the education, experience, and temperament \nappropriate for a life-tenured position on the federal bench. Her \nunanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary, earned after an 18-year \ncareer in the law, including nearly 7 years as a California Superior \nCourt judge and roughly the same amount of time as an assistant U.S. \nattorney in the same district in which she will now serve as a Federal \njudge, would seem to be completely justified. I have little doubt that \nJudge Nguyen will be an outstanding Federal judge.\n  As impressed as we all should be with her qualifications, I believe \nwe can all look at the details of Judge Nguyen's life as a truly great \nand quintessential American story. Born in Da Lat, Vietnam, Judge \nNguyen and her family were able to escape the approaching North \nVietnamese and Viet Cong armies, departing Saigon in 1975 on a crowded \nhelicopter as gunfire could be heard in the background. The Nguyen \nfamily was part of the great wave of Vietnamese immigrants who left \ntheir homeland to escape the Communist takeover. After stops in refugee \ncamps in the Philippines and on Guam, the Nguyens made their way to \nCalifornia, spending several months living in a tent on the grounds of \nthe Marine base at Camp Pendleton. The Nguyens eventually settled in La \nCrescenta. The judge, her siblings, and their mother cleaned dental \noffices after school and at night, while her father studied to be a \ncomputer programmer and worked in a gas station at night and on \nweekends. Eventually, her parents purchased a doughnut shop in North \nHollywood. Judge Nguyen says she often did her homework during high \nschool between shifts at the doughnut shop and also worked there while \nshe was earning her degree from Occidental College. She would \nultimately earn her law degree from UCLA.\n  I do not know Judge Nguyen, but I am impressed by her accomplishments \nand the drive she and her family have shown in coming to this country \nand embracing the opportunities the United States offers it citizens. I \nrecognize in her story the same drive and love of country that I have \nseen among the Vietnamese-American citizens of Alaska. The United \nStates is a nation made great in part by its diversity. I personally \ntake pride in serving alongside our first African-American President, \nand at the same time as our first Vietnamese-American Federal judge. \nStill, as much as the confirmation of this highly qualified woman is an \nexample of the possibilities available to all Americans, I cannot help \nbut believe it is being hailed today as a point of immense pride by the \nVietnamese-American community in my home State of Alaska, in Judge \nNguyen's State of California, and all across this country. I extend the \njudge, and the Vietnamese-American community, my sincere \ncongratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/03/senate-section/article/S12318-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12318-S12319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             STEM EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, a few weeks ago the Department of \nEducation released application guidelines for the Race to the Top \ncompetitive grant program. I am very encouraged that these guidelines \ninclude a competitive preference for science, technology, engineering, \nand mathematics--or STEM--education. I commend the Department for its \nforesight.\n  Throughout the year, I have spoken many times about how important a \nfocus on science and engineering is to our continued economic recovery. \nEngineers and scientists have always been the world's problem-solvers. \nThey will help us to solve the challenges of clean water; lifesaving \ncures for cancer and disease; clean, renewable petro-free energy; \naffordable-health care; and environmental sustainability.\n  Yet, if we are to tackle these immense challenges, we can no longer \nwait to begin training our Nation's future STEM professionals until \nafter they leave the K-12 education pipeline. That is why I am so \npleased that the Race to the Top grant application emphasizes STEM \neducation. This is just the kind of attention STEM education needs.\n  The Race to the Top fund is designed to reward States that have been \nsuccessful in raising student achievement and have superior plans to \naccelerate education reform. State grant applications must, of course, \nfocus on certain core education reform areas. However, an emphasis on \nSTEM education is considered a competitive preference priority worth 3 \npercent of a State's application score. It is the only competitive \npreference in the Race to the Top application guidelines. Applicants \nwill earn all or none of the designated points, thereby truly rewarding \nsound initiatives.\n  To meet this priority, each State must offer a rigorous course of \nstudy in STEM education. They are encouraged to collaborate with \nindustry professionals, universities, research centers, museums, and \nother STEM-focused community partners. Additionally, each State must \nhave a plan for preparing and assisting teachers in integrating STEM \nthroughout the curriculum. This includes offering applied learning \nopportunities and relevant instruction for students.\n  There are some successful STEM education programs already in \noperation throughout the country. A study released by the National \nAcademy of Engineering in September highlighted a handful of K-12 \nengineering curriculum projects. Other education-based initiatives are \nalso spurring interest among our youth. For example, there is a \nremarkable afterschool program in Wilmington, DE, that I recently spoke \nabout here in the Senate. It inspires high school students to pursue \ncareers in STEM fields by teaching them how to build robots. It is a \ngreat program. All too often, though, these types of opportunities have \nnot been available to all of our Nation's students. The Race to the Top \ngrants will bring more opportunities to more students.\n  Perhaps the most important component for meeting this grant priority \nis that States' plans must prepare more students to pursue college \nmajors and careers in STEM. They must also specifically address the \nneeds of women and underrepresented minorities. The United States \ncannot maintain its position as a technological leader nor can we solve \nthe problems we face without a diversity of perspectives and \nparticipation.\n\n[[Page S12319]]\n\n  Women constitute about half of the students in our higher education \nsystem about half of the overall workforce, but they comprise only \nslightly more than 12 percent of the science and engineering workforce. \nAfrican Americans hold only 4.4 percent of science and engineering \njobs, Hispanics just 3.4 percent. We can, and must, do better, and the \nRace to the Top application guidelines are a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Over $4 billion is available for competitive grants in the Race to \nthe Top program. This is an unprecedented level of discretionary \nfunding for the Department of Education, and States nationwide will be \npulling out all the stops to earn their share of the pie. Many States \nworking months ago to put the correct conditions in place to apply for \nfunds.\n  Moreover, the ``Educate to Innovate'' campaign was recently launched \nby President Obama. This campaign is a nationwide effort of private \ncompanies, universities, foundations, nonprofits, and science and \nengineering societies--working with the Federal Government--to improve \nstudent performance in STEM subjects. As part of this effort, business \nleaders and nonprofits will be joining forces to identify and replicate \nsuccessful STEM programs across the country. For example, Time Warner \nCable and the Coalition of Science After School are creating an online \ndirectory of STEM afterschool programs.

Mr. President, I wish today to recognize MAJ Lamont Atkins \nof the U.S. Air Force, who has been my military legislative fellow for \nthe past year.\n  Lamont is a proud alumnus of the University of Alabama, where he \nearned a bachelor of science in management information systems, and an \navid fan of Alabama's Crimson Tide football team. He also holds a \nmasters of arts in computer resources and Information Management from \nWebster University. With over 11 years in the military, Major Atkins \nbrought a wealth of knowledge and experience to my office. He has \nexcelled in every previous assignment and has received numerous \ncommendations, including several Officer of the Year awards.\n  While Major Atkins' primary duty was to assist my military \nlegislative assistant on defense and veterans' issues, he also made \nsignificant contributions in other areas, including banking, judiciary, \nhealth, and education issues. Major Atkins prepared for Senate Army \nCaucus meetings, researched banking issues, and wrote memos on a \nvariety of topics. Lamont performed beyond expectations. His \nflexibility and willingness to go the extra mile greatly benefited our \noffice.\n  During Lamont's tenure, we transitioned from one military legislative \nassistant to another. Lamont's assistance was crucial to ensuring a \nsmooth transition, and was key in bringing the new military legislative \nassistant up to speed on my initiatives.\n  Major Atkins was stationed at Hickam Air Force Base prior to his \nassignment at the Pentagon. The opportunity of experiencing firsthand \nthe unique needs of the constituents of Hawaii was instrumental to \nLamont's success on our staff, and Lamont displayed the aloha spirit \ndaily.\n  I also extend my sincere aloha to Lamont's wife Karonica and their \nchildren, Lamont Junior and Kendall, whom my staff and I have also had \nthe pleasure of getting to know during Lamont's time in my office. I \nextend my heartfelt aloha and utmost appreciation to Major Atkins for \nhis service to the great State of Hawaii, to the Senate, and to our \nNation. My staff and I will miss him dearly. I wish Lamont and his \n`ohana the very best in their future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/03/senate-section/article/S12319-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   RECOGNIZING MILL CREEK ELEMENTARY\n\n Mr. BOND.

These standards are known as the 3 R's: \nrespect, responsibility, and resourcefulness. Mill Creek hopes to \ninstill these standards within its students so they will use them not \njust at school but also in their homes and their communities.\n  Public education is strengthened when schools have the support of the \nlocal community. KMIZ-17, Rolling Hills Veterinary, Columbia Insurance \nGroup and Boulevard Bank have all stepped forward to be involved at \nMill Creek through the Partners in Education program. These businesses \nprovide time and support to students through mentoring, hands-on \nlessons and even a school weather station.\n  Strong parental involvement also leads to school success. Mill Creek \nbenefits tremendously from the countless PTA and volunteer hours \ndonated by family members and community leaders each year.\n  Mill Creek Elementary has been committed for over 20 years to \nproviding a high quality education to its students and preparing them \nto be leaders in their community.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe renewable production credit for wind and open-loop biomass \nfacilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Clean \nRenewable Energy Advancement Tax Extension Jobs Act of 2009, or the \nCREATE Jobs Act of 2009 for short. This is a bill to help all kinds of \nbusinesses create jobs and continue pushing ahead on the development of \nclean renewable energy. My bill extends the tax credit for the \nproduction of electricity from wind and open-loop biomass through \nDecember 31, 2016.\n  It increases the amount of bond authority for new clean renewable \nenergy bonds to incentivize more clean renewable energy projects and \nthe jobs created by these projects. For all businesses, my bill extends \nbonus depreciation for 1 year, so that businesses are able to deduct \nhalf of the value of any property placed in service in 2010.\n  This tax cut for businesses that invest in new property in 2010 will \nspur investment in clean energy projects, as well as other new \nprojects, and that will create badly needed jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to help me in getting this important legislation \nenacted into law as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2826\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nthe National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to conduct a \nresearch program on endocrine disruption, to prevent and reduce the \nproduction of, and exposure to, chemicals that can undermine the \ndevelopment of children before they are born and cause lifelong \nimpairment to their health and function, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there are approximately 80,000 known \nchemicals in our environment that are potentially harmful. Many of \nthose chemicals are not tested to determine if they are damaging to our \nhealth. This includes products Americans use every day such as \nhousehold cleaners, cosmetics or personal care products.\n  The increased rate of disorders affecting the human endocrine system \nis alarming. Children developing in the womb may be particularly \nvulnerable. We can see the effects in our environment. Some fish in our \nlakes and rivers are developing gender mutations. We know there may be \nconnections between these effects and the chemicals around us and it is \ntime to learn more about it. That is why I am proud to introduce the \nEndocrine Disruption Prevention Act.\n  The Endocrine Disruption Prevention Act simply authorizes the \nNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to conduct a \nresearch program on chemicals that may pose a risk to our health. This \nwill streamline research efforts so more useful and complete data will \nbe available to Federal agencies with the responsibility of regulating \nchemicals. This bill allows agencies to fake action based on findings \nand to report to Congress with what actions were taken.\n  This bill promotes action based on hard, scientific evidence. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, and Mrs. Gillibrand):\n  S. 2829. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe cost of labor for building envelope improvements to be included for \npurposes of the nonbusiness energy property tax credit; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Federal tax code is in great need of an \noverhaul and today I am introducing legislation to fix one small piece \nof it. My legislation will help struggling homeowners who are seeing \ntheir money literally going out the window as their heating costs go \nthrough the roof.\n  The current tax code gives homeowners a tax credit for installing \nenergy efficiency improvements, which is all well and good, but it only \nallows labor costs to be included for improvements inside their homes. \nIf the homeowner is installing a new energy efficient furnace, labor \ncosts are included in the expenses eligible for the tax credit. But for \nimprovements like installing energy efficient windows, or doors, or \ninsulation, or energy efficient roofing materials--improvements where \nlabor is a major part of the cost, the tax credit only covers the cost \nof the materials and not the labor to install them. If this seems \ncounterintuitive and counterproductive, that's because it is. Tilting \nthe tax code to favor some types of home improvements over others is \nnot a sound foundation for tax policy or energy policy.\n  This legislation, which Senators Stabenow and Gillibrand have joined \nwith me to coponsor, will fix this problem by including labor costs for \nall eligible energy efficiency improvements whether to the heating \nsystem or to the roof Our legislation doesn't change the amount of the \noverall credit or the kinds of energy efficiency improvements that can \nbe made. It just makes it clear that the credit applies equally to \nlabor costs to install all of the qualifying residential energy \nefficiency improvements, not just some. This will create a level \nplaying field for homeowners when they are trying to decide which \nimprovements to make especially for more labor intensive projects like \ninstalling insulation or new energy efficient roofing. It will also \nmake all of these building energy saving opportunities more affordable. \nMost importantly, it will help Americans actually save energy and it \nwill create jobs for those workers manufacturing and installing new, \nenergy efficiency products.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2829\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MODIFICATION TO NONBUSINESS ENERGY PROPERTY \n                   CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 25C(c) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end \n     the following flush sentence:\n     `` ``Such term includes expenditures for labor costs properly \n     allocable to the onsite preparation, assembly, or original \n     installation of the component.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to property placed in service after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Udall \n        of New Mexico, Mr. Udall of Colorado, and Mr. Bennet):\n  S. 2830. A bill to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation \nAct of 1977 to clarify that uncertified States and Indian tribes have \nthe authority to use certain payments for certain noncoal reclamation \nprojects; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill important to \npublic health and safety and the environment in the West. This \nlegislation addresses an interpretation by the Department of the \nInterior, DOI, which restricts the ability of States to use certain \nfunds under the Abandoned Mine Land, AML, Program authorized by the \nSurface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, SMCRA, for non-coal mine \nreclamation.\n  The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 contained amendments to \nSMCRA reauthorizing collection of an AML fee on coal produced in the \nU.S. and making certain modifications to the AML program. Under this \nprogram, which is administered by DOI, funds are expended to reclaim \nabandoned mine lands, with top priority for protecting public health, \nsafety, general welfare, and property, and restoration of land and \nwater resources adversely affected by past mining practices. The \nprogram is largely directed to abandoned coal mine reclamation, but \nunder section 409 of SMCRA, funds have been available to address non-\ncoal mine sites.\n  Pursuant to a Memorandum Opinion, M-37014, issued by the DOI's \nSolicitor on December 5, 2007, the Department has interpreted the \namendments in a manner that limits the ability of western States to use \ncertain funds under SMCRA to address significant problems relating to \nnon-coal abandoned mines. This is in spite of the fact that these funds \nhad previously been available for these purposes. In accordance with \nsection 409 of SMCRA, western States such as New Mexico, Colorado, and \nUtah, have prioritized the use of AML funds to undertake the most \npressing reclamation work on both coal and non-coal mine sites. While \nactivities on non-coal sites have consumed a relatively insignificant \nportion of the funding provided for the overall AML program, the \nresults in terms of public health and safety in these States is \nconsiderable, and there is significant work yet to be done. For \nexample, New Mexico alone has over 15,000 remaining mine openings with \na vast majority of these being non-coal. Uranium mine reclamation is a \nparticular priority in New Mexico. All AML-related fatalities in New \nMexico in the last few decades have been at non-coal mine sites.\n  The bill that I am introducing today would correct what I believe is \nan unfortunate interpretation of the 2006 Amendments by modifying the \nlanguage of SMCRA to clarify that the funding would be available for \nnon-coal reclamation as it was prior to the passage of the amendments \nin 2006. Under the bill, which makes a conforming change to sections \n409 and 411 of SMCRA, western, non-certified States\n\n[[Page S12325]]\n\ncould continue to use their State share balances, including amounts \ncomprising their so-called previously unappropriated State share \nbalances, for non-coal reclamation.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this legislation, which has \nimportant implications for abandoned mine clean-up in the West.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2830\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 to require a lifetime income disclosure; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lifetime \nIncome Disclosure Act, to help Americans ensure they do not outlive \ntheir retirement savings. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague on \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Isakson, \nand the Chairman of the Aging Committee, Senator Kohl, in introducing \nthe Act. In sum, the Act would require private defined contribution \nretirement plans annually to show plan participants how their account \nbalances translate into monthly income equivalents, based on age at \nretirement and other factors. The act is structured so as not to impose \na material burden on employers.\n  As life expectancies rise, individuals have an increasing need for \nprotection against the risk that they will outlive their savings. In \nfact, Boston College's National Retirement Risk Index recently found \nthat half of American households are ``at risk'' of being unable to \nmaintain their pre-retirement standard of living in retirement.\n  But trends in retirement plan coverage are only increasing this risk. \nDefined benefit pension plans--to which employers make regular fixed \ncontributions--are becoming rare. Individuals who receive any form of \nworkplace retirement account are increasingly offered the opportunity \nto contribute to defined contribution plans, like 401(k)s, to which the \nemployer may or may not provide a matching contribution. At present, \n401(k) plan statements typically provide a total account balance, but \nnot a monthly income equivalent. Consequently, employees are not well-\nprepared to evaluate whether they are saving adequately to maintain \ncost of their current standard of living in retirement.\n  To address this challenge, the act would require that defined \ncontribution plans subject to ERISA, such as 401(k) plans, include \n``annuity equivalents'' on benefit statements provided to employees. An \nannuity equivalent is the monthly annuity payment that would be made if \nthe employee's total account balance were used to buy a life annuity \nthat commenced payments at the plan's normal retirement age, generally \n65. The act requires the statement to show the monthly annuity payments \nunder both a single life annuity and a qualified joint and survivor \nannuity--that is, an annuity with survivor benefits payable for life to \nthe employee's spouse. The annuity equivalents would only be required \nto be provided once a year, even where quarterly statements are \notherwise required.\n  In this regard, 401(k) benefit statements would become better \ncoordinated with Social Security benefit statements, which only express \nbenefits in the form of a life annuity. Knowing the amount of monthly \nincome they can expect from Social Security and their define \ncontribution plan will help employees determine whether they are on the \npath to a secure retirement. Additionally, including annuity \nequivalents on benefit statements will make employees more aware of the \npossibility upon retirement of receiving at least a portion of their \nbenefit in the form of an annuity that protects them against outliving \ntheir savings.\n  As I have already discussed, this proposal addresses a critical \npublic policy issue. But it is equally important that the proposal be \nstructured not to impose any material burden or potential liability on \nemployers that voluntarily maintain a plan. Thus, the act directs the \nDepartment of Labor to issue, within a year, assumptions that employers \nmay use in converting a lump sum amount into an annuity equivalent. \nAccordingly, employers will be able to base their annuity equivalents \nentirely on clear mechanical assumptions prescribed by the DOL. Of \ncourse, to the extent that a participant's benefit is or may be \ninvested in an annuity contract that guarantees a specified annuity \nbenefit, the DOL shall, to the extent appropriate, permit such \nspecified benefit to be treated as an annuity equivalent.\n  The DOL would further be directed to issue, within a year, a model \ndisclosure that explains the assumptions used to determine the annuity \nequivalents and the fact that the annuity equivalents provided are only \nestimates. This model disclosure would include a clear explanation that \nactual annuity benefits may be materially different from such \nestimates.\n  The act also provides employers with a clear path to avoid liability: \nunder the act, employers and service providers using the model \ndisclosure and following the prescribed assumptions and DOL rules would \nnot have any liability with regard to the provision of annuity \nequivalents. This exemption from liability would apply to any \ndisclosure of an annuity equivalent that incorporates the explanation \nfrom the model disclosure and that is prepared in accordance with the \nprescribed assumptions and DOL rules. For example, subject to such \nconditions, the exemption would apply to annuity equivalents available \non a Web site or provided quarterly.\n  Finally, the act would not go into effect until a year after the DOL \nhas issued the guidance needed by employers to implement the new rules.\n  Our proposal is a small step, but one that can make a significant \ndifference in beginning to tackle a key policy challenge. I am pleased \nthat the act enjoys the support of many advocates for retirement \nsecurity, including AARP, the Women's Institute for a Secure \nRetirement, and the Council of Independent 401(k) Recordkeepers. I look \nforward to working with Senators Isakson and Kohl to see these \nprovisions enacted into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2832\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide adjusted Federal medical assistance \npercentage rates during a transitional assistance period; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Transitional \nFederal Medical Assistance Percentage, FMAP, Act, and I am pleased to \ndo so with the support of Senators Brown, Whitehouse, Akaka, Durbin, \nKlobuchar, and Begich. This bill is an important step in continuing the \nconversation about how we can help our States, businesses, and \nindividuals as our economy recovers.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, the economic downturn has been \nparticularly hard hitting on families and businesses. As a result, the \nState has seen a decline in tax revenue and an increased enrollment in \nsafety net programs like Medicaid. Revenue from the sales tax is down \nover 7 percent, income tax receipts are down 2.3 percent, and corporate \ntax revenue is down nearly 10 percent. At the same time, unemployment \nrates have soared to new heights, topping 13 percent earlier this year. \nIn the past 2 years, 40,000 Rhode Islanders have lost their employer-\nsponsored health insurance. Many of these individuals have come to rely \non Medicaid for health coverage. This has caused great strain on the \nState's resources and its Medicaid program. In November, we learned \nthat the estimated Medicaid caseload for the year will cost over $40 \nmillion more than what the State had initially estimated in its budget.\n  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which I supported, \nprovided States with additional Federal assistance through 2010. States \nhave used these funds to help balance their budgets, minimize harmful \ncuts in public services, and, very importantly, to prevent tax \nincreases in many cases. However, even with the funding from the \nRecovery Act, Rhode Island will close the current fiscal year $219.8 \nmillion in the red.\n  A total of 38 States have looked ahead to fiscal year 2011, and they \nhave estimated $92 billion in combined deficits in the coming year. As \nthe State fiscal year nears, and more States have had ample time to \nanalyze their fiscal health it is expected that the total shortfall \nwill likely equal $180 billion.\n  As Congress debates health reform and works to ensure that every \nAmerican has access to health insurance in 2014, we must not forget \nabout ensuring that Americans have access to health insurance between \nnow and then, as the economy slowly recovers and as state budgets begin \nto heal. During this tough time we need to help individuals, \nbusinesses, and States, and I am particularly concerned with making \nsure our States have the resources to provide adequate health care.\n  Unless Congress acts on FMAP legislation, States will be forced to \nuse their limited resources to cover an expanded Medicaid population \nbeginning in January 2011. Since States are planning their fiscal year \n2011 budgets, which will begin in July, many Governors are requesting \nCongress act now to provide States with additional Federal support.\n  The Transitional FMAP Act would extend the enhanced FMAP funding \nwhich we passed in the Recovery Act for two additional quarters. This \nextension accounts for the prolonged recession and ensures that the \npressure of Medicaid needs do not overwhelm the States. The bill would \nalso begin a slow decrease of enhanced FMAP funding from July 2011 \nthrough December 2013. This will help States as they recover and ensure \nthat States do not experience a gap in assistance prior to health \nreform-related FMAP levels beginning in January 2014.\n  Mr. President, this additional funding is important for States, \nbusinesses, and individuals. I know that Chairman Baucus and Leader \nReid are well aware of the importance of FMAP and have a history to \nworking to aid our States. I look forward to working with them and my \nother colleagues to provide States with necessary additional Federal \nMedicaid assistance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2833\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with my \ncolleague Senator Voinovich, the Security Clearance Modernization and \nReporting Act of 2009.\n  Since 2005, our Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal \nWorkforce, and the District of Columbia has held a series of six \noversight hearings on the serious shortfalls of the Federal \nGovernment's ability to effectively and efficiently issue security \nclearances to federal employees and contractors.\n  This issue was placed on the Government Accountability Office's, GAO, \nHigh-Risk List in 2005. Since then, through the strong oversight of our \nSubcommittee and hard work of those in the government dedicated to \nreforming and modernizing the security clearance process, the \ntremendous backlog of security clearance investigations has all but \nvanished, and clearance determinations are made much more quickly. \nWhile progress has been made, we must use this opportunity to continue \nto push for fundamental changes to the clearance process to ensure that \nwe do not experience the same problems in the future.\n  In 2004, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, IRTPA, \nP.L. 108-458, required 90 percent of clearances to be completed within \nan average of 60 days by December 2009. At the time, it took almost a \nyear to complete a Top Secret clearance request. IRTPA also required \nthat agencies recognize clearance determinations made by other agencies \nto ensure reciprocity of clearances. An Executive Order was issued to \nimplement these requirements, designating the Office of Management and \nBudget, OMB, as the agency responsible for setting security clearance \npolicy and calling on the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, to \nconduct clearance investigations. Unfortunately, clearance timeliness \ncontinued to be unacceptably slow.\n  After continued pressure from our Subcommittee and other \nstakeholders, in 2008, OMB brought together the Department of Defense, \nthe Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ODNI, and OPM to \ncreate a plan to overhaul and streamline the clearance process \ngovernment-wide. At the recommendation of this reform team, a new \nexecutive order was issued creating a governance structure for \noverseeing and modernizing the federal government's security clearance \nand suitability processes. The members of the reform team were \ndesignated as the Suitability and Security Clearance Performance \nAccountability Council, PAC.\n  Since the creation of the PAC and the implementation of some reforms, \nincluding enhanced application processes, new clearance standards, and \nplans for electronic adjudication and reevaluation, timeliness of \nclearances has greatly improved. Already, agencies are generally \nmeeting goals laid out by the IRTPA. However, this has required \ntremendous effort and a surge in investigation capacity over several \nyears to address backlogs.\n  The bill that we are introducing today would address the lingering \nconcerns over the clearance process and help sustain the momentum for \nreforming and modernizing the security clearance and suitability \ndetermination processes.\n  First, to ensure accountability in security clearance reform and \nmodernization, it is necessary to produce more detailed timeliness \nreporting. Today, OMB only reports the average timeliness of the 90 \nfastest percent of clearances. At our Subcommittee hearings, the GAO \nhas repeatedly called for expanded reporting. It is important that we \nlook at the timeliness of the whole process. Our legislation would \nrequire more complete reporting on timeliness for all clearances, not \njust the 90 percent that we see today. For the first time, it would \nrequire OMB to break down the numbers based on types of clearances and \nemployee groups, and to report on which agencies are complying with \nreciprocal recognition of clearances. While the current IRTPA reporting \nrequirements end in 2011, our legislation would extend these \nrequirements to ensure that we receive reports until GAO has concluded \nthis is no longer a high-risk issue.\n  To ensure consistent leadership, our bill would codify the \nPerformance Accountability Council, which has been the catalyst for \nmuch of the reform we have seen to date. It is critical that we codify \nthe PAC as its future was in doubt during the presidential transition \nas the new administration reviewed previous executive orders.\n  GAO has also urged the creation of new metrics that would measure not \nonly the timeliness of clearance determinations, but also the quality \nand completeness of investigations. These metrics should be defined \nthrough the creation of a comprehensive strategic plan for clearance \nmodernization. In response to GAO's recommendations, the legislation \nwould require the PAC to create a comprehensive strategic plan. This \nplan would outline reform goals, establish performance measures, create \na more robust communications strategy, define clear roles and \nresponsibilities for stakeholders, and examine funding needs in order \nto keep reforms on track.\n  Finally, this bill would require that the PAC undertake a more \ncomprehensive information technology assessment than it has to date. \nToday, dozens of intertwined systems are used in the clearance process. \nThese systems are a patchwork of outdated technology owned by different \nagencies. Rather than conducting an inventory of the current technology \nin use, as the PAC has already done, our bill would require a true \nneeds assessment to define the most effective information technology \napproach.\n  Our Subcommittee, under both my leadership and that of Senator \nVoinovich, has worked in a bipartisan manner on this issue seamlessly \nfor several years and our oversight has yielded positive results. It is \nvital, from both a human capital perspective and a national security \nperspective, that security clearances and suitability determinations be \nof the highest quality and made in a timely manner. We must work to \nmake sure this issue is removed from the High-Risk List as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S12331]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2834\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friend and \nChairman on the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee, \nSenator Akaka, to ensure that security clearance reform efforts begun \nin recent years continue by cosponsoring the Security Clearance \nModernization and Reporting Act of 2009.\n  Since the 1990s, the Government's Accountability Office, GAO, has \ndocumented problems with the Department of Defense's, DoD, personnel \nsecurity clearance program, and in 2005 added the program to its high-\nrisk list. DoD's personnel security clearance program has remained on \nthe 2007 and 2009 high risk lists.\n  In an effort to address this matter and improve the security \nclearance process, Congress set benchmarks for the time taken to issue \nclearances in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n2004, IRTPA. IRTPA also required the President to select a single \nagency or office to oversee the security clearance process across the \nfederal government and required uniform policies regarding the security \nclearance process, reciprocal recognition of security clearances among \nagencies, an evaluation of technology to expedite security clearance \nprocesses, and a plan to reduce the length of the security clearance \nprocess. While progress has been made to decrease the amount of time it \ntakes to obtain a security clearance, more improvement is needed to \nfully reform the security clearance process, but reform efforts have \nbeen delayed this year by an interagency review of the security \nclearance reform initiatives undertaken over the past several years.\n  To ensure that the good work begun with passage of IRTPA in 2004, I \nam pleased to cosponsor Senator Akaka's legislation that extends \nIRTPA's reporting requirements relating to security clearance reform \nefforts beyond their current 2011 expiration date and requires more \ndetails in those reports about the amount of time required by \nindividual agencies to conduct both security clearance investigations \nand adjudications. To ensure that efforts begun over the past several \nyears continue, the bill codifies portions of Executive Order 13467, \nwhich deals with reforming processes related to eligibility for access \nto classified information. The bill also calls for the development of \nthe strategic plan GAO has been asking for since the DoD personnel \nsecurity clearance program was put on its high risk list in 2005 and \nrequires a more detailed information technology strategy relating to \nsecurity clearance reform efforts.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this bill and thank the Senator from Hawaii \nfor his work on this legislation to address such an important issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Kaufman, Mrs. \n        Gillibrand, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 2835. A bill to reduce global warming pollution through \ninternational climate finance, investment, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n[[Page S12333]]\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee and my colleagues to introduce an important \npiece of legislation, the International Climate Change Investment Act \nof 2009. Climate change is a global issue and only a concerted \ninternational response can succeed. This legislation provides key \nelements of an international deal that will both protect our planet and \nmeet our Nation's international responsibilities. Even more importantly \nin these times, it will open the door to a green economy that can \ncreate jobs here for the markets abroad for clean energy goods and \nservices.\n  Successful global climate negotiations will create the opportunity \nfor us to transform our own economy, to free ourselves from dependence \non fossil fuels from foreign sources, and to create the jobs and \nmarkets for a new, sustainable economy.\n  This legislation establishes a new framework for a global market in \nclean energy technologies. A complete agenda to confront climate change \nwill include support for our educational base and for the research, \ndevelopment, and deployment of clean technologies. A climate deal that \nmoves us away from fossil fuels will create global demand for those \ntechnologies. Building capacity and encouraging dramatic change in \nother countries will create a pool of customers for America's \ninnovators.\n  That global market offers us the best chance to create a new economy \nbased on a growing demand for clean energy goods and services--and that \nwill support job creation and profits here at home. Companies in my \nhome state of Delaware and across America are ready and eager to seize \nthis opportunity for a world's worth of new markets. Our smartest \ninvestors agree.\n  This legislation shows the rest of the world that we are ready to do \nour part to make a smart, effective, and fair international climate \nchange agreement work. It sets us on a firm forward footing to lead the \nway in tomorrow's green economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/03/senate-section/article/S12333-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 367--RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \nENACTMENT OF THE VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT OF 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10601 ET SEQ.) \n   AND THE SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CRIME VICTIMS FUND MADE \nTHROUGH THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS CONDUCTED BY THE FINANCIAL LITIGATION \n             UNITS OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS' OFFICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Ms. Klobuchar) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today \nconfirmed Victoria Espinel as the Nation's first intellectual property \nenforcement coordinator. This position was created by legislation that \nI introduced last year and is vital to protect the intellectual \nproperty interests of United States innovators and companies. \nIntellectual property rights promote innovation and creativity, and the \nprotection of those rights is critical during this time of economic \nuncertainty.\n  Ms. Espinel is extremely well qualified to serve as the President's \nintellectual property enforcement coordinator. She has an extensive \nbackground in intellectual property issues, both foreign and domestic, \nand has experience in government and in the private sector. Ms. Espinel \nserved in the Bush administration as the Assistant United States Trade \nRepresentative for Intellectual Property and Innovation. This is a \nnomination that deserves bipartisan support. American innovation and \nour intellectual property protection should not be a partisan issue.\n  The legislation by which we created this position took a \ncomprehensive approach to intellectual property protection by providing \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement with the tools and resources \nthey need to combat intellectual property theft. The legislation \ncreated an interagency advisory committee to develop a more efficient \nand cohesive approach to protecting American intellectual property. I \nam confident that Ms. Espinel will work well with that committee.\n  I look forward to working with Ms. Espinel to improve the efficiency \nand effectiveness of our intellectual property enforcement efforts. I \nknow her family, and was delighted to chair her confirmation hearing. I \ncongratulate her on her Senate confirmation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/03/senate-section/article/S12352-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
