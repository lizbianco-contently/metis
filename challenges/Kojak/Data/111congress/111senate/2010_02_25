Madam President, I rise this morning to thank our \ndistinguished guest Chaplain, Dr. Benny Tate, of Milner, GA, who has \nbrought us an inspirational message with which to begin our day.\n  Dr. Tate is the senior pastor of Rock Springs Church in Milner, GA, \nand has served his congregation well for 20 years. When Dr. Tate began \npreaching at Rock Springs Church, only 20 people came to worship on a \ngiven Sunday. Today, Dr. Benny Tate preaches to more than 4,000 people \non any given Sunday. Rock Springs Church is now the largest church in \nthe Congregational Methodist denomination.\n  Dr. Tate is the kind of pastor who finds creative ways to go out to \nthe community and spread the word of God. He hosts the ``Apples of \nGold'' radio program, reaching out to central Georgians through 15 \nradio stations.\n  He has worked with local civic organizations, leading his flock by \nexample. He served as the Chappell Mill Fire Station Chaplain and as a \nGeorgia\n\n[[Page S758]]\n\nYouth Camp board member, just to name a couple of his activities. He \nhas also written three books as well as pieces for the local Griffin \nDaily News.\n  One of his books has been read by both my wife and myself and has a \nvery unique and very appropriate title called ``Happy Wife, Happy \nLife.'' All of us males have a great appreciation for that title.\n  I have had the privilege of attending Dr. Benny Tate's church on many \noccasions. I have always found Rock Springs Church to be a very holy, \nspirit-filled church.\n  Dr. Tate has a very unique way of spreading the gospel in a manner \nthat is mixed with humor and yet direct, personal feelings and the word \nof the Holy Spirit and the message that Jesus Christ gives to him. In \nshort, he has effected positive changes in the church and the community \nthrough his outreach. We appreciate his efforts and his words of \nworship this morning, and I am very pleased to have my dear friend, Dr. \nBenny Tate, with us today.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as are many of us, I have been watching \nwith great interest the bipartisan health care summit that is being \nbroadcast on television. I am happy there is a bipartisan meeting at \nthe White House to discuss health care reform. The practicalities are \nthat only 38 of the 535 Members of Congress can participate directly in \nthe summit, but I know that representatives of our political parties \nare there, along with the President. They are talking about something \nthat is very near and dear to all of our hearts, and that is how to \nbring down the costs of health care which is priced out of the reach of \nmany of the American people, including too many in my State of Texas.\n  Unfortunately, sometimes in Washington what happens is, you see what \nis happening on TV or what is happening on the floor of the Senate, and \nit looks like one thing. Then you find out that behind the scenes \nsomething very different is happening. What I am speaking about in \nparticular is, in contrast to a bipartisan summit on health care, my \nunderstanding is there are efforts underway on the part of the staff of \nthe majority party to consider the use of reconciliation to try to pass \nan unpopular health care bill with 51 votes on a party-line basis.\n  I think that contrast between what people are seeing on TV and what \nis actually happening behind the scenes is pretty telling. I would say \nit is disappointing because I think health care reform is too \nimportant. It affects one-sixth of our economy. It affects 300 million \nAmericans. It is simply too significant a step to take to try to do so \nstrictly along partisan party lines.\n  So while it is true that reconciliation has been used in the past, it \nhas never been used for anything such as this. This would be \nunprecedented. I think it would be an act of defiance toward the \nAmerican people who overwhelmingly disapprove of this legislation.\n  There is no doubt that we need health care reform. Premiums have more \nthan doubled over the last decade. Medicare, which provides access to \nhealth care for our seniors, has a $38 trillion unfunded liability \nwhich translates into an IOU for every American family in the amount of \n$325,000.\n  If we heard anything out of the recent election in Massachusetts, I \nthink it is that the American people think there is too much spending \nand too much borrowing taking place in Washington, DC; too many \nresponsibilities, such as this unfunded Medicare liability, that are \nsimply not being met.\n  We know Medicaid continues to be problematic in not providing access \nto enough low-income people who are ostensibly beneficiaries of \nMedicaid. In the Metroplex in Texas, Dallas-Fort Worth, only 38 percent \nof doctors will see a new Medicaid patient because reimbursement rates \nare so low. That is not keeping the promise of access. It is, \nunfortunately, too much like appearing to do one thing on the one hand \nand actually delivering something far different on the other hand.\n  I think everyone agrees we need to solve these important problems. \nBut how we go about solving the problem is important to maintaining the \nconfidence and trust of the American people. I think bipartisanship on \nthis subject is absolutely crucial.\n  After Massachusetts sent our newest Senator, Scott Brown, to \nWashington, we know there was more talk about bipartisanship. But \ninstead of working together to solve these problems, bipartisanship has \nso often translated into: Take it or leave it; if we can do this \nstrictly with a majority party vote, we will.\n  That is what happened on Christmas Eve. I remember that 7 a.m. vote \non Christmas Eve when 60 Senators on the other side voted to pass a \nhealth care bill that the American people have simply said in poll \nafter poll they do not want. Of course, now we see the White House \nrepackaging an unpopular House bill with an unpopular Senate bill and \nposting 11 pages on the White House Web site and claiming this is \nsomehow a package that is sacrosanct and cannot be touched. But in no \nsense could it possibly be considered a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation. To only let the majority party say: Well, this is the \nbasic template, and you can tweak it around the edges but you cannot \nchange any part of it--that is not bipartisanship.\n  So now after the election of Senator Scott Brown, who campaigned on \nthe pledge that he would be the 41st vote to defeat the Senate health \ncare bill because of its spending, its raising taxes, and its raising \npremiums on people with insurance, its taking $\\1/2\\ trillion from \nMedicare--already another fiscally unsustainable entitlement program, \nwith $38 trillion in unfunded liabilities--to create yet another \nentitlement program, the people of Massachusetts sent Senator Scott \nBrown here to stop the health care bill that they don't want.\n  Now we find the majority party wanting to use reconciliation, a \nhyperpartisan tactic, to ram a bill through that the American people \nhave rejected, most recently in Massachusetts. If we are talking about \ntrying to regain the public's confidence, not only is bipartisanship \nimportant in terms of bringing solutions to health care but \ntransparency is crucial when we are talking about something so big that \naffects so many.\n  You will remember in 2008 when President Obama was Senator Obama \nrunning for President of the United States, he promised to broadcast \nnegotiations on C-SPAN for the American people to see who was arguing \non their behalf and who was not.\n  In stark contrast, again, between what was said then and what was \nactually done, we saw the White House cutting deals with special \ninterest groups, such as the pharmaceutical industry. We saw individual \nSenators demand and get special deals for their States as a condition \nto giving their votes to pass that bill.\n  As much as anything else in the bill, I think the way the bill was \npassed with the sweetheart deals, secret negotiations, and lack of \ntransparency turned the American people off to these health care bills. \nI know the President said that after his election Washington would not \nbe business as\n\n[[Page S759]]\n\nusual. Unfortunately, it has been, and the American people don't like \nit.\n  This subject--health care reform--is too big and too important and \ntoo costly to do through sweetheart deals, backroom negotiations, and \nwith utter disregard for transparency. The American people are smarter \nthan I think many folks in Washington, DC, give them credit for because \nthey know this health care proposal is not lasting reform, and it \nsimply would not work as advertised.\n  The White House proposal will still increase premiums on American \nfamilies; that is, if you have health insurance now, this White House \nproposal, an amalgam of the Senate and House bills, will raise your \ninsurance premiums because of costly Federal Government mandates. But \nthis White House bill does one thing the Senate bill did not. It \nactually spends $75 billion more than the Senate bill that passed this \nbody on Christmas Eve, at 7 a.m.\n  The White House bill does share some common elements with the Senate \nproposal. It still cuts nearly $500 billion from Medicare to create a \nnew entitlement program, including a program that is very popular in my \nState called Medicare Advantage, which gives seniors access to more \nchoices and the quality care they like. Rather than allow them to \ncontinue to keep that Medicare benefit, this proposal, the White House \nbill--like the Senate bill--would cut $500 billion from Medicare, \nincluding Medicare Advantage.\n  The basic problem, again, is that we call this ``health care \nreform,'' but the health care bill offers no long-term plan for the \nMedicare Program's solvency--in other words, that $38 trillion I \nmentioned a moment ago. This actually makes it worse by taking another \n$\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare and makes things worse, not better, \nwhen it comes to the program's long-term solvency. I simply think the \nchoice the President has made, and that the Senate and House health \ncare bills have made, to force millions of low-income people onto \nMedicaid is simply not right, giving them no choices but a government-\nrun program which, as I mentioned earlier, denies them access too many \ntimes to a doctor because they cannot find a doctor who will see \npatients and accept government rates for Medicaid reimbursements.\n  I mentioned the 38-percent figure in the Metroplex of Dallas-Fort \nWorth. Only 38 percent of the doctors there will see these patients \nbecause of the rates. Yet these health care bills force millions of \npeople onto that program along with, in the process, promising them \naccess to care but then not delivering as advertised.\n  Then there is this problem. As you know, the Medicaid Program--the \ncost of that is borne by the Federal Government and the State \ngovernments. In my State alone, the health and human services \ncommission in Texas estimates that the expansion of Medicaid under the \nPresident's proposal will cost Texas taxpayers an additional $24.3 \nbillion over the next 10 years. That $24.3 billion is an unfunded \nmandate that is contained in this bill.\n  Where does that money come from? Well, too often--I think some of our \nformer Governors will tell you that what happens is, that is money that \nhas to be used for an unfunded mandate from the Federal Government that \ncomes from education, higher education budgets, law enforcement \nbudgets, and other State priorities. It is simply irresponsible for \nCongress to force on State taxpayers this responsibility to pay for \nthis unfunded mandate when there are other priorities the States have \nchosen that they think are important--things such as education, as I \nmentioned, and law enforcement.\n  The unfunded mandate in this bill is simply unacceptable. The Wall \nStreet Journal summed up the President's proposal this way:\n\n       It manages to take the worst of both the House and Senate \n     bills and combine them into something more destructive. . . .\n       It includes more taxes, more subsidies, and even less cost \n     control than the Senate bill.\n       And it purports to fix the special interest favors in the \n     Senate bill not by eliminating them--but by expanding them to \n     everyone.\n\n  We know the furor it caused across the country when some Senators \nwere able to negotiate more favorable Medicaid reimbursements than the \nrest of the country and when everybody found out those who were not in \nthose favored States would end up paying for those special favors that \nwere necessary in order to get 60 votes. This bill doesn't repeal \nthose; it simply expands them to everybody, vastly increasing the cost \nof this legislation and making it even worse, not better.\n  The President and his congressional allies who support this \nlegislation seem to think the only reason the American people oppose \nthese bills is ``misinformation.'' I suggest we simply look at the \nfacts--in this case straight from the Congressional Budget Office--and \nsee what they, the official scorekeeper for Congress, have to say about \nthese pieces of legislation.\n\n  The CBO said premiums for those who have health insurance of some \nkind--85 percent of the American people--whether it is through \ngovernment programs like Medicare, the VA, or the like, but those who \nhave private insurance, their premiums will go up by 10 to 13 percent \nor an average of $2,100 for families buying policies on their own. That \nis in the individual market where most small businesses and individuals \nhave to shop for their insurance. Their health insurance premiums will \ngo up an average of $2,100 a family or 10 to 13 percent.\n  No wonder the more people learn about this legislation the less \npopular it becomes, and individuals who get health care through small \nbusinesses or larger employers, which is 83 percent of Americans, will \nsee the status quo. They will see their premiums continue to increase \nby 5 to 6 percent a year.\n  I thought health care reform was about bringing down the cost and \nmaking it more affordable, ``bending the cost curve,'' to use the \njargon that has been used here time after time over the last year and a \nhalf. But we find out that for those in the individual market, premiums \nwill go up 10 to 13 percent. For those in the larger employer market, \nit will go up 5 to 6 percent. It will not bend the cost curve down. It \nwill either be ineffective at all and keep premiums basically where \nthey would have been anyway or it will make it worse.\n  Then there is the gamesmanship in how it deals with the budget \ndeficit. Here is what CBO said about the bill's impact on the budget \ndeficit:\n\n       Washington budget gimmicks allow the White House to pretend \n     the bills reduce the deficit by $132 billion, which is a \n     fraction of Washington's $1.3 trillion budget deficit.\n\n  Americans don't believe ``reducing the deficit'' is possible at the \nsame time we are spending $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years, and \nthey are right. It is easy to pretend we are reducing the deficit when \nwe are raising taxes by $500 billion and taking another $500 billion \nfrom Medicare in order to pay for this program.\n  The Obama administration's own actuaries have worried that future \nCongresses would not let the $500 billion in Medicare cuts happen. In \nother words, the bills spend now but would not pay later.\n  I assume the majority leader will bring up the doc fix sometime soon \nbecause he needs to. The 23-percent cut in reimbursement rates for \ndoctors who don't take Medicare patients is not taken care of in this \nbill, and it should be. If this is really about health care reform, \nshouldn't it be making sure that our seniors on Medicare have access to \ndoctors and that they can actually find a doctor who will see them? If \nyou cut 23 percent in the doctor reimbursement rates, which is where we \nare headed now, they are not going to have access to doctors.\n  Here is what the Obama administration's own experts say about the \ncost curve. The Senate bill, they say, will increase overall American \nhealth care expenditures by $222 billion.\n  It will not bend the cost curve down. It will actually bend it up, \nmaking things worse, not better.\n  The American people have been pretty smart about this. They have been \nmore engaged, better informed on this subject than I have seen in a \nlong time. Of course, health care reform is a very complicated area. \nBut they have gotten very well informed about it. They want lasting \nreform that will lower costs.\n  Here is what we know works to lower costs, but this is not something \nthat is in the President's bill and, apparently, not something the \nmajority party is even willing to consider. If they did, I submit this \nwould be a big step forward to bending the cost curve down, making \nhealth care more affordable, and\n\n[[Page S760]]\n\nyield a bipartisan product the American people could support.\n  I believe we need to give control over health care dollars to \npatients, not to Washington bureaucrats or to insurance company \nbureaucrats either. The American Academy of Actuaries found that \nconsumer-driven health care plans have saved as much as 12 to 20 \npercent in health care premiums--12 to 20 percent. That is a lot.\n  Then, of course, there is a practice of defensive medicine, ending \nlawsuit abuse which would save $54 billion over the next 10 years, \naccording to the CBO.\n  We also support allowing small businesses to pool together such as \nbig companies do to pool their risks to help bring down premium costs. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, this would lower premiums \nfor small businesses by 2 to 3 percent--that is not a huge amount, but \nI am sure they will tell you every little bit helps--and in conjunction \nwith these other reforms would have a real, meaningful impact in terms \nof bringing down health care costs.\n  I also support and our side of the aisle supports allowing Americans \nto purchase health insurance from any State they want to, and that \nwould create national competition. It would allow people to buy \npolicies they can afford that suited their family's needs rather than \nthose loaded with State government mandates with no choices, which \nwould result in higher costs.\n  If Congress would allow Americans to purchase their health insurance \nin any State they choose and thereby increasing competition, the \nCongressional Budget Office says the cost of their health care premiums \nwould go down by 5 percent.\n  Clearly, competition, transparency, keeping the power in the hands of \nthe consumer not in government are some of the things that would lower \nthe costs, not cause them to go up. Are these part of the bipartisan \nhealth summit at the White House? Unfortunately, apparently not.\n  I would also support--and I think there would be a lot of support on \na bipartisan basis--giving Medicaid patients, the ones who cannot find \ndoctors because of low reimbursement rates, premium assistance; that \nis, to supplement what they can pay so they can buy private sector \ncoverage which pays doctors at more of a level they would accept in \nterms of seeing those Medicaid patients. Providing Medicaid premium \nassistance rather than forcing people onto a Medicaid Program that is \ndysfunctional and does not work would be an improvement, and you could \ndo it cheaper. According to CBO, this would reduce Federal spending by \n$12 billion over 10 years.\n  My conclusion from all this is, the American people want us to start \nover. We need lasting health care reform. I have offered some concrete \nsuggestions on how we could lower the costs and make it more \naffordable. I believe that if Republicans and Democrats can work \ntogether, we can achieve it. On something as big and important and as \ncostly as this, we need to do it on a bipartisan basis. It needs to be \ntransparent. It needs to be devoid of special interest deals and secret \nnegotiations and done out in the open where people can see it and trust \nit for what it is.\n  We have to reject purported solutions that will do nothing but \nincrease spending, increase taxes, and increase premiums. We need to \nstart over and implement commonsense steps that will lower costs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, this afternoon it is my understanding we \nare going to have one more vote. It is going to be on the Travel \nPromotion Act. I have opposed this in the past. I have already voted \nagainst it three times. I am not going to hang here and waste the whole \nday just to vote against it a fourth time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I make a very brief statement and it be \nprinted in the Record immediately following the vote that takes place \nthis afternoon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      American Hikers Held in Iran\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the ongoing \nimprisonment of three young Americans--Joshua Fattal from Pennsylvania \nand two other Americans who have been in prison in Iran with him, Sarah \nShourd and Shane Bauer. These are three Americans who have now spent \nmore than 7 months in solitary confinement in Iran's Evin Prison for \nallegedly crossing a poorly marked border, the border between Iran and \nIraq.\n  Since their detention along the Iran-Iraq border on July 31, 2009, \nthe Iranian Government has refused requests from their attorney for \nvisits. The Government of Iran has delayed due process and rejected \nrequests from family members to call or visit them. The Iranian regime \nhas also delayed requests for Iranian visas for the families and \nstonewalled the Swiss Embassy's attempt to carry out diplomatic visits.\n  The longer the detainment of these young Americans continues, the \nmore clear it becomes to the international community that the Iranian \nGovernment, the Iranian regime, is engaged in political games rather \nthan seeking to grant them a fair and timely judicial process. On this \nbasis, I request that Supreme Leader Khamenei, President Ahmadinejad, \nJudiciary Chief Larijani, and other Iranian officials make the humane \nand just decision to release Josh, Sarah, and Shane immediately.\n  Keeping these three innocent Americans in prison without due process \nviolates the international human rights standards as well as Iran's own \nlaws. It has been more than 2 months since Foreign Minister Motaki \nclaimed they would be tried in court. Yet no trial date has been set. \nAccording to Iranian law, no detainee can be held temporarily for more \nthan 4 months; thus, judiciary officials must either schedule a court \nhearing or set the three young Americans free. The only conclusion the \ninternational community can draw from the Iranian Government's words \nand actions is that they intend to keep these three young Americans in \nlimbo for domestic or foreign policy aims. It has nothing to do with \nthe actions or intentions of these three American tourists who were \nsimply admiring the natural beauty of the Kurdish mountains near the \nIran-Iraq border. The world is a much worse off place when idealism, \nespecially held by innocent young people, is squashed by cynical \npolitics.\n\n[[Page S761]]\n\n  Among ancient Persia's greatest legacies is a transparent and \nefficient justice system. Innocent people do not appear on the court \ndocket. We ask the Iranian Government--we ask them to send the world \nthe unambiguous message that transparent, timely, and fair judicial \nprocesses remain a cornerstone of Iranian civilization. Keeping Josh, \nSarah, and Shane indefinitely in solitary confinement and without \naccess to legal counsel or their families is unjust and is sure to \ncolor the visions of Iranian society for young people the world over.\n  Do not make Josh, Sarah, Shane, and their desperately concerned \nparents wait another day before being reunited. Supreme Leader \nKhamenei, release these young hikers now.\n\n\n                              Unemployment\n\n  Madam President, in addition to those remarks about those young \nAmericans, I want to talk for a few minutes about unemployment and what \nis happening, certainly across the country but in particular in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. We have 560,000 people out of work right \nnow in Pennsylvania. Our rate is lower than a lot of places, but we \nstill have that many people out of work, a very high number--maybe not \nhistoric but close to a historically high number, 560,000 \nPennsylvanians.\n  There are lots of ways to try to understand what people are going \nthrough and try to get a sense of what people are living through. I had \na chance a couple of weeks ago to sit with 8 of those 560,000 people in \nwhat is called a career link, a job center in Pennsylvania where people \nare filling out scores of applications, applying for jobs. In the case \nof these eight individuals, they are all over the age of 50 and many \nare over the age of 60 and 70--some of the worst situations for those \nwho are in that age bracket, who worked for years, 20, 30 years at one \njob and did it very well, and now, through no fault of their own, are \nout of work.\n  Listening to their stories gave me a better insight into what people \nare up against every day. A number of comments were significant and \nrelevant and poignant, but one in particular by a woman by the name of \nDebi who said something very simple but telling about what is in her \nheart and what she is living through--she said simply: We just want to \nget back to work. That is a very simple statement, but I think that is \non the minds of a lot of Americans who are out of work, and their \nfamily members. They just want to get back to work.\n  They also want to see that Washington is not just legislating--that \nis obviously important, and I will talk a little bit more about that in \na moment--but that we are trying to understand what they are up \nagainst. They do want to get back to work. It is that simple. One of \nthe ways we can do that is by making sure those who are out of work, \nthose something like 15 million Americans out of work through no fault \nof their own, that we do something to help them in the next couple of \ndays to get through the next couple of weeks, literally, with \nunemployment insurance, COBRA health insurance, and so many other ways.\n  We should note that the eligibility for emergency unemployment \ncompensation and for COBRA--known as COBRA premium assistance, really \nhealth insurance for the unemployed--that both of those will expire \nthis Sunday, February 28. If an extension of the unemployment programs \nauthorized by the Recovery Act is not passed, 1.2 million workers will \nlose their unemployment benefits by the end of March. So we have to act \nnow to prevent that from happening. It is unfortunate that it seems \nthere is only an agreement to keep extending it from December to \nFebruary, then from February into March or the end of March. We should \nextend it a lot further than that. Maybe we will have an opportunity to \ndo that. But, at a minimum, we have to make sure unemployment insurance \nis extended and COBRA health insurance is extended. There are other \nreasons to do that as well. The most important reason is the people who \nwill be positively impacted by those actions.\n  An extension of the federally funded unemployment compensation and \nCOBRA programs through December 31, 2010--what we should do is extend \nit that far. They are necessary for a number of reasons. State labor \ndepartments will not be under pressure to constantly update their \nsystems and inform constituents of changes in national law. We should \ngive them the kind of certainty and predictability that they have a \nright to expect, certainly the State government officials but more \nimportantly, the families and affected persons who are recently laid \noff--not constantly be reminded that their unemployment benefits may \nrun out sooner than expected. This is especially true at a time when \nthere are six applicants for every one job.\n  It is important to take action on unemployment insurance and COBRA \nhealth insurance coverage for a third reason as well.\n  At a time when millions of people don't have health care coverage, \nfailure to provide an adequate safety net to ensure people have \naffordable health insurance coverage will only add to the rolls of the \nuninsured in the midst of this debate on health care.\n  Two other points before I conclude. According to the CBO, which we \nkeep quoting in the health care debate and in many others, for every $1 \nspent on unemployment insurance benefits, up to $1.90 is contributed to \nthe gross national product. This is further evidence, in addition to \nwhat I and many others have quoted--Mark Sandy from moodys.com--you \nspend a buck on unemployment insurance or COBRA benefits and/or food \nstamps, all of those safety net provisions to help workers who lost \ntheir job, you not only help someone who needs help and should have the \nhelp we can provide, you also help our economy literally by jump \nstarting spending.\n  We know that in the past couple of days we passed the jobs bill, the \nHIRE Act, a good piece of legislation for small business, for economic \nvitality but also for preserving and creating lots of jobs. That jobs \nbill is not enough. We have to pass these safety net provisions on \nunemployment and COBRA health benefits. We also have to put more job \ncreation strategies on the table and get bills passed to create more \njobs. The recovery bill is still having an effect, still having a \ntremendous impact in Pennsylvania, with still a whole year left of \nspending and benefits of that spending in Pennsylvania and other \nStates.\n  I see Senator Specter is with us. He and I have seen that up close in \nPennsylvania, a tremendous impact already, but there is still more to \ndo on the recovery bill he voted for under great pressure not to vote \nfor it. Thank goodness he did. Without his vote, that bill would not \nhave passed. Millions of Americans' lives would be adversely impacted \nif we did not pass the Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. We have a \nlong way to go, more work to do across the country and to have a \npositive impact on Pennsylvania.\n  One concluding thought. When you look at Pennsylvania, we might have \na lower rate than a lot of States but we do have 560,000 people out of \nwork. Unfortunately, more and more we are seeing in different labor \nmarkets, such as the Erie labor market, which is at 10 percent, the \nLehigh Valley, Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton at 9.8 percent, \nnortheastern Pennsylvania, my home area, at 9.7 percent--even though \nour rate has not yet hit statewide 9 percent, we are seeing in \ndifferent pockets that number going up. We have to continue to put job \ncreation strategies in the pipeline, continue to have the recovery act \nhave an even more positive impact. And thirdly, we need to make sure we \npass the safety net provisions.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to talk \nbriefly about two subjects: a recent CODEL where I participated and, \nsecondly, on the passing of a beloved staff member. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time for business be extended until 12:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Foreign Travel\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, from December 28 to January 7, I \nparticipated on a congressional delegation which visited in Cypress, \nSyria, India,\n\n[[Page S762]]\n\nAfghanistan, and Morocco, and have submitted a lengthy report, which is \nmy practice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of that report be printed \nin the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. For purposes of comment at this time, I will focus on \nwhat we found on our trip to Afghanistan and India as it relates to the \ncurrent war in progress in Afghanistan which has, as a practical \nmatter, been extended into Pakistan and a comment about our trip to \nSyria, our meetings with President Assad, as it bears upon the \npotential for a peace treaty between Israel and Syria.\n  Our visit to Afghanistan was very revealing to get a firsthand \nimpression as to what is going on on the ground. I approached the trip \nwith serious reservations about the President's proposal to add an \nadditional 30,000 troops there. My concern arose in the context of why \nfight in Afghanistan when al-Qaida could organize as well in many other \nplaces, Yemen or Somalia. There had been such a lack of success in \nefforts in Afghanistan by the Soviets, by the Brits, going all the way \nback to Alexander the Great.\n  There is no doubt we have to do whatever it takes to defeat al-Qaida, \nbecause they are out to annihilate us. The question is, where? Where we \nface reports that there were only about 100 al-Qaida actually in \nAfghanistan, we are really looking at a battle with the Taliban.\n  In our meetings with General McChrystal and other key officials, they \nemphasized the point that we should not retreat and that it would be a \nwatershed event if the United States did not provide whatever military \nforce was necessary in Afghanistan.\n  Our delegation replied that the NATO support was lacking and we ought \nto rethink exactly how we are going to deal with the Taliban. The \nefforts to persuade the Taliban to come back and support the Karzai \ngovernment--because there are many there who could be brought back if \nthe inducements were sufficient and they were sufficiently confident--\nthe Karzai government did not lend a whole lot to inspire confidence. \nThey had an election which was clouded with fraud. They have sustained \nreports about dealing in the narcotics trade with high-ranking \nofficials, repeated evidence of corruption at the highest levels--\nhardly inducive to a stable government.\n  When the President projected a withdrawal by mid-2011, that was not \nwhat President Karzai had suggested. He was quoted in the press as \nsaying, U.S. troops would have to be in Afghanistan for 15 years. When \nour delegation had an opportunity to meet with President Karzai, we \npressed him on that issue, and he said: Well, 2 years would be required \nfor an adequate presence of the U.S. military. He never could quite \ndefine what ``adequate'' was, but he said U.S. forces would have to \nstay for another 10 years.\n  More recently, in the intervening weeks, the war there has shaped up. \nWe still have only committed a small fraction of the 30,000 troops--\nsomething like 5,000. Perhaps it will not be necessary to commit the \nadditional 25,000 troops.\n  We had a very productive meeting with the Prime Minister of India, \nPrime Minister Singh. A point which we pressed was whether India and \nPakistan could enter into an arms reduction pact similar to the pacts \nwhich the United States and the Soviet Union have had, which would \nreduce the number of troops from India and the number of troops from \nPakistan on the border to liberate more Pakistan military to help in \nthe fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban.\n  Prime Minister Singh said he would certainly be willing to consider \nthat, but Pakistan would have to control the terrorists. We questioned \nhim as to whether the Pakistani Government could control the \nterrorists, and his reply was very blunt: Yes, the terrorists are the \ncreation of Pakistan, which is the way he responded to that situation.\n  In the intervening weeks, again, there has been unique cooperation \nbetween Pakistani intelligence and the CIA, with many joint maneuvers, \nso perhaps there could be a material improvement along that line.\n  The written text, which will be submitted, goes into some greater \ndetail, which I shall abbreviate because of the shortness of time.\n  In Syria, our meeting with President Bashar al-Asad was cordial and I \nthink constructive. I had first visited Syria in 1984, and this was the \n19th visit there. I have gone there repeatedly, as I have to the region \ngenerally, and even more often to Israel, because I have long thought \nSyria was the key to the Mideast peace process.\n  Syria desperately wants to regain the Golan Heights, and only Israel \ncan decide whether it is in Israel's interest to cede the Golan \nHeights. But it is a different world in 2010 than it was in 1967, when \nIsrael took the Golan. The strategy is very different in an era of \nrockets. It is not quite the same situation.\n  There is a great deal Israel could gain if a peace treaty was entered \ninto with Syria: stopping Syria from continuing the destabilization of \nLebanon, which Syria denies but I think happens to be a fact. For Syria \nto stop supporting Hezbollah and Hamas would be very important to \nIsrael's security. To try to drive a wedge between Syria and Iran would \nbe helpful not only to Israel in the context of the Iranian President \nwanting to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth but would be good not \nonly for the region but for the entire world, if we can find a way to \ncontain Iran in their determination to acquire nuclear weapons.\n  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified yesterday before the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee, and I asked her if she would consider \na recommendation to have the President call the Israeli leaders, Prime \nMinister Netanyahu, and the Syrian President, Bashar al-Asad, to the \nOval Office to be an intermediary there. The office of the Presidency \ncould have great forcefulness and great weight. The Secretary was \nnoncommittal, and the record will reflect the exact words which she \nused.\n  The trip was very worthwhile. I find that when we leave the Beltway \nand leave Washington and see what is actually happening in the field, \nwearing a flak jacket in a helicopter across Afghanistan or talking to \nForeign Minister Walid Mualem, who was the Ambassador here for 10 \nyears, and getting a feel for what is going on in India, it gives us a \nmuch better insight into how we handle our foreign aid, how we handle \nour budget, and how we handle our military operations.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   Statement of Senator Arlen Specter\n\n                             Foreign Travel\n\n       I seek recognition to speak about a Congressional \n     Delegation I took part in from December 28, 2009 to January \n     7, 2010. The CODEL, led by Senator Gregg, comprised of \n     Senators Bayh, Cornyn, Enzi, Klobuchar and their spouses. I \n     was accompanied by my wife, Joan, and my Legislative \n     Director, Christopher Bradish.\n\n\n                                 CYPRUS\n\n       We departed Andrews Air Force Base on Monday morning, \n     December 28th, en route to Nicosia, Cyprus, with a refueling \n     stop in Shannon, Ireland. We began the day with a meeting \n     with our USAID mission to review projects being supported by \n     the United States.\n       We then had a briefing with the United Nations Development \n     Program (UNDP), which is focusing on reconciliation projects, \n     to include media expansion. The UNDP office is located in the \n     U.N. administered neutral zone, which divides the island. The \n     UNDP continues to work with representatives in Cyprus on \n     revision of textbooks and the diversification of media to \n     allow viewpoints other than those of just the state-dominated \n     media outlets to be heard.\n       The media is dominated by Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot \n     political outlets. Cyprus does not have equivalents of NPR or \n     PBS. UNDP hopes to build on those models to allow \n     diversification in the media by providing independent \n     programming which can then be picked up by existing outlets \n     for broadcast. The UNDP media program aims to provide all \n     Cypriots with a non-partisan avenue of communication.\n       Following our meeting with USAID and UNDP officials, the \n     delegation held a country team briefing led by Jonathan \n     Cohen, our Deputy Chief of Mission. Our embassy in Cyprus has \n     65 U.S. employees in addition to roughly 100 Cypriot \n     nationals. Cyprus has become increasingly important to the \n     U.S. due to its strategic location. With an increasing number \n     of U.S. ships transiting the Mediterranean Sea, U.S. port \n     visits in Cyprus increased 24 percent in 2008. With thousands \n     of U.S. troops having shore leave while in port, the U.S. \n     Embassy has worked with the Cypriot government to ensure that \n     appropriate safety measures are in place to protect our ships \n     and sailors.\n\n[[Page S763]]\n\n       Since Cyprus' accession to the European Union in January \n     2004, the number of Cypriots attending U.S. universities has \n     decreased dramatically. The U.S. mission has created a \n     program to use Cypriots who are alumni of U.S. universities \n     to go to high schools and communities to speak about the \n     benefits of an education in the United States.\n       On the law enforcement front, the Cypriot government has \n     utilized U.S. expertise in some of their criminal \n     investigations, including the investigation into the recent \n     theft of the remains of former president Tassos Papadopoulos.\n       We received an overview of U.S. investment in Cyprus as \n     well as U.S. businesses operating on the island. U.S. exports \n     to Cyprus grew by 28 percent in 2008. I asked about the \n     University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's efforts to \n     establish a university and medical center in Cyprus. UPMC is \n     exporting its expertise to bring world-class health care, \n     advanced technologies, and management skills to markets \n     worldwide.\n       Our mission provided an update on the status of \n     negotiations between the north and south. Talks between the \n     Greek Cypriot President, Demetris Christofias and the Turkish \n     Cypriot leader, Mehmet Ali Talat have ramped up in recent \n     weeks with the two leaders reportedly meeting multiple times \n     a week. However significant obstacles remain to reaching an \n     agreement to include how to resolve vexing property, security \n     and constituent state constitution issues.\n       In November 2002, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan \n     presented a draft comprehensive peace settlement, commonly \n     referred to as the Annan Plan. According to the Congressional \n     Research Service:\n\n     ``[The Annan Plan] called for a ``new state of affairs,'' in \n     which the ``common state'' government's relations with its \n     two politically equal component states would be modeled on \n     the Swiss federal example. It would have a single \n     international legal personality. Component states would \n     participate in foreign and EU relations as in Belgium. \n     Parliament would have two 48-seat houses. Each state would \n     have equal representation in the Senate. Seats in the Chamber \n     of Deputies would be allocated in proportion to population, \n     provided that no state would have less than 25% of the seats. \n     A Presidential Council would have 6 members; the offices of \n     President and Vice President would rotate every 10 months \n     among its members. No more than two consecutive presidents \n     could come from the same state. Greek and Turkish troops \n     could not exceed a four-digit figure (9,999). U.N. \n     peacekeepers would remain as long as the common state, with \n     the concurrence of the component states, decides. Cyprus \n     would be demilitarized. During a three-year transition, the \n     leaders of the two sides would be co-presidents. The 1960 \n     Treaties of Establishment, Guarantee, and Alliance would \n     remain in force. There would be a single Cypriot citizenship \n     and citizenship of a component state; residence in a \n     component state could be limited by citizenship, but such \n     limits would have restrictions. Provisions would be made for \n     return or compensation of property. Turkish Cypriot territory \n     would be reduced to 28.5% of the island.\n\n       The Delegation departed the country team briefing for a \n     meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat. Talat \n     provided an overview of the negotiations with President \n     Christofias and focused on three main areas of dispute: \n     governance and power sharing; economic and European affairs; \n     and property reconciliation. While he expressed hope about \n     having fruitful and productive discussions, he indicated that \n     the two sides have disagreements over terminology which \n     preclude them from moving forward on a solution. I asked \n     if there were disadvantages to not achieving a solution \n     and if the status-quo is acceptable. Talat responded that \n     neither side seeks violence, but that the current \n     situation is disadvantageous to both sides.\n       Talat expressed optimism that a resolution could be reached \n     in 2010 but that the talks would likely break in mid-February \n     to allow for elections, the outcome of which could have a \n     significant impact on the continuation of talks between the \n     two sides. Talat indicated that the Greek Cypriots have less \n     of an incentive to find a solution given their dominance of \n     the island. He also confirmed the UNDP representatives' \n     previous assertions that the local media helps inflame \n     opinions on both sides.\n       The delegation then departed the north en route to a \n     meeting with President Christofias. The President opened the \n     meeting with a 37-minute overview of the situation and the \n     negotiations. He expressed concern over the more than 40,000 \n     Turkish troops on the island, as well as the unknown number \n     of Turkish settlers. He too focused on security and land/\n     property compensation as main obstacles to achieving an \n     agreement. Christofias avowed that he is ``free of \n     nationalism'' and that ``Turkish Cypriots are not our \n     enemies, but our brothers and sisters.'' He concluded that \n     Cypriots must rule the country--not Turkey. He stated that he \n     ``will be the unhappiest man on the island'' if he and Talat \n     cannot reach an agreement, but stated: ``I will do my utmost \n     because as time passes, new problems arise.'' He indicated he \n     had a good partner and relationship with Talat and if he \n     should lose in the upcoming elections, the prospects for \n     constructive dialogue and resolution were poor.\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n       On December 30th, the delegation departed Larnaca, Cyprus \n     for Damascus, Syria. This was my nineteenth visit to Syria. \n     We were greeted by Jason Smith, our control officer, and \n     Charles Hunter, our Charge d'Affaires, who provided an update \n     of the situation on the ground during the ride to the \n     embassy. Upon arrival, the delegation received two classified \n     briefings to include a country team briefing. Following our \n     briefings, the delegation departed for the Presidential \n     Palace for a meeting with President Bashar al-Asad and \n     Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem.\n       President Asad opened the meeting by welcoming the \n     delegation and provided his views on the bilateral \n     relationship as well as regional tensions. I have long held \n     the view that the U.S. could play a positive role in \n     fostering an agreement between Israel and Syria. I indicated \n     that if Hezbollah and Hamas could be disarmed and renounce \n     violence the region would be better off. I expressed the view \n     held by many in the U.S. that the Syria-Iran nexus is \n     troubling and Iran's desire to obtain nuclear weapons poses a \n     danger to the region and the world. I complimented President \n     Asad for his willingness to engage the Israelis via the \n     Turks. I asked President Asad for his view on the prospects \n     for an Israeli-Syrian peace, better relations with the West \n     and his country's relationship with Iran. He indicated that \n     the ``devil is in the details.'' He explicitly decoupled the \n     issues, stating that his country's calculus for each is \n     independent of the others. He indicated the U.S. should \n     support the Turkish role in the peace process--which has been \n     put on hold following the conflict in Gaza in 2008 and \n     Israel's parliamentary elections in 2009.\n       Asad stated, ``only peace can protect Israel''--something \n     no amount of armaments can do. He further stated that Hamas \n     and Hezbollah exist as result of the lack of peace. On the \n     U.S. role in the peace process, Asad pointed to efforts \n     undertaken in the 1990s, when Secretary of State James Baker \n     engaged forcefully with the interested parties.\n       It is clear to me that Syria desires robust U.S. engagement \n     in the peace process. Syria's tepid alliance with Iran \n     appears not to be bound by mutual affection, but rather by \n     Syria's desire to be on good terms with a regional force. \n     Syria clearly wants the U.S. to withdraw from Iraq, but not \n     before Iraqi domestic institutions have time to mature to \n     prevent Iran from sweeping in to a political vacuum.\n       We discussed the issue of intelligence cooperation. The \n     good cooperation Syria and the U.S. had following September \n     11, 2001 has since dissipated. The delegation pressed Asad \n     for more cooperation. Asad confirmed that cooperation had \n     been good, but said that security and intelligence \n     cooperation cannot flourish in the absence of strong \n     political and diplomatic relations.\n       The delegation pressed Asad on the Iranian nuclear threat \n     and the potential for Syria to be dragged into a regional \n     conflict. Assad indicated that the Iranian issue needs to be \n     resolved and that conflict must be prevented, but that he \n     does not believe Iran is seeking a nuclear military \n     capability.\n       Senator Klobuchar and I raised the issue of the three \n     American citizens--Joshua Fattal, Shane Bauer, and Sarah \n     Shourd--who have been detained in Iran since July 31, 2009, \n     when they mistakenly crossed into Iran on a hiking \n     expedition.\n       The United Kingdom had asked Syria to intercede with Iran \n     in the case of five British citizens who were in Iranian \n     custody under somewhat similar circumstances. The five \n     citizens were released.\n       Since the start of their detention, I had worked with other \n     members of the Senate to facilitate their release. On August \n     18, I joined Senators Casey, Feinstein, Boxer, Klobuchar, \n     Franken and Murray in writing to the Iranian Ambassador to \n     the U.N. Mohammad Khazaee to request that Iran grant the \n     Swiss consular access to the Americans per Iran's obligations \n     under the Vienna Convention. This letter was followed by a \n     similar one to Ayatollah Khamenei on September 23, 2009.\n       On September 22, I introduced a resolution cosponsored by \n     Senators Casey, Feinstein, Boxer, Klobuchar, Franken, and \n     Nelson (FL) encouraging the Government of Iran to grant \n     consular access for the Swiss and to allow Joshua Fattal, \n     Shane Bauer, and Sarah Shourd to reunite with their families \n     in the United States as soon as possible. The legislation \n     passed the Senate on October 6, and passed the House on \n     October 29, sponsored by Reps. Schwartz and Hinchey.\n       On October 8, I sent a personal note to Ambassador Khazaee \n     requesting his assistance in releasing the hikers.\n       On December 17, 2009 I sent a letter to Secretary Clinton \n     requesting she ask the Syrians to engage Tehran to secure the \n     release of the three Americans. The State Department \n     contacted the Syrian foreign ministry to seek its assistance \n     in a manner similar to the assistance the Syrians provided to \n     the recent efforts to secure the release of the five British \n     yachtsmen detained by Iran in late November after they \n     strayed into Iranian waters. The five Brits were released \n     within a week.\n       President Asad said they would look into the matter \n     including the charges to see if Syria could be of help in \n     securing their release. President Asad told me he would \n     review the matter and that the Syrians ``will try our best.''\n       Later that evening Senator Klobuchar and I had a working \n     dinner with Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem. I have known \n     Foreign Minister Muallem for two decades dating back to his \n     time as Ambassador to the\n\n[[Page S764]]\n\n     United States. We discussed in depth the issues raised \n     earlier with the President. We again pressed the Foreign \n     Minister on the issue of the U.S. hikers detained in Iran. \n     Foreign Minister Muallem indicated he would be willing to go \n     to Tehran to engage his counterpart regarding the plight of \n     the hikers if he sees ``some light at the end of the \n     tunnel.''\n\n\n                                 INDIA\n\n       We departed Damascus the following morning for Delhi, India \n     and where we were met by Deputy Chief of Mission Steven \n     White. The issues we discussed were wide-ranging and \n     included: nuclear cooperation between the United States and \n     India; the November 2008 terrorist attacks in India and \n     India's efforts to combat terrorism; India's tenuous \n     relations with Pakistan and China; its economic and \n     diplomatic presence in Afghanistan; and the position it has \n     taken in global climate change negotiations, in which it has \n     opposed binding emissions reductions as limits on its future \n     economic growth. As the world's second most populous country, \n     it is clear that India will play an increasing role in global \n     politics this century.\n       The delegation participated in a country team briefing at \n     our mission. We had the opportunity to discuss a wide variety \n     of issues in our bilateral relationship with the DCM, \n     political section, defense attache, USAID and consular \n     affairs officers.\n       Much of our discussions during our visit focused on India's \n     growth and the growing pains associated with such growth, to \n     include education. While 92 percent of the country's children \n     go to primary school, half drop out by 6th grade. Many of \n     India's 1.2 billion citizens live in rural regions and \n     getting teachers to those posts is difficult. The country has \n     engaged in an affirmative action for children of lower castes \n     to attend university, but these reserved spots are \n     extraordinarily competitive. Yet, the government of India is \n     committed to inclusive growth and bringing the lower class up \n     to participate in India's prosperity.\n       A central theme in our discussions with our mission \n     personnel as well as Indian officials was the civil nuclear \n     accord signed by the U.S. and India. On October 1, 2008, \n     Congress approved an agreement facilitating nuclear \n     cooperation between the United States and India. As \n     chronicled by the Council on Foreign Relations, the deal, \n     first introduced in a joint statement issued by President \n     Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on July 18, \n     2005, ``lifts a three-decade U.S. moratorium on nuclear trade \n     with India. It provides U.S. assistance to India's civilian \n     nuclear energy program, and expands U.S.-India cooperation in \n     energy and satellite technology'' (CFR--11/20/09). During our \n     meetings, this agreement was described as a ``watershed'' \n     event in our bilateral relationship--an event that opened new \n     doors, new cooperation and new possibilities for two \n     countries that have spent the majority of their histories \n     circling each other but not directly engaging in a meaningful \n     manner.\n       According to our officials, India is taking steps to be a \n     responsible world power on nonproliferation matters. India \n     has supported international efforts, along with the United \n     States, to address Iran's troubling military nuclear \n     ambitions--most recently by supporting an IAEA censure of \n     Iran's nuclear program during a November 27, 2009 meeting of \n     the IAEA's Board of Governors. This has led to a cooling \n     between the two countries, yet India and Iran still have deep \n     economic connections, as Iran is India's second largest \n     energy supplier.\n       On the economic front, India's economy was more sheltered \n     than others and weathered the global economic crisis better \n     than many. Their economy grew 6.8 percent in 2009 and is \n     expected to grow 7.5 percent in 2010. India has increasingly \n     sought and purchased U.S. weaponry. The deepening of the \n     bilateral arms sales are a critical component of our \n     relationship.\n       On the terrorism front, I pressed the team on the prospect \n     of reconciliation between India and Pakistan in the hopes \n     that a reduction in tensions would allow Pakistan to focus \n     its forces on elements such as Al-Qaeda.\n       India is no stranger to terrorism, most recently seen in \n     the horrific attacks in Mumbai on November 26, 2008, which \n     killed at least 173 people, including 6 Americans. Our \n     mission and its law enforcement components have provided \n     assistance to the Indians in the investigation of the \n     attacks.\n       Following the country team briefing, the delegation took a \n     classified regional security briefing before departing for \n     the Prime Minister's office.\n       I have long been concerned about Indian-Pakistani \n     relations. I brought up the issue of an Indian-Pakistani \n     rapprochement during a visit to India in 1995. In August \n     1995, Senator Hank Brown and I were told by Prime Minister \n     Rao in a visit to New Delhi that India was interested in \n     negotiating with Pakistan to make their subcontinent free of \n     nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Rao asked Senator Brown and \n     me to raise this issue with Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir \n     Bhutto which we did. I then wrote to President Clinton urging \n     him to broker such negotiations. Those discussions are \n     summarized in a letter which I sent to President Clinton:\n\n                                                  August 28, 1995.\n       Dear Mr. President: I think it important to call to your \n     personal attention the substance of meetings which Senator \n     Hank Brown and I have had in the last two days with Indian \n     Prime Minister Rao and Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir \n     Bhutto.\n       Prime Minister Rao stated that he would be very interested \n     in negotiations which would lead to the elimination of any \n     nuclear weapons on his subcontinent within ten or fifteen \n     years including renouncing first use of such weapons. His \n     interest in such negotiations with Pakistan would cover \n     bilateral talks or a regional conference which would include \n     the United States, China and Russia in addition to India and \n     Pakistan.\n       When we asked Prime Minister Bhutto when she had last \n     talked to Prime Minister Rao, she said that she had no \n     conversations with him during her tenure as Prime Minister. \n     Prime Minister Bhutto did say that she had initiated a \n     contact through an intermediary but that was terminated when \n     a new controversy arose between Pakistan and India.\n       From our conversations with Prime Minister Rao and Prime \n     Minister Bhutto, it is my sense that both would be very \n     receptive to discussions initiated and brokered by the United \n     States as to nuclear weapons and also delivery missile \n     systems.\n       I am dictating this letter to you by telephone from \n     Damascus so that you will have it at the earliest moment. I \n     am also telefaxing a copy of this letter to Secretary of \n     State Warren Christopher.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n       After returning to the United States, I discussed such a \n     presidential initiative with President Clinton, but my \n     suggestion was not pursued.\n       The delegation had a warm welcome from Prime Minister \n     Singh. The Prime Minister began the meeting by thanking the \n     delegation for Congress' strong bipartisan support in \n     implementing the U.S.-India bilateral nuclear accord. He \n     further declared that this event has made him believe the \n     ``sky is the limit'' in terms of broadening and deepening the \n     U.S.-India bilateral relationship, from energy to defense to \n     education.\n       Prime Minister Singh confirmed that his economy continues \n     to grow, and was insulated from the global fiscal \n     difficulties largely because of India's savings rate and that \n     domestic consumption filled much of the void left by lagging \n     exports. He told the group that India's prosperity will have \n     positive effects on the rest of the developing world. He \n     expressed his strong desire to deepen the defense cooperation \n     between our countries.\n       The group asked the Prime Minister for his views on \n     Afghanistan. He informed the group that India has invested \n     $1.2 billion in reconstruction and development in \n     Afghanistan. While he admitted the existence of corruption \n     within the Karzai government, he indicated that President \n     Karzai is the best option for stability, and that all will \n     benefit from strong international support for Karzai. He \n     stated that deadlines and withdrawal will only play into the \n     hands of the terrorists, as they will signal looming weakness \n     of the government in Kabul.\n       I pressed the Prime Minister on the prospects for relieving \n     tensions between his country and Pakistan and the possibility \n     of having an accord on troops and nuclear weapons. If \n     Pakistan will take action against the terrorist elements in \n     its country, India would be willing to discuss many things, \n     Singh stated. Prime Minister Singh told the group of the \n     strong internal pressure he felt after the Mumbai attacks to \n     take some action against Pakistan, but that he refrained. He \n     further told the group that Pakistanis and Indians are the \n     same--highlighting that he was born in what today is Pakistan \n     and that former Pakistani President Pervez Musharaff was born \n     in what is present day India. He told the group that Pakistan \n     does not need to fear India and that he is committed to \n     engaging in a positive manner with Pakistan. He suggested \n     that serious reform in Pakistan's education system is needed \n     and that madrassas are a significant problem.\n       I asked Prime Minister Singh whether India would consider a \n     treaty with Pakistan to reduce military forces stationed by \n     each nation on the border. I told him of my 1995 \n     conversations with Prime Minister Rao and Prime Minister \n     Bhutto and my letter to President Clinton. I noted that it \n     would be a great help in the war against al-Qaeda if Pakistan \n     could re-deploy significant soldiers from the border to fight \n     al-Qaeda.\n       I analogized an Indian-Pakistan treaty to the U.S.-Soviet \n     arms reduction treaties. If India and Pakistan could agree on \n     disclosure and reduced forces, that would liberate Pakistani \n     troops. Prime Minister Singh said India would be willing to \n     consider such a treaty, but pointed out that Pakistan would \n     have to control Pakistan terrorists such as the ones who \n     attacked the hotel in Mumbai. He said he had been under \n     considerable pressure to respond forcefully, but had not done \n     so. Many feared that the Mumbai hotel attack and a forceful \n     India response could have set off a nuclear exchange.\n       I asked Prime Minister Singh pointedly if the Pakistan \n     government could control the terrorists and he responded \n     ``yes.'' He added the terrorists were the ``creation'' of the \n     Pakistan government.\n       Regarding Iran, Prime Minister Singh told the group India \n     was not in favor of another nuclear power in the region and \n     doesn't want Iran to have that capability. Prime Minister \n     Singh highlighted his country's support at the United Nations \n     to address Iran's nuclear ambitions. He indicated that Iran \n     is a signatory to the NPT, and as such is entitled to\n\n[[Page S765]]\n\n     enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, but that they must \n     comply with international accords to reassure the \n     international community of their peaceful intentions.\n       Following our meeting with the Prime Minister, I returned \n     to the embassy for a meeting with Robert Hladun, the Deputy \n     Country Attache for the DEA and Gib Wilson, the Assistant \n     Legal Attache for the FBI. I received an overview of the \n     regional drug trade and how it impacts the U.S., and our \n     cooperation and assistance to India with their investigations \n     and counterterrorism efforts.\n       The Deputy Chief of Mission hosted a working lunch with our \n     counterparts from the Indian National Congress including: \n     Pallam Raju, Minister of State for Defense, Jitin Prasada, \n     Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Abhishek \n     Manu Singhvi, Manish Tewari, Prakash Javadekar, Raashid Alvi, \n     Madhu Goud Yashki and Deepender Singh Hooda. Our discussions \n     centered on the same topics we had discussed with Prime \n     Minister Singh and the country team, but also provided us an \n     opportunity to discuss how, as parliamentarians, we deal with \n     local and national issues of importance to our constituents. \n     Following lunch, we departed Delhi for Morocco, with a \n     refueling stop in Qatar.\n\n\n                              AFGHANISTAN\n\n       On January 3, 2010, the delegation flew from New Delhi to \n     Kabul, Afghanistan and returned to New Delhi late on the same \n     day. Upon arrival at the U.S. Embassy, we were greeted by \n     General Stanley McChrystal and Ambassadors Anthony Wayne and \n     Francis Ricciardone.\n       General McChrystal outlined a strategy aimed at influencing \n     the Karzai government to institute reforms to win the support \n     of the Afghan people so that many of the insurgents would \n     support the Karzai government and reject the efforts of the \n     Taliban to win control. He acknowledged some of the \n     insurgents who supported the Taliban leadership would stay \n     with the Taliban, so that the Taliban and their supporters \n     would have to be defeated militarily.\n       I asked General McChrystal why fight in Afghanistan when \n     others--the Soviets, the British, Alexander the Great had \n     failed--and al-Qaeda could organize strikes against the U.S. \n     and others from Yemen, Somalia and elsewhere and the U.S. was \n     engaging only a small number of al-Qaeda (estimated by some \n     as few as 100) and really only fighting the Taliban. General \n     McChrystal responded that U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan \n     would have disastrous consequences in the region and beyond \n     and that al-Qaeda would continue to have their best sanctuary \n     in the caves and mountains on the border regions between \n     Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n       I asked him about the reality of significant withdrawal by \n     mid-2011, pointing out that the commitment to start the \n     withdrawal could be met by a small withdrawal which would not \n     be significant. He did not respond on a date for final \n     withdrawal, but said the mid-2011 start of withdrawal was a \n     realistic exit strategy.\n       When I pointed out that President Karzai had publicly \n     stated U.S. troops would be needed for 15 years, General \n     McChrystal did not modify his previously stated estimates.\n       When our Codel later met with President Karzai asked when \n     he thought Afghanistan would be able to maintain the peace \n     and function on its own without any U.S. troops. He said that \n     if the resources were ``adequate,'' that U.S. troops could \n     start withdrawal in two years with full withdrawal after 10 \n     years. There was insufficient time to clarify with President \n     Karzai what resources would be ``adequate'' or what the \n     timetable would be as to estimates of how many troops could \n     be withdrawn each year.\n       We received a brief on the status of the Afghan Army and \n     were informed that it is well respected by much of the \n     population and is seen by many as an entity that holds the \n     promise of binding the nation. The police force is in poorer \n     shape: corruption and involvement in the drug trade, combined \n     with a chronic lack of leadership, hamper its improvement. \n     Only 25 percent of the police force has formal training.\n       The delegation then proceeded to a country team briefing. \n     Our mission in Afghanistan has four ambassadors--a rare \n     occurrence, but one that is necessary given the complexity of \n     the issues and the size of the mission.\n       We discussed the significant monetary investment being made \n     in Afghanistan, with $250 million alone spent on the civilian \n     side each month, and once the additional 30,000 troops arrive \n     the cost will rise to between $9 and $10 billion per month \n     for the entire U.S. effort. When asked to discuss the \n     national security significance to U.S., Major General \n     MacDonald stated that Afghanistan is the extremists' base, \n     threat exists and they have resources in Afghanistan. I \n     pressed the team to rationalize the disparity between \n     President Obama saying we begin withdrawing in 2011 and \n     President Karzai saying that it will take 15 years for his \n     security forces to be ready to stand on their own. I pressed \n     them on how quickly we can train security forces so the U.S. \n     could turn over responsibility and again shared the concern \n     by many over U.S. debt, deficit and obligations at home.\n       Lieutenant General Caldwell outlined the efforts to develop \n     the police and ministries of defense and interior. He \n     highlighted the issue of lacking an effective afghan civil \n     service. He told us that an Afghan soldier makes $165 a month \n     whereas a judge makes only $80. Clearly, civilian pay reform \n     is needed.\n       I pressed the officials on getting the international \n     community to carry its weight. They replied that the U.S. \n     requested 2,500 troops on December 1, 2009 and NATO pledged \n     460, and U.S. officials are now going around Kabul asking \n     each country's ambassador for additional troops. I again \n     pressed them on when we can finally leave. They stated that \n     governance, economy and security need to all be working in \n     tandem and that 300,000 Afghan security forces will be \n     ready by July 2011.\n\n\n                                MOROCCO\n\n       The delegation arrived in Rabat, Morocco at 1 AM on January \n     5th where we were met by Ambassador Samuel Kaplan. Our Codel \n     was very impressed with him. There is considerable debate \n     about ``political appointees,'' but Ambassador Kaplan brought \n     unique skills to this position from a distinguished career in \n     the law, considerable business experience, and extensive \n     activity in political and community affairs.\n       We met with Foreign Minister Fassi-Fihri and Director \n     General Mohamed Mansouri. The Foreign Minster told the \n     delegation he was pleased with the status of relations \n     between our two countries and the deepening in the \n     relationship on issues such as trade and defense and \n     intelligence cooperation. The Foreign Minister explained \n     Morocco's unique position in the world, with one foot in the \n     Mid-East and one in Africa. He described the difficulty his \n     country has had in establishing a democratic system, \n     permitting political parties while maintaining a democracy.\n       Much of our discussion focused on terrorism and prospects \n     for peace in the region. Director General Mansouri stated \n     that terrorists have manipulated Islam and that Morocco has \n     pushed for a more moderate approach and that it is engaged in \n     combating radicalism. I pressed the Foreign Minister on \n     recent incidents of terrorism and what can be done to combat \n     the ideology that inspires suicide bombers and their skewed \n     religious/political views. He told me that many in the Muslim \n     world are frustrated--especially the youth. They lack \n     educational and economic opportunities and poverty has led \n     many to extremist camps. Yet, we also discussed how many \n     terrorists, including those that perpetrated 9/11 and most \n     recently the Detroit airline bombing attempt were educated \n     and came from middle class or wealthy families.\n       The officials told us that we must work to resolve the \n     conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians and that a \n     lasting peace will help subdue tensions and allow governments \n     and moderate Muslims to stand up and lead. In addition, they \n     suggested a global interfaith dialogue must occur. They \n     stated their desire to play a leadership role given Morocco's \n     history in hosting the three great religions.\n       The Foreign Minister highlighted Morocco's efforts to \n     engage the youth with opportunities and positive messages and \n     that their brand of Islam is open, inclusive and tolerant and \n     is a good model for the broader Muslim world.\n       We departed Rabat early on January 7th to return to Andrews \n     Air Force Base by midday EST.\n\n\n                       Tribute To Mr. Kenny Evans\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, Kenny Evans recently passed after being \nwith me for some 30 years. I had known Mr. Evans in Philadelphia for a \nlong time, but when I ran for the Senate in 1980, I asked him to be my \ncampaign deputy in the African-American community. When I was elected, \nI brought him in as my key operative in the African-American community \nbecause of the urgency of having active minority representation.\n  He came to be known and loved and admired as a leading public \nofficial in the city. He served longer than most anybody else who had \nbeen in public office. He took on a great role in housing and in job \ntraining and in education, on civil rights issues and on immigration.\n  When we had a proposal advanced by Congressman Chaka Fattah called \nGEAR UP almost a decade ago, with a $300 million price tag, I consulted \nwith Kenny Evans, listened to his advice and recommendations and helped \nprovide $300 million a year, which has now come to be in the $2.5 \nbillion range, not only servicing Philadelphia but the entire country.\n  When we had a controversy last summer about African-American children \nbeing excluded from a swim club which said they were not welcome there, \nKenny Evans took the lead in consultation and advice on how to handle \nit with the Civil Rights Division, and action has been taken to correct \na wrong there.\n  He was an unusual public servant and an extraordinary man.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement which was \nprepared by Michael Oscar, my executive director for southeastern \nPennsylvania, which Mike Oscar gave at Kenny's funeral, be printed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n\n[[Page S766]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Today, we do not grieve for Kenny Evans, for now he is free \n     to follow the path God has laid out for him. Kenny took God's \n     hand when he heard Him call.\n       Good Morning and on behalf of Charolette and the entire \n     Evans Family, I offer the following remarks highlighting our \n     friend, Kenny Evans.\n       My name is Michael Oscar and I serve as Sen. Specter's \n     Executive Director in Southeastern Pennsylvania. For nearly a \n     decade, I had the distinct pleasure of working with Kenny in \n     many different legislative and political capacities. It is \n     with this background and distinction that I speak to you \n     today.\n       May it be said of Kenny, the words of Alfred, Lord \n     Tennyson:\n\n     ``I am a part of all that I have met\n     To much is taken, much abides\n     That which we are, we are . . .\n     One equal temper of heroic hearts\n     Strong in will\n     To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.''\n\n       Kenny personified these words because his cause was ours,--\n     you and me--the cause of the common man and the common woman. \n     His commitment was to those who Andrew Jackson called ``the \n     humble members of society: the farmers, mechanics, laborers, \n     and the forgotten.''\n       On this foundation for the past three decades with Sen. \n     Specter and beyond, Kenny defined our values, refined our \n     policies, and refreshed our faith. He did this by operating \n     behind the scenes with much grace, class, and dignity.\n       There was never a problem no matter how big or small, he \n     did not try to solve, a request he did not try to respond to, \n     or a person he did not try to help. This was his marquee \n     value.\n       Kenny's work ethic and style mentored future generations of \n     congressional staffers, political candidates, and current \n     legislators in the art and science of politics. As Al \n     Jackson, his friend and luncheon companion for nearly 27 \n     years, stated on numerous occasions, ``he is the maestro of \n     politics''--instinctively knowing how to deal with people and \n     their everyday concerns.\n       In my opinion, he earned this astute characterization \n     because he worked from the ground up, which provided him the \n     proper rubric on how to communicate with people.\n       As his Executive Director for the past five years, I \n     witnessed firsthand his innate ability to soften even the \n     harshest of personalities. There was not a day that went by \n     that Susan Segal would say, ``Kenny would be the perfect \n     choice to handle this constituent.''\n       ``And handle this constituent he did'' because his \n     commitment went well beyond the federal scope. Whatever it \n     took, a phone call, a letter, a closed door meeting. He was a \n     tireless advocate always on a mission.\n       When I first joined Senator Specter's staff in Washington, \n     D.C. before coming to Philadelphia, my COS at the time, Carey \n     Lackman told me ``you had an impressive list of references, \n     but none greater than Kenny Evans.'' Candidly, I didn't know \n     what Carey was talking about. I had no idea who Kenny Evans \n     was and he was not listed as one of my references.\n       I later learned that Kenny worked closely with one of my \n     former employer's, Michael Kunz, the Clerk of Court for the \n     District Court. When Mr. Kunz heard that I applied for the \n     position he called Kenny to advocate on my behalf. \n     Apparently, Kenny immediately called Carey and stated, ``this \n     guy worked for the clerk, do you know how many calls a day I \n     get from constituents to get out of jury duty? You need to \n     hire this guy.''\n       However, my first and lasting impression of Kenny occurred \n     about a year later. Many of you may not be aware of this, but \n     Kenny, along with Al Jackson, established the first urban \n     aquaculture center in the nation.\n       Many of you like me are probably scratching your heads \n     right now wondering what is aquaculture. Well, it's any crop \n     that is cultured in water--whether it be shrimp, fish, or \n     seaweed.\n       Kenny learned about aquaculture from his numerous luncheon \n     conversations with Al Jackson and over the course of a year, \n     they drafted this unique partnership between the University \n     of Pennsylvania and Cheyney University. They wanted to \n     provide African American students the opportunity to learn \n     this unusual science.\n       Proudly I report to you today, the center has been \n     successfully funded for the past seven years by the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture and has graduated nearly 188 \n     African American students in the field of urban aquaculture. \n     This was just one accomplishment of many that Kenny succeeded \n     in on behalf of Sen. Specter.\n       Beyond Kenny's political acumen, he mentored all of us on \n     how to keep things simple, light. When I was drafted by the \n     Senator to run his Philadelphia Office, I heard one of my \n     predecessors define it as ``Kennyism.'' Those Kennyisms have \n     sustained me and our team in Philadelphia for many years and \n     they will never be forgotten.\n       One specific anecdote that defines what we collectively \n     call a ``Kennyism'' was when I was on a leave of absence from \n     the Senator's office to run Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick's campaign. \n     Despite my absence from the office, my three-year-old son, \n     Liam, at the time was enrolled in the daycare center located \n     in the Green Federal Building.\n       So for three days a week, I drove down to the city to drop \n     him off. Before heading up to the campaign office in \n     Doylestown, I would stop by the second floor cafeteria to \n     grab a cup of coffee and I was always greeted by Kenny's \n     chuckle.\n       He would tell me ``Sit down, Mike, tell me about the \n     campaign and more importantly, how is your family?'' He would \n     listen, he would laugh, and he taught me to keep it light. He \n     would end every conversation with ``It will be ok.''\n       Speaking of campaigns, when I had the pleasure of \n     accompanying the Senator during his visit with Kenny just a \n     few weeks ago in the hospital, Kenny despite his medical \n     maladies went right to work assessing for the Senator how the \n     African American Community along with many others will come \n     out for him in his re-election. Yes, many a ``kennyism'' was \n     shared that day.\n       A few short weeks later, I went back to visit with Kenny, \n     along with Al Jackson, and Elvis Solivan, another stalwart of \n     the Specter Team. While there I had this memorable \n     conversation with Kenny's grandson, Lamont. He told me how \n     his grandfather would bring the Senator's Lincoln Town Car \n     home and when he did he would offer his grandchildren a ride \n     in it, and if they accepted the offer then they would wash it \n     later.\n       When I heard the story, I just laughed. ``Senator, rest \n     assured, no one yet from the Oscar family has ridden in the \n     Lincoln let alone washed it except for their father.''\n       Upon your arrival at today's services, you may have noticed \n     that radiant photo of Kenny, Charolette, and President Obama. \n     On that day, Tuesday, September 15, 2009, candidly, Kenny was \n     noticeably not well, but we wanted to ensure he received his \n     photo with the first African American President of the United \n     States.\n       That said, I grasped Kenny's hand, along with Charolette's \n     and together we raced down the long convention center hallway \n     with Andy Wallace at our side running interference. When we \n     got to the photo line, we were immediately escorted to the \n     front of the line. I turned to Shanin Specter and asked him \n     to introduce Kenny and Charolette to the President, and he \n     replied, ``No,'' but he immediately responded with ``Mike, I \n     want you to do it.''\n       So, I proceeded to the President, ``Mr. President, I would \n     like to introduce you to Kenny and Charolette Evans. Kenny \n     has been with the Senator for the past 30 years.'' President \n     Obama retorted, ``my man, Kenny Evans'' and extended a warm \n     hug and handshake. Without question, I will NEVER forget that \n     moment.\n       Ladies and Gentlemen, for those of us who are a part of or \n     friend of Sen. Specter's Alumni and Family, please do not \n     regard today in sorrow, rather rejoice in Kenny's memory and \n     adapt his cause to your daily work.\n       Find comfort and solace in knowing that Kenny joins Carey \n     Lackman and Tom Bowman, former staffers that were dedicated \n     to the cause in helping the common man and woman of \n     Pennsylvania and the nation. Imagine if you will the \n     conversation they must be having right now.\n       For the rest of us assembled here today and to Kenny's \n     family; specifically, Charolette, I offer this summation of a \n     consummate advocate for the little guy, Kenny Evans, by \n     recounting the final sentence of Sen. Ted Kennedy's ``The \n     Dream Shall Never Die Speech,'' at the 1980 Democratic \n     National Convention:\n       ``For all of those whose cares have been our concern, the \n     work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and \n     the dream shall never die.''\n       As in everything we do, may God be blessed! Thank you.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold the suggestion of \nthe absence of a quorum?\n  Mr. SPECTER.

The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, right now there is a meeting at the \nWhite House that is being covered extensively by the media live. There \nhas been much anticipation about the meeting between the President and \na number of Members of Congress, equally divided between the two \nbodies, the House and Senate, and the two political parties. It is a \nchance for both sides to listen to each other. The media has decided \nthat by and large this is going to be unproductive. I watched a good \nbit of it today. At least people are\n\n[[Page S767]]\n\nbeing open with what they believe and what they want.\n  There clearly are major differences between the two parties when it \ncomes to health care. It goes back a couple, three generations. It \ncertainly goes back to the mid-1960s, to 1965 especially, when the \nSenate and the House and President Johnson signed the Medicare bill. An \noverwhelming number of Republicans opposed it and an overwhelming \nnumber of Democrats supported it. It wasn't as partisanly charged as \nthis, but it had the same interest groups around it, including the same \ninsurance company opposition, the same accusations by--it was the John \nBirch Society then. Today it is the tea parties who oppose it. They \ndidn't talk about death panels back then. Perhaps the John Birch \nSociety wasn't as creative as are the tea party people, but they said \nit would be a takeover by big government of health care; the government \nwould stand between the patient and the doctor. None of that has \nhappened with Medicare. The kinds of accusations and charges and scare \ntactics used by the insurance industry and mostly Republican opponents \nin the 1960s to Medicare are very similar to the opponents to health \ncare today.\n  So I say, setting the table, that there are major differences between \nthe two parties. I was speaking to a couple of school groups recently, \none from Lakewood, OH, and one from the University of Miami in Oxford, \nsouthwest Ohio. They asked about partisanship.\n  One woman said: I am neither a Republican nor Democrat--a young \nperson, a 19- or 20-year-old college student. She said: I don't \nunderstand why they are blocking appointments, why you can't even agree \non that, to even have a vote.\n  So the partisanship is surely more charged today than it has been. I \nexplained to them it is not so much party as ideological differences; \nthat Democrats are believers by and large in things such as Medicare, \nand the Republicans think: Let the insurance industry do it. That is \nfine. That is a legitimate philosophical difference. The Republicans \nside with the insurance industry, and the Democrats believe government \ncan play a positive role--not an overreach but a positive role in \npeople's lives by running programs such as Medicare, by running \nprograms such as Social Security, by running programs such as student \nloans, agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency which has \nmade our country significantly safer and people's neighborhoods \nsignificantly safer.\n  There are some people on the other side of the aisle who just want \nPresident Obama to fail. I don't think that is a majority of \nRepublicans; I think it is some number. Let's ignore that for a moment \nand just think there are philosophical differences between the two \nparties. I say that because I think there is something more going on, \nand that is that on a lot of these issues there has been bipartisanship \non this bill.\n  I sit on the Health Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. We did \nour work on this bill back in May. Clearly, this hasn't been rushed \nthrough the Congress or rushed through with reconciliation. The Bush \nadministration, on their big initiatives, pushed them through quickly \nwithout nearly as much debate as we have had, but, nonetheless, we sat \nin the HELP Committee and--the Presiding Officer knows this--we \naccepted, I believe, 163 Republican amendments. I voted for probably \n155 of them. I agreed with most of them.\n  At the same time, the Finance Committee had negotiations with three \nRepublican and three Democratic Senators. I think they took too long--\nthat is my opinion--but the fact is, they had negotiations for months. \nThere were discussions in May and June and July and August and \nSeptember. Finally, Chairman Baucus, in frustration, said: Let's move \nforward. This doesn't seem to be working.\n  So there has been plenty of Republican input into this bill. There \nhas been plenty of bipartisanship. As I said, there have been \nRepublican amendments which have given the bill a Republican flavor and \ncertainly a bipartisan flavor. There were a couple of specific matters. \nThey wanted to allow health insurers to sell across State lines. We did \nthat in the bill. The bill has provisions that allow a company in \nIndiana to sell insurance to residents of Ohio.\n  A company in Indiana can sell in Ohio, and a company in Ohio can sell \ninsurance to somebody across the line in Fort Wayne or in Richmond or \nin Indianapolis or in Gary or anywhere else in that State.\n  So we listened to that, and we included that in the bill because that \nis one the Republicans always talk about: If you would only let us sell \nacross State lines, that would be a great thing. That is what we did. \nWe agreed to that.\n  The second big issue the Republicans talk about is allowing \nindividuals and small businesses and trade associations to pool \ntogether so they can acquire health insurance at lower prices, much the \nway the large corporations and unions do. We did it. We set up \nexchanges that are basically clearinghouses of companies so that \nindividuals can go into these exchanges and buy insurance and spread \nthe risk out among millions of people. Or small businesses can take \ntheir employees--for a company that may have 25 employees, if one or \ntwo of them get sick from cancer, let's say, that small business will \neither--at best, that small business's premiums will go up and at worst \nthey will get their premiums canceled. If two or three or four \nemployees are sick and it costs tens of thousands or maybe hundreds of \nthousands of dollars, you can be in a risk pool with millions so your \nrates don't spike up. So the Republicans were right about that: Let \nthem go into pools, and we did that.\n  So my point is, there is Republican flavor to this bill. There is \nRepublican input--not just input, negotiations and successes--in this \nbill. There are 160 Republican amendments out of the HELP Committee in \nthis bill. There have been almost unending discussions surrounding the \nbill. Yet the Republicans, to a person, oppose the bill. The only \nreason I can figure that out--not that it doesn't have bipartisanship \nto it--the only reason I can figure it out is what my colleague, \nSenator DeMint from South Carolina, said: If this bill goes down, it is \nthe President's waterloo.\n  I don't want to accuse my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nof wanting this to fail in order to have the Democrats fail or wanting \nthis to fail to damage Barack Obama's Presidency. I don't think that. I \nam not accusing them of that. I just wonder.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on the \nissue of health care. Right now the leaders of this body, as well as \nthe House of Representatives, are meeting with the President of the \nUnited States and members of his Cabinet at the Blair House to discuss \nthe current health care reform proposal and where we should go forward \nto improve the health care of the people of this country.\n  I come to the floor today to talk about a specific portion of their \ndiscussion concerning health care fraud prevention.\n  Today, my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, brought up with \nthe President of the United States the issue of health care fraud \nprevention. As a Senator from Florida, this is something I have great \nconcern about because, unfortunately, we are the capital of health care \nfraud for this country. I have put forward a proposal--S. 2128, the \nHealth Care Fraud Prevention Act--to go after this very problem. Today, \nSenator Coburn brought up the fact that we believe that $1 out of every \n$3 spent on health care through Medicare or Medicaid or other public \nprograms--$1 out of $3--is fraud, waste, or abuse--a shocking number. \nIn fact, the belief is that $60 billion a year in the Medicare system \nalone--health care for seniors--is waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Unfortunately, we don't have systems in place to go after and prevent \nthat waste, fraud, and abuse. What we do in the Federal system when we \nthink there is fraud is we send prosecutors and law enforcement folks \nout to\n\n[[Page S768]]\n\ncombat the fraud. These folks are doing a very good job, and there has \nbeen a lot of good work done in my home State of Florida. But the truth \nis, that is going after the fraud after it has already happened, and \noftentimes there is no money left to collect. What we need to do is \nwhat I have proposed, and what the Health Care Fraud Prevention Act, S. \n2128, accomplishes is it stops the fraud before it starts.\n  I was happy today that the President agreed we need to prevent health \ncare fraud. He said we have already incorporated all of the good ideas \non this. I hope that means we are going to pass S. 2128. It is a \nbipartisan supported bill. It is a bill that will stop the fraud before \nit starts. It is not, however, in the Senate bill we passed in \nDecember. When I tried to bring this measure to the floor as an \namendment, it was objected to. Since that time, I have worked with my \ncolleagues on both the Democratic and Republican side of the aisle to \nmove this measure forward. Senator Baucus and I have spoken about it. \nIn the 11-page memo the President put forward, it references doing in \npart what S. 2128 would accomplish. So I hope that in the new proposal, \nwe will put forward S. 2128 and pass it.\n  Quickly, what does the bill do? It does three things:\n  One, it creates a chief health care fraud prevention officer of the \nUnited States. That person, appointed by the President, would work at \nthe agency for health and human services, and their only job would be \nferreting out fraud. When there is $60 billion in Medicare alone and \npotentially that much in Medicaid and across the health care system--we \nthink $\\1/4\\ trillion a year in fraud, waste, or abuse--it is worth \nhaving one person whose whole job is to try to prevent that fraud. \nRemember, if this money is recovered, we can use it to provide health \ncare, we can improve the quality of care because there will be more \nmoney going into actually helping our seniors, helping the poor, \nhelping our veterans.\n  The second thing the bill does is it takes a model from the private \nsector--it borrows a page, if you will--because we have an industry in \nthis country that does an excellent job of preventing fraud, and it is \nthe credit card business. We have all had this experience. You go \nsomewhere and use your credit card, and you get a phone call or an e-\nmail from your credit card company. They tell you some transaction has \njust occurred and ask: Did you really mean to have that transaction? \nDid you authorize that purchase? And you call them up and say either \nyes or no.\n  I have a young family, Mr. President, as you know. When I got \nappointed to the Senate, I brought my kids and my wife up here so we \ncould be close. I have three children 6 and under and a baby coming in \na month, so we are here in Washington, DC, most of the time. I had to \ndo what any good dad would have to do: I had to go out and buy a \ntelevision.\n  I went to Best Buy and bought a television. I live in Tallahassee, so \nbefore I left the store, my credit card sent me an e-mail. You live in \nFlorida, is what this system is doing and thinking, and you are buying \na television, which is a highly suspicious purchase, and you are doing \nit in Washington, DC. So I tell them yes, and the transaction goes \nthrough. If I tell them no, they do not pay Best Buy. They do not pay \nunless there is a verification on the front end.\n  We can use that same technology in health care to set up a predictive \nmodeling system to prevent the fraud before it starts. I called the \nworldwide head of fraud prevention for MasterCard and asked him: Can we \ndo what you do in health care? He said: Sure you can, and I will help \nyou.\n  There is no reason we can't stop billions of dollars of waste, fraud, \nand abuse.\n  Mr. President, before we go on to all the other issues in health care \nthat we can't agree upon, we should call up this bill and we should \npass it. We would get 100 votes, I bet, in the Senate, and we could \nsave what one group here in Washington thinks is $20 billion a year. \nThat is $20 billion we could use to maybe pay down the debt and the \ndeficit or put it back into Medicare, which is hurting and is going to \nrun out of money in a few years. We could do good things with that \nmoney.\n  The third thing this bill does is it requires a background check for \nevery health care provider. Can you believe we don't check the criminal \nrecords of people who claim they are providing health care to our \nseniors? We don't check to see if they are felons. We had a guy in \nMiami who was a convicted murderer who claimed to be a health care \nprovider. This would require we do a background check. And if you are a \ncriminal, guess what. You don't get to provide health care. You don't \nget to dupe the system.\n  So I hope we will take up this bill. I am appreciative of Senator \nCoburn. I am glad the President recognizes we can all agree on this. If \nwe can all agree, let's get something done. Let's call the bill up and \nlet's pass it.\n\n\n                                 Haiti\n\n  Mr. President, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional visit \nto Haiti a couple of weeks ago--actually, 2 weeks from tomorrow. We \nwere there on the 1-month anniversary of the tragic earthquake that \nkilled more than 200,000 people. Two hundred thousand people died in \nHaiti. Myself and the other Members of the Senate and the House who \nwent there were able to see some of the tragedy.\n  We visited the cathedral in Haiti. You often hear President Clinton \ntalk about this wonderful Catholic cathedral in Haiti that stood the \ntest of time but could not stand the test of this earthquake. In fact, \nreally the only prominent part of this cathedral that still stood, \nunbelievably, was the cross.\n  We talked to the people who were there. They are a wonderful and \nresilient people, and it is amazing that they could go on with the \ntragedy they had experienced.\n  I had the great honor to visit the Gesco Ford Operating Hospital, \nstaffed mostly by American doctors and nurses, some of them from Miami, \nsome of them from Orlando, in my home State of Florida. They are doing \nwonderful work.\n  We met with the President of the country and the Prime Minister and \nMinisters of the President's Cabinet, and we talked about what are the \nnext steps.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter I authored to the President of the United States, to which I \nwill be referring.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                          Washington, DC 20510\n\n                                                February 18, 2010.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     President of the United States,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Mr President: On Friday, February 12, we traveled to \n     Haiti with a bipartisan group of colleagues from the House \n     and Senate, led by Speaker Pelosi. The situation in Port-au-\n     Prince, Haiti is dire. While much good work has been done to \n     provide water and food, and to bury the dead, international \n     assistance will be required for years to come.\n       Although a disaster of historic proportions, this \n     earthquake provides great opportunity for renewal and rebirth \n     as tragedies of the past have for cities around the globe. \n     The goal must not be to return Haiti to where it was on \n     January 11, 2010, but to assist the Haitian people in \n     rebuilding a better, prosperous, and stable country.\n       We understand that in the coming weeks your administration \n     will put forth a funding proposal to provide further relief \n     to the Haitian people. For our efforts to be accomplished, \n     that funding must be pursuant to a long-term plan for the \n     success of Haiti's redevelopment. Accordingly, we suggest the \n     following:\n       With the aid of the international community, Haiti must \n     develop a long-term plan for investment. That plan must \n     include defined goals and accountability measures that ensure \n     both transparency and sustainable progress. Second, funds \n     must be provided in a significant way to the Haitian people \n     directly. Micro-loans for small businesses and similar \n     targeted programs that are directly linked to economic \n     performance will foster entrepreneurship and organic business \n     growth. Third, a priority of international assistance to \n     Haiti must be to ensure the well-being, safety, and security \n     of the thousands of orphans that are currently living in \n     Haiti. Fourth, long-term projects must focus on \n     infrastructure and job growth with a special attention on \n     developing centers of commerce outside the capital city, to \n     strengthen the economy and disperse the population. Finally, \n     a task force composed of Haitian-American leaders should be \n     convened to tap the energy and vigor of America's Haitian \n     community to sustain support for the relief effort.\n       In the short term, a joint effort must begin immediately to \n     move displaced Haitians to high ground before the rainy \n     season begins in the coming weeks. Thousands of Haitians are \n     living in low-lying camps, and tragedy will strike again when \n     the rain comes. We urge your administration to stress this \n     point\n\n[[Page S769]]\n\n     with President Preval and Prime Minister Bellerive.\n       In the midst of the terrible disaster, we were all struck \n     by the strength and resiliency of the Haitian people. With a \n     long-term, measurable plan for redevelopment, the people of \n     Haiti can achieve an economy and a society worthy of our \n     investment and their tremendous sacrifice.\n           Sincerely,\n     George S. Lemieux,\n     Bill Nelson,\n     Amy Klobuchar,\n     Frank R. Lautenberg,\n       U.S. Senators.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, this letter is cosigned by myself, \nSenator Nelson, my colleague from Florida, Senator Klobuchar, as well \nas Senator Lautenberg, all of whom were on the trip with me. The letter \nbasically asks the President to do four things in trying to focus our \nhelp and relief for this country.\n  We have been involved in trying to help the Haitian people for \ndecades, and the American people have opened their hearts and their \nwallets to help the situation in Haiti, but the situation is dire. I \ncannot think of a more complicated, difficult problem than trying to \nbring Haiti forward to a sustainable place.\n  Haiti was already in bad shape, but it had a path forward and \nprogress was being made. Now, as you drive the streets of Port-au-\nPrince, it looks like a bombed area. It looks like a war zone. You will \nrandomly see three buildings standing as if nothing had happened and \nthen a building that is completely and utterly destroyed. Right now, \nthousands of people are huddled together in these makeshift camps in \nlow-lying areas. My great fear for the short-term is that when the \nrains come, which they will in the next weeks in Haiti, there will be \nanother great tragedy. So we have to be focused in our help.\n  So I, along with my colleagues, sent this letter to the President and \nasked the President to do four things:\n  First, create a long-term sustainable plan for Haiti and put in \ncharge of that plan, on behalf of our relief efforts, a trustee, along \nwith an inspector general, along with a board of advisers, to work in \npartnership with the Haitian Government to make sure the money is spent \nwisely. We cannot just send billions of dollars into Haiti and let the \nmoney evaporate in short-term solutions. There needs to be a long-term \nsustainable plan.\n  Second, we have to provide funds to the Haitian people directly. \nSmall businesses need microloans so they can provide jobs for the \npeople of Haiti. We can't just give the money to third-party \ncontractors.\n  Third, we have to be focused on this orphan issue. We have to make \nsure it is done legally, and where it is done legally, we have to make \nsure we get those children to their adoptive parents as quickly as \npossible.\n  Fourth, we have to make sure Port-au-Prince is not the center of the \nentire population for the country of Haiti. We are putting too many \npeople in one place when tragedy strikes. We need to encourage \ndevelopment throughout the country.\n  I had the honor of having the President of Royal Caribbean cruise \nlines in my office yesterday--a Floridian, Adam Goldstein--and we \ntalked about tourism to Haiti. There is a beautiful citadel in Haiti \nthat would be a wonderful attraction for cruise ship tourists. There \nhave been all sorts of difficulties building a road to it and making \nsure it is safe and secure.\n  We need to find ways to create jobs outside of Port-au-Prince, \noutside that city, so that fragile humanity is not all focused in one \nplace.\n  Finally, we need to make sure the Diaspora of Haiti, the Haitian-\nAmerican people--for example, we have about 250,000 Haitian Americans \nin Florida--are involved in the rebuilding of Haiti. They need to be \nwelcomed. They are dying to get involved. They are hungry to get \ninvolved in this process of rebuilding their home country.\n  So I hope the President will put together this commission, appoint a \nstrong leader--a Colin Powell or someone of that magnitude--as the \ntrustee to work with the Haitian people to rebuild the island of Haiti, \nand I hope we can get effort and energy behind that proposal quickly so \nwe don't have any other significant challenges in the coming months \nahead for the Haitian people.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today because our economy is \nstruggling. Unemployment remains high, and the recession's hold on \ncities across America is as strong as ever. My home State of Nevada has \nbeen one of the hardest hit, and our tourism-dependent economy is \nbarely hanging on. Unfortunately, this is true for tourism-dependent \ncities across our country.\n  During these difficult economic times, it simply isn't enough to try \nto stimulate domestic spending by passing one massive spending bill \nafter another. We need to incentivize tourists from across the world to \nvisit the truly unique destinations across America. From one coast of \nthis country to the other, there are endless opportunities to tour \nhistoric sights, take advantage of recreational opportunities, observe \ngreat architecture, visit theme parks, dine in some of the finest \nrestaurants in the world, view natural and manmade miracles, and soak \nup everything that is so uniquely found in America. We all know we live \nin the best country in the world. Now is the time for people across the \nworld to enjoy all we have to offer while repairing our economy at the \nsame time.\n  My colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, understands the \nimportance of reasserting our tourism industry on the world stage. \nTogether, he and I have sponsored the Travel Promotion Act, which is \nbefore us today. This bipartisan piece of legislation would help to \nmake our travel and tourism industry more successful and more \ncompetitive internationally. So I thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, \nfor his great leadership on this important issue.\n  Tourism is our country's truest form of economic stimulus. The \naverage overseas visitor to the United States spends roughly $4,500 per \ntrip to pay for hotels, transportation, dining, shopping, and other \nthings. Unfortunately, tourism took a massive hit on 9/11, and it has \nnot yet recovered. This lost decade has only been made worse by last \nyear's recession.\n  If the United States had managed to keep pace with global travel \ntrends, 68 million more travelers would have visited the United States \nbetween 2000 and 2009. These travelers would have generated an \nestimated 250,000 new U.S. jobs in 2008 alone.\n  At a time when unemployment is at record-high numbers in this \ncountry, we cannot afford to throw away anymore tourism-related job \ncreation. We could take a cue from Canada on successful ways to spur \nthis tourism that we need so badly. If you have been watching the \nOlympics, you have seen these ads about British Columbia. I don't know \nabout the rest of you, but it has made me actually want to go up and \nvisit. But it is not just watching the Olympics. It is the ads that \nhave been the most successful part of making me want to go to that part \nof the world. They have beautiful things to advertise, to show you: \nDoesn't that look like an incredible place to go visit?\n  Think about all we have in America that we can advertise to the rest \nof the world that may not have thought about it. I didn't think about \ngoing up to Vancouver and British Columbia, but those ads spurred my \ninterest in it, and I am sure they have for many Americans and other \npeople around the world. Tourism-related jobs can be created simply by \nspreading the word about the wonderful destinations that are literally \nscattered across the United States of America, and we can do it without \nraising taxes on hard-working American families or by digging ourselves \neven further into debt.\n  Unfortunately, the United States has dropped the ball when it comes \nto tourism and the industry has been virtually left behind. Declines in \nvisits to the United States since 2000 have cost our country an \nestimated $500 billion in lost spending and at least $30 billion in \nlost tax receipts.\n  My speech today is not all gloom and doom, however. Instead, I stand \nhere to offer a solution, a solution that can help get our hard-hit \ntourism industry back on its feet. What we need is a comprehensive \nstrategy coordinated by public-private partnerships between the \nGovernment and the expert leaders\n\n[[Page S770]]\n\nfrom our travel and tourism industry. This effort needs to center on a \nmajor initiative that will make the wonderful destinations throughout \nour great country known to foreign audiences. Actually, we do not want \nthem to just be aware of these magnificent places. We want them to feel \ncompelled to visit them.\n  September 11, 2001, forever changed our country and the security \nmeasures along with it. But we need to teach potential visitors about \nthe new security policies of today so they can travel to and from our \ncountry with ease.\n  The bottom line is, the United States stands to make great gains \neconomically and diplomatically if we strengthen our travel and tourism \nindustry. So how do we go about doing this? The Travel Promotion Act \nwhich is before us today would create a public-private corporation for \ntravel promotion to promote the United States as a travel destination \nto overseas travelers. This corporation would develop and execute a \nplan to do the following: It would promote the United States to foreign \ntravelers by using coordinated advertising campaigns and other \npromotional activities, similar to what we see in the Olympics with \nCanada; the corporation would identify and correct misperceptions about \nU.S. travel policies; it would also help provide travel information to \nforeign visitors to the United States such as information about entry \nrequirements, fees, and documents; and last, the corporation would \nfocus its efforts to ensure that all 50 States benefit from overseas \ntourism, including areas not traditionally visited by international \ntravelers.\n  Understand this, no taxpayer funds would be used to finance the \ncorporation for travel promotion. Let me repeat that. No taxpayer funds \nwould be used to finance the corporation for travel promotion. All the \nfunding would come from private industry and from user fees paid by \nsome international visitors. This would finally put the United States \non equal footing with many other developed countries.\n  This legislation would be a true lifeline to my home State of Nevada, \nwhich depends so heavily on travel and tourism. I mentioned earlier my \nState was one of the hardest hit. But I do not think that description \ndoes the situation in Nevada justice. The tourism industry in Nevada, \nespecially Las Vegas, has truly been crippled by the economy. Nevadans \nwho were already struggling through home foreclosures have been forced \nto carry the burden of the downturned economy. Taxicab drivers, valets, \nhousekeepers, waiters and waitresses and construction workers are \ndrowning in this recession because Americans are not traveling like \nthey used to. These workers are barely keeping their heads above water \nand some are not even able to do that. They are losing their homes, \nwhich has truly annihilated the housing market in my State.\n  Boosting overseas travel will provide for growth in an otherwise \nshrinking segment of our economy, and it will help heal local economies \naround our country. This will, in turn, greatly advance our overall \neconomy at a time when we cannot afford to turn away the potential of \nhundreds of billions of dollars.\n  With domestic travel and convention travel down, overseas travel \ncould be the silver lining we all need. At a time when our country \nfaces record deficit and spending levels, I know this money may seem \nlike a lot. Believe me when I say to you that I take my pledge of \nfiscal responsibility very seriously. I vote against spending bills \nthat come across this floor all the time because they simply are an \nirresponsible waste of hard-earned taxpayer dollars. However, this bill \nis a responsible use of dollars. It does not apply a government \nspending bandaid to tough economic situations. It creates a solution \nthat will greatly benefit our economy, and it does it without taxpayer \ndollars.\n  The Travel Promotion Act, which has the overwhelming support of \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, is a relatively small investment that \nwill significantly boost our economy, create jobs, and make us more \ncompetitive in the world. The bill will not increase the deficit. This \nbill does not increase the deficit. But it could spur billions in \nadditional economic activity, benefiting Americans all around the \ncountry.\n  The Congressional Budget Office--nonpartisan, the official \nscorekeeper around here--confirms it will not place any additional \nburden on the taxpayer. People across my State and across the country \nhave had to make difficult decisions when it comes to their own \nfamilies' budgets. In fact, the legislature in my home State of Nevada \nis coming to terms with steep spending cuts and slashing services \nacross the board as we speak, in a special session, because it is too \nfar in the hole to sustain the current spending spree. So Americans are \nlooking to us to boost the economy and so far we have not been able to \ndo that.\n  Yes, we have spent money--and a lot of money at that, in fact--but \nour economic situation remains the same. I am asking that we look to \nthe tourism industry as a lifeline for our economy, as I know it will \nbe for my State and for so many others. The Travel Promotion Act will \nbe that lifeline. It will create jobs, create opportunity, and show the \nworld the beauty and the diversity of America.\n  Each one of us, who together represent all 50 States, knows we have \nincredible places to show the rest of the world. My home State of \nNevada is actually the gateway to the Grand Canyon, which is located in \nArizona. We have Lake Tahoe. We have, obviously, Las Vegas. We have so \nmany other places to visit around our great State. But every single \nSenator could tell those stories. What we need to do is tell them in a \nway that makes foreign travelers want to come to America. The Travel \nPromotion Act is going to help us do that.\n  Let me remind folks, if you watch the Olympics, ask yourself these \nquestions when those commercials about British Colombia come on: Does \nthat make you more or less likely to go, especially if you can afford \nit? I think the answer is pretty obvious. They make an attractive case \nto visit their country.\n  This is the United States of America, with some of the most \nbeautiful, incredible places to see. Are you telling me we cannot \nadvertise this in a way that makes people want to come here? Of course \nwe can. We can have tourism boosted like never before in this country \nand all Americans will benefit by doing that because when foreign \ntravelers come here, they spend money, boost the economy, and boost \nevery single State in this country.\n  I encourage this Senate to pass this bill as quickly as possible and \nget it over to the President for signature so we can get on with \nboosting the economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, may I ask what is the pending business \nbefore the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The travel promotion bill.\n  Mr. WEBB. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Kennan Nomination\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes on \nbehalf of Justice Barbara M. Kennan, who is the nominee to serve on the \nFourth Circuit Court. I respectfully request, in the name of good \ngovernance and the proper functioning of our constitutional system, \nthat our colleagues on the other side of the aisle allow a prompt vote \non her nomination.\n  Justice Kennan was voted out of committee in October of last year by \na unanimous voice vote. Her nomination is noncontroversial. She has \nbeen a dedicated public servant, a fair and balanced jurist, and her \nnomination has had broad bipartisan support. I believe it is critical \nthat we move forward as quickly as possible to confirm her nomination.\n  There are currently four vacancies on the Fourth Circuit, more than \nany other circuit. The seat that Justice Kennan would fill has been \nvacant for more than 2 years. Justice Kennan is an extraordinary choice \nto fill this vacancy. She has been a State supreme court justice since \n1991. She has been a trailblazer for women in the law throughout her \ncareer. At the age of 29, she was the first female general district \ncourt judge in Virginia when she was selected for the Fairfax County \nbench. That was in 1980. She became the first female circuit court \njudge when she was promoted to that court in 1982.\n\n[[Page S771]]\n\n  In 1985, she was 1 of 10 judges named to the First Virginia Court of \nAppeals and the only woman when that court was created. She was \nselected for the State Supreme Court, the second female justice ever to \nserve there, in 1991. She was, in fact, the first judge to have served \non all four levels of Virginia's courts.\n  I also would like to point out when Governor McDonnell was recently \nsworn into his office, he specifically requested that Justice Kennan \ndeliver him the oath of office. There is a wide bipartisan consensus \ninside Virginia about the quality of this nominee, and I am very \nhopeful we can move forward in an expeditious way.\n  I am mindful of the Senate's constitutional role in confirming \nexecutive nominations. It is vitally important, and a robust vetting \nprocess and debate is appropriate. We have conducted, inside Virginia \nin our delegation, that kind of vetting process which resulted in \nJustice Kennan's name being moved forward.\n  In the spirit of pragmatic bipartisanship and good governance, I \nbelieve it is time to move past these procedural delays that seem to \ninfect us and get on with the business of governing.\n  I would like to point out that out of 876 Federal judgeships, there \nare now 100 vacancies. These delays affect the administration of \njustice. These vacancies delay the resolution of disputes and they \ndiminish our citizens' rights to a speedy trial. It is my understanding \nthat Justice Kennan has broad support in this body. The vote in the \nJudiciary Committee is evidence of that. In fact, I will be very \nsurprised if any Senator were to vote against her confirmation. Again, \nI am asking my colleagues on the other side of the aisle if they might \nallow this nomination to advance in a timely way.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Thank you.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kaufman pertaining to the introduction of S. 3043 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, as I address this Chamber, President \nObama is hosting the leaders of both political parties in a summit on \nthe issue of health care reform. He has asked for all serious proposals \nto be brought to the table, once and for all, in an effort to bridge \nthe gap between the House and Senate legislation and pass a final bill. \nHe even provided his own proposal for how we can reconcile these bills \nwith one another.\n  I thank the President for his leadership on this issue and his \ncontinued commitment to the issue of health care reform. I am glad he \nhas called Republicans and Democrats to the table once again in yet \nanother effort to reenergize this debate and move forward on behalf of \nthe American people. I remain confident that we can still get this work \ndone. That is why I have come to the floor today: to reaffirm my \ncommitment to comprehensive health care reform and to urge my \ncolleagues to join with our President and the leadership of our \nrespective parties to find a real solution. In fact, I recently joined \nmany of my colleagues in signing a letter urging this Senate to pass a \nbill that includes a public option--something everyone in this room \nknows I have supported since the beginning of this long debate. No \nmatter what comes out of this afternoon's summit, I will judge our \nfinal proposal based on its ability to acknowledge three goals--the \nsame three goals I have called for time and again over the past several \nmonths.\n  Our reform bill must restore competition to the insurance market, it \nmust give us the tools to hold insurance companies accountable, and it \nmust provide real cost savings to the American people. I am confident \nwe can pass a measure that is capable of meeting these goals. I remain \nconfident that after nearly a century of inaction, the American people \ndemand and deserve nothing less.\n  Every President, every Congress, every ordinary citizen in the past \n97 years has had to wrestle with a health care system that is broken \nand inadequate, a system that our predecessors consistently failed to \nfix; a system that has deteriorated badly over the last few decades and \nthat remains unworthy of this great Nation. Today, 47 million Americans \nare without health insurance and 88 million do not have stable \ncoverage. As a result of our broken system, 45 million Americans die \nevery single year because they had no health insurance. These shocking \nfacts should never be far from our minds as we debate these issues. \nThey are more than statistics; they are ordinary Americans who \ndesperately need our help.\n  As I address this Chamber today, we stand on the verge of correcting \nthe oversights of the past century and getting these people the help \nthey need. Legislation has been written, amended, and rewritten. We \nhave compromised and compromised again. Each Chamber of the Congress \nhas passed a comprehensive bill. Neither bill is perfect but both \nrepresent significant progress. We are so close to doing this. Now is \nthe time to finish the journey.\n  Late last year, both the House and Senate voted for health care \nreform with a strong voice and a clear majority. At this point, we have \nonly to reconcile the differences between these two bills. Just this \nweek, President Obama released his detailed proposal outlining exactly \nhow we can get this done. I urge my colleagues from both Chambers and \nfrom both parties to strongly consider this option.\n  Regardless of how we choose to proceed after today's bipartisan \nhealth care summit, let us come away with a definite plan of action. \nLet us come away with a plan to get this done, a plan that includes \ncompetition, cost savings, and accountability.\n  It is time to realize the promise of the last 100 years. I urge my \ncolleagues to finish the fight that Teddy Roosevelt first waged more \nthan a generation before any of us were born. Now is not the time to \nlose our nerve. Now is the time to act with conviction. Let's not allow \nthe obstructionist tactics of a few to undermine legislation that \ngarnered 60 votes in this Chamber and 220 votes in the House. I refuse \nto accept that a handful of ``no'' votes can invalidate 280 votes. I \nrefuse to accept that the minority party can stifle the voices of \nmillions of Americans and hundreds of Members of Congress who have \ndemanded that we win this fight. I call upon my colleagues in both \nChambers to look past our differences and carry out the will of the \nAmerican people. They sent Democrats to Congress with the largest \nmajority in decades. They elected a President who has pledged himself \nto this cause.\n  As far as the American people are concerned, this debate was over a \nlong time ago. This issue has carried the day. This is the measure that \nthe American people voted for in 2008 and, my fellow Democrats, this is \nwhat our party is all about. Now is not the time to shrink from the \nfight but to engage in it. Now is not the time to falter or to second-\nguess the wisdom of the folks who sent us here. Now is the time to take \nbold action, to forge ahead, to carry forward the ideas and principles \nof our party by delivering real results and delivering for the American \npeople a health care plan that will give them protection and not see \ntheir premiums going up 39 percent and 40 percent.\n  Comprehensive health care reform will extend quality coverage to 31 \nmillion Americans. It will reduce premiums and prevent insurance \ncompanies from abusing their customers or discriminating against people \nwho get\n\n[[Page S772]]\n\nsick. Can my colleagues imagine: You get sick and think you have \ncoverage today and then they cancel your policy and you have no \ncoverage. The majority leader stood on the floor yesterday and told the \nstory about the young kid with the cleft lip where the father paid \n$90,000 because the insurance company canceled the policy because the \nkid was born with a cleft lip. That is unconscionable. We in this \ncountry should not tolerate it.\n  The Senate bill could even cut the Federal deficit by about $1 \ntrillion over the next two decades. I ask my colleagues: What are we \nwaiting for? This is about values, not politics. Our country deserves \nbetter, so let's make it happen.\n  In politics, it is easy to find excuses. It is easy to wait, to \ndelay, to place blame on another and throw up our hands. That is not \nleadership. That is not what the American people have called upon us to \ndo and it is far less than they deserve. The American people have been \nwaiting for 100 years, and I, for one, think that is quite long enough.\n  I say to my colleagues: It is time for us to lead. It is time to take \nup the mantle of Teddy Roosevelt and, yes, Teddy Kennedy, and everyone \nin between. Because this isn't just about health care; it is about \ncreating jobs, helping small businesses, and keeping America on the \nroad to economic recovery. These issues are not separate as some would \nhave us believe. They are tied inextricably together. Fixing the \nAmerican health care system will reduce the deficit, make it easier for \nsmall businesses to meet expenses, create jobs, and provide health \ncoverage to more Americans than ever before. The way I see it, we \ncannot afford to wait any longer.\n  So let us act with a strong, united voice. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in passing a final health care bill and sending it to President \nObama as soon as possible. Yesterday would have been all right. Let's \nwin this fight. Let's stand up for what we believe in and succeed where \nour predecessors came up short. The stakes are too high to settle for \nanything else.\n  I say to my colleagues, and to those who are meeting today with the \nPresident, we must come up and out of this summit with a plan that is \ngoing to give health insurance to the people of America not tomorrow, \nnot next week, but right now.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor, and I note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Nevada's tourism has been hit hard by the \nslowing worldwide economy. And when tourism in Nevada hurts, the entire \nState suffers.\n  Hardworking people have lost their jobs. The State's budget has taken \na major hit. Because that budget is largely funded by tourism, funding \nfor vital programs in our State are at risk.\n  But Nevada is not alone. Its problem is not unique. Tourism is one of \nthe top industries in nearly every State in the country and one of the \nlargest employers in America.\n  That is why this bill is so important. This is an opportunity not \nonly to give American tourism a boost, but it is one of the many ways \nwe are working to create jobs and help our economy recover.\n  The concept behind it is simple: It says, let's create jobs and \nreduce the deficit. It is a win-win for the economy of every State and \nour national economy alike.\n  And it is a bipartisan bill that take the strategies that have made \nLas Vegas such a success and brings them to our entire Nation's tourism \nindustry.\n  This week, the U.S. Travel Association called the last 10 years a \n``lost decade'' for tourism. It cost us half a million jobs and half a \nbillion dollars in lost spending. This bill will turn that around.\n  The travel promotion bill is a jobs bill. It is about creating jobs, \nit is about growing our economy and it is about keeping the United \nStates competitive in the world travel business.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4691\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof H.R. 4691, which is a 30-day extension of provisions which expire on \nSunday, February 28--they are an unemployment insurance extension; \nCOBRA, health insurance for the unemployed; flood insurance; the \nSatellite Home Viewer Act; highway funding; SBA business loans and \nsmall business provisions of the American Recovery Act; SGR, which is \nthe so-called doctor fix; and poverty guidelines--received from the \nHouse and at the desk; that the bill be read three times, passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be made and laid on the table.\n  This matter passed the House unanimously today. The reason it passed \nthe House unanimously today, if we don't do something about this, all \naround America, about 1\\1/2\\ million people who will be watching TV \nwill no longer watch TV. This is mostly in rural areas of America, \nrural areas of Nevada. I guess we could be hard-hearted and say they \ndon't need to watch TV, but in Nevada we have very harsh winters in \nmany parts of the State. For many of these people, the only way they \ncan get information is through television. It could lead to some very \nserious problems. If we talk about flood insurance, even though Nevada \nis a very dry State, this is something we need to do for States where \nwe have all kinds of problems with floods all the time. We, in northern \nNevada and in southern Nevada, have had some devastating floods, not \noften but we have them. Highway funding, this costs nothing, what we \nare doing here, the extension costs zero. SBA business loans, this \ncosts $60 million to allow the SBA to continue processing programs to \nallow people who want to have a business to get a few dollars so they \ncan continue or start a new business. We are not going to be able to do \nthis because it expires at the end of this month; small business \nprovisions of the Recovery Act, the same thing; poverty guidelines, \nthese things cost nothing basically nothing; the SGR, it is my \nunderstanding about $1 billion is being asked for here. I think it is \nsuch a shame that we don't get this done. The big ones, though, from my \nperspective, are the poor. We have people who weren't poor who are now \npoor because they have been unemployed for so long. This will terminate \non Monday. I talked to the Presiding Officer. In just a matter of \nweeks, 65,000 people in Illinois will no longer be able to draw these \nbenefits. In the State of Nevada, which is not as heavily populated as \nIllinois, thousands of people who have been unemployed for long periods \nof time--and I repeat, they started out in this business not being \npoor; they are poor now--it would be a shame not to give them those \nmoneys.\n  My friend, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, is going to say: \nPay for all this. As I have gone through everything we have talked \nabout, it doesn't cost much money. Unemployment compensation does. It \ncosts a lot of money. We have millions of people who are unemployed. In \nyears past, when we wanted to extend unemployment benefits, it was an \nemergency, a declared emergency historically in this body. Why? Because \nit is an emergency. We have rules in effect, pay-go rules we have \npassed. Of course, we can look to that as a step forward. But that \ndoesn't mean we don't have emergencies.\n  I would also say that COBRA--what is COBRA? It is a program to help \npeople who are out of work or who lose their jobs get insurance.\n  Anyway, I say to my friend from Kentucky, I would hope that for the \npeople I have described who are just wanting us to do our work, we can \nget that done. I hope my friend would not object to this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard from the Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. Bunning.\n  The majority leader.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4691\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to H.R. \n4691 and that the Reid of Nevada substitute amendment which is the desk \nbe considered read; that the Republican leader or his designee be \nrecognized to offer a substitute amendment, and\n\n[[Page S773]]\n\nthere be 60 minutes of debate with respect to that amendment, with the \ntime equally divided and controlled between the leaders or their \ndesignees; that upon the use or yielding back of that time, and if a \nbudget point of order is made against the amendment, a motion to waive \nthe relevant point of order be considered made, and the Senate then \nvote on the motion to waive the point of order; that if the waiver is \nsuccessful, the amendment be agreed to and the Reid substitute, as \namended, be agreed to; that if the waiver fails, the amendment be \nwithdrawn; further, that there be 30 minutes for debate with respect to \nthe Reid substitute amendment, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between the leaders or their designees; that upon the use or \nyielding back of that time, and if a budget point of order is made \nagainst the amendment, a motion to waive the relevant point of order be \nconsidered made, and the Senate then vote on the motion to waive the \npoint of order; that if the waiver is successful, the Senate proceed to \nvote on adoption of the Reid substitute amendment; further, that no \nfurther amendments, motions, except a motion to reconsider a vote, or \ndebate be in order; that upon disposition of the Reid substitute \namendment, the bill, as amended, be read a third time; and following \nthe reading by the clerk of the budgetary effects of the pay-go \nlegislation with respect to H.R. 1586, the Senate proceed to vote on \npassage of the bill, as amended; that upon passage, the title \namendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed to.\n  Before my friend from Kentucky makes his feelings known, let me say \nthis. This is something we worked out yesterday. When I say ``we,'' \nthat means Democrats and Republicans, all except one Senator. What this \nagreement allows is for all the provisions in this, these extensions be \npaid for out of the stimulus or the economic recovery money. That is a \nfair vote. Some people want to do that. Let's vote on it. We know what \nthe rules are. We are sent here to vote. We are not sent here to \nobject. When 99 Senators want something done, it is not right for one \nSenator to hold it up. My friend has that right. But it is a real \nproblem for so many different people. I would hope we could have a \nvote. We can do it tonight and move on to other things.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Reserving the right to object, I just wish to make sure \nI am objecting to the right motion. In the third-to-last sentence, the \nleader used, in my opinion, the wrong number. He used H.R. 1586.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky is right. I have \nit written here.\n  Mr. BUNNING. It should be 4691.\n  Mr. REID. That was my mistake. I appreciate the Senator catching \nthat.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard by the Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. Bunning.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, may I now speak and propose a unanimous \nconsent? First of all, let me say this to my good friend from Nevada. I \nhave worked all day trying to work out a compromise, anywhere from 2 to \n4 weeks on this UC, trying to get it paid for, for the time of the \nextension. We were very close. We tried to get agreement using \ndifferent pay-fors than what I am going to propose. But in the final \nanalysis, it came down to, when the White House summit adjourned, the \nleader came back and it was going to be his way and no one else's way. \nThat is what it turned into. I am going to propose a 30-day extension \nwith an offset. So I am as anxious to get those same provisions he has \nbrought up--the COBRA, flood insurance, Satellite Home Viewer Act, \nhighway funding, SBA provisions, American Recovery Act, SGR, poverty \nguidelines. I wish to get them renewed also.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4691\n\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of H.R. 4691; that the amendment at the \ndesk, which offers a full offset, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, \nbe read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Is there objection?\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there \nprobably has never been a time in the history of our country when we \nhad economic conditions that are like they are today--unemployment all \nover this country averaging some 10 percent; some States as high as 14 \npercent. If there were ever an emergency with our economy, it is \ntonight, it is today. And to think we are not going to declare this an \nemergency?\n  Millions of people are unemployed, millions of people have been \nunemployed for long periods of time and their unemployment benefits are \nrunning out. They are not able to buy their health insurance because \nthe program is going to expire on Monday.\n  The Senate has a history of treating unemployment benefits as an \nemergency. No one, I repeat, can argue that the current economic \ndownturn does not represent a grave emergency. So, Mr. President, I am \nforced to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture vote on the motion to concur in \nthe House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1299 occur at 7:50 \np.m. tonight--3 minutes from now--that if cloture is invoked, then all \npostcloture time be considered yielded back, Senator DeMint then be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes to move to suspend the rules; that upon \nthe use of that time, the Senate then proceed to vote on the DeMint \nmotion; that if the DeMint motion is successful, then the amendment be \nagreed to, and the motion to concur with the amendment be agreed to; \nthat if the DeMint motion fails, then no other motions or debate be in \norder; that the motion to concur with an amendment be withdrawn, and \nthe Senate then proceed to vote on the Reid of Nevada motion to concur \nin the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 1299.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we expect to have three votes here tonight. \nAs soon as those are done, we will not have another vote until Tuesday, \nbut it will be in the morning.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. \n     1299, the United States Capitol Police Administrative \n     Technical Corrections Act.\n         Harry Reid, Byron L.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nremarks of Senator DeMint, his vote and the next vote be 10 minutes in \nduration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Cloture having been invoked, the motion to refer falls.\n  Under the previous order, all postcloture time is yielded back.\n  The Senator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint, is recognized for up to \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I know many here are very anxious to start \na new government agency, and I won't hold you up for very long.\n  It is important that we recognize some things that are happening. \nThere is probably one good thing we can do tonight--maybe--to stop the \nlandslide of more government control. In the last year--a little over a \nyear--we have seen this Federal Government take over two of our largest \nauto companies, our largest mortgage company, our largest insurance \ncompany, and expand its control on America's domestic energy sources, \nand, of course, we had the debate on trying to expand control of health \ncare.\n  We are expecting, very soon, a new financial reform package that will \nexpand Federal control everywhere from Wall Street to the local \npawnshop.\n  While these big things are coming in front of us, there are things \nhappening in the executive branch that are circumventing Congress, and \nthat should concern us. A lot of you have heard from industries back \nhome about what the EPA standards are doing. Businesses don't know what \nto expect, nor do local communities. I had an engine company in my \noffice today that said orders were on hold until they find out what the \nEPA is going to do. I have also had people in my office in the last \nweek talking about the FCC and the coming ruling on expanding control \nover the Internet--one place in our economy that continues to boom with \ninnovation.\n  There is one thing that just leaked out that I want to bring to your \nattention. We need to try to halt that tonight before it is too late. A \nwhistleblower at the Department of the Interior leaked a document that \nshows they are considering using the Antiquities Act to grab over 10 \nmillion acres of land in nine Western States and basically take them \noffline of jobs for mining, forestry, and energy. This includes Nevada, \nUtah, Montana, New Mexico, California, Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, and \nWashington. It is important that we stop this and at least have some \nSenate hearings on what they are trying to do.\n  This is a priority for what we are talking about today because the \nPresident and the Congress have said our top priority is jobs. This \naction by the Interior Department will hurt jobs. It will dry up tax \nrevenues in local communities and States. It will restrict energy \nsupplies in this country.\n  Mr. President, all I am asking is that we suspend the rules, which \nrequire 67 votes, and vote on this amendment to stop the Department of \nthe Interior from taking over over 10 million acres of land and hurting \nour economy and jobs.\n  I promised the leader I would keep it to less than 10 minutes. I \nencourage everybody to support this motion I am getting ready to make.\n  Mr. President, I move to suspend the provisions of rule XXII, \nincluding germaneness requirements, for the purpose of proposing and \nconsidering my amendment, which is at the desk, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion of \nthe Senator from South Carolina to suspend rule XXII and offer an \namendment to prohibit the establishment of national monuments under the \nAntiquities Act or any other law.\n  I understand that the proposed amendment is in response to \nallegations that a portion of an internal planning memo at the \nDepartment of the Interior identified several areas throughout the \ncountry as areas that may be appropriate for potential national \nmonument consideration.\n  The Secretary of the Interior has stated that the document was simply \na brainstorming exercise to identify sites on public land that might \nmerit more serious consideration for possible management options, and \nthat no decisions have been made about which areas, if any, might merit \nmore serious review and consideration.\n  I don't think it makes sense to try to legislate every time an \narticle appears in a newspaper. I would observe that even the document \nin question that was leaked to certain Members of Congress states that \n``further evaluations should be completed prior to any decision, \nincluding an assessment of public and Congressional support,'' and \nSecretary Salazar has publicly stated his view that new designations \nand conservation initiatives work best when they build on local \nefforts. So I think that any attempt to legislate at this time is very \npremature.\n  Apart from the substantive problems with the proposed DeMint \namendment, the travel promotion bill is not the appropriate legislation \nto consider this issue, and waiving the Senate rules to allow for \nconsideration of an amendment that would not otherwise be in order is, \nin my view, not appropriate.\n  For these reasons, I oppose the motion to suspend rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL.

On this vote, the yeas are 38, the nays are \n58. Two-thirds of the Senate voting, a quorum being present, not having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Under the previous order, the motion to concur with amendment No. \n3326 is withdrawn.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nsupport of H.R. 1299, the Capitol Police Administration bill, the \nlegislative vehicle for the Travel Promotion Act of 2009.\n  The Travel Promotion Act of 2009 will allow the United States to \nremain competitive as a welcoming destination for foreign travelers. \nOur ability to explain the processes and changes made by the United \nStates to gain entry for travel will help to ease fears about the entry \nprocess. The proposed nonprofit, independent corporation charged with \nthis responsibility will be able to conduct the necessary outreach and \npromote tourism in a way that the tourism industry cannot. In addition, \nan Office of Travel Promotion will be able to work with the Department \nof State and the Department of Homeland Security to improve the entry \nprocess.\n  Promoting the United States as an attractive tourist destination for \nboth leisure and business with international visitors is of the utmost \nimportance to the many States that house destination resorts. Consider \nthe experience of my own home State of Hawaii. Hawaii's economy largely \nrelies on travel and travel related business. Visitors from around the \nworld come to see our islands' natural beauty, and experience the \nspirit of ``Aloha.'' Our Nation's hospitality industry suffered a \nsevere setback following the events of September 11, 2001, and travel \nfrom abroad to the United States fell dramatically.\n  It is not only the hospitality industry in Hawaii that suffers, but \nour local businesses. The State of Hawaii boasts its beauty and \nenvironment, but many travelers to our State come to do business, which \nis sometimes obscured or overlooked because of Hawaii's label as a \ntourist destination. The hospitality industry's employees rely on \nvacationers and businessmen and women to provide for their families. \nThe economic activity generated by this industry continues to struggle \nduring these financially challenging times.\n  Hawaii's experience is not unique. The hospitality industry \nnationwide continues to face similar challenges, and the economic \neffects have rippled through the nation to impact all of our citizens. \nThe State of Hawaii's visitor statistics continue to reflect the \ndownward trend. Preliminary travel data for 2009 indicate that there \nwas an overall 3.5 percent decline in the number of international \nvisitors to the islands compared to the number of international \nvisitors in 2008. Nationwide, the number of international visitors \nbetween January and November of 2009 fell by 7.2 percent compared to \nthe same period during 2008.\n  Both developing countries and industrialized economies around the \nworld have ministers and offices that promote travel to their \nrespective countries. However, the United States does not have an \noffice that promotes travel and tourism abroad. This legislation is an \nimportant first step in the right direction. Establishing an Office of \nTravel Promotion will help to attract foreign travelers to the United \nStates. This will not only sustain our tourism based industries, it \nreinforces business relationships and promotes a better understanding \nbetween Americans and our friends abroad. Interacting with the American \npeople is a valuable tool at our disposal to dispel international \ntravelers of misconceptions they may have about our country. \nApproximately 74 percent of visitors have a more favorable opinion of \nthe United States after visiting our country.\n  The economic activity generated by international travel and its \npromotion should be approached in the same manner we foster other \nindustries equally important to jobs and the economy. The Travel \nPromotion Act of 2009 is vital to our travel and tourism industry's \nability to compete globally, and to restore confidence in the United \nStates' image as a country that is committed to welcoming our friends \nfrom abroad. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and help \nus ensure that international business and leisure travel to the United \nStates is given all of the tools necessary to succeed.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to concur in the House \namendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1299.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I do not \nbelieve we need another office in this bureaucracy, so I will be voting \nagainst this bill. I voted against it on June 22 of last year, \nSeptember 8 of last year, and September 9 of last year, so my vote \nwould have been the same this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/25/senate-section/article/S775-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S775-S776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 4213\n\n  Mr. REID.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/25/senate-section/article/S776-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S776-S792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 4691\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4691, a 30-day extension \nof provisions which expire on Sunday, February 28--unemployment \ninsurance, COBRA, flood insurance, Satellite Home Viewer Act, highway \nfunding, SBA business loans and small business provisions of the \nAmerican Recovery Act, SGR and poverty guidelines--received from the \nHouse and at the desk; that the bill be read three times, passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senator has objected to extending \nunemployment benefits across the United States of America which will \nexpire on Sunday night. He has also objected to extending COBRA \nbenefits, which is health insurance for the unemployed people across \nAmerica. This has been done regularly, now that we are in this \nrecession, because millions of Americans are out of work. We know there \nare four or five, maybe even six people for every available job. Folks \nhave depleted their savings, they run the risk of losing their homes, \nthey are trying to keep their children in school, they are trying to \nprovide the necessities of life, and the Senator from Kentucky objects \nto their having unemployment benefit checks.\n  What does it mean to me? Well, in the State of Illinois, it means \nthat as of Sunday night, 15,000 people in my State will stop receiving \nunemployment benefits because of the objection of the Senator from \nKentucky. It means that every week thereafter another 15,000 will lose \ntheir unemployment benefits. It is a harsh reality that many of these \nfamilies have been looking for work for a long time.\n  The Senator has also objected to providing assistance to small \nbusiness. The request I made would extend, for 30 days, provisions of \nthe Small Business Act and the Recovery Act lending programs for small \nbusinesses. So what the Senator from Kentucky is doing, as of Sunday \nnight, is shutting down the availability of credit for small businesses \nacross America through this Small Business Administration program. In \nthe midst of a recession, when we are told small businesses are the \nengine that will bring us out of this recession, when they are \ndesperate for credit to keep their doors open, families who have spent \na lifetime building a small business are going to be denied an \nopportunity to borrow money through the Small Business Administration \nbecause of the objection of the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Let me say a word about COBRA. One of the first casualties of \nunemployment is health insurance. Sadly, many of these people are in a \nposition where they do not qualify for Medicaid--health insurance for \nthe poorest people. So they find themselves without health insurance \nfor the first time because they are unemployed. We said, under \nPresident Obama's Recovery Act, we are going to help you pay for those \npremiums so you can continue to have health insurance for your family. \nThat expires Sunday night too. The objection of the Senator from \nKentucky means thousands of people across America will lose their \nhealth insurance. Because of his objection, they will lose it on Sunday \nnight.\n  Workers who lose their jobs count on COBRA. And COBRA, frankly, is \nexpensive. On average, COBRA coverage consumes 84 percent of \nunemployment benefits. It is not cheap. The average monthly \nunemployment benefit in Illinois is just over $1,300. The average \nmonthly family COBRA premium is over $1,100. Through the Recovery Act, \nwe said we would pick up 65 percent of that. Well, because of the \nobjection of the Senator from Kentucky, if these people want to \nmaintain their health insurance through unemployment, they are \nbasically going to have to turn to savings or give it up.\n  Why? Why would we want to heap this kind of suffering on people who \nare already going through such misfortune? It isn't just Illinois that \nsuffers, it is virtually every State. As of December, there were \n221,000 people in Kentucky unemployed--10.7 percent of the Kentucky \nworkforce--63,000 people in Louisville, 18,000 people in Lexington, \n6,000 in Bowling Green, 5,500 in Elizabethtown, 5,000 in Owensboro. As \nthey are desperately looking for work, many of these people are just \ngetting by on unemployment checks. They are just trying to get by.\n  Last month, the State of Kentucky had the sharpest increase in \nunemployment claims in the country--in the entire United States--with \n2,510 more claims than the month prior due to the automobile industry \nand manufacturing job cuts. Unfortunately, many of these people will \nlose their unemployment benefits in Kentucky because of the objection \nof their Senator. If Senator Bunning has his way, more than 14,000 \nKentucky residents will lose their unemployment assistance in March and \n60,000 by the end of June.\n  Why? Why are we doing this to these families in Kentucky and Illinois \nand every State? Everyone acknowledges there is only one objection. \nEveryone in this Chamber acknowledges we are a caring and compassionate \ncountry, and we will, on an emergency basis, extend a helping hand to \nthose who have lost their jobs.\n  Most Senators have left for the evening, but some have stayed on the \nfloor. I have asked them if they would like to say a word on this \nissue. They are going to go home and tell their people back home there \nare going to be some terrible things happening as of Sunday night \nbecause of the objection of the Senator from Kentucky: 15,000 in my \nState, thousands in his own State and all across the country.\n  I am staying tonight to talk about this because, frankly, I don't \nthink this ought to be business as usual. I don't think one Senator \nought to be able to heap this kind of suffering and misfortune on \npeople who are already struggling in this economy. If you wish to take \nit out on somebody, take it out on a colleague or a debate, but these \nare helpless people out of work.\n  Senator Reid offered to the Senator from Kentucky an amendment--bring \nto the floor your theory on how to pay for this. He has a theory. He \nwants to pay for it with unexpended stimulus funds, as I understand \nit. He would have had his chance on the floor to make his case. He \nwould have had a rollcall at the end of the day. He might have won, he \nmight have lost, but he came to the floor yesterday and said I am not \ngoing to fall for that. I may lose this amendment and therefore I am \ngoing to object.\n\n  That is the nature of things. It is like when you pitch a ball game. \nSometimes you win and sometimes you lose. On the floor, sometimes you \nwin----\n  Mr. BUNNING. Do you know about that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have never pitched a ball game. I never have. I am very \nproud of what you have done in your baseball career. But let me tell \nyou, this is a wild pitch you are throwing tonight because this is a \npitch that is hitting somebody in the stands, it is hitting an \nunemployed worker in Illinois. That is a wild pitch that should not \nhave been thrown, Senator.\n  I believe when you look at what this is going to do across America, \nthis is unforgivable that we would do this to these unemployed people.\n  For the Senator from Michigan, I yield for the purpose of a question.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I appreciate the Senator from Illinois, my friend, in \nhis comments. I guess my question would relate to the State of Michigan \nbecause the Senator listed off some very important statistics. I wonder \nif the Senator is aware that in March, 62,000 people in the great State \nof Michigan, where we have the highest unemployment rate--we have a \n14.6-percent unemployment rate, over 700,000 people right now \nunemployed, looking for work. These are people trying to keep a roof \nover their head, trying to keep food on their table, they are trying to \nhold things together as they are looking for a job. Yet we have 62,000 \ngreat people from Michigan who are going to lose their benefits in \nMarch. In fact, if this continues--and I know all of us are working \nvery hard to get a year extension of\n\n[[Page S777]]\n\nunemployment benefits. But I am wondering if my friend is aware that by \nMay, 225,000 people in Michigan will be out of their benefits. These \nare people who are looking for work. We know for every one job \navailable there are six people right now who are fighting to get that \njob. We have a jobs agenda. We are working very hard to make sure there \nare more jobs and partnering within the private sector.\n  But in the meantime, I am wondering if my friend would agree with the \nfact that this is a disaster, in fact. This is as much a disaster for \nfamilies as anything else. We do emergency spending for floods and \nhurricanes and all kinds of disasters. For families, would my friend \nagree, this is as much of a disaster and warrants as much immediate \nattention as anything else we do?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Michigan, this has been \ncharacterized as an emergency because it is an emergency. It has been \nacknowledged by the Budget Committee. It will be treated as an \nemergency spending situation. It is an extraordinary situation, just \nlike a drought or flood or hurricane or tornado. These people have had \ntheir lives disrupted. We are trying to keep these families together. \nIf there is ever a family value issue, this is it.\n  At this point I would like, on behalf of the people of Michigan and \nIllinois and Kentucky, Mr. President, to ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4691, a 30-day \nextension of provisions which expire on Sunday, February 28, \nunemployment insurance, COBRA, flood insurance, Satellite Home Viewer \nAct, highway funding, SBA, business loans and small business provisions \nof the American Recovery Act, SGR, and poverty guidelines received from \nthe House and at the desk; that the bill be read three times, passed, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUNNING. The Senator from Kentucky objects.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island \nfor purposes of a question.\n  Mr. REED. I am wondering if the Senator can confirm that we have \nroutinely extended unemployment benefits over many decades, over both \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents and Republican and Democratic \nCongresses, and we have always done it when the unemployment rate was \nat least above 7.4 percent. I think the lowest unemployment rate in \nwhich we suspended unemployment, extending benefits, was 7.4 percent. I \nsay that because in Rhode Island we are up to 12.9 percent and there \nare other States that are equally disadvantaged.\n  This not only sort of upsets what I think is the logical way to \nproceed on this tonight, but it rejects decades and decades of the \ncommon sense and common decency of the Congress.\n  I think and I hope you can confirm that understanding.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Rhode Island he is correct. In \nthese extraordinary times when people have lost so many jobs, we set \npolitics aside and we say we are going to help these people, whether it \nis victims of an economic disaster or a natural disaster. I cannot \nimagine if I were going home to Rhode Island, facing 12.9 percent. It \nis 11.1 in my home State of Illinois. You have a larger percentage of \nyour population going through this. I am sure you have examples of \nfriends, of folks who have already contacted your office who are at \ntheir wits end to figure out how to keep their families together.\n  I have seen it. I went to the unemployment offices in Chicago. I hope \nthe Senator from Kentucky has visited with unemployed families in his \nState and understands how desperate they are. These are people who will \ndo anything to get a job. They will do anything to get an interview.\n  They are trying desperately. Some of them are taking training \ncourses, trying to figure out anything that might work to get a job.\n  They are really up against it when it comes to health insurance. It \nis one of the first casualties. This objection by the Senator from \nKentucky will make it next to impossible for these families to have \nhealth insurance as a result of his objection.\n  I don't understand why we would do this. We are a caring people. On a \nbipartisan basis we step up as an American family when people are in \nneed. I would not ask twice if someone came to me with a disaster in \nanother State, because I know I have needed help in my own State. This \nis a real disaster. It is one that has affected virtually every State.\n  When you take a look at some of the provisions in this bill--\nincidentally, beyond unemployment--some people, particularly those \nliving in rural areas, are affected by this Satellite Home Viewer Act \nwhich will not be extended because of the Senator's objection. It is a \nminor inconvenience for some, maybe more of an inconvenience for \nothers. But why would we do this? Why would we object to the extension \nof these basic provisions in the law for 30 days? That is all we are \nasking for. I would think that is very basic and something we should be \ndoing.\n  I also think the idea of helping the doctors who are treating \nMedicare patients is not an unreasonable thing to do. These are people \nwho are taking care of the elderly in America, our parents and \ngrandparents. This so-called SGR, the sustainable growth rate, or doc \nfix, is also one of the provisions which the Senator from Kentucky is \nobjecting to.\n  It doesn't make sense. We want to make sure patients across America \nreceive the care they are entitled to, that Medicare patients can go \nvisit their doctors and doctors can receive adequate compensation for \ndoing that. I do not think that is an unreasonable thing for us to ask \nand I hope my colleagues who are on the floor here, if they have \nsimilar situations in their own State with unemployment, or if they are \ndealing with small businesses needing credit, would join me in this \nconversation on the floor about how unfair it is to be objecting to \nthis extension of unemployment benefits.\n  I yield to the Senator from Missouri for purposes of a question.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I am not prepared with some of the \nquestions I would like to ask because, frankly, I am surprised. I would \nlike to be able to ask you and compare the numbers in Missouri, the \nnumber of families who are going to find out tomorrow morning that even \nthough we have appropriately extended unemployment benefits, that now \nwe are not going to. I think they are going to be as surprised as I am. \nIt is easy to get out of touch in this place. People are deferential to \nyou around here. They open doors for you and bow and scrape. It is easy \nto forget what people are going through, what families are feeling \nright now, how hard it is for them to look to the future and still see \nthat American dream on the horizon.\n\n  Really, 30 days of unemployment? Really? Have we gotten to that? Have \nwe gotten to the point that that is going to be a political football? I \nthink we have to take a hard look in the mirror, if it comes to this--\n30 days of unemployment insurance for families who want to work, who \ndeserve to work, who are trying to work.\n  By the way, let me ask the Senator from Illinois, if the unemployment \nruns out, where do those families go? What happens then? Where do they \ngo?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Missouri that for many \npeople there is almost no place to turn. In my hometown of Springfield, \nIL, there is something called township assistance, when you have no \nplace to turn. It is a fraction of the money you would receive for \nunemployment. It would barely provide money for food for these people.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I am assuming if they get to the point, then it is \nfood stamps, right?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. There is other governmental assistance that is \navailable to them. Maybe they will have to lose their homes. They would \nhave to go to homeless shelters.\n  What I am trying to get at is there is a cost to this. It is not like \nall of a sudden the government is not going to get any cost if these \npeople stop getting unemployment insurance. If they lose their health \ninsurance, it is not as though they are going to not get treated in the \nemergency room if they get hit by a car on Monday. We are going to take \ncare of them in the emergency room. We are all going to pay for it.\n\n[[Page S778]]\n\n  This is wrong. I hope the Senator sticks around and renews this \nmotion for a while. I hope some of us stick around and help.\n  The American people need to realize how out of touch this place has \ngotten.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on behalf of unemployed people in Kentucky \nand Rhode Island and Michigan and Illinois and Missouri, I ask \nunanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of \nH.R. 4691, a 30-day extension of provisions which expire on Sunday, \nFebruary 28; unemployment insurance, COBRA, flood insurance, Satellite \nHome Viewer Act, highway funding, SBA business loans and small business \nloans and small business provisions of the American Recovery Act, SGR, \nand poverty guidelines received from the House and at the desk; that \nthe bill be read three times, passed, and that the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves the right to object.\n  Mr. BUNNING. It seems to me people have not been listening, \nparticularly the Senator from Illinois. He has been through two of \nthese with the leader. He heard the arguments on both sides. \nUnfortunately, he has a one-side-only view of this situation. I have \noffered the same COBRA, flood insurance, unemployment insurance, \nSatellite Home Viewing Act, highway funding, SBA loans, small business \nprovisions--I have offered to do the same thing for the same amount of \ntime. The only difference I have, and some of my good friends from the \nother side of the aisle, is that I believe we should pay for it. There \nis a right over the last 3 years of the Democratically controlled \nCongress. We have run up $5 trillion in debt. There has to be a time to \nstop that.\n  We just passed, last week, pay-as-you-go. The first bill up--and I \nhave said this before earlier--was the small business bill that just \npassed. Now, $5 billion out of that bill was paid for; $10 billion was \nnot.\n  This is the second request after we passed the small business bill \nthat the leader proposed. This also adds $10 billion to the deficit. \nThat is $20 billion in two small bills.\n  What I have proposed is that we pay for it. My gosh, we have over \n$400 billion in unspent stimulus money. I also worked, or tried to \nwork, with the leader and his staff. I know he was busy at the White \nHouse, but I tried very hard to work with his staff to get other pay-\nfors and cut the time down to 2 weeks to make sure these people were \ntaken care of.\n  I did not get any support from my good friends on the Democratic side \nof the aisle. I did not think it was fair to do what you are proposing \nto do, the Senator from Illinois. I will be here as long as you are \nhere and as long as all of those other Senators are here. I am going to \nobject every time because you will not pay for this and you propose \nnever to pay for it.\n  Eventually, by Tuesday, when we do have another vote, you will get a \nvote, and you will get this done. So I am trying to make a point to the \npeople of the United States of America: We have a debt of $14-plus \ntrillion. I listened to the head of the Federal Reserve speaking to me \nin the Banking Committee today, and he looked straight at me and said \nthe debt and the proposed budget of the Obama administration makes the \ndebt unsustainable. We cannot sustain it.\n  I have a family of nine children and 40 grandchildren. I am as \nconcerned as all of those good Senators sitting over there to pay for \nthis and make sure we give these benefits to those people. But that is \nnot the case. So it is their way or the highway, and I am not taking \nthe highway.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wanted to give the Senator from Kentucky an opportunity \nto explain his position. I did not assert regular order until he had an \nopportunity to do so. But I would like to remind him, on November 4 of \nlast year, he issued a press release entitled, ``Bunning Supports \nExtension of Benefits for Kentucky's Unemployed.'' The legislation \nincludes Senator Bunning's net operating loss amendment. It passed by a \nvote of 98 to 0. And he said:\n\n       Kentucky has been hit hard by the current economic \n     downturn. This legislation will lend a helping hand to \n     working families across the Commonwealth who are in search of \n     a job.\n\n  It was not paid for either. The point is, we are in the same \nrecession. It has gotten worse in some areas of the country, \nparticularly in the Senator's area of the country.\n  As I reported earlier, unemployment figures are growing in Kentucky. \nThe situation is just as dire and just as serious.\n  I share the Senator's concern about our deficit situation. But \nvirtually every reputable economist you will talk to will tell you, in \nthe midst of a recession you need to insert into the economy economic \nactivity and spending, and the money that flows through the fastest is \nunemployed benefits to those out of work because they spend it \ninstantly. It goes right back into the economy.\n  This idea of somehow we are going to hold back on unemployment \nbenefits and balance the budget on the backs of unemployed people in \nIllinois and Kentucky, you could not pick a worse strategy or a worse \ntime to do it. The stories coming out of Kentucky and the stories \ncoming out from Illinois are as graphic as can be.\n  Samantha, who lives in Kentucky, writes: I am in desperate need of \nhelp. I have been unemployed since January 31, 2007, cannot find work \nanywhere. I was laid off after 10 years of employment. I was able to \nget 26 weeks of UI benefits. After these ran out, I thought I needed to \ntake whatever job I could find. I took a job that I was told would be \nfull time at minimum wage. I never got more than 20 hours a week. When \nI asked my employer, I was told I would get more hours. I was forced to \nquit due to not being able to afford childcare and transportation. I \nstill cannot find work. I have been forced to sign up for government \nassistance. This is not enough to live on. I have three children.\n  Talk about 40 grandchildren. This lady has three children she is \ntrying to support--``and we have already lost our home. Is there \nanything I can do to try and qualify for unemployment?''\n  I mean, for goodness' sakes, why would we want to make this deficit \nbattle on the back of Samantha from Kentucky. Let's have this battle \nout on the budget resolution. Let's have it out on appropriations \nbills. But on unemployment benefits, for someone in this circumstance? \nThat, to me, is pushing it too far. This is a national emergency. It \nshould be treated as such.\n  I am supportive of the commission we voted for and only had 53 votes. \nBut I believe it is a step in the right direction toward resolving our \ndeficit difficulties. The majority leader has appointed me as a member \nof the Presidential Commission on the Deficit and Debt. It is not an \neasy assignment. I take it seriously. But I will tell you, if the \nbelief is that we can somehow deny enough unemployment benefits to \npeople to balance the budget, I do not want to see what America will \nlook like. I cannot imagine what it will look like with Samantha and \nher three children if that becomes our national strategy.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield for a question? I want to ask a \nquestion. Would the Senator from Illinois agree that we make choices \nhere every day about what, in fact, we are going to do? And there is no \nquestion that the deficit is a huge issue. But I, along with you, have \na reaction this evening listening to my friend from Kentucky, who is my \nfriend. We have worked together on a number of different issues.\n  But to hear that somehow, when there has not been a concern about \nrising deficits when we were talking about tax benefits for the \nwealthiest Americans that did not have to be paid for, but now we are \ntalking about those who find themselves, through no fault of their own, \nwithout a job, who are trying to hold it together in one of the worst \neconomies certainly of my lifetime, and that somehow we are now--now--\ngoing to worry about balancing the budget and the deficit on the backs \nof the least of our brothers--I mean, that is really what is being \ntalked about tonight. I find it outrageous that we would be having this \nkind of discussion.\n\n[[Page S779]]\n\n  Would my friend agree that, in fact, there are other choices? In \nfact, when we have the debate about extending the tax cuts to the \nwealthiest Americans, I want to hear the same debate and the same \nobjection coming as is coming to people right now who are trying to \nhold it together for $200 or $300 a week and keep food on their table \nfor their families.\n  Would my colleague agree?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from Michigan. I will tell you \nthat because the Senator from Kentucky has noted our current national \ndebt, $14 trillion, I think it is worth a moment to explain that debt \nand how we reached that astronomic figure.\n  When President George W. Bush became President of the United States, \nwe had a national debt of $5 trillion, and we handed him a surplus--as \nPresident Clinton left office, he gave to President George W. Bush a \nsurplus. At the end of the George W. Bush Presidency 8 years later, we \nwere knocking on the door of $12 trillion in debt. We had more than \ndoubled the national debt in 8 years.\n  How did that happen? Some of it came from circumstances beyond \nPresident Bush's control. 9/11 devastated the economy, and that \ndevastation cost us dearly in terms of jobs and services and businesses \nand revenue lost.\n  But conscious decisions were made by the George W. Bush \nadministration to enact tax cuts in the midst of a war. That has never \nhappened before in the history of the United States. It is \ncounterintuitive. In addition to your ordinary budget of your country, \nyou have a war budget on top of it. When you desperately need revenue \nto pay for that war and the ordinary expenses of your government, this \nadministration, the previous administration under George W. Bush said: \nLet's give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in the midst of those two \nwars. They were voted on by the other side of the aisle, who supported \nthe idea, driving us deeper in debt as a nation. And, of course, we \nwaged the wars under President Bush without paying for them. That, too, \nadded to our national debt.\n  Another $400 billion was added to the debt with the Medicare \nprescription drug program, which was not paid for. So when this \nPresident came to office, he inherited not only a recession, but $12 \ntrillion in national debt brought on by the previous administration. \nThe recession has taken and added another $1 trillion to that debt in \nthis last year, and we are trying to claw our way out of it.\n  Now, that is the reality and the history of how we reached this point \nof $14 trillion in debt. To suggest it is the Democratic side of the \naisle that does not take the deficit seriously, I would say, we \nproduced a surplus under President Clinton, a surplus that was handed \nto President George W. Bush and quickly mushroomed into the biggest \ndebt in the history of the United States of America.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator from Illinois is very eloquent in his \nadvocacy. But I think he is avoiding the question posed by Senator \nBunning, who simply says he is prepared tonight to fund the programs \nthat you wish, to have them go forward.\n  As I understand it, is it not true he said that if you take this $10 \nbillion, I think it is, that is required to fund this program, and you \nfund it out of the $400 billion unspent from the stimulus--a large part \nof it was supposed to be for this very purpose--that he would let the \nbill go tonight; that what he objects to is not doing that, and which, \nin effect, means--does it mean that the debt will be increased again \ntonight by another $10 billion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In response to the Senator from Alabama, there is one \nelement that he has forgotten to include; that is, the majority leader, \nSenator Reid, offered to the Senator from Kentucky a vote, an up-or-\ndown vote, as to whether these unemployment benefits and COBRA benefits \nwould be paid for out of stimulus funds. He rejected it. He said: I do \nnot want to agree to that because I may lose the vote. And he may.\n  The Senator from Kentucky would not agree to a vote on that question. \nHe said: I may lose it. Well, he may. He may win it. But the fact is, \nhe would not agree to a vote. He said: You have to put in this \nunanimous consent request a provision that says this would be paid for.\n  Now, I would say to the Senator from Alabama, I understand that the \nremaining stimulus funds, most of which are already committed and \nobligated, will be spent this year on projects in Alabama, Illinois, \nand Kentucky to create jobs. So the money we take out of that stimulus \nfund now unspent is money that will not be spent to create jobs across \nAmerica.\n  Now that, to me, would be a misfortune because we want to create \njobs. I will concede to you this money for unemployment will add to the \ndeficit, as previous emergency spending for unemployment has as well. \nWhat we are asking for tonight has been the ordinary care of business, \nwhich the Senator from Kentucky has supported as recently as November.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield only for the purposes of a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We are well aware that the Democrats have a sizable \nmajority in this body, and if the Democratic leadership, including \nyourself, is committed to not paying for this and taking care of this \nappropriation by borrowing additional money from the world on which we \npay interest, then it is likely to be a futile act to have this vote.\n  He is asking you to step to the plate, as I understand it, is he not, \nand say: Join with me and let's pay for it, either through the stimulus \nor some other way, and let's not keep adding debt because that is what \nthe American people are asking. And I ask you, are you not hearing that \nfrom your constituents?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am hearing from my constituents that they want jobs. \nThey are out of work. Many of them are unemployed. And I would say to \nthe Senator from Alabama, we may have 59 votes, but you know as well as \nI do that 60 votes is the coin of the realm in this body.\n  You also know that with very little parliamentary effort, you can \ndrag out this whole question through motions to proceed and cloture and \nfilibusters. It can go on literally for days if not weeks.\n  I ask the Senator from Alabama, why would we do that in a situation \nwhere these people desperately need help for unemployment assistance \nand for health insurance? Why do we want to heap this misery on them?\n  We said to the Senator from Kentucky: You can have a vote. You may \nwin. You may lose. You will have your day on the floor of the Senate. \nHe said: No. Unless you accept my way, go to the highway. Did I hear \nthat earlier? As far as I am concerned, that is not a reasonable \napproach.\n  I have called up amendments on the floor and lost them. But the point \nis, you make your best case, and the Senate decides whether to support \nyour position.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Illinois for allowing me to \nask those questions. I think the Senator from Kentucky is speaking on \nbehalf of the conscience of a lot of Americans, a majority of \nAmericans, if they heard this debate. He is doing it as a matter of \nprinciple. I know he has no desire to see people not receive \nunemployment compensation. He is willing to support that. He simply is \nsaying that enough is enough.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I have a question for the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. BUNNING. The press release you read from was about an \nunemployment insurance extension that was fully paid for. So don't \ncompare apples to oranges.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will verify that. I was given information it was not. \nIf I am incorrect, I will state so. But we have extended unemployment \nbenefits repeatedly and not paid for them.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I understand that. I have voted for that occasionally. \nBut this one you read from was fully paid for.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will check on that. If the Senator is correct, I will \nmake that point in the record.\n  I would like to notify the Senator from Kentucky about Joetta from \nFerguson, who wrote:\n\n       I have been laid off since October 31, 2008. When I was \n     laid off, I lost my health insurance coverage. The COBRA plan \n     offered cost so much, I could not keep the insurance. I\n\n[[Page S780]]\n\n     was told if business picks up in the spring, I could get \n     called back to work. However, since I was laid off from the \n     concrete company, there have been two other office personnel \n     laid off this past January, so I doubt I will be called back \n     to work. I am 58 years old. I have a high school education. I \n     am finding it extremely difficult to find a job, even though \n     I apply for work and am registered with the local \n     unemployment office. I am not one to seek after handouts. \n     However, I have worked all my adult life and have paid taxes \n     as most everyone else has. And I do not expect favors from \n     anyone. I am completely down and out and can hardly pay \n     bills, buy food, et cetera, let alone medical expenses. My \n     husband has insurance through his employment but the cost to \n     add me onto his plan is so high, we simply cannot afford it. \n     Also, he makes $10 per hour, so it isn't as if we have an \n     abundance of money to live on. And I am a very economic \n     person.\n\n  It is hard to imagine why we would say no to unemployment benefits \nfor Joetta from Ferguson under the circumstances. If we want to fight \nthis budget and deficit battle, why would we hurt her in the crossfire \nof the conversation? Why wouldn't we extend these unemployment benefits \nfor her and thousands like her in Illinois and Kentucky and other \nStates?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. First, I would like to know, as we stand here tonight, \nhave we paid for the tax cuts handed out to the wealthiest Americans?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If you are talking about the tax cuts under President \nGeorge W. Bush, no.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I am a new Senator. I have been here just over a year. \nBut I don't recall, in January of 2009 when I arrived, that any Member \nstood up and said: I am going to hold up everything right now until we \npay for the tax cuts for the wealthiest. Did that happen in January? \nDid I miss that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, it did not happen. I don't think it has ever \nhappened. It is an indication that when it comes to giving relief to \nthose who are in a pretty luxurious state, we don't pay for it.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. It sounds as if the Senator shares my memory, because I \ndon't remember it in January 2009. I don't remember it in February \n2009. I don't remember it in March 2009. I don't remember it in April, \nMay, June, July, August, September, October, November, December, or \nJanuary of this year or this month.\n  I am confused. I am confused that the principle has been put forward \ntonight that there is a reason to hold up a program that hasn't been \npaid for. Even if we haven't been here late into the evening having a \ndiscussion about paying for the tax cuts, are there Members of this \nbody who have held up affairs over the last 14 months, saying it is \ntime to take care of paying for the tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No. As a matter of fact, there are some who are trying to \nextend estate tax benefits to even the wealthiest of the wealthy and to \ngive them additional assistance and argue that tax cuts should not be \npaid for.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. So the principle being presented tonight is that if you \nare fortunate to be among the wealthiest Americans, we will give you \nadditional benefits and it doesn't matter if we pay for them. But if \nyou are among the most unfortunate Americans who have lost their jobs--\nand when you lose your job, you might well have lost your health care \nthat went with your job--if you are struggling, then it matters that it \nis paid for immediately.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator. It is a double standard, and it \nis one that benefits those who are wealthy as opposed to those who are \nout of work.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. It is a double standard that bothers me a great deal.\n  We in this Chamber are fortunate enough to receive a paycheck. But \nback home, I have a tremendous number of families, working families in \nOregon who are not going to get a paycheck. I have unemployment in \nCrook County of 16.8 percent. I have unemployment in Douglas County of \n14.9 percent. In Harney County, it is 15.5 percent. In Deschutes \nCounty, it is 14.5 percent; Jefferson County, 14.1 percent; Lake \nCounty, 12.9 percent; Josephine County, 13.6 percent. These are \ncounties where more than one in eight people is out of work.\n  Am I to say to my good citizens back home that if you are among the \nmost fortunate, we will give you additional benefits, unpaid for, but \nif you are down and out, it is just too bad, we are going to hold up \neverything and say we are not going to help you?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly what has happened with this objection, \nthis objection to extend unemployment benefits for 30 days. That is all \nwe are asking for, 30 days.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. So if I understand right, there is the complete \nopportunity to have a debate 30 days from now, but we could have had \nthe debate tonight because there could have been a vote tonight. It was \noffered but turned down. There will be opportunities throughout this \nnext month, but we are going to cut people off at the worst moment here \nbecause one Senator says: I am happy about unfunded gifts to the most \nfortunate, but I am determined not to help people who are down and out.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Oregon, that is exactly \nwhat has happened. When it came to the tax cuts, they weren't paid for. \nThey went primarily to the wealthiest people in America. Now \nunemployment benefits not paid for are objected to.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I am deeply disturbed that one could be so disconnected \nfrom the challenges of working Americans as to have us in the situation \nwe are in at this moment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Oregon, here is a comment \nfrom Sharon, who is also from Kentucky. She writes:\n\n       I have worked since the age of 15. I hold two MA degrees \n     and have worked a full and part-time job for 15 years. I \n     entered the private sector until my position was eliminated \n     approximately 14 months ago. Gas prices almost prevented my \n     seeking employment very far from home. At 55 years of age, I \n     never thought I would be without health care. I never \n     considered that I would have difficulty finding a job. By the \n     way, my spouse was also employed by a company which was \n     downsized and sold twice within 1 year. He is also \n     unemployed. We live in Kentucky which is a more rural part of \n     America. Our state and county typically have a high \n     unemployment rate as well. Extension of unemployment \n     insurance would be a lifeline.\n\n  That lifeline has been cut off by the objection of the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  I yield to the Senator from Vermont for purposes of a question.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator for yielding. We have talked about \nthe fact that unemployment today and economic suffering is probably \ngreater than at any time since the Great Depression of the 1930s. But I \nwonder if the Senator from Illinois is aware that the problem is not \njust high unemployment but long-term unemployment; that, in fact, I \nbelieve we have never seen in modern history a length of time in which \npeople are unemployed as is currently the case. Would the Senator \nconcur that what we are looking at now is a modern tragedy in terms of \nthe length of time people are experiencing unemployment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would agree with the Senator from Vermont. You have to \ngo back 70 or 80 years to the Great Depression to see this long a \nperiod of unemployment.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I want to ask another question. My recollection is that \na number of months ago there was a vote here on the floor of the Senate \nregarding the repeal of the estate tax. My understanding is that vote \nto repeal a significant part of the estate tax would have benefited, as \nI recall, the top three-tenths of 1 percent of the population; 99.7 \npercent of the people would not have benefited. I could be wrong, but \nmy understanding is that if that legislation, that bill, that amendment \nhad passed, it would have cost our government about $1 trillion in a \n10-year period, $1 trillion in benefits to the top three-tenths of 1 \npercent.\n  Can my friend from Illinois remind me as to how many Republicans \nvoted against giving $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top three-tenths \nof 1 percent that was not paid for?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Vermont, I do not recall, \nbut I think he might recall. Does he?\n  Mr. SANDERS. On my suspicion--I won't swear to it--I don't recall \nthat any Republican did not. I may be wrong on this, but my \nrecollection is that all Republicans voted to repeal the estate tax, \nvoted for that legislation. Some Democrats did as well.\n  But I find it remarkable, picking up on the point the Senator from \nOregon made a moment ago, here we were talking about $1 trillion over a \n10-year\n\n[[Page S781]]\n\nperiod to benefit the top three-tenths of 1 percent. I don't recall \nhearing anybody saying: Hey, we have a huge national debt. We can't \nafford another trillion dollars. But somehow, when it comes to \ndesperate people who are hanging on by their fingernails, trying to \nkeep their families afloat in the most serious economic moment since \nthe Great Depression of the 1930s, somehow, right now that has to be \npaid for. We have to pay for $10 billion, but somehow you don't have to \npay for $1 trillion over a 10-year period. I don't quite understand \nthat. Maybe my friend from Illinois can elucidate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say in response, I do not understand it. It is \nhard for me to follow the logic that we need to reward those who are \nthe most comfortable in America and punish those who are suffering. \nThat is what this objection does. By denying unemployment benefits and \nCOBRA benefits to those out of work, it literally makes their lives \nmore difficult. Yet many of the same people have argued that these tax \nbreaks for the wealthy should be considered as part of our future, even \nif they are not paid for. I don't follow the logic behind that position \nin any way whatsoever.\n  Mr. SANDERS. For the record, the sum was $350 billion over 10 years, \nnot $1 trillion. The trillion would have been the complete repeal of \nthe estate tax. But nonetheless, $350 billion benefiting the top three-\ntenths of 1 percent is a sizable chunk of cash. I am somewhat amazed \nthat nobody at that point was terribly worried about how that was going \nto be paid for.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania for a question.\n  Mr. CASEY. I don't know if the Senator has seen this, but this is the \nNational Employment Law Project, February 2010. One of the columns \nhighlights the total number of individuals exhausting their \nunemployment benefits in the month of March. I don't know if the \nSenator from Illinois quoted this number earlier. I don't think he did. \nBut the total for the month of March in Illinois would be 65,431 \npeople. In my State of Pennsylvania, the total would be not quite that \nhigh but 62,599 people.\n  That leads me to my second question. I had the opportunity a couple \nweeks ago to sit with 8 of the 560,000 people in my State who are out \nof work. In Pennsylvania, that 560,000 adds up to 8.9 percent of the \nworkforce, but it is an incredibly high number--maybe not a record but \nvery close. Those eight individuals were like every one of the people \nin this country who has lost their job, not through anything they did. \nThrough no fault of their own, they are out of work.\n  I would ask the Senator from Illinois about what he has seen and \nheard from individuals he has sat down with in Illinois who have lost \ntheir jobs and are going to job centers and places such as that to fill \nout unemployment forms, fill out job applications. I would ask you \nabout that.\n  (Mr. MERKLEY assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, in response to \nthe question, through the Chair, that I have been to these unemployment \ncenters in Chicago and downstate, and I am always heartened by the fact \nthat these people are just not going to give up. They really keep \ntrying. But you can tell that many of them are beaten down. Some of \nthem tell me about how many times they now apply on the Internet for \nany job openings and they do not even get a response. They consider it \na victory just to get an interview or a response, and they just keep \ntrying every single day. Meanwhile, they are trying to keep their \nfamilies together, and the only lifeline they have is unemployment \ninsurance checks. It is not a lot of money: $1,100 a month. Imagine \ntrying to live on it. It is a very meager amount of money, particularly \nfor someone who is used to a larger paycheck and more comfort in life. \nWhy would we cut off the $1,100 a month to these people at this moment \nin time when the economy is so weak? I do not understand why we would \nobject to providing unemployment benefits to these people, whether they \nare in Pennsylvania or Kentucky or Illinois. In my way of thinking, \nmany of these folks are in this situation through no fault of their \nown, and they are trying their best to turn their lives around and it \nis not an easy circumstance for any of them.\n  Mr. CASEY. The ones I have met in that--they call it a career link, a \njob center--of those eight individuals, all but one--but maybe even the \none--of those eight people were in their fifties, sixties, or \nseventies. In most instances--probably five out of the eight, maybe six \nout of the eight--they had never lost their job before; they had never \nhad to depend upon unemployment insurance, food stamps, any kind of \nhelp. In fact, one woman said she felt ashamed that she had to apply \nfor food stamps. She had never had to be that reliant on anything. \nAnother woman by the name of Debbie said to me: We just want to get \nback to work. We don't want to be in this condition. We want to get \nback to work. So there was no complaining.\n  But I want to ask the Senator, as well, you referred earlier to \nanother part of this discussion, which is that we focus on those who \nneed this unemployment insurance--and we are talking here just about a \n30-day extension; we are not talking about providing this for years or \na long period of time--but the Senator talked about the economic impact \nof the spending of these dollars. I do not know if the Senator is \nfamiliar with what Mark Zandi, the economist, talked about. I do not \nknow if the Senator is familiar with that. Let me just ask the Senator \nthat.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, I am aware of \nthat economist, and I am aware the CBO recently reported that the one \nthing we can do to generate more economic activity in our economy that \nis better than anything else is unemployment assistance. It is No. 1 on \ntheir list. They talked about tax credits for new jobs in small \nbusinesses, but No. 1 was unemployment assistance. So as we cut back on \nunemployment assistance, the economy starts to go into a stall. We are \nnot putting the money back into the economy; we are pulling it out at a \ntime when the Federal Reserve is trying to keep interest rates low to \ngenerate more economic activity and move us forward to better \nemployment. We are pushing against it. We are taking unemployment \nassistance out because of the objection of the Senator from Kentucky--\none Senator who has objected. So from the economist viewpoint, we are \ndoing exactly the opposite of what we should be doing to get this \neconomy moving again.\n  Mr. CASEY. Let me add that the reference to the Congressional Budget \nOffice--that has been the referee or the arbiter of what is used as a \nnumber for health care, what protections are for spending--I heard the \nsummary of that same report on the House side at a Joint Economic \nCommittee meeting.\n  But the reference I made earlier is a very similar analysis made by \nMark Zandi. Mark Zandi is an economist from moodys.com. He happened to \nbe an adviser to John McCain's Presidential campaign, so he is not some \npartisan in this debate. But he said, going back a year ago, when we \nwere debating the recovery bill--whether to enact it or not--he said \nthat if you spend $1 on unemployment insurance, you get I think it is \nmore than $1.60 back, somewhere in the $1.60 to $1.70 range. So this is \nnot only a question of how we help people who have lost their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own; the secondary benefit here is it can \nhelp people who are out of work and need a stimulated economy, need an \neconomy that is jump-started by the spending we would provide through \nunemployment insurance. So it makes no sense.\n  As the Senator from Illinois said earlier, there are lots of ways to \nmake the argument that our friend from Kentucky is making, but this is \nnot the time or the place, when all we are talking about is a 30-day \nextension of unemployment insurance for people who, through no fault of \ntheir own, have lost their jobs. It makes no sense. And as I look at \nthese numbers in Pennsylvania of 62,599 people losing or will lose, if \nhe prevails, their unemployment insurance in the month of March, it \nmakes no sense.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alaska for a question.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I have a couple questions in regard to the bill. I will probably have \nmore later, but, first, remind me and the\n\n[[Page S782]]\n\npeople who are watching what the unemployment rate for our country is \ntoday.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Currently, on a national basis?\n  Mr. BEGICH. On a national basis.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I believe it is now just slightly below 10 percent on a \nnational basis. In my State, it is still over 11 percent.\n  Mr. BEGICH. In your State, it is 11 percent?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. BEGICH. In my State, it is 9 percent.\n  I will lay out a couple points. In my State, the 9 percent, which is \none of the highest in years for us, one of the highest numbers ever in \na long time, but when you look at it by region--and I am curious if in \nyour State it has similar impacts like this--for example, 9 percent is \na lot, no question about it, but in the Aleutians East Borough in \nAlaska it is 20.2 percent; in Bethel it is 14.8 percent; in Aleutians \nWest Borough it is 13.7 percent; in the Northwest Arctic Borough it is \n12.89 percent; in Kenai Borough it is 12.3 percent; in Mat-Su it is \n10.4 percent. Those are examples. The number is high for our State. It \nis one of the highest in many years. But it really does not tell the \nwhole story.\n  I ask the Senator, do you have similar circumstances that are \nregionally higher than the average for your State?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Alaska that Rockford in the \nnorthern end of my State was as high as 15 percent. You know, it does \nnot tell the whole story because, as they say, some people get \ndiscouraged when they are out of work and they do not get counted on \nthese rolls anymore. So the actual unemployment rate is much higher. \nThese people will not be affected by our action tonight because they \nare not in the program, they are not receiving unemployment assistance. \nBut the actual misery index of people unemployed over a long period of \ntime is even higher.\n  Mr. BEGICH. They have given up. They have lost faith.\n  Mr. DURBIN. They have lost faith and they have stopped trying.\n  I would say to the Senator from Alaska, when I look at the State of \nKentucky, here is Allen County with 13.9 percent unemployment; Bath \nCounty, 15.7 percent unemployment; Carroll County, 13.8 percent; Clay \nCounty, 13.3 percent unemployment; Cumberland County, 13.4 percent; \nEdmonson County, 14.3 percent; Elliott County, 13.0 percent; Estill \nCounty, 12.7 percent; Fleming County, 12.4 percent; Floyd County, 12.3 \npercent; Fulton County, 14 percent; Gallatin County, 13 percent; \nGarrard County, 12 percent; Grant County, 11.2 percent; Graves County, \n10.6 percent; Grayson County, 16 percent--one of the highest; Green \nCounty, 12 percent; Hardin County, 10.1 percent; Harlan County, 12.5 \npercent; Jackson County--this is even higher--17.8 percent.\n\n  On this page, as I look through here, the highest in Kentucky appears \nto be--I may mispronounce this--Magoffin County, 21.4 percent \nunemployment in that one county; Marion County, 11.8 percent. The list \ngoes on and on. McCreary County, 14.1 percent; Meade County, 14.3 \npercent; Menifee County, 17.5 percent; Metcalfe County, 14.4 percent; \nMorgan County, 15.1 percent; Powell County, 16.9 percent; Trigg County, \n16.5 percent; Wolfe County, 15.6 percent.\n  The Senator from Alaska is right. The average does not tell the \nstory. There will be pockets in Kentucky and Illinois and Alaska with \nmuch higher unemployment. So when we cut off the benefits because of \nthe objection from the Senator from Kentucky, as of Sunday night some \nof these counties will be hit harder than others. There is no question \nabout that.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I will ask if I can read something toward a question. As \nyou drill down--that is what we are doing here a little bit, and your \nanswer to my question is what I wanted to ask to make sure I was clear \non that. It is not just the average that we should always be thinking \nabout, but how do we drill down?\n  When I got back from my break, I received this e-mail. I am sure you \nhave similar e-mails. That is going to be my question. What kind of \nresponses have you gotten from those who are unemployed?\n  Here is one from my State:\n\n       . . . I implore you as your first order of business upon \n     your return from the snow--\n\n  Which I thought was very interesting--\n\n     and recess to extend the emergency unemployment benefits \n     through the end of 2010 that are due to expire on the 28th of \n     Feb. Thank you.\n\n  He was thanking me in advance for something this gentleman believes \nwe will do because it is right. This gentleman is 46 years old, a \nprofessional in the legal field. He had applied for over 30 different \njobs. He has had two interviews. He is still unable to get a job. He is \nJeff from Eagle River. I will not use his last name. He did not \nauthorize me to do that. But just reading this letter tells me, why are \nwe not doing this?\n  I am a new Member. Like the Senator from Oregon, I have been here a \nlittle over a year. I have the same question he had on, literally, the \n$1 trillion that was unfunded, given to the richest of the rich. It has \nnever been revoked or changed, but it was funded by whom? Not by this \nbody but on the backs of people like my son who is 7\\1/2\\ years old, \nwho will pay for the richest of the rich. I do not call it a tax cut; I \ncall it a tax scheme. To me, that is outrageous when I think about it.\n  So I associate my comments with those of the Senator from Oregon. As \na new Member, this is not necessarily new to me, but being here in the \nChamber and watching this process over the last year and a half, this, \nto me, seems so simple. These are the people who are hurting the most. \nYet when it comes time to do a small item of a $10 billion extension to \nallow them to make sure, come Monday, they know they can provide for \ntheir family, as this gentleman here who is 46 years old--it is just \nshocking to me and unbelievable.\n  I am assuming the Senator from Illinois receives these same kinds of \nletters every day from people who are stressed and concerned. And they \nare not out there looking for a handout; they are looking at someone in \nour position to assist them in this unbelievable recession we are \nfacing. Is that similar to what the Senator receives?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is exactly what I have run into. Here is a letter from \na man from Yorkville, IL, who wrote me:\n\n       On bailout after bailout for businesses, my tax dollars \n     have been used to save companies that should have planned \n     better in the first place. Now I am unemployed--not because I \n     made some poor decisions like AIG or Citigroup, but because \n     in today's economy, the company I worked for folded. . . .\n       If the Senate cannot reach an agreement . . . to extend \n     unemployment, myself, my wife, and our two young children \n     will have nowhere to live other than our car. How about a \n     bailout for those of us Americans that have worked all our \n     lives and now cannot get a decent job?\n       I am begging you to stand up in front of the Senate . . . \n     and demand that congress work harder for those of us who put \n     all of you in office. The next time you need our votes, \n     hopefully the 10% of unemployed Americans will not have had \n     their cars repossessed so that we may make it to our local \n     polling places.\n\n  Well, he kept a sense of humor in his misfortune. But this is an \nexample of a man who thought he had a good job and a good future who \nnow is contemplating living in his car. And now we are saying, because \nof the objection of one Senator, that we are not going to provide \nunemployment benefits to thousands of people in similar situations as \nof Sunday night. Why we are doing this to these poor people at this \nmoment in time is impossible to explain.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I thank the Senator. I have other questions, but I know \nthere are others who are standing to ask questions. But I have a \nquestion on the small business fund and the Medicare component, which \nare vitally important to keep our economy moving. I will withhold and \nask those questions in a few minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island for a question.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Senator. I very much appreciate the \nSenator from Illinois yielding for a question. If the Senator would not \nmind a series of questions, the first question has to do with, I guess \nI would say the sense with which we on this side of the aisle should \nreceive the protestations of intense concern about the deficit that \ncome from the other side of the aisle, and it relates back to when the \nprevious Republican administration first took office.\n  As the Senator from Illinois mentioned, the last Democratic \nadministration left an annual budget in surplus and a nation that had a \n$5 trillion\n\n[[Page S783]]\n\ndebt. But my recollection is that in addition to a nation in annual \nbudget surplus, what President Clinton also left the Republican \nadministration that followed was a budget trajectory projected by the \nnonpartisan professional Congressional Budget Office to eliminate the \nnational debt of the United States of America. We would be a debt-free \nnation if the Democratic policies of President Clinton had been \nfollowed according to the nonpartisan, professional Congressional \nBudget Office. If I additionally recall, there were actually economic \ndebates that were provoked by that, wondering whether it was actually a \ngood idea for the Nation to be, for the first time since President \nAndrew Jackson, debt free.\n\n  So my question is, Is it not true that more than just an annual \nbudget surplus was left to the Republicans by the Democrats last time, \nbut what was left to them also was a budget trajectory that would have \nmade this Nation debt free during President Bush's term had he extended \nthose Democratic policies?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Rhode Island is correct. The Senator \nfrom Kentucky has talked about the Nation's deficit and debt, and he \nshould realize that when President Clinton left office in January of \n2001, the national budget was in better shape than it had been in a \ngeneration.\n  In fiscal year 2000, the final year in which President Clinton had \nfull responsibility for the national budget, our Nation's budget \nsurplus was $236 billion--budget surplus. That year, the debt held by \nthe public declined for the third consecutive year. As President \nClinton left office, budget surpluses were projected to continue \nthroughout the next 10 years. CBO, in its January 2001 budget outlook, \nprojected surpluses of $5 trillion for 2001 through 2010, including \nnearly $800 billion in 2010 alone. Those surpluses were so large, as \nthe Senator from Rhode Island indicated, that the Congressional Budget \nOffice told us the debt held by the public would be entirely paid off \nby 2006.\n  Fast forward 8 years, at the end of George W. Bush's Presidency, that \nadministration, and the national debt had climbed from $5 trillion that \nhe inherited to more than double that amount.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The question I was asking is, Is it not fair to \nascribe to that Republican administration and its policies the \nresponsibility for more than just the difference between $5 trillion \nand $12 trillion? Because if those policies hadn't changed, according \nto the nonpartisan, neutral, professional Congressional Budget Office, \nduring the term of President Bush, we would have actually been a debt-\nfree nation and, therefore, responsibility for the entire Federal debt \nthat was inherited by President Obama could fairly be said to be the \nresponsibility of the policies from the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Rhode Island is correct.\n  I don't know how the Senator from Kentucky voted when it came to the \ntax cuts for the wealthy. I don't know, so I can't presume to state it \non the floor. I don't know if he voted for the annual budgets to \nprolong the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without paying for them. I \ndon't know how he voted on the Medicare prescription drug benefit that \nwas not paid for, at least the $400 billion cost. I will acknowledge he \nwas correct that the unemployment I referred to in November was paid \nfor. I want that clear on the Record and I stand corrected and \nacknowledge it to the Senator from Kentucky. But I would say that his--\n--\n  Mr. BUNNING. Will the Senator from Illinois yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield after one more question from the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. But I would say, when it came to his party position, \ntonight we hear this idea of fiscal conservatism, strict spending, \npunish those who are unemployed, take money away from those who have \nbeen out of work in order to bring down this budget deficit. But for 8 \nyears, under President George W. Bush, we certainly didn't hear this \nsentiment expressed when it came to people who were so well off across \nour country.\n  I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island for a question.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. In evaluating this concern about the deficit, we have \njust determined that the policies of the other side of the aisle \ncontributed to virtually all the national debt we have inherited. Then \nlet's look to the situation now because I think we understand we have \nto fix this deficit problem.\n  The distinguished Senator from Illinois earlier mentioned a vehicle \nfor trying to do this, which was the establishment of a statutory \ndeficit commission. My recollection is, the votes were inadequate for \nthat, in significant part because on the Republican side of the aisle, \nseven of our colleagues whose names were on that plan as cosponsors of \nit voted against the bill that they had cosponsored for a mechanism \nthat would potentially, at least, have provided a vehicle for resolving \nsome of our deficit concerns.\n  My question is, Is that also the recollection of the Senator from \nIllinois? And how, in the light of this debate about the budget deficit \nand the fact that the budget deficit is so important, it is worth \nforcing honest, hard-working--when they can find work--Americans into \ntheir cars to sleep, as the Senator from Illinois has said, out of \ntheir homes, into penury. Why is it not important enough for our \nfriends on the other side to support legislation of which they were \ncosponsors, and what was the motivation for that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say in response to the Senator, for those who \nhave not been following the debate from the beginning, tonight we are \nspeaking to the fact that the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, is \nobjecting to extending unemployment benefits for 30 days in the United \nStates to those who are out of work and extending COBRA benefits which \nhelp to pay for health insurance for 30 days, in addition to several \nother items, and has stated his reason is because of his concern about \nthe budget deficit.\n  I don't know how the Senator from Kentucky voted on this commission, \nbut I do remember it well because Senator Kent Conrad, the chairman of \nthe Senate Budget Committee, came to me and said he had worked out an \nagreement with Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican, that they would try to \ncreate a commission which would take a look at our national deficit and \nmake recommendations to Congress which we would then have to vote on. \nIt was controversial, that is for sure.\n  When it was called for a vote, it ended up with, I believe, 53 votes \nand fell short of passage because 7 Republican Senators who had \ncosponsored the measure initially voted against it, cosponsors who \nvoted against it, and it included the Republican minority leader. Their \ndetermination to deal with the deficit and the debt withered away and \ndisappeared when they had a chance to vote for it on the floor. I don't \nknow how the Senator from Kentucky voted.\n  So here is a chance for the Republicans to join the Democrats to deal \nwith the deficit and debt, and they walked away. Seven of them turned \ntheir back on a bill they had cosponsored and walked away from it.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, with the indulgence of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, if I may ask my final question. If we have established \nthat it was the Bush administration and Republican policies that \ncreated virtually all the national debt we now carry, and if we have \nestablished that when the mechanism that many believe would be the best \nvehicle to address the deficit was abandoned by our friends on the \nother side in significant measure, even those who had cosponsored it, \nthus preventing it from passing, what am I supposed to tell Carol \nThomasian from North Providence? She is unemployed. She is a Rhode \nIslander. She has worked hard all her life. She went to work first as a \nteenager. She eventually got married. She started a family. She got a \ncollege degree to increase her earning potential. She bought a home. \nHer family lived in the home. She did everything right, pursuing the \nAmerican dream.\n  Two years ago, when the Rhode Island economy collapsed--and it \ncollapsed in Rhode Island sooner than in other States; we have been in \na recession for a long time now--she was laid off from her job as a \nconstruction project manager, and she hasn't been able to find work \nsince. She is struggling to keep her family together. She is a single \nmom now. She is raising a 12-year-old son and a 15-year-old daughter. \nShe has all those responsibilities of teenager parenting. She is also\n\n[[Page S784]]\n\ntrying to care for her disabled mother. She has a bachelor's degree in \nbusiness administration. She has an associate's degree in architecture. \nShe is a capable, trained, hard-working woman. Because she is out of \nwork, her car has been repossessed, making it so much more difficult to \ntry to find work, and it is unemployment insurance that is keeping her \nfamily together. This will cut 309 Rhode Islanders in our small State \nright off, in another few months it will cut up to 1,500 people right \noff.\n  How am I supposed to explain to them this principle that they need to \nsuffer because of our budget deficit, with a party that is forcing that \nsuffering on them and that did more to run up our national deficit than \never and that has obstructed the vehicle that would have started the \nwork to fix the deficit and is absolutely silent about the deficit when \nmillionaires and multimillionaires and billionaires are given tax \nbreaks? How can I explain that? What do I tell her?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Rhode Island, there is no \nexplanation because it doesn't make sense. You certainly couldn't \nexplain to this woman who has worked so hard throughout her entire life \nand now faces this misfortune that we are heaping additional misfortune \non her because of this objection to extending unemployment benefits. In \nthe State of Rhode Island--I know it is small in comparison to so many \nothers--the Senator from Rhode Island is likely to meet some of these \n309 people or hear from them when their unemployment benefits are cut \noff. I am sure my office will hear too. I will not know how to explain \nto them that the Senator from Kentucky has objected to a 30-day \nextension of unemployment benefits. If we are going to fight this war \non the deficit and debt, why fight it on the backs of unemployed people \nsuch as the one we have just heard described in the State of Rhode \nIsland?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Would the Senator from Illinois give me a chance to \nrespond? You have had the floor for an hour and a half.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield for a question from the \nSenator.\n  Mr. BUNNING. A question. OK. If all the things that have been said on \nthe other side are true, all of the programs you have talked about \ncould have been extended and for much longer periods if Senator Reid, \nyour leader, had not blown up the bipartisan jobs bill agreed to by the \nchairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member, Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley, and jammed through his own bill which we \ntalked about; and all the spending forces of that compromise, of those \nprograms that you are talking about, were paid for in that bill. \nExplain that to the American people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to. The Senator from Kentucky has not \nstated it 100 percent accurately.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Oh, he has.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Because in the original proposal from the Finance \nCommittee, the unemployment benefits were extended for 3 months, as I \nunderstand it. The tax extenders----\n  Mr. BUNNING. They were paid for.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me explain. There was a source of revenue for the \nbill, but it wasn't enough to pay for the entire bill. The source of \nrevenue was enough for those who wanted to say: Well, this will pay for \nunemployment, to point to it; and those who wanted to say: No, it pays \nfor another part of the bill. So it did not pay for the entire bill.\n  Mr. BUNNING. That is your interpretation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yielded for a question and I answered the question, but \nI will yield for another question.\n  Mr. BUNNING. It has been brought up during this debate that the \nbalanced budget amendment and the balanced budget is a product of the \nClinton administration. The Senator from Illinois knows that to be \nfalse.\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, I don't know that to be false.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Well, do you know anything about how the balanced budget \nbill was brought to the floor of the House of Representatives?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Kentucky I was serving in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I was serving.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will tell my colleague what has been said on the floor \nand which I stand behind; that is, the fact that when President William \nClinton left office, he left a budget in balance and in surplus.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield for a further question.\n  Mr. BUNNING. That is only because Representative John Kasich and the \nBudget Committee that he chaired in the House, for 3 years in a row, \nbrought a balanced budget bill to the floor of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. I was a member of that Budget Committee.\n  The first 2 years, the Clinton administration rejected the balanced \nbudget bill. In the third year, instead of getting run over by the \ntrain, President William Jefferson Clinton got on the train and agreed \nthat the balanced budget bill should be passed. Then the Senate \nconcurred and we balanced the budget. It took a little bit, but we did \nit. That is where the surplus came from--a Republican's idea, John \nKasich, of Ohio, who brought a balanced budget to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If that is a question--\n  Mr. BUNNING. The questions I have are--I wanted to straighten out my \ngood friend from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If that was a question, it is clear that there was \nbipartisanship, and we can use a little bit more of that around here.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Even the fact that our President--somebody who talked \nabout extending tax cuts to the wealthy and talked about extending tax \ncuts, and the fact that nobody on the floor of this Senate--explain to \nme, with 60 Democrats and 40 Republicans, why someone on the Democratic \nside of the aisle didn't make a bill that would rescind those tax cuts? \nYour President--our President--wants to extend 85 percent of those same \ntax cuts without paying for them. He has a bill in his budget to do \njust that. Explain that. I have one more. Your President also wants to \npass a $250 billion estate tax bill, also without paying for it. That \nis right. Well, it is right. Look it up. I am on the Budget Committee, \nso I see these bills. Is the Senator on the Budget Committee?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, I am not. I yield further for a question.\n  Mr. BUNNING. The Senator in the chair is, so he knows what has been \nproposed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. BUNNING. The question I asked about the 60/40, I didn't hear \nanybody answer that. The Senator from Oregon is gone. He was the guy \nwho posed the question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In response to the Senator from Kentucky, this is a great \ndebate. I think we ought to continue it. But can we remove from the \naudience the millions of Americans who will not have unemployment \nchecks as of Sunday night because of the Senator's interest in this \nissue? When you think about this, we ought to be engaged in this, and \nyou and I ought to stay up late to talk it over and talk about what we \nshould do. But why are we leaving these unemployed people in Kentucky \nand in Illinois in the middle of this debate? These people have nothing \nto do with what happened with John Kasich, of Columbus, OH, or what \nhappened with President William Jefferson Clinton. They are trying to \nprovide food for their families in the morning. Instead, we have \ndragged them into the middle of this deficit and debt debate.\n  For those who have just tuned into this conversation, the Senator \nfrom Kentucky has objected to extending unemployment benefits for 30 \ndays, and COBRA benefits, which pay for health insurance for the \nunemployed for 30 days.\n  Because of his objection--he is the only Senator to object--I will \nfind 15,000 people in my State of Illinois, as of Sunday night, losing \ntheir unemployment benefits. If you wonder why I am still on the floor \nat 10:20 p.m. in Washington, on Thursday night, after a pretty long \nday, it is because I thought to myself: How in the world can I walk \naway from this Chamber, go home and relax, realizing that 15,000 \npeople, come Sunday night, in Illinois are going to get cut off from \nunemployment benefits?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, we have been talking about whether tax \ncuts were paid for. Let's talk about\n\n[[Page S785]]\n\nother things that weren't paid for. That is what this is about. As the \nSenator knows--in fact, I know the Senator from Illinois gets irritated \nat me sometimes because I am constantly trying to figure out ways that \nwe can be more fiscally responsible around here. Sometimes I swim \nupstream on some of those things. I was one of the cosponsors of pay-\ngo. In fact, pay-go was in place in the 1990s, and it was allowed to \nexpire in Congress. It was 2000, or 2001, or 2002, in the early years \nof the Bush administration, when the Republicans had the majority. They \nlet it go. They said they didn't need pay-go anymore. This is probably \nthe most glaring example, and it gets in my craw, because I now hear so \nmuch about fiscal responsibility, and as we struggle with this health \ncare bill, making sure that we pay for it, I look back at Medicare Part \nD. Now that is a lallapalooza right there, Medicare D.\n  I am wondering if the Senator from Illinois remembers what the vote \nwas on the motion to waive the Budget Act on Medicare D.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Well, it is interesting. It was a big majority to \nwaive the Budget Act. I have the vote here. There were 61 votes to \nwaive the Budget Act, including our friend from Kentucky. I think the \nCBO score on that was around $450 billion, as I recall.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Not a dime of it paid for--not one dime. It is all on \nthe credit card, one big blob of red ink.\n  Is the Senator aware how many of our friends on the other side of the \naisle have new religion--this is new religion about balancing the \nbudget--and how many actually voted for Medicare D? It was a brandnew \nentitlement program, a massive government entitlement program, a \ngovernment-run health care-related government program, and not one dime \nwas paid for? Do you know how many on the other side, who are still \nserving today, voted for this new entitlement program?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, I do not.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. It was 24. Do you know who the Senators were who \nvoted for this massive, government-run entitlement program that added \nhundreds and billions of dollars to our debt--not tax cuts? We can \nargue about whether tax cuts create jobs. Clearly, those didn't because \nwe inherited a big mess in terms of job creation. But do you know who \nthe Senators serving on that side are who now want to preach about \nfiscal responsibility and pay for programs--how many were willing to \nput that kind of program on the credit card? They were Senators \nAlexander, Bennett, Bond, Brownback, Bunning, Chambliss, Cochran, \nCollins, Cornyn, Crapo, Enzi, Grassley, Hatch, Hutchison, Inhofe, Kyl, \nLugar, McConnell, Murkowski, Roberts, Sessions, Shelby, Snowe, and \nVoinovich.\n  All of it was a massive government entitlement program run out of \nWashington--big government, big bill, not paid for, and there was not \none word about it needing to be paid for. And we fast forward to now. \nThat is a big part of our deficit. We now figured out on Medicare D \nthat we transferred a bunch of taxpayer money straight to the bottom \nline profits of the pharmaceutical companies. I wasn't here then, but \nmaybe the Senator can enlighten me. My recollection is that the biggest \npeople in favor of Medicare D were pharma.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is correct. It was their belief that they \nwould make a lot of money.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. They have made a fortune on the backs of taxpayers.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Those of us who supported some kind of competitive \nbidding and government buying in bulk to reduce costs were defeated \nbecause pharma objected.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. In that bill, they even outlawed the ability of the \ngovernment to negotiate for lower prices based on volume. Those are \n``good business practices''--make sure we cannot get a good deal based \non how many drugs we are going to buy. We cannot even lower the cost of \nthis massive government entitlement program by negotiating for lower \nprices based on volume. They outlawed that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This cost over $400 billion, and many Republican \nSenators, including the Senator who has objected to unemployment \nbenefits for millions of people in America who are out of work, voted \nfor this program that was unpaid for. Now they tell us we cannot extend \nunemployment benefits to people in Kentucky and Illinois and Missouri \nbecause we have not paid for them. Clearly, it is a double standard.\n  I might add that when it came to the estate tax, aka the ``death \ntax,'' according to some, on June 7, 2006, the Senator from Kentucky \ntook the floor and said:\n\n       Mr. President, I rise today in strong favor of abolishing \n     one of the most unjustified taxes we have in America today, \n     the death tax. Americans should not have to talk to their \n     undertaker and their tax man on the same day. Small \n     businesses and family farms should not be forced to close \n     down in order to pay the government money because a loved one \n     has passed away.\n\n  Then when the Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act was called for a vote, \nthe Senator from Kentucky voted to repeal this tax, costing the \ngovernment $300 billion; that is over $300 billion added to our \nnational debt. This tax affects less than one-half of 1 percent of all \nthe people in America, the wealthiest people in our country. To provide \n$300 billion in tax relief to them--the Senator from Kentucky said we \ncan add that to the deficit and that is OK. But when it comes to \nproviding a $1,100 monthly unemployment check to someone in Illinois \nwho is struggling to find a job, he says no, that adds to the deficit. \nSo for the wealthiest in America on the estate tax, there is no \naccountability, no reckoning, but for the poorest in America, the most \nstruggling families in America, we are going to hold them to the \nhardest economic standard. To me, that is at least inconsistent, if not \ninexplicable.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have yielded to the Senator from Missouri for a \nquestion.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I have a couple more questions. I wasn't here when \nthe major tax cuts went through in the Republican Congress with \nPresident Bush--the tax cuts that were supposed to bring about great \nprosperity and job creation in our country. Of course, they didn't. We \nhave had record job losses. As President Bush left office, my \nrecollection is that we were having between 600,000 and 700,000 job \nlosses every month. Clearly, the plan that these tax cuts would be a \ntime of wine and roses for all didn't work out. My recollection is that \nthat tax cut was done by reconciliation, wasn't it?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would have to check my notes.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I think it was. Reconciliation only lasts for so long \nand then they sunset. I think that was one of those things where a \nmassive amount of government liability was incurred through \nreconciliation at that time.\n  Let me also ask a couple questions about the stimulus. I know the \nSenator from Kentucky was offered a chance to have an amendment paid \nfor by the stimulus. I don't think that we have talked enough about \nwhat is left of the stimulus money and what it is for. It is my \nunderstanding--and correct me if I am wrong--that a big chunk of the \nstimulus that is left is in fact the tax cuts for working families. In \nfact, the tax cuts were a 2-year period. So, of course, that was about \none-third of the money, and only half of that has been paid out because \nwe have only been through a year of the stimulus. We still have money \nwaiting to go out in the form of tax cuts to 95 percent of America--in \nfact, the exact opposite folks who got the tax cuts under George Bush.\n\n  Is that my understanding about what is remaining in the Treasury as \nit relates to stimulus?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I believe the Senator from Missouri is correct. It is \ninteresting that those who are critical of the stimulus, the Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act, on the Republican side virtually never \nacknowledge the fact that one-third of that whole package is tax cuts, \nwhich is the Holy Grail on the Republican side of the aisle--tax cuts \nfor working families.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Tax cuts for working folks.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Working families.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. These are working folks. They are not--frankly, my \nfamily is very blessed. The tax cuts that were passed helped my family. \nIt didn't help some of the families out there now struggling with \nunemployment.\n  The rest of the stimulus that is out there--I have been interested in \nMissouri. In fact, I wrote a letter to the\n\n[[Page S786]]\n\nbudget chairs in Missouri because they were kind of puffing up about \nhow they were going to be able to balance the budget this year. I \nlooked into it and realized that the only way they were balancing the \nbudget this year was because of the stimulus money. It is, in fact, the \nstimulus money that has gone to Kentucky, gone to Illinois, gone to \nMissouri, gone to Oregon, gone to Alaska, and gone to Rhode Island. \nThat is what is allowing these State legislatures to keep from making \nmassive layoffs of public school teachers. There would be massive cuts \nin education in Missouri this year, and, frankly, no cuts in public \neducation would be popular in Missouri.\n  I asked the Missouri legislators. I said: Some of you have been \ntalking about doing away with the stimulus, pulling back the stimulus. \nIn fact, some of our friends across the aisle said we should get rid of \nthe rest of the stimulus. I asked the State legislators: What will you \ncut if we pull the stimulus? Tell me how Missourians will be hurt if we \ndecide to pull the rest of the stimulus and maybe spend it on other \nthings, such as perhaps this emergency bill dealing with unemployment \ninsurance. They would not tell me. They want the people of Missouri to \nthink they are balancing that budget with fairy dust. They don't want \nthe people of Missouri to know that, in fact, the stimulus is what is \nout there helping these States balance these budgets because their \nrevenue has dropped off the charts, just like our revenue has, which is \ncausing some of the deficit and which is certainly contributing in a \ngreat way to the debt as it relates to a drop in revenue, an increase \nin unemployment expenses, and then the programs that have been passed \nin the previous administration not paid for.\n  I have 20,000 Missourians--20,000--who are going to find out sometime \nin the next 48 hours that they are done with unemployment. I cannot \nhelp but believe that if we have this kind of crisis at the other end \nof the income scale, that all of a sudden we would not have this \nnewfound religion that this is the moment, this is the hour, this is \nthe day that we are going to find new religion about deficits. It is \nthe wrong time.\n  I am a cosponsor of pay-go. I am a cosponsor of the fiscal \ncommission. I don't take earmarks. I voted against the omnibus. I voted \nagainst many budget bills because I think there was too much fat in \nthem. I voted against a lot of fiscal measures in this body. But this \nis not the time to do this on the backs of these families. It is the \nwrong time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri and for \nthose who are following this debate.\n  Mr. BUNNING. You said you would yield to me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I know. For those who are following this debate, we have \nasked to extend unemployment benefits for those out of work in America \nfor 30 days and to extend COBRA benefits which helps them to pay for \ntheir health insurance for 30 days. It passed the House of \nRepresentatives. We were prepared to pass it this week so that when the \nbenefits expire for many people on Sunday night, they would continue.\n  One Senator from Kentucky, Senator Bunning, who is on the Senate \nfloor, objected. As a consequence, we have taken to the floor to make \ncertain that the people who are following this debate understand the \ngravity of this decision. It is not a casual decision. It is a decision \nmade by one Senator that will literally affect the lives of a lot of \npeople.\n  I give an example of Stan Lipowski who lives in Rockford, IL, as I \nmentioned earlier an area hard hit. Stan is pretty nervous. He is 60 \nyears old. He lives in Loves Park near Rockford. He lost his job in \nJune and relies on his unemployment check to keep his household afloat. \nThis is from the Rockford newspaper where he is quoted as saying:\n\n       It's not sufficient, but without it, I'd be in real \n     trouble. I'm already borrowing against my house to put my \n     daughter through college.\n\n  He is living on his unemployment check, and the objection of the \nSenator from Kentucky is going to cut off the checks for people just \nlike him. I cannot understand why we would do this. I am going to renew \nmy unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 4691, a 30-day extension of provisions \nwhich expire Sunday, February 28, unemployment insurance, COBRA, flood \ninsurance, Satellite Home Viewer Act, highway funding, SBA business \nloans and small business provisions of the American Recovery Act, SGR, \nand poverty guidelines received from the House and at the desk; that \nthe bill be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. There are so many things that I would like to say in \nresponse to so many Senators. Before I do that, I want to straighten a \nfew things out. First of all, the prescription drug Part D--I want to \nhelp out my good friend from Missouri and my good friend from Rhode \nIsland. I want them to know that the $400 billion that was spent has \nnot been spent. Just for their information. And the Democratic \nalternative proposed by Representative Pete Stark on the Ways and Means \nCommittee in the House of Representatives cost over $1 trillion to \nfund. That was the alternative to the Republican $400 billion.\n  I know the Senator from Missouri was not here. She probably doesn't \nknow Representative Stark. I served with him for 8 years on the Ways \nand Means Committee. The same thing goes. If you don't like Part D of \nMedicare, you have 59 Senators and you can repeal it anytime you want, \nor at least try to, if you think it is misspent money.\n  Somebody complained about HHS negotiating drug prices. Our own \nscorekeeper, CBO, said we would have--I was on the committee--we would \nhave no savings if they negotiated directly with the drug companies. \nThose profits that my good friend from Illinois talked about are not \nprofits that go to the drug companies because any of the Medicare \nfacilities we use, whether it be a hospital or a doctor or Medicare \nPart B or Part A or Part D--all of those moneys go to doctors, \nhospitals, and people who get prescription drugs to pay for those \nprescription drugs.\n  You have to look at the benefits and see if they outweigh the \ncomplaints.\n  I object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the regular order.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I object and would like to make a unanimous consent----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator asked for the regular order. Is \nthere objection to his request?\n  Mr. BUNNING. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He said he did not object.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. As I understand it, the unanimous consent request is \nagreed to?\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky objects?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thought maybe we had gotten through to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  It is interesting, he wants to talk about everything except the \nunemployed people affected by his objection. I say to the Senator from \nKentucky, we can relitigate all you want. The fact is, the Medicare \nprescription drug program, which costs $400 billion over a 10-year \nperiod of time, is not paid for and you voted for it. So when it comes \nto deficit reduction, you pick and choose those issues that you will \nspend money on. Tonight you are making it clear that you will not spend \nmoney to help unemployed people--people across Kentucky and across \nIllinois.\n  Some of these stories I received from my State I am sure you received \nfrom your State. Here is one from a woman in Bullhead City, IL:\n\n       My husband and I are in our fifties and lost our jobs in \n     2008. I knew immediately we were in trouble so we took our \n     savings and moved to a state park where rent is $400 a month, \n     including utilities.\n\n  They were living in a camper.\n\n       My husband has gotten sick and not been able to see a \n     doctor as we have no medical insurance, our unemployment \n     benefits ran\n\n[[Page S787]]\n\n     out in August and we have no income. The $400 rent that \n     seemed so cheap a year ago is now a struggle to pay. To keep \n     our phone and Internet on is a struggle, yet imperative--\n\n  Because that is the way they look for jobs.\n\n       Neither of us has ever been without until now. I have found \n     that it is more and more difficult and our spirits are at an \n     all-time low. I write this with tears in my eyes, not so much \n     for myself but for the thousands who are facing these \n     difficult times alone. I could not do it alone.\n       When my husband left the house this morning to look for \n     work, I slipped a baggie of Life cereal in his pocket so he \n     would not go hungry. We had no milk . . . too early to offer \n     ramen noodles or macaroni and cheese.\n       I've always been proud to be American and of this great \n     country, yet I can't seem to hold my head up these days. I \n     barely have enough money left to make it. . . . I wait and \n     pray for an extension [of unemployment benefits] to buy us \n     more time.\n       I implore the Republicans to quit dangling carrots in our \n     faces and do the right thing.\n\n  That is what this is about, Senator Bunning. This woman and people \nlike her all across America who will be turned down for unemployment \nbenefits because of your objection. Why are we doing this to these \npeople, whether they live in Tennessee, Kentucky, or any other State? \nWe are a caring people, and I know the Senator from Tennessee feels \nthat way. I do too.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield for a question from the Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I know we talked about unemployment which is a \nsignificant piece of this bill. I also want to point out there are \nother pieces. I want to make sure I am correct. Maybe the Senator could \nclarify this.\n  I know he mentioned in the very early hours when we started this \ndiscussion that there were issues that deal with small business, \nseniors, and it has two other major components.\n  Is it correct that this bill also deals with seniors and small \nbusinesses?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, it is correct.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I appreciate the Senator's constant reminder that this \ndebate is about real people. I don't know what the debates were in \nyears past. I was not here, as Senator McCaskill and Senator Merkley \nmentioned. I was not here. People read and watch what is going on. They \nsee right through what is going on: The wealthiest of the wealthiest \nget the privileges of this body, and people working every single day \nand those now unemployed ask for a little bit of help to make sure they \ncan make it through these tough times, and the other side of the aisle \nturns their back on them.\n  You used the example of seniors. In Alaska, the Medicare \nreimbursement rate is critical. We are one of the highest cost States. \nWe have less doctors today than yesterday, the year before and the year \nbefore. We have very few. I met with our clinics today. I think it is \ndown to one in Anchorage that accepts new Medicare patients. Now we say \nwe are not going to make sure these reimbursement rates are the right \nrate. So now we will have more doctors not serving our seniors. It is \nnot only about the unemployed. They are about to throw seniors over the \ncliff, at least in my State.\n  Does this bill deal with seniors and making sure the reimbursement \nrate is the right rate so doctors can perform the services these \nseniors need?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Alaska that is correct. \nAccording to the 2009 Medicare Trustees Report, on January 1, 2010, \nphysicians were expected to face an across-the-board cut of 21\\1/2\\ \npercent. By 2014, the cuts to physicians treating Medicare patients \nwould be 40 percent. We have averted these cuts with short-term \nextensions, because at those reimbursement levels many doctors would \nstop treating Medicare patients.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I know in my state the answer is: They will. This is a \nsignificant problem even at the 21-percent rate of reimbursement. So \nnot only do we have the unemployed now, whom the other side seems to \nhave a problem with, yet when it comes to the richest of the rich, they \nhave no problem dealing with them, taking care of them unfunded.\n  The pharmaceuticals--I know this debate a little bit. I know how the \ntalk I just heard from the Senator from Kentucky sure did go around and \naround, but the bottom line was the pharmaceutical companies got those \nmonies, made extensive profits, and on the backs of taxpayers. But now \nit is time to help our seniors, make sure they get basic care, and they \nare going to be thrown over. It is amazing to me, when I look at this \nbill--I thought it was simple. Maybe I am naive, being a new Member \nhere, but these are simple things. The crisis in this country is the \nbiggest recession since the Great Depression. Yet when it comes time to \ngiving a little bit of assistance to make sure we can move through this \ntough time, we are not willing to assist the unemployed. Yet the \nrichest of the rich get taken care of.\n  I want to ask one question about that so-called bipartisan bill that \nwas mentioned earlier. I know earlier there was discussion, and I hope \nI can ask this question. The ``bipartisan'' bill that was talked about \nearlier, I know I flipped through the multiple pages of the index and \nsaw all these extenders for businesses, and, if I remember this right--\ncorrect me if I am wrong--the unemployed had a very short extension but \nall these businesses got the long extensions for their tax benefits.\n  Again, it is a question of who do we support here and who do we help? \nAm I mistaken that so-called bipartisan bill--that really wasn't \nbipartisan and which had a lot of issues with it--am I correct there \nwas some imbalance there that people were concerned about?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator from Alaska is correct.\n  Mr. BEGICH. The other piece I want to talk about, and I will end on \nthis because I know the Senator from Oregon has a question or two, and \nit is one of the things I heard over and over again, and that is why I \nthink the way this is being approached is very simple: Here it is, \ndon't cloud it with a lot of other junk. The public has spoken, and \nthey want transparency. They want it clean, they want it simple, and \nthey want to understand what it is talking about, without this whole \nbusiness of jamming in things left and right. Here, this is simple: \nUnemployment for the unemployed, taking care of our seniors.\n  I am on Alaska time, so this is early for me. I have plenty of time. \nWhen it is midnight here, it is 8 o'clock in Alaska, so I have plenty \nof time here. But when I think about these issues of seniors and the \nunemployed that the other side doesn't want to help, it seems the next \nissue--and I will wait my time here and ask about it--is small \nbusinesses--the people who are the backbone of this country--trying to \nhelp those unemployed become employed. That is another piece of this \nbill. Is that correct, that small business is another piece?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is. The SBA programs, which would provide credit for \nsmall businesses--we were looking for a simple 30-day extension so \nthese programs would be available. This objection has stopped that 30-\nday extension and it is going to close down some of those programs, as \nof Monday, that would be available to small businesses across the \nNation.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Small businesses that were probably in the process of \npursuing their dreams and hopes in this recession of creating a new \nopportunity to help those unemployed and others to build our economy. \nIn Alaska, 52 percent of our employment is small business. They are the \nbackbone of this country. They were kind of left out last year. This is \nan effort to continue to help them. Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Alaska is correct.\n  I want to make it clear for the record, because the Senator from \nTennessee came and asked me why we didn't offer to the Senator from \nKentucky an opportunity to have an amendment to pay for these \nunemployment benefits out of the stimulus package, that was offered to \nhim. He said, no, he didn't want to have an amendment offered on the \nfloor because he wasn't sure he could pass the amendment. So he was \noffered the same chance that every Senator has had to take his idea \nbefore the Senate and to get a majority vote. That is not an \nunreasonable thing. That is how the Senate works.\n  I would also say to the Senator from Kentucky that if he believes we \nhave surplus funds in the stimulus or Reinvestment and Recovery Act \nthat can be spent on unemployment and the like, I am afraid he is \nwrong. It is important to note that of the $166 billion in funds\n\n[[Page S788]]\n\nremaining to be obligated, almost every dollar has already been spoken \nfor, even if not yet obligated. So if he thinks the money that has not \ngone out the door of the stimulus act is not spoken for, it is not \ntrue. It is spoken for. That would have been part of the argument when \nhis amendment could have come to the floor, an amendment which he did \nnot care to offer.\n  I would tell him there are two projects in his State that will be \naffected if he cuts the balances in this. And I know he may not care, \nbut some may. It is a Milton-Madison bridge replacement--Milton, KY, to \nMadison, IN--asked for by the Kentucky transportation cabinet. The \ntotal cost is $131 million; TIGER funding, $21 million--a vital link, I \nam told, between two towns. If the bridge is taken out of service, the \nresulting detours will create resulting hardships for residents on both \nsides of the river.\n  There is also another project under this Recovery and Reinvestment, \nwhich I know you voted against, but it is the Appalachian Regional \nShort-Line Rail Project; the location, Kentucky, West Virginia and \nTennessee, and the TIGER funding there is $17 million. The fact is many \npeople believe these will create jobs in Kentucky and put people to \nwork. They have been spoken for and obligated. If that money were taken \nout of the stimulus package, it may affect that project or some other \nproject. But the fact is the money is not just sitting in the stimulus \nfund waiting to gather dust or interest; it is money that has been \nspoken for to put people to work in Kentucky and Illinois and all \nacross America.\n  The fact is the Senator from Tennessee came and asked me why didn't \nwe offer the Senator from Kentucky a chance to offer his amendment. We \ndid. And if he had taken that opportunity, he might have won, he might \nhave lost, but he would have had his day on the floor of the Senate, \nwhich is all any of us can ask for--an up-or-down vote. Instead, he \nsaid: If you don't pay out of the stimulus, no one is going to get \nunemployment benefits, and that is, I believe, an unreasonable \nposition, and that is why we have taken to the floor this evening.\n  Mr. CORKER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield to the Senator for the purpose of a \nquestion.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I have been working in an unusual way \nacross the aisle on an issue that I think is important in this body for \nthe last 2 weeks, and I had planned to spend all day tomorrow, \nSaturday, Sunday, and Monday--whatever it takes--to get a bill that I \nthink is important to this country and important to this body. It is 10 \ntill 11, 5 till 11. And whether you agree or disagree with the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, I am here because I think this is a broadside. The fact \nis that we here in the Senate give each other notice.\n  I understand the frustration with my friends on the other side of the \naisle. I talk to many of you after the lunches that take place. I know \nthere is a lot of frustration. I understand the concerns of the people \non my side of the aisle, especially after we just voted for a pay-for. \nAnd my guess is everybody on the other side of the aisle who is here \ntonight voted for it. Yet we are continuing to pass bills that are not \npaid for.\n\n  I am not going to debate the merits. I know you can talk about taxes \nfor the rich, tax reductions, and all that. The fact is, you did not \ngive the Senator from Kentucky notice this was going to occur.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If that is a question, I would like to respond to it. If \nthat is a question, it is incorrect, and I want the record to be clear.\n  MR. CORKER. Let me just say this----\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry, that is not correct.\n  Mr. CORKER. If I can just finish.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Regular order. I have the floor.\n  Mr. CORKER. If I could just----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. CORKER. This also is not comity.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield for a question after I respond to the \nSenator from Tennessee, and what I would say is the Senator is \nincorrect. After the Senator from Kentucky objected this evening, the \nRepublican side was notified that I was going to come to the floor and \nrenew this unanimous consent request. The Senator from Kentucky knew \nit. He was notified in advance. We then had three subsequent rollcall \nvotes and a unanimous consent request, and then I came to the floor. So \nthe Senator from Tennessee is not correct. He was given prior notice.\n  I would be happy to yield further for a question.\n  Mr. CORKER. I appreciate the explanation. I believe we are stooping \nto a low level.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry, I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. CORKER. I believe we are stooping to a low level. The Senator \nfrom Kentucky and I agree on a lot and we disagree on a lot, and I am \nnot here at this moment to debate the merits of either side. What I am \nsaying is this is not the way the Senate functions.\n  Everybody in the country now knows that the Senator from Kentucky has \na hold on this bill. That is something that is honored. Not a hold on \nthe bill, but he is objecting to unanimous consent, and that is \nsomething that we honor in this body. If the attempt made tonight is \ngoing to be to keep a man 20 years my senior here, without the \nknowledge that this was going to happen--obviously other people had \nthis knowledge--you can see that nobody on our side did.\n  I was getting ready to go to bed, get up in the morning, resume my \ntalks with Senator Dodd--which regardless of what you all do tonight I \nam going to continue because I think our country has serious problems \nthat need to be dealt with--but this, in my opinion, is beneath the \nSenate. And while I might be weary, I will stay here the entire night \nto defend the Senate and defend the fact that the Senator from Kentucky \ndid not know this was going to happen.\n  I am tired. I have been working hard for a long time on a bill that I \nthink is important. I would rather go to bed and be fresh and deal with \nthe issues that need to be dealt with for this country, but I will stay \nhere all night because this is not the way the Senate functions.\n  I am disappointed. I know that we have a lot between us, but I have \nfelt actually, recently, that we were beginning to sort of make things \nclick. I have seen people stepping out and doing things that I feel are \nthe right things to do on behalf of the country, and I have talked to \nmy good friend, the Presiding Officer tonight, about those kinds of \nthings. I have a lot of friends on both sides of the aisle. But this is \nnot the way the Senate functions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I did yield for a question, and I don't believe the \nSenator has a question, but I respect him and respect his point of \nview.\n  Mr. CORKER. My question is: Is this the way the Senate functions? And \nI am asking someone who I respect right now.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I said to the Senator that we gave notice to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, after he had made his objection. So this was not a sneak \nattack. As soon as he made his objection, we notified the Republican \nside of the aisle of what I was going to do.\n  Secondly, I would say that I think those of us who----\n  Mr. BUNNING. Unfortunately, that is not true.\n  Mr. DURBIN.--Put a hold on a bill or a hold on a nomination can \ncertainly do that. I think they ought to step forward and say publicly \nwhen they do that and why they do that.\n  Mr. CORKER. That has been done.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In this situation, in fairness to the Senator from \nKentucky, he has been very public and open about his objections to \nthis. I certainly respect we have different points of view. But I would \nsay to the Senator from Tennessee, here is what I face and what other \nSenators face. After we completed these rollcalls here, we would have \nwalked out the door and gone home and relaxed and headed home for the \nweekend, and then come Sunday, somebody might have noticed the \nunemployment benefits for 15,000 people in my State were cut off, \neliminated, people out of work.\n  I could have left. I would like to be home relaxing too--I am not a \nspring chicken--but I think it is an important enough issue to stand up \nand speak about it tonight. We have heard from the Senator from \nKentucky. I have yielded to him in a way that may go beyond what is \nrequired, but I wanted him to express his viewpoint, and he has, about \nwhy he has done this.\n\n[[Page S789]]\n\n  And, yes, I am a little weary standing here, too, and I don't plan to \nstand here all night. But if we were to walk out that door and ignore \nthe impact of that objection on the thousands of people in our own \nState, do you think we are meeting our obligation as Senators? I think \nit is worth speaking out. You must receive these same communications I \nreceive from people who are out of work. These are sad, heartbreaking \nstories. We are about to make these stories even worse because of the \nobjection of one Senator.\n\n  Yes, it is his right to do it. But it is our right to stand and \nexplain the effect this is going to have on a lot of innocent people.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oregon for purposes of a question.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Senator. I have before me a chart on workers \nlosing Federal unemployment benefits at the beginning of March. It \nnotes ``Workers Exhausting Regular State Benefits without Additional \nFederal Extensions'' as 380,000 workers. Then there is an additional \ncolumn that says ``Workers Prematurely Exhausting Their Federal \nBenefits'' at the start of March: 813,000. I am rounding off. It has a \n``total'' column that says, for the United States as a whole: 1,193,838 \nindividuals lose their benefits.\n  As I am reading this chart, my impression is they are losing their \nbenefits at the end of February if we do not have an extension. Am I \nreading this correctly?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Oregon, I believe it is the end \nof March.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. The end of March. But there are many people who lose \ntheir benefits much sooner if we do not pass this extension?\n  Mr. DURBIN. As I understand it, some will start to lose them as of \nSunday night. Then, as their benefits expire, by the end of the month, \nthe Senator is correct: 1,193,000 people. The Senator from Kentucky and \nothers have said eventually you are going to get around to the process \nof actually getting the 30-day extension. It is true we could do that. \nWe could use up another week of time of the Senate to go through the \nfilibusters and cloture motions on the motions to proceed and the rest \nof it. But it strikes me as a colossal waste of time and a sad \ncommentary on the Senate that we are forced to do this to provide \nsimple unemployment benefits to people across America who are out of \nwork.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. My friend from Tennessee has made some comments about \nthe process. I must say I very much respected the dialog he has been \ninvolved in, in the Banking Committee, through the year I have served \non that committee, working to find the right way to have regulatory \nreform that will help put our economy back on track. There is so much I \nagree with him on. But I completely, respectfully, disagree that it is \ninappropriate, when unemployment benefits are threatened for our \nworkers in our States, to come to this floor and say: This matters. \nThis matters for working families.\n  When I was asking the people of Oregon to consider my candidacy to \ncome here to represent them, I went on a 100-town tour with 100 public \ntownhalls. In every townhall, people came and talked to me about the \nchallenge of employment and health care. Tonight, both are at stake.\n  I had one woman who stood and she said: I got a letter from my doctor \nwhom I have had for many years. I think she said 20 years. She said: \nThe letter fired me from being a patient because I am on Medicare now \nand that the doctor had dismissed all the Medicare patients because the \ncalendar could now be filled with folks with private insurance that \npaid better.\n  My colleague from Alaska was talking about that problem in Alaska. It \nis a huge problem in Oregon that our seniors who are on Medicare cannot \nget in the door of a doctor--at least it is increasingly difficult. The \nresult of it being increasingly difficult is, a program they have \ncounted on to provide their health care they are unable to utilize.\n  Tonight we are considering an extension or a fix of the physician \npayments related to this very issue, whether doctors are going to take \nand keep taking Medicare patients in their agenda. We have talked about \nunemployment, but it is equally important we address this Medicare rate \nbecause, in my State, it is a growing challenge. We have a generational \ncontract with our citizens over Medicare that they are going to be able \nto get in the door of a doctor's office. If we do not address this \npayment issue, then we are not honoring that generational commitment \nunder the Medicare Program.\n  So I do, respectfully, disagree with my colleague from Tennessee. I \nwish we had more debates such as this. I wish we had more debates such \nas this with votes. I wish we had a vote tonight, with a debate, and \nthat my good colleague from Kentucky had agreed to have the debate and \nhad made his case and persuaded us on this floor of his point or that \nothers would have made a different point and would have been \npersuasive. But we didn't have that debate because the offer was made \nand the offer was rejected.\n  Here I am tonight, looking at the thousands and thousands of \nAmericans who are going to lose their health care because they will not \nbe able to get in a doctor's door, who are going to lose their COBRA \nbenefits and therefore will not be able to afford the expense of health \ncare because they are unemployed, who are going to lose their \nunemployment insurance benefits--or looking at the businesses that are \ntrying to get small business loans that will not be able to get them if \nwe are not extending the small business loan guarantee program.\n  I think this is about one of the most important debates for working \nAmericans. We need to get this 1-month extension, we need to respect \nthat everyone in this Chamber, every one of our 100 Senators can \nproceed to carry this debate on over this coming 30 days. We are going \nto have another chance to vote on this. But tonight we should not take \nour differences over the process--or our differences over what happened \nduring the Bush administration--and take it out on the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society.\n  So I ask my colleague from Illinois, does he share my concern that we \nare taking procedural differences and age-old debates and we are taking \nit out on the most vulnerable? Is it the wrong thing to do, as I \nbelieve?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Oregon that is exactly why I am \nstanding. I didn't plan on doing this. I had a pretty full day down at \nthe Blair House and other places. I believed, by the end of the day, \nthe Senator from Kentucky would agree to a vote. He would have had his \nchance on the floor--which is all we can ask for in the Senate, to \nargue his point of view--and that we would be able to go home for the \nweekend knowing unemployed people across the United States would not \nhave their benefits cut off--cutting off unemployment checks in the \nmidst of this recession.\n  I had not planned on being here tonight, but I thought to myself, I \nsay to the Senator from Tennessee, how can I walk out that door and go \nhome and go to bed and say: Well, just another day, another objection. \nThose 12 million people who sent me here expect me to stand for them \nonce in a while.\n  That is what I am trying to do. I cannot believe we have reached the \npoint in the Senate where these battles over cosmic issues are being \nvisited on people who are struggling to survive day to day, to put food \non the table. That is what it has come down to. That is exactly what it \nhas come down to. I think that is unfortunate. I think we are better \nthan that. I think we should be better than that as a Nation and as a \nSenate.\n  Does the Senator from Vermont seek the floor to ask a question? I \nyield for the purposes of a question.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I say to my good friend, the Senator from Tennessee, he \nis a good friend as is the Senator from Kentucky. I like the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. I know he is honest. He is sincere. He is not hiding. He \nis here. I respect that. We disagree very strongly on his position.\n  The Senator from Tennessee said a moment ago his point of view, this \nis not the way the Senate functions, that is not what the Senate is \nabout, in so many words.\n  If you go and ask millions of people and say if the amendment of \nSenator Bunning came to the floor of the Senate--no one can predict \nwhat the vote would be, but my guess is he would probably lose. That is \nmy guess. But he has decided, one person, to say to hundreds and \nhundreds of thousands of\n\n[[Page S790]]\n\nworkers, I, one Senator, am exercising my right, no question about \nthat, and I am going to object. I, one person who does not have the \nvotes to pass my amendment, am saying to people--you have heard the \nSenator from Illinois describing these stories of the pain, turmoil \nthat families are going through. No one disputes what he is saying. It \nis going on in Tennessee, it is going on in Vermont, Kentucky, \nMissouri. We all understand that. I don't think there is a \ndisagreement. People are hurting terribly.\n\n  I don't think there is a disagreement. When people Monday morning \nwake and find they are not getting the safety net of that life-\nsupporting check, do you know what people are going to be feeling? Do \nyou know what panic? They don't know how the bureaucracy works. \nSuddenly, they wake and somebody says: I am not getting my check. Am I \never going to get a check? Well, they are going to get a check, but it \nis delayed.\n  There was an article in the paper just the other day, one of the \nramifications of this recession, and we all know it is true, is what it \nis doing to the emotional health of people. Think about people who want \nto work, who have worked their whole lives and cannot find a job. Do \nyou know what it is doing to them? To their emotional well-being? Do \nyou think they like unemployment checks? The vast majority don't want \nit--a thousand times more they would like a job. Suddenly, for no \nunderstandable--they don't understand what is going on. I don't \nunderstand what is going on half the time in the Senate. Suddenly, \nbecause one Senator says: I am sorry, I object, I object, and thousands \nand thousands of people are wondering whether they are going to \nsurvive.\n  They are going to get their checks. We will eventually pass this.\n  This is a good debate. We have a $14 trillion national debt. How did \nwe get here? How do we resolve that debt? Who in this room thinks that \na $14 trillion debt is sustainable? Nobody does. We have to deal with \nthat issue. Who caused it? We have disagreements. How do you solve it? \nWe have disagreements. Let's argue out those disagreements but not on \nthe backs of people today who are hurting and hurting terribly.\n  One of the points I would like to ask the Senator about is we are not \njust looking at record-breaking unemployment in our lifetimes. This \nunemployment rate takes place after years and years of decline.\n  There was an interesting piece--I don't have the date, it was a \ncouple months ago--in USA Today; astounding facts. What they said--this \nis from USA Today, I think going through the census data. Between 2000 \nand 2008, men between 25 and 34 saw an 11.7-percent drop in their \nmedian income; people, then, from 45 to 54, 11.2 percent drop. In other \nwords, all over this country we see people who are furious. They are \nangry. They are confused. Do you know why? They went through a decade \nwhere they worked hard and at the end of that decade they were poorer \nthan when they began the decade and then came the Wall Street collapse \nand then came massive unemployment. What we are trying to do--no one \nthinks the extension of unemployment is the solution. We have to \nrebuild the economy. We have to create jobs. But I hope nobody in this \nroom thinks it is acceptable or moral that we allow desperate people to \ngo over the cliff--not to have money to buy food?\n  Hunger in the United States of America today is a serious problem. It \nis not a joke. This is America. Desperate people, for their kids, for \ntheir parents, need that unemployment check.\n  We are going to pass this. I gather we will pass it next week. But \nall we are doing is disrupting the lives of hundreds of thousands of \npeople for no good reason. Senator Bunning has raised important issues. \nI disagree with him, but those issues are important. Let's debate them. \nBut you do not have to do it on the backs of the middle class and the \nworking class who have been decimated for years and are now in worse \nshape than they have been and now we are suddenly pulling out the rug.\n  I ask my friend from Illinois, my assumption is, we are at some point \nsoon going to pass these unemployment extensions. My understanding is, \nI don't know how it is going to be, but I suspect many Republicans are \nprobably going to vote with many on this side; is that a correct \nassumption? And are we simply bringing more pain and confusion to \nhundreds of thousands of people who suddenly, Sunday, Monday, are going \nto find out they don't get a check?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say, in response to the Senator from Vermont, the \nlast time we went through this exercise about unemployment benefits, he \nmay recall there was a Republican Senator who insisted on an amendment \non the bill relating to ACORN. If he could not get another chance to \ntake a swing at the organization, ACORN, he was going to hold up the \nunemployment benefit bill.\n  I reached the limit of my patience at that moment. I thought to \nmyself, it was not the first, second, third, or fourth or fifth time, \nit was going to be the sixth or seventh time. There was a belief on his \npart that he had to keep taking a swing at this organization, even at \nthe expense of delaying unemployment benefits.\n  I will tell you, I think that is unfortunate. If you want to fight a \nbattle, for goodness' sakes, make it a fair fight. Do not fight the \nbattle over the bodies of people who are unemployed and struggling to \nget by on a day-to-day basis. If you want to fight the battle of the \ndeficit, fight the battle of the deficit on the budget resolution or \nwhatever appropriations bill you choose.\n  But to deny unemployment benefits to make your point about the \nNation's debt takes this to an extreme. That is why I am here. That is \nwhy I did not go home tonight. I would like to be there to see what is \nhappening with the Olympics and what every other American family is \ndoing. But I thought to myself, I cannot walk out that door without \nspeaking up for what I consider to be an unjust decision by one of my \ncolleagues.\n  He sees it differently. I do like Senator Bunning. He and I may have \nhad our differences, but we have had some good conversations about \nbaseball. Maybe that is all but about baseball.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I would say that the Senator and I have had strong \nagreements. I would ask the Senator from Illinois, in the hearing of \nthe Senator from Kentucky: Look, the Senator from Kentucky has raised \nimportant issues. I would hope that he would allow us, not for our \nsake, but for the sake of tens and tens of thousands of people, to get \nthose checks out. Let's come back and continue that debate.\n  You have raised the right issues. These unemployment checks are going \nto go out, unless I am mistaken. So all we are doing is disrupting the \nprocess. We understand where you are coming from. You have raised a \nfair point. It is a very important issue.\n  But I would, through my friend from Illinois, ask my friend from \nKentucky, who is a friend--I like Jim Bunning: Let us continue this \ndebate. But it does not have to be tonight. It does not have to be in a \nway that causes confusion and uncertainty and a lot of pain for a lot \nof people. So I would--\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield. But I would say also to the \nSenator from Tennessee and the Senator from Kentucky, there is a \nversion of this unanimous consent request which will give you your \nvote. If the Senator would agree to that. You will not.\n  I yield to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. The Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from \nVermont and the Senator from Rhode Island all came here in the same \nclass. The Senator from Oregon just arrived in January. So we have not \nbeen here for a long time to watch how the Senate works and how the \nSenate traditionally has worked. I know it appeared to my pal from \nTennessee that this looked like some organized ambush of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. I have to tell you the truth, we are not that well \norganized. If we were that well organized, we probably would have been \ndoing more of this a long time ago.\n  I honestly came down to the Senate floor understanding a deal had \nbeen made to give Senator Bunning a vote on his amendment. I expected \nthat vote to occur. I had not talked to my office. I was surprised when \nI got to the floor and realized that Senator Bunning, which he can do \nunder the rules, was going to hold it.\n\n[[Page S791]]\n\n  I walked up as I was finishing voting on the third bill, and I said \nto Dick: Are you going to stick around and make him object again?\n  He said: You know, I think I am going to stick around for a while. I \njust do not feel right going home.\n  At that moment I thought: I do not feel right about going home \neither. I think it is time, if we are going to do an objection every 5 \nminutes, and if we are going to have holds--if this was a hold on a \nnominee, it could wait until Monday. But when Senator Bunning decided \nto do this, it came at a risk. And the risk it came with was that there \nwere going to be Senators who were going to speak out about it. There \nwere going to be Senators who were going to disagree with him, and they \nwere going to publicly say that this is not the moment.\n  This $10 billion, with all of this deficit spending that has gone on \nfor the last decade, this is not the moment to have one Senator say: I \ncan stop it. So I felt like I wanted to talk about it. But nobody \norganized this. Nobody said: Jeff Merkley, can you stay? This is just \nsome of us decided we wanted to stay and talk about it.\n  Here is what I ask. Have there been this many objections and holds \ntraditionally in the Senate?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Have we had this many? Have there been this many \nobstructions to the regular order of the Senate traditionally?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have been here 14 years--14 years in the House, 14 \nyears in the Senate. This Senate has changed so dramatically in the 14 \nyears I have been here. We actually had debates on the floor of the \nSenate. We had Members offering amendments back and forth. I mean good \ndebates. I thought it really was a joy to be part of a deliberative \nbody that engaged in that.\n  But now we are in this era of cloture and filibuster and holds and \nobjections, and it grinds to a halt. You think to yourself: No wonder \nthere is frustration among the membership, and no wonder so many people \non the outside look at us and say: Why are they not doing things?\n  How can we explain to people in Missouri, Illinois, or Tennessee or \nKentucky that we are here tonight because we are going to cut off \nunemployment benefits? You know, the Senator is right, the Senator from \nVermont is right. The day will come when those unemployment benefits \nwill go through. It may take us a week. We may have to eat up a whole \nweek of the Senate Calendar to get that done.\n  You think to yourself: Senator, is there not something you should be \ndoing that is more important? And we know there is. We should be \nworking on a jobs program. We should be working on health care. You are \nworking on financial regulations. I know, Senator Corker, you may be \nupset with me at this moment. But I respect you so much. It shows \nextraordinary courage on your part to step up and try and tackle this \ntough issue.\n  I am glad you are doing it. It does harken back to a better era in \nthe Senate when people did work on a bipartisan basis. So I would say \nto the Senator from Missouri, we have been here for a while, and I know \nthere are staff people here who did not plan to be here this late. In \ndeference to them, I am going to allow the Senator from Missouri to ask \na question. I am going to then make a unanimous consent request again. \nThen at that point, I will not make it after that point.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Well, I guess what I am trying to ask the Senator \nis--I do not think most Americans think the Senate is working very well \nright now. I think most Americans think we are behaving sometimes like \nchildren. I think most Americans are not sure what the rules are and \nwhat the difference is between a cloture, a filibuster, a motion to \nproceed, and a motion to recommit; what is the difference between a \nreconciliation and a conciliation or all of the other terms we throw \naround here.\n  But there is one thing I think we all need to come to grips with; \nthat is, if we are going to try to stop the place, we need to be proud \nto own it. I think that goes on both sides of the aisle. If a Senator \nwants to hold a nomination, I do not think they should be allowed to \nkeep it secret for 10 seconds. If somebody wants to try to hold a bill \nor wants to object to something, I think this nonsense that they have \nhad in the Senate forever that it is a secret for a while is the \nstupidest thing that I can possibly imagine.\n\n  If you are big enough to get elected to the Senate, you ought to be \nbig enough to own what you do with your rights when you get here. \nSenator Bunning has stood up strong tonight, and he has explained his \nposition. A few of us stuck around and talked about our positions. I \nthink that is about the healthiest thing we can do. I think it is a \nheck of a lot healthier than running around behind closed doors placing \nholds that nobody knows are there or why.\n  I make a pledge tonight that if I am ever going to hold anything, the \nminute I decide to do it, I am going to say what it is, why it is, and \nI am going to own it. I think it is time that all of us do that. If \nsomebody is not willing to own it, then I hope someone comes to the \nfloor and does to them what we are doing tonight.\n  I think the sooner we own what we are doing with our rights in the \nSenate, the sooner we wear them like a proud coat of bright-colored \nfeathers, the better off we are going to be in terms of getting things \ndone around here. This is not about making the other side fail. That is \nnot what this is supposed to be about. This is supposed to be about us \nworking together like you are trying to do.\n  My friend, the Senator from Tennessee, you are doing the right thing. \nYou are trying to find common ground and work hard, and there are \nplenty of us who want to do that. I hope that whatever is motivating \nyou to work as hard as you are working in a bipartisan way, I hope it \nis contagious because if you can spread it around a little, I think the \nAmerican people would be so proud that we would quit this nonsense of \npolitical holds and political ``gotcha'' amendments.\n  By the way, I am the first to admit this has gone on on both sides. \nThis is an equal opportunity Senate. But it is time that we try to make \nthis place work better.\n  I have to tell you honestly, my dear friend, I think tonight helps. I \ndo not think it hurts. I think it is a good thing, and I am proud to \nhave participated in this tonight. I think the Senate would be a \nhealthier place if we did it more often.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois for yielding for this time, and I \nthank him for sticking around as long as he has, so at least we now \nknow what has happened and why.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If that is a question, I agree. In defense of the \nquestion, I agree with what the Senator said.\n  I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I was presiding during the time that my friend, \nSenator Corker, was speaking. I did not have the chance to respond. But \nI want to assure him, through the Chair and through this question, that \nas the distinguished Senator from Missouri has just said, this was not \nplanned on our side, at least not by me. I came for the votes.\n  The only surprise tonight was my surprise that a Senator was going to \nstop our unemployment insurance program. It never crossed my mind, \nuntil it just happened tonight, that was within the realm of \npossibility. I have 75,000 people unemployed in my small State of Rhode \nIsland. We are at 13 percent unemployment.\n  So when I discovered, as a surprise tonight at these votes, that this \nwas going to happen, like Senator Durbin, I could not just walk away \nfrom this Chamber. No way. No way.\n  But it was not as part of a planned surprise. The person in my life \nwho was surprised as to what happened tonight was me. Frankly, I am \nstill surprised, and I am surprised this has not resolved itself during \nthe course of this discussion.\n  I am surprised that the 75,000 people in Rhode Island and over 1 \nmillion people in this country, who are going to wake up to the worry \nand concern and extra anxiety that Senator Sanders spoke about, are \ngoing to have to face that. I think it is unfortunate. But it is not \nbecause of a surprise attack by me. It is because I am responding to a \nsurprise to something that I think is very unfortunate and \nextraordinarily painful for tens of thousands of regular working people \nwho did nothing wrong but cannot find work in this economy in my home \nState.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. I am happy to yield for a question \nfrom the Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On pages S791 and S792, February 25, 2010, the Record reads: . . \n. in this economy in my home State. The Presiding Officer (Mr. \nBegich). The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. Corker. Mr. President, I \nthank . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . in this \neconomy in my home State. I thank the Chair. Mr. DURBIN. I thank \nthe Senator. I am happy to yield for a question from the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n[[Page S792]]\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. I have \nto say to my friend from Missouri that I agree that the discussion has \nbeen very good. I received an e-mail from my staff regarding what was \nhappening. I got in my car and drove down here. I have to say that as I \nlook across the other side of the aisle and on this side, I have a lot \nof friends, a lot of goodwill.\n  I say to the Senator from Illinois, I don't think I have ever, in my \nshort time here, 3 years 2 months, I don't think I have offered a \nmessage amendment. I don't think I have ever offered anything that was \nmeant to obstruct unnecessarily. As a matter of fact, I offer very few \namendments. I try to do my work with other Senators and bring things to \nthe floor that are hopefully ready to pass.\n  At the end of the day, the Senator from Vermont is the best I know in \nthis body at talking about compassion for people that I know he \nbelieves; I think we all believe. I always listen to him with great \nawe, candidly, at his ability to express what all of us feel about \npeople who are unemployed or have large heating bills or whatever may \nexist. I don't really think that is what this debate is about. It \nisn't. This debate is about the fact we are spending money that we \ndon't have. Yet we have passed a $787 billion stimulus bill that won't \nbe spent until way beyond 2012.\n  I cosponsored an amendment, a piece of legislation with the Senator \nfrom Colorado, Mr. Bennet, to use some of that unspent money past 2012 \nto pay down the deficit. He is in a tough race. He wanted me to \ncosponsor something that was sensible, and I did.\n  This is really not about the fact that all of us want to see people \nwho are unemployed have these benefits. We don't want to see physicians \ntake a 21 percent cut. It is about paying for it. I wonder if the \nSenator from Illinois would agree to me offering unanimous consent that \nwe pass this measure that is before us, and we do it tonight. And we \npay for it with unspent funds from the stimulus bill that won't be \nutilized or are not planned to be utilized until beyond 2012. That is \nwhat this debate is about. All of us want to see people get \nunemployment benefits. We want that. We want to see them have all the \nthings that are in this bill. It is not about that. You know that if \nthis bill were offset, it would have been voice voted out of here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we pass this measure out, that we offset \nit with unspent stimulus moneys that are going to be utilized past the \nyear 2012, and then we work together, just like we are tonight, to \nfigure out a way to make up that difference. I know this is something \nthat is very important to the administration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order. I yielded for \nthe purpose of a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois yielded for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Tennessee, here is the \ndifficulty we face. Of the stimulus funds currently sitting there, they \nhave been obligated. They will be spent. There won't be a surplus, we \nare told, of any funds. This would have come out during the course of \nthe debate, if Senator Bunning had accepted our offer of the amendment. \nTo agree to this now is to basically agree to what he has been asking \nfor, just say we will pay for it with the stimulus. I don't think it \nshould be, and I don't think it can be. It should be the subject of a \ngood floor debate. That is what the Senate is for.\n  I understand you can't make a unanimous consent request when I have \nyielded only for a question. But that would be my response to you based \non that.\n  Mr. CORKER. I would like a ruling from the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is correct.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator for yielding for a question, and I \nthank him for this discussion. I understand my request is out of order. \nI actually thank each of you for your heartfelt comments. All of us \nknow that we all want to see these benefits extended.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to ask this unanimous consent \nrequest one last time this evening. I will not be making another \nunanimous consent request until tomorrow morning. There will be an \nopportunity, I believe, with the Senate coming into session, pursuant \nto the adjournment script, at about 9:30 in the morning. I will make \none request. I will make the same unanimous consent request in the \nmorning. That is the only time I will make it. But at this point that \nis my plan.\n  I thank the members of the staff, all of them, who were not notified \nthat this was going to happen this evening and had to make changes in \ntheir own personal and family plans as a result.\n  As we have said, there will be thousands and thousands of people \nacross America impacted by this decision in just a few days. That is \nwhy many of us thought it was worth the wait and the effort. I still \nbelieve it was.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 4691, a 30-day extension of provisions which \nexpire on Sunday, February 28--unemployment insurance, COBRA, flood \ninsurance, Satellite Home Viewer Act, highway funding, SBA business \nloans and small business provisions of the American Recovery Act, SGR, \nand on poverty guidelines--received from the House and at the desk, \nthat the bill be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider \nbe made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding we will now move to closing the \nsession. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, particularly \non the Democratic side, for sticking with me through the course of the \nevening. None of us had planned for this, and it came as a surprise \nthat this issue came before us. I think there were heartfelt sentiments \nstated here, and I thank them very much for staying with me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/25/senate-section/article/S792-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S792-S793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING VERNON HUNTER\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.

They put \nthemselves in harm's way to keep us all safe and protect our freedoms \nand way of life.\n  Those who work in civilian roles also routinely take risks to their \nsafety when performing their jobs, including the many Federal employees \nposted overseas and at our borders.\n  This week, sadly, our Nation mourns the loss of a truly outstanding \npublic servant who was killed last Thursday in the tragic attack \nagainst an office building in Austin, TX.\n  Vernon Hunter was a 27-year veteran of the Internal Revenue Service \nand before that served for two decades in the U.S. Army.\n  Earlier this month, I honored an IRS employee who made it possible \nfor tens of millions to file their taxes electronically. At that time I \nspoke about how our IRS employees continually work hard to make it \neasier and less stressful for Americans to pay their taxes.\n  Vernon was one of the great IRS managers who helped process tax \nfilings and resolve issues for taxpayers. He had a reputation for being \nkind and full of life. He always wanted to help people solve their \nproblems. His biography reads like a lesson in service and sacrifice.\n  A native of Orangeburg, SC, Vernon enlisted in the U.S. Army after \ngraduating from high school. He served two combat tours in Vietnam, at \nthe same time facing discrimination at home when he was turned away \nfrom an all-White boarding house despite wearing the uniform. Vernon \nremained in the Army for 20 years, after which he worked for a short \ntime in the private sector. However, as do many of our great Federal \nemployees, he believed he had always been called to serve his Nation, \nand he returned to Federal employment nearly three decades ago when he \nbegan working for the IRS.\n  Last week, Vernon lost his life when a small plane appeared out of \nthe clear morning sky and struck his office\n\n[[Page S793]]\n\nbuilding. The pilot also died in an act of apparent suicide, leaving \nbehind a lengthy manifesto condemning corporations, the government, and \nsingling out the IRS. Although 13 people were injured, Vernon was the \nonly person killed in the violent explosion that ensued.\n  Loyal, dedicated public servants such as Vernon bravely put \nthemselves at risk each and every day through the mere act of doing \ntheir jobs. The attack in Austin was, of course, presaged by the \nOklahoma City bombing and the anthrax attacks of 2001.\n  Civilian Federal employees know there is always a risk. Many pass \nthrough metal detectors each morning coming to their offices. Mail is \nscreened and emergency drills rehearsed. A Federal office building is a \nplace of both dedicated work and unwitting risk in the name of service \nto country. Vernon, tragically, epitomized both.\n  Vernon was 68 years old and is survived by his wife Valerie who also \nworks for the IRS in the same office building, along with six children \nand stepchildren, seven grandchildren, and a great-grandchild. \nAccording to his son, Vernon was planning to retire from the IRS and go \nback to school. He wanted to teach children with special learning \nneeds. Vernon was also an active member of the Greater Mountain Zion \nBaptist Church in Austin where he ushered and where his funeral will be \nheld tomorrow.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Vernon Hunter and \nexpressing our condolences to his family, friends, and those who worked \nwith him at the IRS. He made the ultimate sacrifice in service of our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/25/senate-section/article/S793-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today during Black History Month \nto honor the history and legacy of the First Kansas Colored Infantry, a \nregiment of former slaves, which was the first group of Black men to \nfight in the American Civil War.\n  This regiment of escaped Black slaves was the first organized into \nservice for the U.S. Government. They were commanded by COL James M. \nWilliams. For the first time during the Civil War, Black troops were \nfighting alongside White troops in the name of freedom and equality.\n  In June 1862, Kansas Senator James H. Lane started recruiting troops \nfrom among free Blacks, especially the increasing numbers of fugitive \nslaves in Kansas, men who had fled their masters in Missouri and \nArkansas. The progressive nature of Kansas made it appealing to slaves \nfleeing Missouri and Arkansas as soon as the Civil War fighting began. \nBy August 1862, Colonel Williams assembled 500 men in a camp outside \nLeavenworth. These men fought bravely in July of 1863, at Cabin Creek, \nwhen the First Kansas Colored Infantry along with other Union forces \nworked to drive the Confederates out of nearly all of Arkansas.\n  President Lincoln also took note of the bravery of the First Kansas \nColored Infantry when he noted to a group of visitors from South \nCarolina who came to complain about the arming of Blacks: ``You say you \nwill not fight to free Negroes. Some of them seem to be willing enough \nto fight for you.'' These men of the First Kansas Colored Infantry \ncontinued to fight until the end of the Civil War, being credited with \nseeing action at Sherwood, MO; Honey Springs; Indian Territory; and \nLawrence, KS; Poison Springs, AR. They saw more regular combat than any \nother black regiment of the war. In October 1865, the men of the First \nKansas Colored Infantry were discharged at Fort Leavenworth.\n  Frederick Douglass once stated, ``In a composite nation like ours, as \nbefore the law, there should be no rich, no poor, no high, no low, no \nwhite, no black, but common country, common citizenship, equal rights \nand a common destiny.'' These men were willing to give their lives in \nthe hopes for a better future, an equal future, for their children. It \nis a struggle that continues today, and we look to our history as we \ncontinue to engage in it.\n  Mr. President, the men of the First Kansas Colored Infantry helped \nshape this nation into a society of freedom and a beacon of hope around \nthe world. I ask that we all thank them and honor their legacy of \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/25/senate-section/article/S793-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S793-S794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       USA PATRIOT ACT EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this is not where I hoped we would be, \n8\\1/2\\ years after the USA PATRIOT Act became law. Congress should not \nhave passed that law in such haste in 2001 and ought to have enacted \nmeaningful reforms to it years ago. That is why I voted against the \nPATRIOT Act in the first place, and it is why, Congress after Congress, \nyear after year, I have sponsored and cosponsored bills and amendments \nto enact changes that would protect the rights of innocent Americans \nwhile also ensuring that the government has the authorities it needs to \nprotect national security.\n  So needless to say, it is far from ideal that the three expiring \nprovisions are being extended for 1 year. But my hope is that Congress \nwill take the opportunity presented by the 1-year extension to finally \nenact the meaningful changes to the PATRIOT Act that I have been \nadvocating for years. It is well past time to place appropriate checks \nand balances on authorities like national security letters, whose abuse \nthe inspector general has documented repeatedly; ``sneak and peek'' \nsearches, which allow government agents to search Americans' homes \nwithout telling them until well after the fact; and section 215 orders, \nwhich authorize the government to secretly obtain records about \nAmericans without connections to terrorists or spies.\n  I will continue to fight for these reforms, just as I did a few \nmonths ago in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Our committee took up the \nUSA PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension Act in October 2009, and Senator \nDurbin and I pushed for improvements on a variety of issues. Some of \nthose amendments were successful, such as the amendment shortening the \npresumptive time period for delayed notice of a ``sneak and peek'' \nsearch warrant from 30 days to 7 days and the amendment requiring that \nthe Attorney General issue procedures governing the acquisition, \nretention, and dissemination of records obtained via national security \nletters, NSLs. There are other provisions in that bill that I strongly \nsupport, as well, including new inspector general audits, a sunset for \nthe first time on the NSL authorities, and changes to the NSL and \nsection 215 gag orders to help bring them in line with the first \namendment.\n  But in key ways, that bill fell short, and as a result I voted \nagainst it in committee. Most importantly, it did not contain \ncritically important protections for the government's use of section \n215 orders and NSLs. Senator Durbin offered amendments that would have \nrequired that the government be able to demonstrate some connection--\nhowever tenuous--to terrorism before obtaining an individual's \nsensitive business records using these authorities. But those \namendments were rejected.\n  This was in some respects mystifying. The Senate Judiciary Committee \npassed this same standard for section 215 orders unanimously in 2005, \nand the Senate adopted it by unanimous consent that year, although it \nwas not in the conference report that ultimately became law. The \narguments that led the Senate to pass this standard in 2005 still \napply. The ``relevance'' standard in current law is still dangerously \noverbroad and the burden of proof should be on its proponents to \nexplain why a more focused standard, unanimously supported by the \nSenate in 2005, cannot serve as an effective counterterrorism and \nnational security tool.\n  I recall during the debate in 2005 that proponents of section 215 \nargued that these authorities had never been misused. They cannot make \nthat case now. Section 215 has been misused. I cannot elaborate, but I \nbelieve that the public deserves some information about this. I and \nothers have also pressed the administration to declassify some basic \ninformation about the use of section 215, and it has declined. I hope \nthat the administration will reconsider and that more information will \nbe declassified before this reauthorization process is completed. I do \nappreciate that the administration has offered to provide information \nabout this to Members of the Senate beyond those of us who serve on the \nIntelligence and Judiciary Committees. But that is just a start. We \nmust find a way to have an open and\n\n[[Page S794]]\n\nhonest debate about the nature of these government powers, while still \nprotecting national security secrets, and under current conditions that \nsimply isn't possible.\n  Congress and the American people do, however, have a great deal of \ninformation about how the national security letter authorities have \nbeen abused by the FBI. In a series of incredibly detailed audits--\naudits that the Judiciary Committee chairman worked so hard to require \nin the 2006 PATRIOT Act reauthorization legislation--the Department of \nJustice Office of Inspector General has documented years of misuse. In \nhis first report, in 2007, the inspector general found--as he put it--\n``widespread and serious misuse of the FBI's national security letter \nauthorities.'' His most recent report documents even more instances of \nthe FBI inappropriately obtaining telephone records, through the use of \nso-called ``exigent letters'' and other informal requests for telephone \nbilling records that violated the requirements of the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act, ECPA.\n  So I will continue to press for improvements to the PATRIOT Act. \nIndeed, last year I and nine other Senators introduced the JUSTICE Act, \nwhich takes a comprehensive approach to fixing our surveillance laws. \nIt permits the government to conduct necessary surveillance but within \na framework of accountability and oversight. It ensures both that our \ngovernment has the tools to keep us safe and that the privacy and civil \nliberties of innocent Americans will be protected. These are not \nmutually exclusive goals. We can and must do both.\n  Since the PATRIOT Act was first passed in 2001, we have learned some \nimportant lessons. Perhaps the most important is that Congress cannot \ngrant the government overly broad authorities and just keep its fingers \ncrossed that they won't be misused or interpreted by aggressive \nexecutive branch lawyers in as broad a way as possible. It is no longer \npossible for proponents of the PATRIOT Act to argue that it has never \nbeen abused. It has. Congress cannot and must not ignore its \nresponsibility to put appropriate limits on government authorities--\nlimits that allow agents to actively pursue criminals, terrorists and \nspies but that also protect the privacy of innocent Americans.\n  We also now know that lawyers in the Office of Legal Counsel looked \nfor every possible loophole in statutory language to justify what I \nbelieve were clearly illegal wiretapping and interrogation programs. \nThat should also teach us that we must be extraordinarily careful in \nhow we draft these laws: We must say exactly what we mean and leave no \nroom for reinterpretation.\n  I hope that this extension will allow Congress an opportunity to do \njust that--to get this right once and for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/25/senate-section/article/S794-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NOMINATION OF JUSTICE BARBARA KEENAN\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the summer of 2009, Senator Webb and I \nhad the honor of interviewing several potential candidates to serve on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. We were enormously \nimpressed by the quality of all the candidates being considered. But \none candidate rose to the top of the list for her extensive experience, \njudicial temperament, and commitment to the law. This candidate was \nJustice Barbara Keenan.\n  President Obama nominated Justice Keenan on September 14, 2009. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the nomination where \nmembers of the committee were given the opportunity to engage Justice \nKeenan in a question-and-answer session. On October 29, 2009, the \nmembers of the committee reported the nomination by unanimous consent.\n  Justice Keenan's nomination has been on the Senate Calendar for 4 \nmonths now. I believe it is time for this Chamber to consider the \nnomination and give Justice Keenan an up-or-down vote.\n  Justice Keenan has strong academic credentials. She graduated from \nCornell University in 1971 and received her law degree from the George \nWashington University Law School in 1974. She also earned a master of \nlaws degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1992.\n  Justice Keenan has served with distinction at every level of State \ncourt in Virginia. She has served as a justice on the Virginia Supreme \nCourt since 1991. She also served on the Fairfax County General \nDistrict Court, the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, and the Court of \nAppeals of Virginia. Earlier in her career, Justice Keenan worked as an \nassistant prosecutor in Fairfax and briefly worked as an attorney in \nprivate practice.\n  The Virginia State Bar Judicial Nominations Committee ranked Justice \nKeenan as ``highly qualified.'' She was one of the few candidates to \nreceive a unanimous vote.\n  The committee noted in the summary of her evaluation that ``. . . it \nwould be a shame to lose Justice Keenan's skills on the Supreme Court \nof Virginia, but Senators Webb and Warner could do no better than her \nappointment to the Fourth Circuit . . .'' The committee also found that \nJustice Keenan has exhibited excellent judicial temperament, has the \nhighest integrity, and concluded that she has superior intellect and \nlegal skills for the position.\n  In addition to the Virginia State Bar, Justice Keenan was considered \n``highly recommended'' or ``highly qualified'' by the Virginia Women \nAttorney's Association, the Old Dominion Bar Association, the Virginia \nTrial Lawyers Association, and the Asian Pacific American Bar \nAssociation.\n  I must also mention that Justice Keenan is the first woman appointed \nto the bench in Virginia and one of the initial 10 appointees to the \nVirginia Court of Appeals following its creation in 1985.\n  Six weeks ago Justice Keenan was the first woman to administer the \noath of office to a Virginia Governor, Gov. Bob McDonnell.\n  In May, Virginia Lawyers Weekly named Justice Keenan as the \n``influential woman of the year'' for ``a litany of first and years of \nservice.''\n  I look forward to casting my vote in support of Justice Barbara \nKeenan's nomination and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/25/senate-section/article/S794-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S794-S795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO TONY BELL\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Tony \nBell of Harveyville, KS. Tony has been selected as a 2009 Great \nComebacks Recipient for the Central Region. This very important program \nannually honors a group of individuals who are living with intestinal \ndiseases or recovering from ostomy surgery.\n  The Great Comeback Award celebrates the lives of people with painful \nand debilitating diseases like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, \ncolorectal cancer and other diseases that can lead to ostomy surgery. \nTony is one of over 700,000 Americans, from young children to senior \ncitizens, who have an ostomy, a surgical procedure that reconstructs \nbowel and bladder function through the use of a specially fitted \nmedical prosthesis. Ostomy surgery is a life-altering and sometimes \nlife-saving procedure which both addresses a medical issue and improves \na patient's quality of life.\n  Hundreds of thousands of those suffering from Crohn's or ulcerative \ncolitis rely on a certain type of ostomy to function on a daily basis. \nJust like a prosthesis, ostomies help restore patients' ability to \nparticipate in the normal activity of daily life. Recipients are \npatients who live full and productive lives with their ostomies.\n  Born with a defect of his colon, Tony Bell received an ostomy \nimmediately after birth. A few years later, the ostomy was reversed, \nbut after years of struggling with incontinence, 9-year-old Tony \nreceived a permanent colostomy. All of a sudden, this inactive, \nwithdrawn boy who was scared to leave his home was ready to saddle up \nand grab life by the horns.\n  In control of his body--and his life--at last, an empowered Tony \nembraced a bright future--one he hoped would include a career as a \nprofessional bull rider. He wasted no time, mounting his first bull at \nthe age of 10. As Tony trained for rodeo events, he also pursued his \nlove of music. In fact, as a high school senior, he was chosen to join \nthe elite Kansas Ambassadors choir on a European tour.\n\n[[Page S795]]\n\n  While attending college on a singing scholarship, Tony went pro on \nthe rodeo circuit and competed professionally for 2 years, even riding \nin the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo, known as ``The Daddy of Them \nAll.'' Having achieved this childhood dream, Tony has set his sights on \na new goal, following in his parents' footsteps to become a teacher.\n  Through it all, Tony says he drew tremendous strength from his \nparents, who taught him to be resilient and to bounce back from \nwhatever life threw his way. He also credits his ``second family,'' \nYouth Rally, a summer camp for adolescents with an ostomy, for helping \nhim through some rough patches in his life. He now returns each summer \nas a counselor and enjoys ``paying it forward'' by providing support \nand encouragement to campers.\n  Today, Tony, 28, lives in Harveyville, KS, with his wife Pam and 6-\nyear-old stepdaughter Haiden. He works on the family farm and is only a \nfew credits shy of his special education teaching degree. Although Tony \ndidn't end up a country music star, he channels his passion and \nperforms in a barbershop quartet with his dad. An outdoor enthusiast, \nhe enjoys skydiving and noodling--fishing for catfish with your bare \nhands. ``I want to share with the world my story of success so that \nothers with life-changing conditions know that they are not alone,'' \nsaid Tony. ``No matter what comes your way, always reach for the stars \nand grasp your dreams--they are only a bull ride away.''\n  I urge my colleagues to take the time to meet with Tony and some of \nthe other Great Comebacks Regional Award Recipients. Their personal \nstories are inspirational and will raise your awareness about some of \nthe Great Comebacks being made by people living with intestinal \ndiseases or recovering from ostomy surgery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/25/senate-section/article/S795-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING BILL GRESHAM\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, my State of Mississippi has lost \none of its finest citizens, Bill Gresham of Indianola, who passed away \non Tuesday, February 23. His family and friends will gather today to \nhonor his memory at funeral services in his hometown. I extend my \nsincerest sympathies to Bill's wife Ann, his daughters Gayle and Susan, \nhis sons Walton and Tom, his sons and daughters-in-law, his \ngrandchildren, and all members of his extended family.\n  Bill Gresham graduated from Indianola High School and the University \nof Mississippi. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and the \nKorean war. After his Navy service Bill returned to Mississippi and \nbecame a very respected and successful leader in our State. Bill was \npresident of Gresham Petroleum Company and Gresham Service Stations and \na board member of Double Quick, Inc. and Delta Terminal, Inc.\n  Bill was president of Delta Council, the Mississippi Petroleum \nMarketers Association, the Mississippi Propane Gas Association, the \nMississippi Economic Council, and the Mississippi Gaming Commission. He \nwas also a board member of Mississippi College, the Mississippi Ethics \nCommission, and the National Propane Gas Association.\n  Bill was inducted in the Hall of Fame of the University of \nMississippi Alumni Association, which he served as President. He was \nalso a member of the University of Mississippi Foundation. Bill was an \nEagle Scout and a leader in the Chickasaw Council of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica. His dedication to community service was also reflected in his \nleadership of the Indianola Rotary Club and as a major general in the \nMississippi Army National Guard.\n  Bill Gresham was a proud citizen of the United States of America and \na real patriot.\n  In Mississippi, Bill Gresham's name will be associated with the \nhighest standards of leadership and values. Our State is a better place \nto live because of the life of Bill Gresham, and I am glad that I was \nable to call him a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/25/senate-section/article/S795-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:21 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4626.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Risch, Mr. Barrasso, \n        and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 3038. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to prevent the \nenforcement of certain national primary drinking water regulations \nunless sufficient funding is available; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Small System \nDrinking Water Act of 2009. This is the third Congress that I have \nintroduced this bill which would assist water systems throughout the \ncountry comply with the ever growing number of federal drinking water \nstandards. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Mike Crapo, James \nRisch, John Barrasso and David Vitter as cosponsors of this \nlegislation. My bill will require the Federal Government to live up to \nits obligations and require the EPA to use the tools it was given in \nthe 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act amendments, SDWA.\n  My goal here is to ensure that small towns across the country have \nsafe, affordable drinking water and that the laws are fair to small and \nrural communities. Currently EPA assumes that families can afford water \nrates of 2.5 percent of their annual median household income, or $1,000 \nper household. For some families, paying $83 a month for water may not \nbe a hardship but for so many more, it is nearly impossible. There must \nbe some flexibility inserted into the calculation that factors in the \nability of the truly disadvantaged to pay these costs. Forcing systems \nto raise rates beyond what their ratepayers can afford only causes more \ndamage than good.\n  EPA needs to look more closely at how it determines affordability. My \nbill directs EPA to take additional factors into consideration when \nmaking this determination. These include ensuring that the \naffordability criteria are not more costly on a per-capita basis to a \nsmall water system than to a large water system.\n  In EPA's most recent drinking water needs survey, Oklahoma identified \na total of over $4.1 billion in drinking water needs over the next 20 \nyears. $2.4 billion of that need is for community water systems that \nserve fewer than 10,000 people. The $4.1 billion does not include the \ntotal costs imposed on Oklahoma communities to meet federal clean water \nrequirements, the new Groundwater rule, the DBP II rule or the Long \nTerm 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule. Oklahoma continues to \nhave municipalities struggling with the 2002 arsenic rule. Many of our \nsmall systems are having difficulty with the Disinfection Byproducts, \nDBP, Stage I rule, and small systems who purchase water from other \nsystems and did not have to test, treat or monitor their water must now \ncomply with DBP II. EPA estimates that over the next 20 years, the \nentire country will need $52.0 billion to come into compliance with \nexisting, proposed or recently promulgated regulations.\n  My bill proposes a few simple steps to help systems comply with all \nthese rules. First, it reauthorizes the technical assistance program in \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act. The DBP rules are very complex and involve \na lot of monitoring and testing. If we are going to impose complicated \nrequirements on systems, we need to provide them with help to implement \nthose requirements.\n  The bill creates a pilot program to demonstrate new technologies and \napproaches for systems of all sizes to comply with these complicated \nrules. It requires the EPA to convene a working group to examine the \nscience behind the rules in order to compare new developments since \neach rule's publication.\n  Section 1412(b)(4)(E) of the SDWA Amendments of 1996 authorizes the \nuse of point of entry treatment, point of use treatment and package \nplants to economically meet the requirements of the Act. However, to \ndate, these approaches are not widely used by small water systems. My \nlegislation directs the EPA to convene a working group to identify \nbarriers to the use of these approaches. The EPA will then use the \nrecommendations of the working group to draft a model guidance document \nthat states can use to create their own programs.\n  Most importantly this bill requires the federal government to pay for \nthese unfunded mandates created by laws and regulations. In 1995, \nCongress passed the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act to ensure that the \nFederal Government pays the costs incurred by State and local \ngovernments in complying with Federal laws. My bill is designed to \nensure that EPA cannot take an enforcement action against a system \nserving less than 10,000 people, without first ensuring that it has \nsufficient funds to meet the requirements of the regulation.\n  Since the 108th Congress, I have coauthored and cosponsored \nlegislation to provide additional resources to communities through the \nState Revolving Loan Funds. Unfortunately, not much has changed. We \nstill have too many regulations and not enough money to pay for them. \nFunding legislation is important but until that money becomes \navailable, it is unreasonable to penalize and fine local communities \nbecause they cannot afford to pay for regulations we imposed on them. I \nthank my colleagues and look forward to their support of this \ncommonsense proposal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL, of New Mexico (for himself and Mr. Corker):\n  S. 3039. A bill to prevent drunk driving injuries and fatalities, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ROADS \nSAFE Act of 2010. I am pleased to be joined in introducing this \nlegislation by my colleague, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Bob \nCorker.\n  This legislation will encourage the development of new tools to fight \ndrunk driving and has the potential to save 8,000 lives every year.\n  Tragic drunk driving crashes often prompt communities to do more to \nprevent drunk driving. This was the case in my home State of New Mexico \nback in 1992, when a drunk driver killed a mother and her three girls \non Christmas Eve. He was speeding down the highway 90 miles an hour, \ngoing the wrong way down an interstate highway. This crash helped \nchange attitudes in my State. But it should not take a tragedy for us \nto do more to prevent drunk driving.\n  In 2008, drunk driving killed about 12,000 Americans, including 143 \npeople in New Mexico. That is an average of 32 people killed every day \nby drunk driving. This unacceptable death toll is all the more shocking \nwhen you consider that each one of those deaths was preventable.\n  The United States has already made significant progress. Compared to \n20 years ago, our roads are much safer today. Yet even as the overall \nnumber of people killed on our highways has\n\n[[Page S798]]\n\ndeclined, drunk driving still accounts for about one-third of all \ntraffic fatalities.\n  It is even more worrisome that a drunk driver has just a 2-percent \nchance of being caught. In fact, one study found that a first-time \ndrunk driving offender has, on average, driven drunk 87 times before \nbeing arrested. Imagine, 87 times. This is unacceptable. Something must \nbe done to prevent these drivers from getting on the road in the first \nplace.\n  The good news is, there are potential technologies out there that \ncould do that. That is why Senator Corker and I are introducing the \nROADS SAFE Act today. New safety technology has already transformed the \nautomobile and saved countless lives. For example, airbags and antilock \nbrakes are now standard features in many vehicles. These safety devices \nare built into the car and are unobtrusive to the driver. Such \ntechnologies are an important reason we have fewer traffic fatalities \ntoday.\n  Imagine a future with vehicles that could detect whether a driver is \ndrunk when he or she gets behind the wheel--before he or she even \nstarts their vehicle. That would be no drunk driving crashes if it were \nimpossible for drunk drivers to drive. If such technology were widely \ndeployed in cars, an estimated 8,000 lives could be saved every year.\n  I realize many may think this is a farfetched idea. Yet consider that \nvehicles today can already give driving directions, thanks to GPS \nsatellite navigation devices. Some cars can even parallel park \nthemselves. New Mexico and other States require convicted drunk drivers \nto use an ignition interlock, a breathalyzer device they blow into \nbefore their vehicle's engine will start. The success of ignition \ninterlocks for preventing repeat drunk driving offenses suggests a \nbetter technology could be used to prevent all drunk driving.\n  In 2006, Mothers Against Drunk Driving convened an international \ntechnology symposium in Albuquerque, NM. The goal of the meeting was to \nreview efforts to develop advanced ignition interlocks technology.\n  In 2008, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration partnered \nwith leading automakers to explore the feasibility of in-vehicle \ntechnologies to prevent drunk driving. The recent progress of this \ncooperative effort fuels optimism that such technology could be \ndeployed within 5 to 10 years.\n  Clearly, such advanced technologies must win widespread public \nacceptance in order to be effective. They must be moderately priced, \nabsolutely reliable, and unobtrusive to sober drivers.\n  The aim is to stop drunk driving, not discourage responsible social \ndrinking. A recent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety poll found \nthat 64 percent of Americans believe advanced alcohol detection \ntechnology is a good idea and that it is reliable.\n  What would the ROADS SAFE Act do? This legislation would authorize \n$12 million in annual funding for 5 years for the Driver Alcohol \nDetection System for Safety Program, also known as DADSS.\n  DADSS is a public-private partnership between NHTSA and the \nAutomobile Coalition for Traffic Safety. The goal is to explore the \nfeasibility, potential benefits, and public policy challenges \nassociated with using in-\nvehicle technology to prevent drunk driving.\n  This increased Federal funding to combat drunk driving is a smart \ninvestment in public safety. Drunk driving has direct and indirect \neconomic costs in terms of damaged property, medical bills, and lost \nproductivity. In economic terms, drunk driving costs $129 billion per \nyear. Of course, such monetary costs cannot be compared to the value of \nsaving 8,000 lives every year.\n  Several organizations dedicated to fighting drunk driving already \nsupport this bipartisan proposal. Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the \nCentury Council, and the Distilled Spirits Council all support the \nROADS SAFE Act.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to join me, Senator Corker, and these \nimportant organizations in the fight against drunk driving by \nsupporting the ROADS SAFE Act. We have made much progress in our \nefforts to prevent drunk driving, but there is so much more to be done.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Kaufman):\n  S. 3042. A bill to provide for a study by the National Academy of \nSciences on the technical policy decisions and technical personnel at \nthe Federal Communications Commission; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Kaufman, \nto introduce legislation that puts a greater focus on efforts to \nimprove the technical resources and decision-making process at the \nFederal Communications Commission. The bill proposes a study by the \nNational Academy of Sciences on the technical policy decision-making \nprocess and the availability of technical personnel at FCC.\n  Over the past several years, there have been concerns voiced by the \ntechnical community and even Commissioners themselves about the lack of \ntechnical resources and expertise at the Federal Communications \nCommission, FCC. It is for good reason: in 1948, the FCC had 720 \nengineers on staff; today, it has fewer than 300--an astonishing 62 \npercent reduction--even though the FCC now must face technical issues \nconcerning the Internet, advanced wireless communications, and \nbroadband. Also, FCC officials have recently acknowledged a shortage of \nnetwork engineers and that a large number of experienced engineers are \neligible to retire within the next few years.\n  Yet, communications technologies are becoming increasingly complex--\nevolving from the traditional circuit-switched phone networks to \npacket-based dynamic-routing high-bandwidth data networks. The need to \nthoroughly address these issues challenges staff and leads to delays or \neven inaction in technical rulemakings since the Commission doesn't \nhave the appropriate resources for timely technical evaluation and \ndecisionmaking.\n\n  Technical proceedings, including those to authorize new technologies, \nhave been dismally slow--typically taking 2-5 years for approval--\ncreating a bottleneck for innovation and competition.\n  A December 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office, GAO-\n10-10-79, reaffirms these concerns and provides additional evidence of \nthe need for such a study. The GAO concluded that ``weaknesses in FCC's \nprocesses for collecting and using information also raise concerns \nregarding the transparency and informed nature of FCC's decisionmaking \nprocess.'' Furthermore, the report found the ``FCC faces challenges in \nensuring it has the expertise needed to adapt to a changing \nmarketplace.''\n  With the rapid advancement of technologies and innovation within the \ntelecommunications industry, the FCC must be better equipped and more \nagile to address the ever-changing technical landscape from a \nregulatory perspective. If it isn't, our Nation's technical leadership \nin this area will continue to erode and it will be even more difficult \nto lay the proper policy foundation necessary to meet future \ntelecommunications needs.\n  To better examine these significant issues and make tangible \nrecommendations toward a comprehensive solution, this legislation \nproposes a study by the National Academy of Sciences on the technical \npolicy decisionmaking process and the availability of technical \npersonnel at FCC. Specifically, the study would include an examination \nof the FCC's technical policy decisionmaking, current technical \npersonnel staffing levels, and agency recruiting and hiring processes \nof technical staff and engineers, and recommendations to improve these \nareas. The study would provide tangible and specific proposals to \nstreamline processes and rulemakings as well as how the FCC can be more \ncompetitive in hiring the required technical personnel to make it more \neffective. The bill authorizes $1 million over a 2-year period to \nconduct this comprehensive technical study.\n  This bill takes a step towards ensuring the Commission has the \nadequate resources and proper technical decisionmaking processes in \nplace to be a more effective agency. This is absolutely critical given \nhow rapidly technologies are changing and the implications that \nregulation could have on the underlying technical catalysts of \ninnovation. It is also critical to overall reform at the Commission \nbecause in\n\n[[Page S799]]\n\norder to properly regulate communications, the FCC must be deeply \nknowledgeable of both the legal and technical aspects of the issues \nbefore it. That is why I sincerely hope that my colleagues join Senator \nKaufman and me in supporting this important legislation.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor a bill Senator \nSnowe introduced today to conduct a study on the technical policy \ndecision-making process and the availability of technical personnel at \nthe Federal Communications Commission, or FCC.\n  Professionals in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, \nand mathematics have always been our Nation's problem solvers. They \nhelp us solve great challenges in energy, health, security, and \ntransportation. Their innovation creates jobs, jobs that will continue \nto lead us on the path to economic recovery.\n  Still, the number of STEM professionals in some of our government's \nmost critical agencies has been declining. In 1948, the FCC had 720 \nengineers on staff. Today, while communications technologies have \nbecome increasingly complex, it has fewer than 300 engineers. Over the \nyears, there has been a shift in the FCC from hiring engineers to \nhiring professional staff, resulting in a shortage of network \nengineers. What is more, a high proportion of these experienced \nengineers are eligible to retire within the next few years. That means \nthat, as communications technology continues to change the way we \nengage our world, the FCC may face a critical shortage.\n  This legislation proposes a study by the National Academy of Sciences \nto address these issues. Specifically, the study will examine the FCC's \ntechnical policy decisionmaking, including if the FCC has the adequate \nresources, processes, and personnel in place to evaluate properly and \nto account for the technical aspects of the Commission's rulemaking \nprocess. It will also examine the current technical personnel staffing \nlevels and FCC recruiting and hiring processes of technical staff and \nengineers. Finally, the study will provide recommendations to improve \neach of these areas.\n  It is critical that we include engineers in our Nation's technical \npolicy and decision making, at the FCC and across the government. I am \npleased that this study will explore the implications and offer \nrecommendations for the decline of engineers in this important agency \nand I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Senator Snowe's \nefforts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. GILLIBRAND (for herself, Mr. Kaufman, Ms. Snowe, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 3043. A bill to award planning grants and implementation grants to \nState educational agencies to enable the State educational agencies to \ncomplete comprehensive planning to carry out activities designed to \nintegrate engineering education into K-12 instruction and curriculum \nand to provide evaluation grants to measure efficacy of K-12 \nengineering education; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I am pleased to lead a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators today to introduce the Engineering Education for \nInnovation Act, also called the E\\2\\ for Innovation Act. Joining me in \nleading this are Senator Kaufman, Senator Snowe, Senator Murray, \nSenator Cantwell, and Senator Klobuchar. The intent of this legislation \nis to competitively award planning and implementation grants for State \neducational agencies to integrate engineering education into K-12 \ncurriculum and instruction to spark student interest in engineering \nthrough comprehensive K-12 engineering education including hands-on \ndesign and engineering components.\n  The bill increases the availability of K-12 engineering education \ncurriculum and teacher professional development programs, encourages \nbroader participation of girls and underrepresented minorities in K-12 \nengineering education, invests in afterschool engineering education \nprograms, and the legislation also funds the research and evaluation of \nsuch efforts.\n  Our Nation today faces pressing technological challenges in renewable \nenergy, biotechnology, health care technology, material science, and \ninformation technology. According to the National Science Board's 2010 \nScience and Engineering Indicators, only 5 percent of college graduates \nin the United States major in engineering, compared with 12 percent of \nEuropean students, 20 percent of those in Asia and one-third in China. \nIn addition, while women earn 58 percent of all bachelor's degrees, \nthey constitute only 18.5 percent of bachelor's degrees awarded in \nengineering. African Americans hold only 4.6 percent and Hispanics hold \nonly 7.2 percent of bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering.\n  As a woman, I am a strong proponent of programs that support girls \nand underrepresented minorities. Many K-12 students, especially girls \nand students from underrepresented groups or who are economically \ndisadvantaged, and their teachers have little knowledge about the \nengineering design process or the many career possibilities in \nengineering. Today, we continue to have an untapped pool of potential \ntechnical workers, and we must leverage the diversity of these \nindividuals to fuel the innovation necessary for our future global \ncompetitiveness.\n  I am committed to initiatives that enhance student participation in \nSTEM, diversify the STEM pipeline and promote competence and confidence \nto teach engineering for preparing the next generation of our Nation's \nhigh tech workforce for a sustainable and competitive economy. Long \nterm investments in STEM education will pay rich dividends to our \nfuture economy by building capacity to innovate.\n  The introduction of engineering education has the potential to \nimprove student learning and achievement in science and mathematics, \nincrease awareness about what engineers do and of engineering as a \npotential career, and boost students' technological literacy. I want to \nthank all my colleagues for joining together to address the critical \nneeds of our Nation in a bipartisan manner. I look forward to working \ntogether to move this legislation through this Congress.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Engineering \nEducation for Innovation Act, or E-squared for Innovation Act. I am \nproud to cosponsor this bill with Senator Gillibrand, introduced today, \nalong with Senators Snowe, Cantwell, Klobuchar, and Murray. This bill \nwill help us meet the engineering education challenges I have often \nspoken about on the Senate floor by awarding, planning, and \nimplementation grants to States to integrate engineering education into \ntheir K-12 curriculum and instruction. It also funds the research and \nevaluation of all such efforts.\n  I believe we are at a crucial moment for science, technology, \nengineering, and math, or STEM education. Today's engineers have a \ncentral role to play in developing the innovative technologies that \nwill help our economy recover and promote real job growth. In turn, we \nmust promote policies and programs that help to generate greater \ninterest in STEM and actually lead to the production of a greater \nnumber of engineers.\n  Last year, the National Academy of Engineering and National Research \nCouncil released their seminal report on engineering in K-12 education. \nAccording to their report, K-12 engineering education can improve \nstudent learning and performance in science and math and increases \nstudents' technological literacy. It can also increase awareness of the \nengineering profession and boost student interest in pursuing a career \nin the field.\n  The report stressed the need for greater coordination among key \nstakeholders to develop common definitions and grade level appropriate \ngoals for engineering education. It also emphasized the need for more \nresearch on the impacts of engineering education and potential models \nfor implementation. The E-squared for Innovation Act seeks to address \nthese recommendations in three ways.\n  First, the legislation awards planning grants to State educational \nagencies to review any existing engineering education resources in the \nState and to develop implementation plans to integrate K-12 engineering \neducation into curriculum and instruction. Grantees must coordinate \nthese activities with a number of partners, including the Governor's \noffice, institutions of higher education, teachers and administrators\n\n[[Page S800]]\n\nat public elementary and secondary schools, and other relevant players \nin the State.\n  Second, the E-squared for Innovation Act provides implementation \ngrants to State educational agencies to carry out a number of \nactivities, including developing academic standards, curricula, and \nassessments that include engineering; recruiting and training qualified \nteachers to deliver engineering education; and investing in afterschool \nengineering education programs. Priority will be given to applicants \nwho serve a significant percentage of student populations \nunderrepresented in engineering.\n  Third, the bill charges the Institute of Education Sciences with \nconducting research and evaluation on the grants awarded. These studies \nwill determine the effectiveness of the programs and activities at \nimproving student achievement in STEM education and assess how \nsuccessful programs can be replicated.\n  The E-squared for Innovation Act is supported by a diverse list of 77 \norganizations. To name a few, supporters include the National Center \nfor Technological Literacy, the American Society for Engineering \nEducation, the Delaware Foundation for Science and Mathematics \nEducation, IBM, Intel, the University of California, the National \nSociety of Black Engineers, and the American Society of Mechanical \nEngineers--just to name a few. I am truly amazed but genuinely pleased \nat the wide-reaching support for this bill.\n  Norm Augustine, former CEO of Lockheed Martin, expressed strong \nsupport for the E-squared for Innovation Act, adding:\n\n       One of the many reasons our nation does not seem to attract \n     young people into engineering is that many seem to have no \n     idea what an engineer does. Although we attempt to teach math \n     and science in K-12, seldom do we expose students to \n     engineering.\n\n  Many in my home State recognize this problem and, consequently, \nsupport for STEM programs is growing in Delaware. Governor Jack Markell \nrecently launched a STEM education council in Delaware to bring \ntogether teachers, business leaders, curriculum specialists, higher \neducation representatives, and others to focus on innovative STEM \nprograms and curricula that engage young people in Delaware in STEM \neducation. The council will assist in Federal grant applications for \nSTEM-related programs and support effective professional development \nprograms in STEM areas.\n  In STEM-focused schools across Delaware, students are learning how to \nextract DNA from fruit, build robots that can throw balls, perform \nforensic investigations, make ``slime'' and lip balm, and more. It is \nthrough these types of comprehensive, hands-on activities that we will \nget young people interested in tackling and learning STEM subjects and \neventually pursuing engineering jobs. The E-squared for Innovation Act \nis just the kind of program we need to bolster these activities in \nDelaware and ensure more students nationwide have access to these \nexciting engineering opportunities.\n  I cannot stress enough how much I believe this Nation is at a \ncrossroads in STEM education and that this is our opportunity to push \nforward and create an environment that will cultivate and encourage our \nnext generation of engineers. They will foster the research and \ninnovation that will help us solve challenges such as clean drinking \nwater, lifesaving cures for cancer and disease, renewable energy, \naffordable health care, and environmental sustainability.\n  Our country is counting on these future engineers, and the E-squared \nfor Innovation Act is a step in the right direction to support and \nencourage them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/25/senate-section/article/S800-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S800-S801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 422--RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANT PROGRESS MADE BY THE \n   PEOPLE OF UKRAINE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS \n    FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENTIAL RUN-OFF ELECTION ON FEBRUARY 7, 2010\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Kerry) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 422\n\n       Whereas adherence by Ukraine to democratic, transparent, \n     and fair election standards has been necessary for full \n     integration into the democratic community;\n       Whereas steps undertaken by Ukraine in recent years, \n     including reform of election laws and regulations, the \n     development of a pluralistic and independent press, and the \n     establishment of public institutions that respect human \n     rights and the rule of law, have enhanced Ukraine's progress \n     toward democracy and prosperity;\n       Whereas the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (OSCE) concluded that ``most OSCE and Council of \n     Europe commitments were met'' with regard to the conduct of \n     the run-off presidential election on February 7, 2010;\n       Whereas international monitoring groups concluded that \n     prior elections in Ukraine on January 17, 2010, and in 2007, \n     2006, and 2004, were also generally in accordance with \n     international election norms;\n       Whereas the United States has closely supported the people \n     of Ukraine in their efforts to pursue a free and democratic \n     future since the declaration of their independence in 1991;\n       Whereas the NATO Freedom Consolidation Act of 2007 (Public \n     Law 110-17; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), signed into law by \n     President George W. Bush on April 9, 2007, recognized the \n     progress made by Ukraine toward meeting the responsibilities \n     and obligations for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) and designated Ukraine as eligible to \n     receive assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994 \n     (title II of Public Law 103-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note);\n       Whereas Ukraine has made steps toward integration within \n     European institutions through a joint European Union-Ukraine \n     Action Plan, as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy; \n     and\n       Whereas the United States-Ukraine Strategic Partnership \n     Commission was inaugurated by Secretary of State Hillary \n     Clinton and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Petro Poroshenko on \n     December 9, 2009: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the important progress made by the people of \n     Ukraine in establishing democratic institutions and carrying \n     out peaceful elections on January 17 and February 7, 2010;\n       (2) supports ongoing progress by Ukraine in addressing \n     remaining challenges in the electoral processes as identified \n     by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n     and other international election monitoring entities;\n       (3) encourages all parties to respect the independence and \n     territorial sovereignty of Ukraine, as well as the full \n     integration of Ukraine into the international democratic \n     community;\n       (4) pledges further support for the development of a fully \n     free and open democratic system, as well as a transparent \n     free market economy, in Ukraine; and\n       (5) reaffirms its commitment to engage the Government of \n     Ukraine in further development of bilateral cooperation \n     through the United States-Ukraine Strategic Partnership \n     Commission.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the important progress \nmade by the people of Ukraine in the establishment of democratic \ninstitutions following the presidential runoff election on February 7, \n2010. Voters recently elected Viktor Yanukovych as President of Ukraine \nin a process that international monitors declared to have generally \ncomported with international election standards. This represents \nimportant progress towards the consolidation of democratic institutions \nthat the U.S. has worked diligently to foster. Serving as President \nGeorge W. Bush's envoy to the 2004 run-off election that resulted in \nwhat is now widely known as the ``Orange revolution,'' I had the \nopportunity to witness firsthand the great aspirations of the Ukrainian \npeople for a government that responds to their needs. Given Ukraine's \nlocation on the periphery of NATO and the Russian Federation, as well \nas its role as the primary energy conduit to Europe, Ukraine's \npolitical development and external orientation greatly impact European \nsecurity and U.S. policies in the region. A continuing partnership with \nthe people of Ukraine and U.S. technical assistance programs on a range \nof issues, including nuclear security, non-proliferation, energy \nsecurity, institution-building, and others, will serve to advance our \nvital national security interests. This U.S. engagement should also \nsupport ongoing progress by Ukraine in addressing the remaining \nchallenges in the electoral processes as identified by international \nelection monitoring entities.

Mr. President, I rise today, to celebrate a \nremarkable anniversary. This month, Volunteers in Service to America, \nbetter known as VISTA, celebrates the 45th anniversary of its founding. \nI am delighted to have Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi as my \ncosponsor. Public service is a bipartisan issue.\n  Forty-five years of bringing people together, lifting communities up, \nfighting poverty, making America stronger.\n  Forty-five years of fighting illiteracy, improving health services, \nreducing unemployment, increasing housing opportunities, reducing crime \nand recidivism, and expanding access to technology.\n  Forty-five years of leveraging resources and building capacity while \nproviding thousands of Americans the opportunity to devote a year of \nfull-time service living and working in low-income communities to help \neradicate poverty.\n  VISTA did not invent these ideas; America has a long and rich history \nof public service. But when John F. Kennedy became president, these \nenduring values found new life. The person in his new administration \nwho truly pursued that vision with all his might was President \nKennedy's brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver. I will always know him as a \nhero and a friend.\n  He created a legacy of programs that promote social equality and \nhuman dignity--such as Legal Services, Job\n\n[[Page S802]]\n\nCorps, and yes, VISTA. He was also the driving force behind the \ncreation of the Peace Corps, which is how I originally came to know \nhim.\n  When we first met in the early 1960s, I was still studying Chinese \nand interested in Southeast Asia affairs, but my life was quickly \ntransformed after meeting Sargent Shriver.\n  He understood that one way to improve the world was to start with our \nown communities--and that if we unite together with a common mission of \nmaking our communities stronger, we can make the world a better place.\n  That was when I became a VISTA volunteer, shortly after the program \nbegan. I was lucky enough to come to West Virginia--and that was when \nmy life changed forever. I often say that while I was technically born \nin New York, I was really born in West Virginia that year.\n  I truly believe that people are liberated when they get outside of \nthemselves to help others.\n  When I first came to West Virginia, over 40 years ago, much of my \nwork was with children who didn't have great opportunities in life. I \nwas a VISTA member in Emmons, West Virginia, a small, coal mining \ncommunity on the Boone-Kanawha County line.\n  It took me 6 months to finally be accepted by the community. I used \nto sit on the railroad tracks with the kids, throwing rocks and just \ntalking with them. One day, one of the kids invited me into their home; \nthen the others soon followed.\n  I had found what I wanted by working with this community--what my gut \nwas telling me was important. I found out a few other things as well. \nThere was not any organization in the community or a general effort to \nbetter the living conditions of the area.\n  Many of the children didn't even go to school because it was several \nmiles to a paved road and the school board wouldn't send a bus to \nEmmons.\n  So, we fought for a school bus. We built a small library. We built a \npark. We started a baseball team. We didn't win a single game, but that \nwasn't what was important. It was opening up new possibilities for \nthose kids.\n  My experience was just one of thousands. Since 1965, more than \n175,000 Americans of all ages and walks of life have answered VISTA's \ncall. I am proud to count myself as a member of that very special \ngroup.\n  So VISTA's anniversary is also my own. When I look back on VISTA \nbeginnings, I see my own roots--the foundation on which I have built \nthe rest of my life.\n  I got into politics shortly thereafter. I knew I could not be a VISTA \nforever, so I ran for the House of Delegates, knowing that was the way \nI could continue to make change.\n  I knew there were a thousand Emmons all across Appalachia. But \neverything that I have done in my career in public office has been \ngrounded in the VISTA experience and in those kids and families who \ntaught me so much about life.\n  Today, VISTA, which became part of AmeriCorps in 1993, continues to \nengage more than 7,000 members in helping more than 1,000 local \norganizations build sustainable anti-poverty programs every year.\n  So to them--to VISTA's members, past and present--to its numerous \ndevoted host organizations and communities which give as much to the \nprogram as they receive--to my friend and mentor Sargent Shriver--to \neveryone who carries on VISTA's noble work every day--congratulations \nand thank you.\n  Now, watch out. We have only just begun: In these times of enormous \neconomic uncertainty and challenge, our nation needs VISTA's, courage, \ncommitment and service more than ever. Your impact is real. I know \nwithout a doubt, from the bottom my heart that for years to come, VISTA \nmembers will continue to transform our communities and our nation--for \nthe better.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, in submitting a resolution \nto celebrate the 45th anniversary of the Volunteers in Service to \nAmerica, or VISTA, program.\n  President Kennedy suggested in 1963 a program of national service \nthat would provide assistance to those in need in urban and rural \nareas. Less than 2 years later, President Johnson launched the ``War on \nPoverty,'' and included the VISTA program created by the Economic \nOpportunity Act of 1964.\n  Incorporated into the AmeriCorps network of programs in 1993, VISTA \nhas been hard at work in the fight against poverty for 45 years. Today, \nthe VISTA program is stronger than ever, placing 6,500 full-time \nvolunteers at 1,200 nonprofit organizations and public agencies each \nyear. These volunteers are committed to serving the needs of the \npoorest Americans at numerous program sites, and they are to be \ncommended for their unselfish contributions to helping others.\n  I am proud to say that there are 87 VISTA volunteers at 21 program \nsites in my home State of Mississippi. I understand the sacrifices that \nare being made by these young men and women and the important impact \nthat these volunteers have made in our communities.\n  I am pleased to congratulate VISTA on 45 years of distinguished \nservice to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/25/senate-section/article/S802-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S802-S803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 50--RECOGNIZING THE HISTORIC FOUNDING OF \n THE BLACK STUNTMEN'S ASSOCIATION AND THE COALITION OF BLACK STUNTMEN \n                               AND WOMEN\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Burris, Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. Feinstein) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge a group that has \ncreated opportunities for countless African American men and women in \nthe film and television industry. I rise to submit this Senate \nConcurrent Resolution honoring the Black Stuntmen's Association and the \nCoalition of Black Stuntmen and Women for their efforts to not only \nintegrate, but enhance the television and film industry. This is a \ncompanion resolution identical to H. Con. Res. 190 submitted by my good \nfriend, Congresswoman Shelley Berkley.\n  I take great pride in submitting this resolution not only because \nthese individuals knocked down the walls of racial discrimination, but \nalso because many of these pioneers now reside in my home State of \nNevada.\n\n[[Page S803]]\n\n  In the 1950s and 1960s few African Americans had roles in television \nor film and rarely were given the opportunity to work as stuntmen and \nwomen. Most often, the few opportunities available to individuals \nwilling to engage the dangerous work as stuntmen were taken by whites, \nwho donned dark make-up to look like the black actors they were \nportraying.\n  To overcome the barrier of racism and many other obstacles to the \nentertainment industry, in 1967 a group of courageous men and women \nformed the Black Stuntmen's Association. Even though many had to work \nother jobs, they took it upon themselves to train each other, often \nmeeting three to four nights a week for several hours. They trained in \nparks, on beaches and just about anywhere they could set up equipment \nto practice tumbles and flips. They eventually progressed to \ndisciplined training in automotives and driving techniques for cars and \nmotorcycles.\n  These individuals are pioneers and would later work with the \nCoalition of Black Stuntmen and Women to fight racism in the \nentertainment industry. Their collective efforts have created \nopportunities for many that once never existed.\n\n       Eddie Smith; Earnie Robinson; Alex Brown; S.J.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \nnature this evening. I thank all of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. I think we have had a nice discussion. I think we all know \nthis is not about any of our lack of desire to make sure that these \nbenefits are extended. I think everybody here knows this. It has been \nnice listening to some of the comments.\n  Therefore, since it was out of order before, I would like to ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 4891, that the amendment at the desk which offers \na full offset be agreed to, that the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand this issue will be dealt with. Every American that is looking for \nthe benefits we have discussed will have those forthcoming.\n  Mr. President, I ask that that be approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I believe the Senator from \nTennessee said 4891. I think the bill was 4691.\n  Mr. CORKER. H.R. 4691.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would not mind repeating his unanimous \nconsent, I didn't quite hear the end of it.\n  Mr. CORKER. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 4691 which I understand to be the \nmeasure that is before us, that the amendment at the desk, which I \nunderstand offers a full offset to pay for this, be agreed to, the \nbill, as amended, be read for a third time and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/25/senate-section/article/S816-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             OFFSETTING THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, it has been a long night. It is called an \nambush. That is what happened. The consent that I was assured of was \ngoing to be that the Senator from Illinois offer the same--I am going \nto get it right--30-day extension without an offset. He was going to \noffer it, and I was going to have a chance to object. We weren't going \nto stand around for 3\\1/2\\ hours debating the issue. That is the \nunderstanding I had with the leader of the Democrats.\n  Now, I don't know what I have for tomorrow. I have been assured that \nthe Senator from Illinois will offer the same amendment tomorrow \nmorning, and I will have a chance to object, if I so choose. But I want \nto assure the people who have watched this thing until a quarter of 12, \nI have missed the Kentucky-South Carolina game that started at 9 \no'clock. It is the only redeeming chance we had to beat South Carolina, \nsince they are the only team that has beat Kentucky this year. All of \nthese things that we have talked about and all the provisions that have \nbeen discussed, the unemployment benefits, all these things, if we had \ntaken a longer version of the jobs bill that was mutually agreed on, a \nbipartisan bill that Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley agreed on, \nthat the Senator from Nevada, the leader withdrew his support from and \nbrought his own narrowly scoped bill to the floor, $10 billion was not \npaid for, $5 billion was--so we have $10 billion immediately after we \npassed pay-go last week, so we have a $10 billion bill we talked about \nearly on that just passed and now we have an extension--by the way, the \nBaucus-Grassley bill was totally and completely--it is debatable, \naccording to the Senator from Illinois, but it was paid for--CBO said \nit was paid for, but at least that is what Joint Tax said, too, because \nI happen to be on the same committee with those two gentlemen--we would \nnot have spent 3 hours-plus--almost 3\\1/2\\--telling everybody in the \nUnited States of America that Senator Bunning does not give a damn \nabout the people who are on unemployment; the doctors whom I represent \nthat I did not want to extend SGR; all of the other things--COBRA, \nflood insurance, small business loans, and small business provisions.\n\n  I feel sorry for the people in Kentucky who live in east Kentucky who \nmay lose their Satellite Home Viewer Act for a day or two because they \nwill miss all those Senate commercials that are going on. I know how \nthey desperately want to watch those, but if they do not have cable, \nthey will not be able to do it.\n  But this debate could have been completely changed had not the other \nside rammed through a bill, a partisan bill, over a bipartisan bill. \nYou cannot preach bipartisanism and practice partisanship. I do not \ngive a darn how good you are at conning people, people see through it. \nIf you think I am kidding, go into your State and ask. The American \npeople understand what is going on up here. That is why the Congress \nand the Senate have a 30-percent approval rating. Even the President of \nthe United States is higher than that, and his is not good because it \nis below 50 percent.\n  But I have served in this body and over in the House--I have not had \nas long; I have had 2 years shorter than the House service of the \nSenator from Illinois and 2 years shorter than the Senator's Senate \nservice; so I have spent 12 and 12, 12 years here and 12 in the House--\nand we are not conning the people in the United States about anything. \nThey know what is going on. That is why they are madder than heck. They \nare tired of Senators who talk out of both sides of their mouths. They \nare tired of people who have been appointed to positions who come \nbefore the Congressional committees and do not speak the truth. If you \nthink the Tea Party people are crazy, get them involved in your Senate \nrace or get them against you when you are running.\n  Remember now, this all could have been changed had not the leader of \nthe Senate decided that a bipartisan compromise jobs bill was not as \nimportant as his partisan jobs bill that just passed right before all \nthis debate.\n  I just want to tell the people who have watched--and I doubt if there \nare many right now--that I am as interested in all those things I have \nobjected to because of no offsets as the people who have spoken on the \nother side of the aisle or my good friend from Tennessee or my good \nfriend from Alabama.\n  This body should be and can be better than it has been. In my 24 \nyears of service, I have never seen the Congress of the United States \nperform as badly as we are performing presently. And it shows up. \nBipartisanship means input from both sides--not talking about it, doing \nit. That is the whole difference in what we have had here tonight. We \ndid not even have to have this debate. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/25/senate-section/article/S816-4", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
