Mr. President, I made a decision at the beginning of this \nCongress to go back to the way the Senate used to be, or at least the \nway I saw the Senate. I believed if we moved away from the past \npractices of the last 15 years of limiting the offering of amendments, \nfor example, having more debate, not less, that a new spirit would \ndevelop in this historic body we call the Senate.\n  I believe that spirit has come--come slowly--but with the trust of \nthe Republicans growing with the majority, amendments have come with \nthe idea of improving or changing legislation, not the ``I gotcha'' \npolitics, tactics of the past used by both Democrats and Republicans. \nThe result has been legislation being passed of which we can all take \ncredit:\n  The lands bill; Ledbetter, equal pay for men and women; the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, 14 million kids with health \ninsurance; the economic recovery package, which is being felt now \naround the country; the omnibus spending bill, which was long overdue; \nnational service legislation, allowing 750,000 men and women to become \ninvolved in public service, getting paid a little bit for that but help \nfor their college education.\n  We did some things that needed to be done with the budget, reducing \nthe deficit in 5 years by as much as two-thirds. We passed housing \nlegislation, which will bolster the ability of regulators to do a good \njob of watching what goes on with housing, including\n\n[[Page S5650]]\n\nstrengthening the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; passing the \nfinancial fraud legislation to stop some of the tactics cheaters use to \ncause the problems that were caused leading to this economic crisis. \nYesterday morning, we passed the credit card legislation.\n  We have a long ways to go. But I think we are beginning to trust each \nother that amendments are being offered to take provisions out of \nlegislation or to add to legislation to improve it in the mind of the \nperson offering the amendment.\n  As a result of this, we can all go back to our constituencies during \nthis recess saying we are working together now, we are getting some \nthings done. This does not help Democrats or Republicans; it helps us \nboth, and it helps our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/20/senate-section/article/S5650-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there now appears to be a wide \nbipartisan agreement in the Senate that closing Guantanamo before the \nadministration has a plan to deal with the detainees there was a bad \nidea. Senators will make it official today with their votes.\n  For months, we have been saying what Senate Democrats now \nacknowledge: that because the administration has no plan for what to do \nwith the 240 detainees at Guantanamo, it would be irresponsible and \ndangerous for the Senate to appropriate the money to close it.\n  I commend Senate Democrats for fulfilling their oversight \nresponsibilities by refusing to vote to provide any funding to close \nGuantanamo until the administration can prove to the American people \nthat closing Guantanamo will not make us less safe than Guantanamo has. \nThose of us in Congress have a responsibility to American service men \nand women, risking their lives abroad, and to citizens here at home. \nCongress will demonstrate its seriousness about that responsibility \nwhen it votes against an open-ended plan to release or transfer \ndetainees at Guantanamo.\n\n  The administration has shown a good deal of flexibility on matters of \nnational security over the past few months: on Iraq, for example, in \nnot insisting on an arbitrary deadline for withdrawal; on military \ncommissions, by deciding to resume their use; on prisoner photos, by \nconcluding that releasing them would jeopardize the safety of our \nservice men and women; and on Afghanistan, by replicating the surge \nstrategy that has worked so well in Iraq.\n  I hope the administration will show more of this flexibility by \nchanging its position on an arbitrary deadline for closing Guantanamo. \nAmericans do not want some of the most dangerous men alive coming here \nor released overseas, where they can return to the fight, as many other \ndetainees who have been released from Guantanamo already have.\n  Some will argue that terrorists can be housed safely in the United \nStates based on past experience. But we have already seen the \ndisruption that just one terrorist caused in Alexandria, VA. The number \nof detainees the administration now wants to transfer stateside is an \norder of magnitude greater than anything we have considered before. It \nis one thing to transfer one or two terrorists--disruptive as that may \nbe--it is quite another to transfer 50 to 100, or more, as Secretary \nGates has said would be involved in any transfer from Guantanamo.\n  In my view, these men are exactly where they belong: locked up in a \nsafe and secure prison and isolated many miles away from the American \npeople. Guantanamo is a secure, state-of-the-art facility, it has \ncourtrooms for military commissions. Everyone who visits is impressed \nwith it. Even the administration acknowledges that Guantanamo is humane \nand well run. Americans want these men kept out of their backyards and \noff the battlefield. Guantanamo guarantees it.\n  The administration has said the safety of the American people is its \ntop priority. I have no doubt this is true, and that is precisely why \nthe administration should rethink--should rethink--its plan to close \nGuantanamo by a date certain. It should have focused on a plan for \nthese terrorists first. Once the administration has a plan, we will \nconsider closing Guantanamo but not a second sooner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/20/senate-section/article/S5650-4", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RONALD REAGAN CENTENNIAL COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  No. 1, I would like to associate myself with the comments of the \nminority leader about Guantanamo Bay. It is a location that does \nprotect our national interests in terms of a location. It is probably \nthe best run military prison in the world. I have been there several \ntimes.\n  To the guard force and those who are serving at Guantanamo Bay, in \nmany ways, you are the unsung heroes in this war because it is tough \nduty. You have to go through a lot to be a member of the Guantanamo Bay \nguard team.\n  They do a wonderful job. It is a very Geneva Conventions-compliant \njail, and there are some pretty bad characters down there who make life \nmiserable for our guard force. But those who serve at Guantanamo Bay do \nso with dignity and professionalism. Their motto, I believe, is ``honor \nbound.'' That certainly reflects upon them well.\n\n  The idea of the Congress saying we want to plan before we appropriate \nmoney to close Guantanamo Bay makes a lot of sense to me. We see a \nbipartisan movement here to make sure we know what we are going to do \nwith the detainees who are housed at Guantanamo Bay. The American \npeople should be rightly concerned about how we dispose of these \nprisoners. Quite frankly, they are not common criminals accused of \nrobbing a liquor store; they are accused of being a member of al-Qaida \nor allied groups that have taken up arms against the United States. \nTheir mission and their purpose is to destroy our way of life and to \nput our allies and friends in the Mideast into the dark ages. So if you \ndo not want to go back to the dark ages in terms of humanity; if you \nwant young girls to grow up without having acid thrown in their face; \nif you want a young woman to be able to have a say about the future of \nher children in the Mideast, then we need to come up with a rational \npolicy regarding fighting al-Qaida and, once we catch them, how to \ndispose of their cases and make sure they are not only fairly treated \nbut their mission and their goals are defeated and they do not return \nto the fight.\n  We have seen in Iraq that there are Muslim populations that do not \nwant to be part of the al-Qaida agenda. Al-Qaida followed us to Iraq \nbecause they understood if we were successful there in creating a \ndemocracy in the heart of the Mideast, it would be a threat to their \nagenda. Iraq has a way to go, but I am very proud of the Iraqi people. \nThey have come together. They are making political reconciliations. \nTheir army and police forces are getting stronger. The story of the \nsurge is that the Iraqi people joined with our forces and coalition \nforces and delivered a mighty blow against al-Qaida. Al-Qaida is, quite \nfrankly, in the process of being defeated by the Iraqi people with our \nhelp. Now the fight goes to Pakistan and Afghanistan. I cannot think of \na more noble cause than to take up arms and fight back against these \nterrorists who wish the world ill, who will do anything in the name of \ntheir religion to have their way, and who would make life miserable for \nparts of this world and eventually make life miserable for us.\n  Imagine a caliphate being established in Baghdad, which was their \nplan, to put the Mideast in constant turmoil. We would not be able to \ntravel freely in this world. We could not interact or do business with \nthe people in the Mideast. It is a very oil-rich region, so it is in \nour national security interests to stand with moderate people in the \nMideast and other places where al-Qaida attempts to take over, and \nfight back. But when we fight back, we don't have to be like them. \nQuite frankly, if we are like them when we fight back, we will lose.\n  This is an ideological struggle. There is no capital to conquer. \nThere is no navy to sink or air force to shoot down. We cannot kill \nenough of the terrorists to win the war. What we have to do is contain \nthem, fight them, and empower those who live in the region who want to \nlive in a different way, give them the capacity to defend themselves \nand bring about a stable life in their countries. That is what we are \ntrying to do in Iraq. If we win in Iraq, we will have a democracy in \nthe heart of the Arab world that will be an ally to this country in \nperpetuity. We will have replaced a dictator named Saddam Hussein, and \nwe will have a place where we can show the world that there are Muslims \nwho do not want to be governed by the al-Qaida agenda, and to me that \nis a major win in the war on terror. Now we are in Afghanistan. We have \nlost ground, but we are about to recapture that ground from the \nTaliban, which are al-Qaida sympathizers and, quite frankly, allowed \nthem to operate in Afghanistan late in the last century and early in \nthis century to plan the attacks of 9/11.\n  So that is why we are fighting. That is why we are in this \ndiscussion. That is why we are concerned about releasing these \nprisoners within the United States, and that is why we are concerned \nabout Guantanamo Bay. We have every right and reason to be concerned as \nto how we move forward.\n  I want to move forward. We need a plan to move forward. We should not \nclose Guantanamo Bay until we have a comprehensive, detailed, legal \nstrategy as to what we will do with these prisoners. Where we put them \nis only possible if people know what we will do with them. So we have \nto explain to the American people and our allies the disposition plan. \nWhat are we going to do with these detainees? Then where you put them \nbecomes possible. Without what to do, we are never going to find where \nto put them.\n  I do believe the President and our military commanders are right when \nthey say it is time to start over. It is a shame we are having to start \nover, because Guantanamo Bay is a well-run jail. But as I mentioned \nbefore, this ideological struggle we are engaged in, the enemy has \nseized upon the abuses at Abu Ghraib, the mistakes at Guantanamo Bay, \nand they use that to our detriment. They inflame populations in the \nMideast based on our past mistakes. Our commanders have told me to a \nperson that if we could start over with detention policy and show the \nworld that we have a new way of doing business--a better way of doing \nbusiness--it would improve the ability of our troops to operate in the \nregions in question where the conflict exists; it would undercut the \nenemy; it would help our allies be more helpful to us. Our British \nfriends are the best friends we could hope to have, and they have had a \nhard time with our detainee policy. So we have every reason in the \nworld to want to start over, but the Congress is right not to allow us \nto start over until we have a plan. The Congress, in a bipartisan \nfashion, is absolutely right to keep Guantanamo Bay open until we have \na complete plan. I do believe this President understands how to move \nforward with Guantanamo Bay.\n  The best way to move forward, in my opinion, is to collaborate with \nthe Congress, to look at the military commission system, which I think \nis the proper venue to dispose of any war crimes trials. Remember, \nthese people we are talking about have been accused of taking up arms \nagainst the United States. They are noncitizen, enemy combatants who \nrepresent a military threat. Military commissions have been used to try \npeople such as this for hundreds of years. We did trials with German \nsaboteurs who landed on the east coast of the United States for the \npurpose of sabotaging our industries. They were captured and tried in \nmilitary commissions. So there is nothing new about the idea of a \nmilitary commission being used against an enemy force.\n  I do think the President is right to reform the current commission. \nI, along with Senator McCain, Senator Warner, and others--Senator Levin \nparticularly--had a bill that set up a military commission process that \nreceived complete Democratic support on the Armed Services Committee, \nand four Republicans. I think that document is worth going back to. The \nideas the President has put on the table about reforming the \ncommission, quite frankly, make a lot of sense to me.\n  So we do need to move forward. We do need to start over. If we could \nstart over with a new detention policy that is comprehensive, it would \nhelp our war effort, it would help operations in the countries in \nquestion and in the\n\n[[Page S5652]]\n\nMideast at large, and it would repair damage with our allies. Quite \nfrankly, we have lost a lot of court decisions. It would give us a \nbetter chance to win in court.\n  What do I mean by starting over? Come up with a disposition plan that \nunderstands that the detainees at Guantanamo Bay represent a military \nthreat and apply the law of armed conflict in their cases. That means \nwe have to treat them humanely. The Geneva Conventions now apply to \ndetainees under Common Article 3 held at Guantanamo Bay based on a 2006 \nSupreme Court decision. We are bound by that convention because we are \nthe leader of the convention. We have signed up to the convention. As a \nmilitary lawyer for 25 years, I hold the Geneva Conventions near and \ndear to my heart, as every military member does, because it will \nprovide protections to our troops in future wars. Yes, I know al-Qaida \nwill not abide by the conventions but, quite frankly, that is no excuse \nfor us to abandon what we believe in. When you capture an enemy \nprisoner, it becomes about you, not them. They don't deserve much, but \nwe have to be Americans to win this war. There are plenty people in \nthis world who would cut your head off without a trial. I want to show \nthe world a better way. How we dispose of these prisoners can help us \nin the overall ideological struggle.\n\n  What I am proposing is that we come up with a comprehensive plan that \nwill reform the military commissions and that the President come back \nto the Congress and we have another shot at the commissions to make \nthem more due process friendly but we realize that the people we are \ntrying are accused of war crimes and we apply the law of armed \nconflict.\n  I have been a military lawyer, as I said, for 25 years. The judges \nand the jurors and the lawyers who administer justice in a military \ncommission setting are the same people who administer justice to our \nown troops. It is a great legal forum. You have rights in the military \nlegal system. You get free legal counsel. Usually cost is not an \nobject. The men and women who wear the uniform who serve as judge \nadvocates take a lot of pride in their job. They are great Americans. \nThey are great officers. They believe in justice. We have seen \nverdicts, and the few verdicts we have had at Guantanamo Bay indicate \nthat our juries are rational. Our military jurors do hold the \nprosecution to the standards of proof and they balance the interests of \nall parties. As I say, I have never been more impressed with the legal \nsystem than within our military justice system. Military commissions \nneed to be as much like a court-martial as possible, but practicality \ndictates some differences.\n  The one thing this body needs to understand is that it is illegal \nunder the Geneva Conventions to try an enemy prisoner in civilian \ncourt. Why is that? You are afraid that civilian justice, jurors and \njudges, will have revenge on their mind. They are not covered by the \nGeneva Conventions. Participants in a military commission are covered \nby the convention--every lawyer, every judge, every juror. They have an \nobligation to hold to the tenets of the convention and any misconduct \non their part in a trial could actually result in prosecution to them \nor disciplinary action, and that would not be true in the legal world. \nSo having these trials in a military commission setting is the proper \nvenue because they are accused of war crimes. Having the trials in \nmilitary commissions is consistent with the Geneva Conventions. It is a \nworld-class justice system. Quite frankly, it is the best place to \nbalance our national security interests.\n  But to the hard part. We can do that. We can reform the commissions. \nSome of these detainees can be repatriated back to third countries in a \nway I think is rational and will not hurt our national security \ninterests. But there is going to be a group of detainees--maybe half or \nmore--where the evidence is sound and certain that they are a member of \nal-Qaida, but it is not of the type that you would want to go to a \ncriminal trial with. It may have third country intelligence service \ninformation where the third country would not participate in a criminal \ntrial because it would compromise their operations. Some type of \nevidence would be such that you would not disclose it in a criminal \ntrial because it would compromise national security. You have to \nremember, when you try someone criminally, you have to prove the case \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. You have to share the evidence with the \ndefendant. You have to go through the rigors of a criminal prosecution. \nUnder a military commission people are presumed innocent, and that is \nthe way it should be. But I want America to understand that we are not \ncharging everyone as a war criminal; we are making the accusation that \nyou are a member of al-Qaida. In military law what you have to do if \nyou are accusing someone of being part of the enemy force is prove by a \npreponderance of the evidence that you are, in fact, a part of the \nenemy force.\n  So what I would propose is to set up a hybrid system. For every \ndetainee once determined to be an enemy combatant by our military or \nCIA, there will be a process to do that, a combat status review \ntribunal, and we need to improve that process--but you run each \ndetainee through that process and if the military labels them as an \nunlawful enemy combatant, a member of al-Qaida, then we will do \nsomething we have never done in any other war, and that is allow that \ndetainee to go into Federal court.\n  Under article 5 of the Geneva Conventions, status decisions are made \nby the military, not by civilian judges. It is usually done by an \nindependent member of the military in an administrative setting. These \nare administrative hearings. But this war is different. There will \nnever be an end to this war. We will never have a signing on the \nMissouri as we did in World War II. I realize that. An enemy combatant \ndetermination could be a de facto life sentence. So I am willing to \nbuild in more due process to accommodate the nature of this war.\n  What I have proposed is that every detainee determined to be an enemy \ncombatant by our military would go to a group of military judges with \nuniform standards where the Government would have to prove to an \nindependent judiciary by a preponderance of the evidence that the \nperson is, in fact, an enemy combatant, and if our civilian judges who \nare trained in reviewing evidence agree with the military, that person \ncan be kept off the battlefield as long as there is a military threat. \nAbout 12 percent of the detainees released from Guantanamo Bay have \ngone back to the fight. The No. 2 al-Qaida operative in Somalia is a \nformer Gitmo detainee. It is true we put people in Gitmo, in my \nopinion, where the net was cast too large and they were not properly \nidentified. You are going to make mistakes. What I want to do is have a \nprocess that our Nation can be proud of: transparent, robust due \nprocess, an independent judiciary checking and balancing the military, \nbut never losing sight that the goal is to make sure that the \ndetermination of enemy combatant is well founded and, if it is, not to \nrelease people back to the fight knowing they are going to go back and \nkill Americans. That doesn't make us a better nation, to have a process \nwhere you have to let people go when the evidence is sound and clear \nthey are going to go back to the fight. That does not make us a better \npeople. You do not have to do that under the law of armed conflict. \nLet's come up with a new system that will give every detainee a full \nand fair hearing in Federal court. If they are tried for war crimes, \nput them in a new military commission, and every verdict would be \nappealed to civilian judges. Let the trials be transparent. Balance \nnational security against due process. But never lose sight of the fact \nthat we are dealing with people who have taken up arms against the \nUnited States. Some of them are so radical and their hearts have been \nhardened so much, they are so hate-filled, it would be a disaster to \nthis country and the world at large to let them go in the condition \nthat exists today.\n\n  Where to put them. Mr. President, 400,000 German and Japanese \nprisoners were housed in the United States during World War II, and 15 \nto 20 percent, according to the historical record, were hardened Nazis. \nA hardened Nazi is at the top of the pecking order when it comes to \nmass murder. The idea that we cannot find a place to securely house \n250-plus detainees within the United States is not rational. We have \ndone this before. They are not 10 feet tall.\n\n[[Page S5653]]\n\n  It is my belief that you need a plan before you close Gitmo, and when \nyou look at a new facility, it needs to be run by the military because \nunder the Geneva Conventions you cannot house enemy prisoners in \ncivilian jails.\n  I look forward to working with the President of the United States to \nstart over, but we need a plan to start over--a plan to try these \npeople, consistent with the law of armed conflict, in a military \ncommission that is reformed, that will administer justice fairly and \nbalanced and will realize that these people present a military threat. \nWe need a system to allow for keeping the detainees off of the \nbattlefield--who are committed jihadists--that will allow them to have \ntheir day in court with an independent judiciary but also will allow a \nprocess that will keep them off the battlefield as long as they are \ndangerous. If the judges agree with the military on the enemy \ncombatant, you should have an annual review process to determine \nwhether they present a military threat. No one should be held without a \npathway forward, but no one should be released because you think this \nis a crime we are dealing with.\n  If you criminalize this war and do not use the law of armed conflict, \nyou are going to make a huge mistake. There are countries that have \nterror suspects in jail right now that are about to have to release \nthem because under criminal law you cannot hold them indefinitely. \nUnder military law, you can hold the enemy force off the battlefield if \nthey are properly identified as part of that force, as part of the \nmilitary threat. That has been the law for hundreds of years, and it \nought to be the law we apply. Where we put them is important, but what \nwe do with them is more important, how we try them and detain them.\n  We have a chance to show the world that there is a better way, a \nchance to showcase our values. Yes, give them lawyers and put the \nevidence against them under scrutiny. Put burdens on ourselves, make us \nprove the case--not just say it is so, prove it in a court that is \nappropriate for the venue we are talking about, appropriate for the \ndecisions we are about to make. Put that burden on us, and treat them \nhumanely because that is the way we are. That may not be the way they \nare, but that is the way we are. That makes us better than they. The \nfact that we will do all these things and they won't is a strength of \nthis Nation, not a weakness. Some people in the past have lost sight of \nthat. The fact that we give them lawyers and a trial based on the \nevidence, not prejudice and passion, makes us stronger.\n  We will find a better way to do what we have been doing in the past. \nWe will find a way to close Gitmo, and we will come up with a new plan \nbecause we are Americans and we are committed to our value system and \ncommitted to beating this enemy.\n  I look forward to working with the Members of this body to come up \nwith a comprehensive disposition plan that will find a new way to try \nthese people, a new process to hold them off the battlefield, and \nalways operating within our values, which will allow our commanders the \nchance to start over in the region. Every military commander I have \ntalked to said it would be beneficial to this country to start over \nwith detainee policy. They also understand that we are at war and we \nneed to have a national security system.\n  As to where we put them, there were six prison camps in South \nCarolina during World War II. There is a brig near the city of \nCharleston, a naval brig. It is not the location, because it is near a \npopulation center. The place I have in mind is an isolated part of the \nUnited States--if necessary--that will be run by the military, with a \nsecure perimeter, that will be operating within the Geneva Conventions \nrequirement, that will have a justice system attached to it, that will \nbe transparent and open where we can administer justice and reattach \nour Nation to the values we hold so dear.\n  Part of war is capturing prisoners. That is part of war. We know what \nthe other side does when they capture a prisoner. Let the world know \nthat America has a better way, a way that will not only make us safe \nbut help us win this war.\n  In conclusion, the goal of this effort to start over is to undermine \nthe enemy's propaganda that has been used against us because of our \npast mistakes, allow our allies to come join us in a new way forward, \nand protect us against a vicious enemy that needs to be held off the \nbattlefield, maybe forever. Some of these people are literally going to \ndie in jail, and that is OK with me because I think the evidence \nsuggests that if we ever let them out, they would go back to killing \nAmericans, our friends, and our allies. I will not shed a tear. The way \nto avoid getting killed or going to jail forever is, not to join al-\nQaida. If you have made that decision to do so, let it be said that \nthis Nation is going to stand up to you and fight back, within our \nvalue system. Some of these people will never see the light of day, and \nthat is the right decision. Some of them can be released.\n  Let's have a process that understands what we are trying to do as a \nnation. Make sure it is national security oriented, make sure it is \nwithin our value system but also that everything we do is as a result \nof a nation that has been attacked by these people. They have not \nrobbed a liquor store; they have tried to destroy our way of life. The \nlegal system I am proposing recognizes that distinction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the \nInouye-Inhofe amendment and suggest to my colleagues that this should \nnot be a controversial amendment. In fact, I commend my colleagues on \nthe Democratic side for recognizing the futility of trying to put \nfunding in the bill that we are debating here without having a plan \nwith which to close Guantanamo Bay.\n  It seems to me, at least, that a lot have gotten up and argued that \nhaving Guantanamo Bay open as a detention facility makes our country \nless safe. I argue the contrary. That didn't exist prior to 9/11, and \nwe were attacked anyway. The people who want to attack us don't need an \nexcuse; they are going to attack us anyway. They are going to attack us \nbecause they hate us and they hate our way of life and the things we \nstand for and because that is what they do. They have hate in their \nhearts. I believe we need to have a place where we can detain people \nlike that. It seems to me at least that the Guantanamo Bay facility \nfits perfectly within the definition of what makes sense. It is a \nstate-of-the-art facility, a $200 million facility. Nobody has ever \nescaped from it. It is a very secure facility. It is hundreds of miles \naway from American communities.\n  One thing I point out to my colleagues is that we have already \nexpressed our view here in the Senate about whether these detainees \nought to be transferred somewhere here into American society and into \nfacilities in American communities and neighborhoods. In July of 2007, \nwe took a vote in the Senate, and by a vote of 94 to 3, the Senators \nvoted in favor of a resolution that would prevent these detainees from \ncoming here--being released into American society or transferred into \nfacilities in American communities and neighborhoods. Those in favor of \nthat resolution at the time included both the current Vice President of \nthe United States and the current Secretary of State.\n\n  My hope would be that this amendment offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma and the Senator from Hawaii will receive that same measure of \nsupport that was accorded to the amendment adopted in the Senate in \nJuly of 2007 by a vote of 94 to 3. This amendment should receive that \nsame measure of support.\n  As I noted last week in a speech on the floor, President Obama told \nus, when he issued his January 22 Executive order to close Guantanamo, \nthat he would work with Congress on any legislation that might be \nappropriate. Instead of consulting Congress, the President asked for \n$80 million to close Guantanamo, with no justification or indication of \nany plan.\n  I believe any plan to close Guantanamo that includes bringing these \nterrorists into the United States is a mistake. We don't want the \nkillers who are held there to be brought here into our communities.\n  It is deeply troubling that not only does the Obama administration \nwish to hold open the possibility that some detainees might be \ntransferred to facilities in American communities, it is\n\n[[Page S5654]]\n\neven considering freeing some of them into American society. These are \nthe 17 Chinese Uighers whose Combat Status Review Tribunal records were \ndeemed insufficient to support the conclusion that they are enemy \ncombatants but who cannot be returned to China because of fear that the \nChinese Government will torture or kill them.\n  At a press conference on March 26, ADM Dennis Blair, the Director of \nNational Intelligence, said this:\n\n       If we are to release them [the Uighers] in the United \n     States, we need some sort of assistance for them to start a \n     new life.\n\n  It is hard to believe that this administration is seriously \nconsidering freeing these men inside the United States and, most \noutrageous of all, paying them to live freely within American \ncommunities and neighborhoods. The American people don't want these men \nwalking the streets of America's neighborhoods.\n  The American people don't want these detainees held in a military \nbase or a Federal prison in their backyard either. These are not common \ncriminals; these are hardened killers bent on the destruction of the \nUnited States. They are resourceful, these people are innovative, and \nthey understand the strategic vulnerabilities of the United States and \nhow to exploit those very vulnerabilities. Who would have predicted \nthat this group of people would basically be able to steal a fleet of \nplanes and cause death and destruction on the scale and magnitude of \nPearl Harbor? It is hard to imagine a more dangerous set of \ncircumstances to put upon an American community.\n  Since President Obama seems set on a course to bring terrorists into \nthe United States, I strongly support the efforts of Senators Inhofe \nand Inouye to introduce this amendment. The amendment would prevent any \nfunding in the bill from being used to transfer detainees held at \nGuantanamo Bay to any facility in the United States or to construct, \nimprove, modify, or otherwise enhance any facility in the United States \nfor the purpose of housing any Guantanamo detainees.\n  If we must close Guantanamo Bay, it should not result in Americans \nbeing less safe. Bringing these detainees to the United States would \nmake Americans less safe, and we should not do it.\n  Transferring these detainees would also stress the civilian \ngovernments in the communities where the detainees would be placed. \nThey would be faced with overwhelming demands, from roadblocks to \nidentification checks, along with having the increased security \npersonnel necessary to deal with what is an obvious threat. The value \nof homes and businesses would decline.\n  I can tell you that South Dakotans definitely don't want these \ndetainees in their State. I hope my support of the Inouye-Inhofe \namendment will help to ensure that they will not be transferred to \nSouth Dakota or to anywhere else in the United States.\n  My view is that no Guantanamo detainee should be brought to this \ncountry to be incarcerated and certainly should not be brought into the \nUnited States and freed. The Senate has clearly spoken on that front, \nas I said, by a vote of 94 to 3 on a resolution, in July 2007, that \ndetainees housed at Guantanamo Bay should not be released into American \nsociety and not transferred stateside into facilities in American \ncommunities and neighborhoods.\n  Guantanamo is secure. The facility is a $200 million state-of-the-art \nprison. No one has ever escaped, and the location makes it extremely \ndifficult to attack. Best of all, it is located hundreds of miles from \nAmerican communities. If the President wants to close Guantanamo, he \nmust do so in a way that keeps America safe. In my view, America is \nless safe if Guantanamo detainees are brought into the United States.\n  I appreciate the hard work of Senator Inhofe and Senator Inouye on \nthis issue. I hope when we have the vote today, my colleagues will \nadopt this amendment with the same level of support that we adopted the \nresolution back in July of 2007 by a vote of 94 to 3, stating very \nclearly that it is the view of the Senate that these detainees should \nnot be brought into American communities, into American neighborhoods. \nI would argue they ought to be held right where they are, in a place \nthat is safe, that is secure, that is state of the art, where they \nreceive the very best of treatment, where no one has ever escaped, \nhundreds of miles away from American communities and neighborhoods.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the quorum call be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill at this point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want the record to show that I support \nPresident Obama's supplemental request for the remainder of fiscal year \n2009. This supplemental provides critical funding for military and \nsecurity efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. A small portion is \nfor international programs, including assistance to Jordan, one of our \nimportant allies in the Middle East. Jordan is struggling with a huge \ninflux of Iraqi refugees that strains its national services and \nparticularly its water resources. Jordan has been a friend and ally, \nand it is right that in the supplemental bill we give them a helping \nhand because the war in Iraq has created a situation which we should \naddress in Jordan.\n  It also provides additional support to the Global Fund which partners \nwith other nations to tackle AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. I have \nworked with my colleagues for years to provide adequate funding for the \nGlobal Fund. I am glad this supplemental request from the Obama \nadministration continues critical food assistance to help meet urgent \nneeds of the world's poorest, which is also included. Funding is \nprovided to help stem the flow of drugs and violence across our border \nin Mexico.\n  At home, the supplemental includes money to prepare and to respond to \na global disease pandemic, including the recent H1N1 virus. This $1.5 \nbillion went through my subcommittee and is money well spent so the \nPresident can have resources to respond quickly to any outbreak of \ndisease or pandemic; that we would have adequate money for \nvaccinations, as well as providing medications, should people be \nstricken. We are looking ahead, planning ahead, thinking ahead, hoping \nthe H1N1 will disappear from the world scene before the next flu season \nbut being prepared if it does not or if something else threatens us.\n  This bill also provides funds critical to helping President Obama \nmeet a key campaign promise--bringing an end to the war in Iraq. In \nlate February, President Obama made an important announcement to \nthousands of marines at Camp Lejeune: bringing an end to the war in \nIraq. After only 5 weeks into office, he delivered on his major \ncampaign promise to end one of the longest wars in American history.\n  The President's plan is measured, thoughtful, and will bring an end \nto this costly and unnecessary war. The supplemental also wisely shifts \nresources to the real sources of the September 11 attacks on America--\nAfghanistan. For too long, this war in Afghanistan did not receive \nadequate civilian and military resources as they had been diverted to \nthe war in Iraq. The supplemental corrects this mistake.\n  It also focuses resources on Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation \nstruggling with insurgents based in the border area with Afghanistan. \nIt provides pay and allowances to our brave men and women in the U.S. \nmilitary. These are some of the many important needs which deserve our \nsupport.\n  The President should be commended for recently presenting a budget \nfor 2010 which moves away from repeated supplementals. This got to be a \nhabit around here. We didn't go through an orderly debate on the budget \nabout wars. Every time President Bush wanted money for a war, he said: \nI am declaring this an emergency. It will not be considered in the \nordinary budget process. Here it is.\n  An emergency is defined as something unanticipated. After 5 or 6 \nyears\n\n[[Page S5655]]\n\nof emergencies, you begin to realize you can anticipate next year we \nare going to have another unanticipated emergency.\n  This President, President Obama, wants to change that so that we go \nto an orderly budget process. This supplemental bill will be the last \nof the requests, and I think it is one we should honor as he tries to \ntackle some situations that were given to him when he took office just \na few months ago. The President inherited many challenges at home and \nabroad, and I hope, on a bipartisan basis, we can help him address \nthem.\n  This supplemental appropriations bill will provide critical funding \nfor our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, and I hope Congress passes it.\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \ndecided to use this legislation to open a debate about the future of \nGuantanamo. They have filed a number of amendments related to this \nissue. I am sure it is not their intention, but these amendments will \nhave the effect of slowing down delivery of critical funding for our \ntroops. Nevertheless, it is their right to offer these amendments, and \nthough they are not germane to this legislation, they raise policy \nquestions which we can debate.\n  Senator Inouye, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, has \noffered an amendment, which has broad support on both sides of the \naisle, that will eliminate any funding in this bill for closing \nGuantanamo and make clear that none of the funds in this bill can be \nused to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the United States.\n  Here is the bottom line: There will not be any Guantanamo funding in \nthis bill. So for the Republicans to bring up a series of Guantanamo \namendments tells me they are more intent on raising an issue than on \nresponding to the critical need this supplemental addresses.\n  These amendments are also premature. President Obama has not yet \npresented his plan for closing Guantanamo to the Congress and the \nAmerican people. When he does, we will have plenty of opportunity to \ndebate it. This bill, which will provide critical funding for our \ntroops, is not the right place for this debate. This is not the right \ntime. In fact, some of the amendments would have the effect of tying \nPresident Obama's hands, preventing him from moving forward with the \nclosure of Guantanamo before he has even had the chance to present his \nplan.\n  There is a great irony here. For 8 long years, Republicans opposed \ncongressional oversight of the Bush administration's counterterrorism \nefforts. When Democrats in the minority during the Bush years would ask \nfor oversight by congressional committees so that we could get more \ninformation about a variety of issues relative to terrorism, we were \ntold: No, the President has an important job to do and don't bother \nhim, Congress; leave him alone.\n\n  For 8 years, Republicans criticized Democrats who asked questions \nabout the misguided war in Iraq and controversial policies related to \ninterrogation, detention, and warrantless surveillance.\n  For 8 years, they claimed congressional oversight was nothing more \nthan micromanaging the important and critical work of the Commander in \nChief.\n  Now, after 8 long years, the Republicans are unwilling to give \nPresident Obama a few short months to formulate and present a plan for \nclosing Guantanamo.\n  Let's take one example. The distinguished minority leader, Senator \nMcConnell, has offered an amendment that would require the President to \nsubmit a detailed report to Congress on each detainee at Guantanamo \nBay, including a summary of the evidence against each detainee.\n  For many years, the Bush administration refused to provide Congress \nwith even a list of the names of the detainees at Guantanamo. They \nclaimed that a disclosure of those names would threaten national \nsecurity. I don't recall Senator McConnell or anyone from his side of \nthe aisle protesting this lack of disclosure by the previous \nadministration.\n  Yesterday, Senator McConnell said his amendment is designed to \nprevent released Guantanamo detainees from getting involved in \nterrorism. He said:\n\n       Recidivism is of great concern for those of us who have \n     oversight responsibilities here in Congress.\n\n  I do not recall Senator McConnell, or any other Republican, \nprotesting when the Bush administration, over the course of many years, \nreleased hundreds of Guantanamo detainees, some of whom have actually \nbeen involved in acts of terrorism since they were released.\n  So during the Bush years, while Guantanamo was churning hundreds of \ndetainees, some being released and returned to their countries, there \nwas not a whimper or a peep from the Republican side of the aisle. Now \nthat President Obama has said the days of Guantanamo are numbered, they \nare coming in asking for detailed accounting of every single detainee. \nIt is clearly a double standard.\n  There is also concern that the McConnell amendment could taint \nprosecutions of Guantanamo detainees by requiring the Obama \nadministration to turn over critical evidence to Congress. Imagine for \na moment that we gathered evidence that can be used successfully to \neither detain or prosecute one of the detainees, and Senator McConnell \ninsists that it be shared with Members of Congress. Is that in the \ninterest of national security? I don't think so.\n  For 7 years after the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration failed to \nconvict any of the terrorists who planned these attacks. At President \nObama's direction, career prosecutors are now reviewing the files of \neach Guantanamo detainee and gathering evidence to determine if each \ndetainee can be prosecuted. Isn't that what we want, an orderly process \nlooking at each detainee to determine whether they are guilty of \nwrongdoing, deciding whether they can be prosecuted, whether they \nshould be detained and doing this with the understanding that a lot of \nthe information is classified and most of it should be carefully \nguarded so as not to jeopardize the prosecution?\n  The McConnell amendment would say: Let Congress take a look at each \ndetainee and all the evidence. That does not make sense, and I hope \nMembers of the Senate will reject it.\n  The last thing Congress should do is interfere with the efforts of \nthe Obama administration to gather evidence against terrorists that \ncould ultimately bring them to justice.\n  There is another amendment. Senator John Cornyn of Texas has an \namendment that has 18 detailed findings about the Bush administration's \nuse of abusive interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding.\n  Among other things, the Cornyn amendment claims these techniques \n``accomplished the goal of providing intelligence necessary to defeat \nadditional terrorist attacks against the United States.'' To say the \nleast, we could debate that proposition for quite some time.\n  Former Vice President Cheney has been burning up the cable channel \nairwaves in recent weeks. He claims waterboarding produced valuable \nintelligence in the interrogation of al-Qaida leader Abu Zubaydah. But \nback in 2004, Vice President Cheney also told us the Bush \nadministration had learned from interrogations at Guantanamo that the \nIraqi Government had trained al-Qaida in the use of biological and \nchemical weapons. We now know there was no such link between al-Qaida \nand Iraq. This was part of the justification for the invasion of Iraq, \nand Vice President Cheney told us the interrogation at Guantanamo was \nproducing the information to confirm a link that never existed.\n  What about Abu Zubaydah? Just last week in the Judiciary Committee we \nheard testimony from a former FBI agent who actually interrogated him. \nHe testified under oath in our committee that he obtained valuable \nintelligence from Abu Zubaydah using traditional interrogation \ntechniques and that abusive techniques, such as waterboarding, are \n``harmful, slow, ineffective, and unreliable.''\n  Senator Cornyn does not serve on the Intelligence Committee. I don't \nknow the basis for his claim that waterboarding produced intelligence \nthat prevented terrorist attacks. I do know the Intelligence Committee, \nunder Senator Dianne Feinstein's leadership, is now conducting a \ndetailed, thoughtful, and thorough investigation into the Bush \nadministration's detention and interrogation practices. \n\n[[Page S5656]]\n\nI have said publicly--others have said it as well, including the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid--that before we talk about creating an \noutside commission, the Senate Intelligence Committee should be allowed \nto do its work so Members of Congress can at least learn, through open \nand classified information, what did happen. But Senator Cornyn can't \nwait. Senator Cornyn wants to pass out ``get out of jail free'' cards \nto the previous administration before we even have a thorough \nexamination of what happened.\n\n  One of the things the Intelligence Committee is reviewing is the \neffectiveness of these techniques in obtaining useful intelligence. The \nSenate is certainly not in a position today to go on record with \nconclusions such as those in Senator Cornyn's amendment before the \nIntelligence Committee even completes its investigation. It is not only \npremature, it certainly is questionable as to whether we should be \nengaged in this debate until their work is done.\n  I might remind Senator Cornyn, and those following this debate, that \nthe Intelligence Committee is a bipartisan committee. It works in a \nbipartisan fashion. Senator Bond and Senator Feinstein and others can \ncontinue to work together to come to good conclusions, to provide the \nSenate with good evidence, before we jump at the Cornyn amendment, \nwhich reaches conclusions not based on fact.\n  Senator Cornyn's amendment would also express the sense of the Senate \nthat no one involved in authorizing the use of abusive interrogation \ntechniques, such as waterboarding, should be prosecuted or sanctioned. \nIt is inappropriate for Congress to interfere in ongoing investigations \nby the Justice Department.\n  During the Bush administration, political interference significantly \nundermined the credibility and effectiveness of the Justice Department. \nAttorney General Holder has pledged to restore the integrity and the \nindependence of that department.\n  There are two ongoing investigations into the Bush administration's \ninterrogation practices. One investigation is looking into the CIA's \ndestruction of evidence of interrogation videotapes. The other is an \ninvestigation of Justice Department attorneys who authorized abusive \ntechniques such as waterboarding.\n  Here is the reality: Both of these investigations didn't begin under \nPresident Obama. They began under the Bush administration. Both are \nbeing conducted by Department of Justice attorneys. So the suggestion \nthat this is some partisan witch hunt is obviously false.\n  You wonder, with these two Department of Justice investigations \nunderway and with the Senate Intelligence Committee doing a thorough \ninvestigation of this subject, why does Senator Cornyn want to come to \nthe floor and have the Senate go on record saying that nothing possibly \ncould have been done that was illegal or wrong? That would be the \nheight of irresponsibility, should we pass that amendment.\n  Decisions about whether crimes were committed should be made by \ncareer prosecutors based on the facts and the laws, not political \nconsiderations or statements made by Senators on the floor without \nevidence to back them up. I urge my colleague from Texas to withdraw \nhis amendment and allow the Justice Department to do its work.\n  There is an organization which I like and respect very much called \nAmnesty International. When you take a look at John Cornyn's amendment, \nhe would qualify for some amnesty award because he wants the Senate to \ngo on record offering amnesty when it comes to the interrogation of \ndetainees by not only--and let me go through the list--any person who \nrelied in good faith on those opinions at any level of our Government, \nbut also it includes Members of Congress who were briefed on the \ninterrogation program.\n  To offer this kind of a statement ahead of time, without any \ngathering of evidence or fact, is, in my mind, an indication of how \nnervous some people are on the other side of the aisle. We should let \nthis run its course in a professional manner. We shouldn't make a \npolitical decision, and we should defeat the Cornyn amendment.\n  Several of my Republican colleagues came to the floor yesterday to \ncriticize President Obama's intention to close Guantanamo and argue it \nshould remain open. I listened carefully to their arguments, and, \nfrankly, there were enough red herrings to feed all the detainees at \nGuantanamo.\n  One of my colleagues said President Obama wants to close Guantanamo \n``to be more popular with the Europeans.''\n  Well, I know President Obama. I served with him. He was my colleague \nin the Senate. His first interest is the United States and its safety. \nBut the safety of the United States also involves being honest about \nwhat has happened. What happened at Abu Ghraib and what happened at \nGuantanamo has sullied the reputation of the United States and has \nendangered alliances which we have counted on for decades. President \nObama is trying to change that. By closing Guantanamo and responsibly \nallocating those detainees to safe and secure positions, he is going to \nsend a message to the world that it is a new day in terms of America's \nforeign policy.\n  The American people want to see that. They want a safer world and \nbelieve that if the United States can work closely with our allies \naround the world who are opposed to terrorism, we will be safer. That \nis what President Obama is setting out to do. Some of those allies may, \nin fact, be European. They may be African or Asian. They could be from \nall corners of the Earth. But if they share our values and want to work \nfor common goals, President Obama wants to work with them.\n  GEN Colin Powell and many other military leaders have said for some \ntime that closing Guantanamo will make America safer. Experts say \nGuantanamo is a recruitment tool for al-Qaida and hurts our national \nsecurity. That is why President Obama, like President Bush, Senator \nJohn McCain, and many others, wants to close Guantanamo.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues argued that Guantanamo is the only \nappropriate place to hold the detainees because ``we don't have a \nfacility that could handle this in the United States'' and American \ncorrections officers would ``have no idea what they are getting into.'' \nWell, I would say to my colleagues who made those statements that they \nought to take a look at some of our secured facilities in the United \nStates and they ought to have a little more respect for the men and \nwomen who are corrections officers, who put their lives on the line \nevery single day to keep us safe and who make sure those who are \ndangerous are detained and incarcerated.\n  The reality is, we are holding some of the most dangerous terrorists \nin the world right now in our Federal prisons, including the mastermind \nof the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the ``shoe bomber,'' the \n``Unabomber,'' and many others.\n  Senator McConnell said yesterday, ``No one has ever escaped from \nGuantanamo.'' Well, that is true, to the best of my knowledge. But it \nis also true that no prisoner has ever escaped from a Federal \nsupermaximum security facility in the United States.\n  In fact, the Bureau of Prisons is currently holding 347 convicted \nterrorists. Is Senator McConnell going to come to the floor and say \nthey should be moved from these Federal correctional facilities because \nthey pose a threat to the United States being incarcerated in the \ncontinental United States? I haven't heard that. But in his efforts to \nkeep Guantanamo open at any cost, he wouldn't even consider allowing a \ndetainee to be brought to the United States for trial and being held, \neven temporarily, in any type of secure facility.\n  Republicans are criticizing the President, but the reality is, they \ndo not have a plan themselves to deal with Guantanamo. I assume, from \nSenator McConnell's statements, he would leave it open. He doesn't care \nabout the impact this might have on the United States around the world. \nIf he has a plan to close it, I would like to hear it. I think he ought \nto come forward and join with President Bush, join with President \nObama, join General Powell, join Senator McCain, Senator Graham, and \nothers who have said Guantanamo should be closed. Otherwise, \nunfortunately, he is being critical of the President's intentions \nwithout producing his own approach.\n  The Bush administration had many years to deal with Guantanamo, but \nthey didn't follow through. President\n\n[[Page S5657]]\n\nObama has taken on the challenge of solving one of the toughest \nproblems his administration faces, beyond the state of our economy. The \nPresident is taking the time to carefully plan for the closing of \nGuantanamo, with the highest priority being the protection of America's \nnational security.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to withdraw these Guantanamo \namendments. These amendments don't fit in the supplemental \nappropriations bill. They tie the President's hands and keep him from \nmaking the necessary decisions to keep us safe and to make sure \nterrorists do not, in any way, threaten the United States. They also \nslow down our efforts to provide critical funding for our troops in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n\n  I hope when this matter comes before the Senate in the hours ahead, \nmy colleagues will read carefully and closely, particularly the \namendments by Senator Cornyn and by Senator McConnell. The amendment by \nSenator Cornyn, which grants a sense-of-the-Senate amnesty to those who \nwere involved in interrogation techniques, is not consistent with a \nnation that is guided by the rule of law. For that Senator to make \nconclusions in his amendment that have not been supported by evidence \nand fact should be grounds enough for us to reject his amendment.\n  I don't know where these investigations in the Department of Justice \nor the Intelligence Committee will lead, but if we are truly sworn to \nuphold the Constitution and the laws of our land, we should allow them \nto run their course with the facts and law being honestly considered by \nthose different panels.\n  Senator McConnell's amendment, which asks for more detailed \ninformation about detainees at Guantanamo than any Republican ever \ndared ask under the Bush administration, could jeopardize the \nprosecution of terrorists. Is that a good idea? It is certainly not. I \ncertainly hope my colleagues will join me in opposing the McConnell \namendment as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak with \nrespect to an amendment I have filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I have filed an amendment to this \nsupplemental appropriations bill which is designed to put more \ntransparency and more measurable control factors into the way we are \nspending these appropriations with respect to the situation in \nPakistan.\n  I would begin by saying I have a great deal of concern, as do many \nMembers of this body, with respect to the achievability of some of the \nstrategic objectives that have been laid out by the new administration. \nWe are still looking for clear and measurable end points to the \nstrategy itself. At the same time, I believe the new administration \ndeserves an opportunity to attempt to bring a greater sense of \nstability into that region. It is a big gamble.\n  As I mentioned to General Petraeus when he was testifying, and as I \nmentioned to other witnesses before the Armed Services and the Foreign \nRelations Committee, the biggest gamble we face with respect to the \npolicies that have been announced in Afghanistan and Pakistan are that \nwe are basically allowing ourselves to be measured by unknowns, over \nwhich we have no real control. In Afghanistan, this is very clear, when \nwe put as one of our objectives the creation of an Afghani national \narmy. I asked General Petraeus if he could tell me at what point in the \nAfghan history has there ever been a viable national army, and the \nanswer is, except for a period of about 30 years when the Afghanis were \nsponsored by the Soviets, there was no viable national army. And even \nthere it was not one you would measure in the same context of what we \nare saying we are going to attempt to achieve. So that puts our success \nin the hands of a rather speculative venture but one I hope we can \nachieve in some form.\n  I would also point out an article in the New York Times today, which \npoints out there was a good bit of American weaponry ammunition found \nin the aftermath of battle between the Taliban and American forces, \nwhich shows there are munitions that were procured by the Pentagon that \nnow seem to be in the hands of the troops who are fighting against \nAmericans. I would point out that is not unusual for this region. When \nI was Secretary of the Navy more than 20 years ago, one thing we were \nseeing in the Persian Gulf, with the Iranian boghammers attempting to \nattack our vessels, was that some of the rocket-propelled grenades that \nwere found in these boghammers actually could be traced back to weapons \nwe had given the Afghani anti-Soviet fighters in Afghanistan. It is a \ncommon occurrence in this region.\n  The question is, How we can minimize those sorts of occurrences?\n  With respect to Pakistan, the situation is even more difficult.\n  We have very few control factors in Pakistan in terms of where our \nmoney goes when we send it in or what happens to our convoys that go \nthrough Pakistan on the way to Afghanistan. Eighty percent of the \nlogistical supplies that go to Afghanistan go by ground through \nPakistan. We cannot defend those convoys. We have had many occurrences \nsince last summer where they have been interrupted, where they have \nbeen attacked, trucks have been destroyed, and other vehicles have been \nstolen, et cetera.\n  In Pakistan there are a number of reputable observers who point out \nthat some elements in the Pakistani military, particularly in their \nintelligence services, actually have continued to assist the Taliban. \nBecause of--No. 1, the vulnerability of our supply routes; No. 2, the \ninstability of the Government itself, obviously which we are attempting \nto assist; and No. 3, the focus of Pakistan in terms of its principal \nnational security objectives as being India rather than Afghanistan \nitself--that leads to a situation where we must have a measurable \nsource of control and accountability over the money we are going to \nappropriate to assist the situation in Pakistan as it relates to \ninternational terrorism, the future stability of Pakistan, and \nattempting to defeat al-Qaida.\n  With all that in mind, I asked a series of questions last week in the \nArmed Services Committee to Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. This basically was the line of questioning. First, do \nwe have evidence that Pakistan is increasing its nuclear program in \nterms of weapon systems, warheads, et cetera? Admiral Mullen gave me a \none-word answer--yes. I declined to pursue that answer because I didn't \nbelieve that was the appropriate place to have a further discussion. \nBut I did say, and I believe now, this should cause us enormous concern \nat a time when we are having so much discussion in this country about \nthe potential that Iran would obtain nuclear weapons, where Pakistan, \nan unstable regime in a very volatile part of the region, not only \npossesses nuclear weapons but is increasing its nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  I then asked Admiral Mullen: Can you tell me what percentage of the \n$12 billion that has gone to Pakistan since 9/11 has gone toward its \ndefense measures related to India or to other areas that are not \ndesigned to address directly the terrorist threat or the activities of \nthe Taliban? The answer was we do not know. No. We cannot measure those \nwith any degree of validity because of the opaqueness in the Pakistani \nGovernment.\n  I then asked him: Do we have appropriate control factors, in terms of \nwhere future American money will go? Secretary Gates indicated there \nwere improved control factors, but we do not have the control factors \nin Pakistan as now exist even in countries such as Afghanistan, with \nall the difficulties in that country.\n  With all of that in mind, I drafted a simple amendment. I hope this \ncan go into the managers' package. I believe all of us who are going to \nstep forward right now and attempt to assist the administration can \nagree that what we should have is a simple statement from the Congress, \nfrom the appropriators, that none of the funds we are appropriating \ncould be used for either of these two purposes--No. 1, to support, \nexpand, or in any way assist the development or deployment of the \nnuclear weapons program of the Government of Pakistan; or, No. 2, to \nsupport programs for which these funds in the appropriations act have \nnot been identified.\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\n  It is a very simple amendment. It simply says no money will go \ndirectly or indirectly to assist Pakistan's nuclear weapons program; \nNo. 2, no money will be spent in any way other than the way we have \nidentified it in this program and that the President must certify this \nand must come back every 90 days and recertify whether any funds have \nbeen appropriated for those purposes.\n  I hope the managers of this bill can accept this amendment. If not, I \nwill seek a vote on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1144\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about amendment No. \n1144, the Protecting America's Communities Act, which I am offering to \nH.R. 2346, the supplemental appropriation bill.\n  Before I begin my comments, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nCoburn as an original cosponsor of S. 1071, which is a collateral \nstand-alone bill, as well as a cosponsor to amendment No. 1144.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, this amendment amends immigration law \nto prohibit any detainee held at Guantanamo Bay Naval Facility from \nbeing transferred or released into the United States. It is a little \nbit different from the vote we are going to be taking at 11:30.\n  There are over 240 terrorists in U.S. custody at the military \ndetention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Let me just describe some \nof the individuals who reside at Guantanamo. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed--or \nKSM--is the self-proclaimed, and quite unapologetic, mastermind of the \n9/11 attacks. KSM admitted he was the planner of 9/11 and other \nplanned, but foiled attacks against the U.S. In his combatant status \nreview board, he admitted he swore allegiance to Osama bin Ladin, was a \nmember of al-Qaida, was the military operational commander for all \nforeign al-Qaida operations, and much more. KSM and four other \ndetainees, who are charged with conspiring to commit the terrible 9/11 \nattacks, remain at Guantanamo.\n  In addition, Gitmo uses Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri who was responsible \nfor the October 2000 USS Cole bombing which murdered 17 U.S. sailors \nand injured 37 others. Also residing a Gitmo are Osama bin Ladin's \npersonal bodyguards, al-Qaida terrorist camp trainers, al-Qaida \nbombmakers, and individuals picked up on the battlefield with weapons \ntrying to kill American soldiers--our young men and women who \npatriotically serve their country. The detainees at Guantanamo are some \nof the most senior, hardened, and dangerous al-Qaida figures we have \ncaptured.\n  These are exactly the type of individuals we hope never get past our \nfront lines and enter into the United States. However, as one of his \nvery first acts in January, President Obama ordered the closure of \nGuantanamo, but 4 months later he still does not have a plan to \naccomplish this. Officials in his administration have stated publicly \nthat some of these detainees could be brought to the U.S., and some \ncould even be freed into the United States.\n  The disposition of the detainees at Gitmo is not a new issue. Over \nthe past several years, the military has transferred the majority of \ndetainees held at Gitmo to other countries. However, the success of \nthese transfers is mixed at best. According to a Defense Intelligence \nAgency report from December 2008, 18 former detainees are confirmed and \n43 are suspected of returning to the fight after being released from \nGuantanamo. This represents a recidivism rate of over 11 percent. Just \ntwo months later this rate rose to 12 percent. These individuals do not \neven represent the most serious and dangerous terrorists we have \ncaptured. The most dangerous detainees remain at Gitmo. This data has \nlikely risen since December, but the Department of Defense refuses to \nrelease the information under instructions from the administration. If \nwe start to release or transfer the most hardened terrorists left at \nGitmo, these numbers will only increase further.\n  One thing that is clear: we know that these detainees have remained \nloyal to al-Qaida and Osama bin Ladin despite being captured and remain \na danger to our national security. We have statements from detainees \navowing it is their goal to kill Americans, claiming that they ``pray \nevery day against the United States.'' Al-Qaida searches every day for \noperatives who can evade our enhanced security mechanisms in its quest \nto commit another attack against our homeland. It is important to \nremember that most detainees held at Guantanamo were captured on the \nbattlefields in Afghanistan or Iraq and were determined to be a threat \nto our Nation's security. Whatever their ties to terrorists groups or \nactivities, these individuals should never be given the privilege of \ncrossing our borders, even if incarcerated. To do so would be nothing \nshort of an invitation for al-Qaida to operate inside our homeland. KSM \nand other high value detainees at Gitmo are no different, and do not \nconceal their intent to harm Americans if given the chance.\n\n  My amendment would prevent those terrorists at Gitmo from having that \nchance. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the \nright to ``establish a uniform rule of naturalization.'' The Supreme \nCourt has determined that the power of Congress ``to exclude aliens \nfrom the United States and to prescribe the terms and conditions on \nwhich they come in'' is absolute. My legislation capitalizes on the \nclear and absolute authority of Congress to determine who enters our \nborders by first adding to the list of those inadmissible to the United \nStates those detained at Gitmo as of January 1 of this year.\n  However, because Congress delegates to the executive branch parole \nauthority, this administration could still bring those terrorists \ndetained at Gitmo into the United States. Parole authority is granted \nto the Attorney General to allow aliens, who are otherwise not \nqualified for admission to the U.S., permission to enter our country on \na case-by-case basis--essentially a waiver for those otherwise \ninadmissible. Although aliens paroled into the U.S. are not considered \n``admitted'' for purposes of our immigration laws, they are within the \nborders of our country and therefore become eligible to apply for \nasylum or seek other legal protections.\n  To deal with this, my legislation also eliminates parole authority \nfor the executive branch as it pertains to those individuals detained \nat Gitmo as of January 1, 2009. As such, there is no basis for \nPresident Obama to allow these detainees to be transferred to U.S. \nsoil.\n  The Protecting America's Communities Act also provides protections \nfor American citizens in the event President Obama decides to try to \nexercise some other authority to bring these Gitmo detainees to the \nU.S., such as the authority granted to him via Article II of our \nConstitution. Again, we know that if the detainees were transferred to \nthe U.S., they would seek legal protection under the generous legal \nrights our Constitution grants our citizens. However, our courts and \nour legal system were not established to try individuals detained on \nthe battlefield. Because of the nature of the global war on terror and \nevidence gathered against them from the battlefield or through \nintelligence, the detainees are unlikely to be suitable for prosecution \nwithin the U.S. criminal courts. There is no ``CSI Kandahar'' in which \nevidence picked up off the battlefield is carefully marked and the \nchain of custody is observed.\n  There is too much at stake to grant the unprecedented benefit of our \nlegal system's complex procedural safeguards to foreign nationals who \nwere captured outside the United States during a time of war. Allowing \nthese terrorists to escape conviction--or worse yet, to be freed into \nthe U.S. by our courts--because of legal technicalities would tarnish \nthe reputation of our legal system as one that is fair and just. \nProhibiting the detainees from entering into the U.S., as the \nProtecting America's Communities Act does, is one small step in the \nright direction.\n  Further, if these individuals were to be brought to the U.S. by \nPresident Obama to be tried on our Article III courts and not \nconvicted, the only mechanism available to our Government to continue \nto detain these individuals would be via immigration law. However, the \ncurrent immigration laws\n\n[[Page S5659]]\n\non our books are insufficient to ensure that these detainees would be \nmandatorily detained and continued to be detained until they can \nsuccessfully be removed from our borders.\n  Although I am adamantly opposed to bringing any of these detainees to \nthe U.S., and I do not believe the President has independent authority \nto do so, I believe we need legislation to safeguard our citizens and \nour communities in the event they are brought here. To that end, my \nlegislation makes mandatory the detention of any Gitmo detainees \nbrought to the U.S.\n  It also strengthens and clarifies the authority of the Secretary of \nthe Department of Homeland Security to detain any of the Gitmo \ndetainees until they can be removed. This statutory fix is needed \nbecause in 2001, the Supreme Court decided the case of Zadvydas v. \nDavis, holding that unless there is a reasonable likelihood that an \nalien being held by the Government will actually be repatriated to \ntheir government within a given period of time, that alien must be \nreleased and cannot be detained by the U.S. Government for more than 6 \nmonths.\n  We all know a major issue facing our country in dealing with those \nfolks detained at Gitmo is finding a country to take them. For example, \nthere are 17 Chinese Uighurs being held at Gitmo who have been cleared \nfor transfer to another country. However, the United States will not \nsend them back to China for fear they might be treated unfairly by the \nChinese Government. No other country to date is willing to take them. \nTherefore, my legislation provides authority to the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to continue to detain these individuals and provides \nfor a periodic review of their continued detention until they can \nsafely be removed to a third country.\n  In addition, my legislation prohibits any of those individuals \ndetained at Gitmo from applying for asylum in the event they are \nbrought here. Now, there are a number of other proposals to prohibit \nfunding from being used to transfer to or detain the Gitmo terrorists \nin the United States--I am going to support those provisions--but those \nare not permanent. Those will have to be renewed annually. Congress \nwould have to maintain this prohibition in all future spending bills.\n  Although I do believe this is a good short-term solution, and I \nsupport those measures, I want to be confident that Congress does not \ndrop the ball in the future. We need a more permanent solution to this \nproblem, and the Protect America's Communities Act provides exactly \nthat.\n  I urge the President to develop a policy that would allow closure for \nthe families of the victims of 9/11 that will prevent terrorists from \nstepping foot on U.S. soil and will keep them off the battlefield where \nthey will attempt to kill our men and women in future combats.\n  However, we cannot wait for the President to assure us that none of \nthese detainees will be brought to America. The stakes are too high, \nand in order to maintain the highest degree of security and safety in \nour country, we need to adopt the Protect America's Communities Act to \nensure that they never step foot inside of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to give some views on \nGuantanamo. I have had the privilege of serving with the distinguished \nSenator who has just concluded his remarks on the Intelligence \nCommittee of the Senate. But I strongly disagree with him. I would like \nto have the opportunity to make the case.\n  First of all, Guantanamo is not sovereign territory of the United \nStates. Under a 1903 lease, however, the United States exercises \ncomplete jurisdiction and control over this naval base.\n  In December 2001, the administration decided to bring detainees \ncaptured overseas in connection with the war in Afghanistan and hold \nthem there outside of our legal system. That was the point: To hold \nthese detainees outside of the U.S. legal system.\n  This was revealed in a December 2001 Office of Legal Council \nmemorandum by John Yoo of the Justice Department.\n  He wrote this:\n\n       Finally, the Executive Branch has repeatedly taken the \n     position under various statutes that [Guantanamo] is neither \n     part of the United States nor a possession or territory of \n     the United States. For example, this Office [Justice] has \n     opined that [Guantanamo] is not part of the ``United States'' \n     for purposes of the Immigration and Naturalization Act . . . \n     Similarly, in 1929, the Attorney General opined that \n     [Guantanamo] was not a ``possession'' of the United States \n     within the meaning of certain tariff acts.\n\n  The memo concludes with this statement:\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that a district \n     court cannot properly entertain an application for a writ of \n     habeas corpus by an enemy alien detained at Guantanamo Bay \n     Naval Base, Cuba. Because the issue has not yet definitively \n     been resolved by the courts, however, we caution that there \n     is some possibility that a district court would entertain \n     such an application.\n\n  This set the predicate for Guantanamo: Keep these individuals outside \nof the reach of U.S. law, and set up a separate legal system to deal \nwith them.\n  Now, was this right or wrong? It was definitively wrong, because \nsince then the Supreme Court has rejected this position in four \nseparate cases.\n  First, in Rasul v. Bush in 2004, the court ruled that American \ncourts, in fact, do have jurisdiction to hear habeas and other claims \nfrom detainees held at Guantanamo.\n  Second, in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, also in 2004, the Court upheld the \nPresident's authority to detain unlawful combatants, but stated that \nthis authority was not ``a blank check.'' In particular, the Court \nruled that detainees who were U.S. citizens, such as Yasser Hamdi, had \nthe rights that all Americans are guaranteed under the Constitution.\n  Third, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld in 2006, the Court declared invalid the \nPentagon's process for adjudicating detainees and extended to \nGuantanamo detainees the protection from cruel, inhuman, and degrading \ntreatment found in Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions.\n  The administration responded by pushing through Congress the Military \nCommissions Act. This legislation expressly eliminated habeas corpus \nrights and limited other appeals to procedure and constitutionality, \nleaving questions of fact or violations of law unresolvable by all \nFederal courts. This happens nowhere else in American law. But this \nMilitary Commissions Act was enacted in the fall of 2006.\n  That law was then challenged through the courts and overturned in the \nfinal Supreme Court decision in this area, Boumediene v. Bush, decided \nin 2008.\n  In Boumediene, the Supreme Court stated that the writ of habeas \ncorpus applied to detainees even when Congress had sought to take away \njurisdiction. It stated that detainees must be allowed access to \nFederal courts so that a judicial ruling on the lawfulness of their \ndetention could be made.\n  Writing for the majority in the Boumediene decision, Justice Kennedy \nwrote the following:\n\n       The laws and the Constitution are designed to survive, and \n     to remain in force, in extraordinary times. Liberty and \n     security can be reconciled; and in our system they are \n     reconciled within the framework of the law.\n\n  Several habeas petitions have been filed and reviewed in the DC \nCircuit since the Boumediene decision, and that process is ongoing \ntoday.\n  In sum, these four Supreme Court rulings make one thing exceedingly \nclear: The legal rights of these detainees are the same under the \nConstitution, whether they are kept on American soil or elsewhere.\n  Attempts to diminish or deny these legal rights have only served to \ndelay the legal process at Guantanamo Bay.\n  In fact, only 3 of the roughly 750 detainees held at Guantanamo have \nbeen held to account for their actions.\n  One is David Hicks, an Australian. He pled guilty to charges and has \nsince been released by the Australian Government.\n  Salim Hamdan, Bin Laden's driver, was found guilty of providing \nmaterial support for terrorism by his military commission. He was \nsentenced to 5.5 years, but having already served 5 years in \nGuantanamo, he was released to Yemen in November of 2007.\n  Ali Hamza al Bahlul, a Yemeni who was al-Qaida's media chief, was \nfound guilty of conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism \nin November of 2008. He refused to mount a defense on his own behalf \nand was given a life sentence.\n  Today, there are approximately 240 detainees incarcerated at \nGuantanamo.\n\n[[Page S5660]]\n\n  In 2007, nearly 2 years ago, I introduced an amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill to close Guantanamo Bay within 1 year and transition \nall detainees out of that facility.\n  The amendment was cosponsored by 15 Senators. Unfortunately, it was \nnot allowed to come up for debate.\n  Within 2 days of his inauguration, President Obama issued an \nExecutive Order announcing the closure of Guantanamo within 1 year and \nordering a review of each detainee.\n  Let me say this: I believe closing Guantanamo is in our Nation's \nnational security interest. Guantanamo is used not only by al-Qaida but \nalso by other nations, governments, and individuals, people good and \nbad, as a symbol of America's abuse of Muslims, and it is fanning the \nflames of anti-Americanism around the world.\n  As former Navy General Counsel Alberto Mora said in 2008:\n\n       Serving U.S. flag-rank officers . . . maintain that the \n     first and second identifiable cause of U.S. combat deaths in \n     Iraq--as judged by their effectiveness in recruiting \n     insurgent fighters into combat--are, respectively the symbols \n     of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.\n\n  I deeply believe closing Guantanamo is a very important part of the \nlarger effort against terror and extremism. It is a part of the effort \nto show that Americans are not hypocritical, that we do not pass laws \nand then say that there is a certain group of people who are exempt \nfrom these laws.\n  Detentions at Guantanamo have caused tension between the United \nStates and our allies--the allies we try to get to contribute more \nforces and other support for the war in Afghanistan, and they are a \nrallying point for the recruitment of terrorists.\n  So, closing it is a critical step in restoring America's credibility \nabroad, as well as restoring the value of the American judicial system.\n  The executive branch task force responsible for ensuring that \nGuantanamo closes within the year is reviewing the evidence on each of \nthe roughly 240 detainees to determine the following:\n  Who can be charged with a crime and be prosecuted; who can be \ntransferred to the custody of another country, like the 500 or so \ndetainees who have already left Guantanamo; who poses no threat to the \nUnited States but cannot be sent to another nation; and, finally, who \ncannot be released because they do pose a threat but cannot be \nprosecuted, perhaps because the evidence against them is the \ninadmissible product of coercive interrogations.\n  Let me be clear. No one is talking about releasing dangerous \nindividuals into our communities or neighborhoods as some would have us \nbelieve.\n  The best option is to prosecute the terrorists who plotted, \nfacilitated, and carried out attacks against the United States.\n  Let's look at the record for a moment.\n  The United States has prosecuted individuals in Federal court for the \nbombings of U.S. Embassies and the 1993 World Trade Center attack. It \nhas prosecuted individuals plotting to bomb airplanes, for attending \nterrorist training camps, and for inciting violent acts against the \nUnited States.\n  According to a report, ``In Pursuit of Justice: Prosecuting Terrorism \nCases in the Federal Courts,'' issued in May of last year, more than \n100 terrorism cases since the beginning of 2001 have resulted in \nconvictions.\n  The individuals held at Guantanamo pose no greater threat to our \nsecurity than these individuals convicted of these crimes, who are \ncurrently held in prison in the United States and are no danger to our \nneighbors, to our communities. The Bush administration had estimated \nthat out of the 240 detainees at Guantanamo, 60 to 80 could be \nprosecuted for crimes against the United States or its allies. Current \nefforts to try these cases are ongoing.\n  In the event that detainees cannot be tried in Federal court or in \nstandard courts martial, the Obama administration has recently proposed \nrevisions to military commissions. This is an issue we are going to \nhave to look at very closely in the coming weeks.\n  Our system of justice is more than capable of prosecuting terrorists \nand housing detainees before, during, and after trial. We have the \nfacilities to keep convicted terrorists behind bars indefinitely and \nkeep them away from American citizens.\n  The Obama administration will determine which civilian and military \nfacilities are best to accomplish these goals. One example is the \nsupermax facility in Florence, CO.\n  It is not in a neighborhood or community. It is an isolated supermax \nfacility. It has 490 beds. They are reserved for the worst of the \nworst. This facility houses not only drug kingpins, serial murderers, \nand gang leaders, but also terrorists who have already been convicted \nof crimes in the United States.\n  There have been no escapes, and it is far, as I said, from America's \ncommunities and neighborhoods, as are just about all the maximum and \nsupermax facilities.\n  This facility has housed terrorists such as Ramzi Yousef, the \nmastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and at least six of \nhis accomplices; Omar Abdel-Rahman, known as the ``Blind Sheikh,'' who \nwas behind a plot to blow up New York City landmarks, including the \nUnited Nations; Richard Reid, the al-Qaida ``shoe bomber,'' who tried \nto blow up an airliner in flight; four individuals involved in the 1998 \nbombings of Embassies of the United States in Kenya and Tanzania; Ahmed \nRessam, the ``Millennium Bomber,'' who was detained at the Canadian \nborder with explosives in his car as he was headed to the Los Angeles \nairport; Iyman Faris, the al-Qaida operative who plotted to blow up \nbridges in New York City; Jose Padilla, the U.S. citizen held for 3\\1/\n2\\ years as an enemy combatant based on allegations that he had wanted \nto detonate a dirty bomb inside the United States and was later \nconvicted of material support to terrorism; 9/11 conspirator Zacarias \nMoussaoui; the ``Unabomber,'' Theodore Kaczynski; and Oklahoma City \nbombers, one of whom is now deceased, Timothy McVeigh and Terry \nNichols.\n  These 20 are just an example of terrorists who have been or are being \nheld inside the United States.\n  So there is ample evidence that the United States can and, in fact, \ndoes hold dangerous convicts securely and without incident.\n  As I said earlier, I believe that not all detainees can be \nprosecuted.\n  The Bush administration had identified a second group of 60 to 80 who \ncould be transferred out of Guantanamo, if another nation could be \nfound that would accept them.\n  Again, the Obama administration is finding some success in moving \nthese detainees abroad.\n  Since January of this year, there have been stories indicating that \ncertain European nations may accept some of the detainees. A few days \nago, France accepted an Algerian detainee from Guantanamo. These \ncountries recognize that closing Guantanamo is in the best interests of \neveryone, and are willing to be part of the solution. We sincerely \nthank them.\n  Finally, let me address the third category of detainees, which \npresents the thorniest problem.\n  The Executive Order Task Force will likely determine that there are \nsome detainees who can neither be tried, nor transferred, nor released. \nSecretary Gates recently testified that there were 50 to 100 of these \ndetainees.\n  The President has the authority to detain such people under the laws \nof armed conflict, and he very well may need to exercise that \nauthority. I would support his doing so.\n  In my view, this authority should be constrained and in keeping with \nthe Geneva Conventions. Detainees should only be held following a \nfinding by the executive branch that this action is legal under \ninternational law.\n  These detainees should have the right to have a U.S. court review \nthis determination, much as the Boumediene decision guaranteed that \nhabeas petitions of detainees will, in fact, be heard. That judicial \ndetermination should be reviewed periodically to determine whether the \ndetainee remains a threat to national security and should continue to \nbe detained.\n  In this, there is a protocol that I believe will stand court scrutiny \nand enable the President to continue the detention of everyone who \nremains a national security threat to the United States.\n  Guantanamo, despite all the rhetoric on this floor, has been a symbol \nof abuse and disregard for the rule of law\n\n[[Page S5661]]\n\nfor too long. Four Supreme Court decisions should convince even the \nmost recalcitrant of those among us; it is in our own national security \ninterests that Guantanamo be closed as quickly and as carefully as \npossible.\n  The fact is, no Member of Congress wants to see, or advocates, the \nreckless release of terrorists, or anyone who is a threat to our \nnational security, into our communities. It does not have to, and it \nwill not be done that way.\n  Of the 240 detainees at Guantanamo right now, some can be tried. Some \nhave been declared not to be enemy combatants. Others may need to be \ndetained in the future, but only in a way that is consistent with our \nlaws and our national security interests.\n  I believe we should close Guantanamo. I support the President in this \nregard. This is a very important decision we are going to make. I very \nmuch regret that this amount was in the supplemental bill without a \nplan, and I think that is the key. The plan was not there. How would \nthe money be used? Nobody knew. So it fell smack-dab into the trap that \nsome want to spring throughout the United States: That this \nadministration or this Senate would release detainees into the \nneighborhoods and communities of the United States.\n  As shown on this chart, this supermax facility is not in a \nneighborhood or a community. Yes, we have maximum security prisons in \nCalifornia eminently capable of holding these individuals as well, and \nfrom which people do not escape.\n  I believe this has been an exercise in fear-baiting. I hope it is not \ngoing to be successful because I believe American justice is what makes \nthis country strong in the eyes of the world. American justice is what \npeople believe separates the United States from other countries. \nAmerican justice has to be applied to everyone because, if it is not, \nwe then become hypocrites in the eyes of the world.\n  We should return to our values. One of the largest symbols of \nreturning to these values is, in fact, the closure of the facility at \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 15 minutes 56 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nnotified after 10 minutes and that the approximately 6 minutes be \nreserved for Senator Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I do \nnot think I will object--I did not hear the request the Senator made. \nWill the Senator repeat it, please.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It is to reserve the 10 minutes I had scheduled and \nto reserve 6 minutes for you, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, that 6 minutes would be immediately prior \nto Senator Inouye's closing; is that right?\n  I do not object. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to \nprohibit funds from the supplemental being used for relocation of \nGuantanamo Bay prisoners.\n  President Obama has asked for $100 million in the regular 2010 \nDefense appropriations bill for his proposal to close Guantanamo Bay. \nAs Congress considers that plan for 2010, it is reasonable for us to \nask the President to come to Congress with his plan so we can consider \nthe funding requirements as part of the normal oversight process. But \nright now, I think it is clear, from all the debate we have heard, the \nPresident does not have a plan. Instead, he is proceeding with a \ndecision to close Guantanamo Bay, even though there is no viable \nalternative for the detainment of terrorist combatants.\n  On September 11, 2001, we know the United States peered into the face \nof evil, when 19 foreign terrorists brought the violence of extremism \nto our soil, claiming the lives of nearly 3,000 Americans.\n  That day changed the course of American history. In the 8 years \nsince, America has boldly waged the global war on terror in an effort \nto prevent terrorism from ever reaching American shores again.\n  This conflict has presented our Nation with operational challenges \nwhich we had not seen before. It is where to and how to detain captured \nterrorists who are enemy combatants but do not represent legal \ncombatants of a country. They are not an organized military. They do \nnot have the honor code that any military of a country has. No. They \nare terrorists. They do not have an honor code. Therefore, how and \nwhere we detain them has been a unique situation for our country.\n  Included in the detainees at Guantanamo Bay is the self-confessed \nmastermind of 9/11, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. Since just after 9/11, \nthese enemy combatants have been at a prison facility that is a U.S. \nNaval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. I have been there. Conditions are \ngood. Medical service and food is good. Customs of the combatants are \nrecognized and respected.\n  My colleagues are discussing Guantanamo, saying it is divisive. They \nare talking about the whole issue of what is torture. I think it is \nvery important that we separate what is torture from detaining enemy \ncombatants who must be detained because they have information and \nbecause they are either suspects or known terrorists or are self-\nconfessed terrorists who want to harm and kill Americans and our \nallies.\n  So as we are discussing the issue of where they are detained, I think \nwe should put aside the issue of what is torture, which is a legitimate \nissue for discussion but not in where these prisoners are housed. This \nissue should be: Is this a secure facility? Are conditions clean? Does \nit meet the standards of any American prison? Does it protect Americans \nby holding the detainees in a secure place from which it would be very \ndifficult for them to escape?\n\n  One other point, because it has been brought out that we have secure \nprisons in America. Well, there is a difference here because we are \nputting these enemy combatants who do not have an honor code on \nAmerican soil, if that is the choice that is made, and we are also \nallowing people from the outside to then start plotting for their \nescape into America's neighborhoods.\n  I believe the President's initiative saying we would close Guantanamo \nBay within a year is premature, and I am extremely concerned that this \ndeadline, when there is no alternative and no plan for these dangerous \nterrorists, is taking precedence over the plan that must be put forward \nfor the security of Americans.\n  There are five scenarios that have been outlined here on the floor \nabout what we would do with these detainees: hand them over to their \nhome countries for incarceration, transfer them to a neutral country, \ntransfer them to prisons in America, send them to U.S. facilities \nabroad, or release them outright. Unfortunately, every one of these \noptions heightens the threat to the lives of Americans.\n  Let's talk about putting them in America. That is the worst of these \noptions. By taking this action, we allow people to plot the takeover of \na prison or the escape of these detainees, put them in cell phone range \nwhere they could be talking to the outside. That would be the worst \noption.\n  In 2007, the Senate voted 94 to 3 expressing its firm opposition to \nany plans to release Guantanamo detainees into American society or to \nhouse them in American facilities. So what about other countries? What \nabout putting them out into other countries? That, too, is very \ndangerous. In January, it was reported that former Guantanamo detainee \nSaid Ali al-Shihri, who had been released into the custody of Saudi \nArabia, has subsequently resurfaced as a terrorist operative. Today, he \nis one of the al-Qaida leaders in Yemen and is charged with planning \nand executing acts of violence against the United States and its \nallies. He is not the exception. According to the Pentagon, as many as \n61 enemy combatants released from Guantanamo have since reconnected \nwith terrorist networks and renewed their commitment to destroying \nAmerica and our way of life. Even more frightening, these 61 former \nprisoners came from the group of 500 who were deemed ``less dangerous'' \nand thus were released. That means the approximately 270 detainees \ncurrently housed in Guantanamo represent the most nefarious of \nprisoners.\n\n[[Page S5662]]\n\n  Clearly, a viable alternative to Guantanamo has not been identified. \nExpediting closure of this detention facility without absolutely \nassuring that American lives would be safe, not endangered by this act, \nwould place misguided foreign policy goals above the protection of our \nhomeland and our people. Moreover, it signals a dangerous return to the \npre-9/11 mindset.\n  Before setting a deadline to close this facility at Guantanamo Bay--a \nU.S. naval base where they have been secured and from which there have \nbeen no escapes and no attempts to escape--before setting that \ndeadline, the American people must be assured that the transfer or \nrelease of these detainees will not increase the risk to American \ncitizens at home or abroad. As it stands, the administration cannot \ngive that assurance today. We must require a plan before this order is \nexecuted. Not doing so is a pre-9/11 mentality that we cannot afford to \nadopt.\n  We must remember what happened on 9/11. We were complacent. We were a \npeople who never thought we would be attacked on our homeland by people \neven within this society who were helping to plot this destruction. We \ncannot go back to the mentality of ``everything is going to be OK and \nwe won't be attacked again.'' There are people in Guantanamo and all \nover the world today who are plotting to undo the freedom in America \nand the ability to live with diversity and in peace, and we must hold \nup that flag of America and what it represents for the world. That is \nwhat will make America good in the eyes of the world--not releasing \nterrorists to harm other people and our allies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to inquire how much time we have \nbefore the Senator from Hawaii wraps it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me just say that on \nFebruary 2, I was in Guantanamo Bay. It was one of several trips I have \nmade down there. I wish to suggest that one of the trips I made was \nright after 9/11. At that time, I did quite a bit of research to try to \nunderstand why people have this obsession about closing Guantanamo. I \nlooked at the resources down there, and I couldn't figure it out. That \nwas several years ago. Now, as recently as 2 months ago, I still have a \nhard time figuring that out.\n  I wish to suggest to my colleagues--and I have been listening to some \nof those who are objecting to the action we are about to take today--\nthere cannot be a case at all that there are human rights abuses in \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  Eric Holder, the new Attorney General, went down there just a short \nwhile ago. He came back, and he witnessed the same thing I did--he was \ndown there about the same time--that during the recent visit, the \nmilitary detention facilities at Gitmo meet the highest international \nstandards and are in conformity with article 3 of the Geneva \nConvention.\n  Then, on February 20, a short time after that, Vice Chief of Naval \nOperations Admiral Walsh went down and issued a detailed report \nfollowing a 2-week review. I go down for 1 day at a time; he was down \nthere for 2 whole weeks with a whole team. The team conducted multiple \nannounced and unannounced inspections of all of the camps, in daylight \nand at nighttime, keeping in mind that there are six different levels \nof security down there, which is a resource we can't find in any of our \nother installations to which we have access. Anyway, they talked to all \nof the detainees in the yards and everyone else, and they found that \ntheir conditions were in conformity with article 3 of the Geneva \nConvention.\n  So this shouldn't even be controversial. This is something on which \nwe all agree.\n  I would suggest that we don't have any cases where people are being \nneglected. Right now, they have better health care than they have ever \nhad before. There is a medical practitioner, a doctor, a nurse, for \nevery two detainees there. There is even a lawyer for each detainee who \nis there. From their own statements to me, these individuals are eating \nbetter, living better than they have at any other time of their lives.\n  The big problem is, if we did close it, we would have to do something \nwith these people. I heard one of the Senators who is on the opposite \nside of this issue say a few minutes ago: Well, that is fine because \nright now they are disposing of them.\n  They have only, in the last 3 months, found one place. It has dropped \ndown from 241 to 240. If that is a success story, I am not sure I \nunderstand what success is.\n  The bottom line is, there are things down there that we can't \nreplicate anywhere else, and they are being well cared for.\n  One thing that hasn't been talked about enough is the existence of \nthe expeditionary legal complex that is in Gitmo. This took 12 months \nto build. It cost $12 million. This is where they can have tribunals.\n  One of the things people say is: Well, they can be put into our \njustice system.\n  We can't do that because these are detainees, and tribunals have a \ndifferent set of procedures they use and it has to be a special type of \na court that is set up. We do have that provision down there. We do \nhave that court that is set up. We are in the process of trying these \npeople.\n  So if you don't do this, there are a couple of choices--only three \nchoices--on getting rid of these people. One is, you either leave them \nthere and try them and try to adjudicate them or you can send them out \nsomeplace. Well, we have already tried that. Countries won't receive \nthese people, and I can't blame them. The third choice would be to \nsomehow have them intermingled into our system here, set up in some 17, \nas they suggested, places for them. So none of the options are good, \nbut this is one resource that has served America well. We have had it \nsince 1903.\n  I would ask my good friend, the senior Senator from Hawaii, if he \nknows of any deal that America has that is better than this. It is \n$4,000 a year. That is all it costs. So it is a resource we need to \nkeep, we have to keep.\n  The only argument I hear against it is: Oh, the Europeans don't want \nthem. Where are the Europeans? I am getting a little bit tired of \nhaving them dictate what we do in the United States. What if they came \nforward and said: You have to close the Everglades tomorrow. Would we \nroll over and close the Everglades? No, we wouldn't. So I think there \nare a lot of options out there, and this is the best option.\n  Quite frankly, I go a lot further than this amendment. I think we \nneed to keep this resource open. It has served us well in the past, and \nit should serve us well in the future. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Inouye-Inhofe amendment.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, starting from his very first days in \noffice, President Obama has taken bold action to demonstrate to the \nworld that the United States will lead by example, particularly in the \narea of protecting and promoting human rights. I am especially proud \nthat Congress is working with him to help restore faith in the United \nStates as a friend, ally, and leader in the global community. I believe \nAmerican leadership is still sorely needed in the world today. I am \nprivileged to chair the Helsinki Commission, which is one of the key \ntools available to help this administration engage like-minded nations \nwho have made a common commitment to promoting democracy, human rights, \nand the rule of law.\n  I want to make it clear that I fully support President Obama's \ndecision to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In \nrecent years, no other issue has generated as much legitimate criticism \nof the United States as the status and treatment of detainees at \nGuantanamo Bay. Having said that, I think the amendment offered by the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee and the senior Senator from \nOklahoma to strip the Guantanamo funding from the underlying bill makes \nsense. We are not ready to move forward just yet. Reviewing the status \nof and transferring or releasing the detainees is an extremely \ncomplicated matter. It wouldn't be appropriate for any Congress to give \nany administration the funding to do this absent a detailed plan on how \nto proceed. President Obama is working on such a plan\n\n[[Page S5663]]\n\nand I am confident he will provide it to Congress in a timely fashion, \nat which point I am optimistic Congress will indeed provide this \nadministration with the funding it needs to close the detention \nfacility at Guantanamo Bay and begin to address the abuses and excesses \nof the previous administration and repair our badly damaged reputation \nabroad, which is critical to enlisting other nations in the continuing \nstruggle against global terrorism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the Guantanamo \namendment which I offered along with Senator Inhofe. As all of my \ncolleagues know, the amendment would strip the funding from the \nsupplemental that was requested to begin the process of closing \nGuantanamo.\n  Let me say at the outset that despite some of the rhetoric concerning \nthis issue, this amendment is not a referendum on closing Guantanamo. \nInstead, it should serve as a reality check since, at this time, the \nadministration has not yet forwarded a coherent plan for closing this \nprison.\n  In the committee markup, I included language which would have delayed \nthe obligation of funding for Guantanamo until the administration \nforwarded such a plan. I also included provisions which would not have \nallowed prisoners to be relocated to the United States or released if \nthey still pose a threat to our Nation. But after listening to the \ndebate and reading media reports, it became clear that this message was \nnot getting through. Rather than cooling the passions of those who are \njustifiably concerned with the ultimate disposition of the prisoners, \nthe funding which remained in the bill became a lightning rod far \novershadowing its impact and dwarfing the more important elements of \nthis critically needed bill.\n  Instead of letting this bill get bogged down over this matter, as \nchairman of the committee, I determined that the best course was to \neliminate the funds in question. The fact that the administration has \nnot offered a workable plan at this point made that decision rather \neasy.\n  But let me be very clear: We need to close the Guantanamo prison. \nYes, it is a fine facility, state of the art, and I too have visited \nthe prison site. Yes, the detainees are being cared for, with good \nfood, good service, and good medical care. Our service men and women \nare doing great work. But the fact is that Guantanamo is a symbol of \nthe wrongdoings that have occurred, and we must eliminate that \nconnection.\n\n  Guantanamo serves as a sign to many in the Arab and Muslim world of \nthe insensitivities that some under our command demonstrated at the Abu \nGhraib prison. It is a constant reminder that what we call ``enhanced \ninterrogation techniques'' is referred to nearly universally elsewhere \nin the world as torture. Yes, we should not kid ourselves; the fact \nthat Guantanamo remains open today serves as a powerful recruiting tool \nfor al-Qaida.\n  We Americans have short memories, but that is not so in other \ncultures. For example, when the Japanese Prime Minister visited \nYasukini shrine, which commemorates Japanese soldiers from World War \nII, the Chinese were outraged. This controversy was for events that are \nnow more than 65 years old.\n  In Korea, the name of the dictator Toyotomi Hideyoshi is still \nremembered today for the thousands of ears and noses which were cut off \nKoreans and sent to him to prove to him how many Koreans his soldiers \nhad killed. That atrocity is still remembered today by millions of \nKoreans, even though it occurred more than 400 years ago.\n  The dehumanizing photographs of detainees at Abu Ghraib are no longer \nfresh in our minds, but that is not true in the Middle East, where the \npopulace remembers the degradation with disgust. When they think of \nGuantanamo, they remember those photos. Those images are still crystal \nclear to them. The wrongdoing has not been forgotten.\n  The closure of Guantanamo is a requirement for this country to help \novercome some of the ill will still felt by Muslims around the world. \nTo many, Guantanamo is considered an affront to the Muslim religion. \nStories of improper respect for the Koran by prison officials, even \nthough inaccurate, serve as a reminder to millions of Muslims that this \nprison must be closed.\n  Many of our colleagues are justifiably concerned about how the \nterrorists at Guantanamo will be handled. They deserve answers. But so \ntoo we must begin planning to close this prison. That work needs to \nbegin soon for the good of our Nation and the men and women still \nserving in harm's way.\n  It is up to the administration to fashion a plan that can win the \nsupport of the American people and its congressional representatives. \nAs we approach the fiscal year 2010 budget, this will be a key element \nof our continued review of this matter.\n  I support the amendment for the reasons I have stated and urge its \nadoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I continue to believe that President Obama \nmade the right decision to close Guantanamo, and I look forward to \nreviewing his plan to do so. While closing Guantanamo may not be easy, \nit is vital to our national security that we close this prison, which \nis a recruiting tool for our enemies.\n  Mr. INOUYE.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, later today, or at some point in time, \nwith respect to the supplemental, there will be an amendment that will \nseek to strike funds that have been put in this supplemental for the \npurpose of providing additional loan money to the IMF. I would like to \ntalk about that for a moment because this is a proposal of the \nPresident which has the bipartisan support of members of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and it has serious implications with respect to \nthe health of the world's economy. It also has serious implications \nwith respect to America's leadership.\n  Madam President, everybody understands that the United States of \nAmerica is not alone in wrestling with an economic crisis that is \nglobal at this point. We all understand how it began. We understand the \nimplications of our own irresponsibility with respect to the regulatory \nprocess and the greed and other excesses that drove what happened on \nWall Street and what has affected the lives of millions of Americans, \nbut it has also affected the lives of people around the globe. The fact \nis, what started in the United States has now spread to countries \naround the world, and it continues to reverberate beyond our financial \nsystems into all of our economies. The global economic crisis is in \nfact seriously affecting emerging markets and developing countries, and \nthey are now experiencing severe economic declines and massive \nwithdrawals of capital.\n  We don't know yet where this crisis will end, but we know we do have \nan ability to be able to address this crisis in various ways. One of \nthe most powerful instruments, one of the most powerful tools available \nto the leaders of the governmental financial marketplace, is the IMF \nitself. President Obama understood early on that our actions on the \nglobal stage in response to this financial and economic crisis would be \na very important test of America's leadership. That is why in his first \nmajor meeting abroad at the G-20 leader summit in London, the President \ncalled for an expansion of the IMF's new arrangements to borrow. It is \noften referred to just as the NAB--the new arrangements to borrow. The \nPresident proposed expanding that up to about $500 billion in order to \nhelp the world's economies avoid collapse.\n  This crisis of the last months has offered us a vivid illustration of \nhow the increasing interconnectedness of our global economic financial \nsystem actually comes with a greater susceptibility to systemic risk. \nThe IMF contains risk, deals with risk, minimizes risk by serving as a \nbulwark against rolling financial failures, and it addresses volatility \nin the global financial system. The result of that is actually to help \neverybody. The NAB is a contingency fund to which many countries \ncontribute, and today other countries are looking to the United States \nto deliver on our earlier commitment.\n  Japan has committed $100 million, the European Community members have \nalready committed $100 billion, and may well commit up to $160 billion. \nIn the last few weeks, countries such as Canada, Switzerland, China, \nSouth Korea, Norway, Australia, the Czech Republic, India, and others \nhave all offered commitments in the billions of dollars in order to \nsupport the IMF. The President's promise helped to galvanize this \nglobal response, and it is critical that we, the United States, having \ngalvanized this response, having helped to lead people to the watering \nhole, now fulfill our obligations ourselves. We need to do our part, \nand we need to approve the President's request for up to $100 billion \nof authority. In fact, in terms of the budget authority here, this is \nscored at about $5 billion. Why? Because this is a loan process, and it \nis a loan process over which the United States continues to have input \nand the ability, in fact, to help make decisions.\n  The reasons to support the President's request frankly go far beyond\n\n[[Page S5665]]\n\nthe need of other countries at their moment of economic vulnerability. \nA fortified IMF is in our interest also. There are real national \nsecurity concerns about the way this crisis could trigger a political \ncrisis around the world. It is, in fact, a crisis which has already \nbrought down the Governments of Iceland and several east European \ncountries. It has helped to spark riots in Europe and Southeast Asia, \nand it will very likely be a driving political force for a long time to \ncome.\n  For all the volatility that we have seen, Madam President, we value \nour investment in the IMF all the more for the things we have not seen. \nThe fund has been able so far to act swiftly to stave off balance of \npayment crises in countries such as Pakistan. Obviously, whatever we \ncan do to avoid economic crisis in Pakistan right now is critical to \nthe survival of that democracy and to the ultimate success, we hope, \nagainst the insurgencies the Government of Pakistan and the people of \nPakistan are fighting.\n  We are also seeing the steps taken by the IMF thus far are also \nlending strong support to key U.S. allies, including Mexico, Poland, \nand Colombia. These are vulnerable nations with very important American \ninterests at play. Successes obviously don't make headlines the same \nway that failures do, but make no mistake; IMF financing has helped to \nstabilize several potentially volatile situations in this crisis \nalready.\n  Madam President, I am not alone in warning of the security threat \nthat is posed by this crisis. Back in March, the Director of National \nIntelligence, ADM Dennis Blair, testified before Congress about the \nrisks in front of our Nation. This is what he said:\n\n       The primary near-term security concern of the United States \n     is the global economic crisis and its geopolitical \n     implications.\n\n  That is a remarkable statement coming from a person who is in the \nmiddle of struggling with potential dirty bombs and terrorism and \ncounterterrorism and the threat of al-Qaida in various parts of the \nworld. He nevertheless still emphasizes that the primary threat is a \nglobal economic crisis, and I believe we need to understand the full \nimplications of it.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter signed by 14 former National Security Advisers and \nSecretaries of State, Defense, and Treasury, all urging us to move \nexpeditiously to live up to the President's commitment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  The Bretton Woods Committee,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2009.\n       Dear Madam Speaker and Majority Leader Reid: We are writing \n     to express support for the Administration's request for \n     prompt enactment of additional funding for the International \n     Monetary Fund.\n       As you well know, the global economic crisis has had a \n     severe impact on emerging markets and developing countries. \n     As conditions deteriorate in these countries, they endanger \n     America's own growth along with U.S. jobs and exports. The \n     IMF is the best instrument to provide these countries with \n     the short term loans that will enable them to weather the \n     crisis.\n       At the April G-20 Leaders Summit, the President urged other \n     nations to provide additional resources for the IMF. The \n     legislation increases the size and membership in the New \n     Arrangements to Borrow--a contingency facility that will \n     permit continued international lending when the IMF's \n     existing resources are drawn down. The new agreement also \n     opens the way for greater participation by major emerging \n     market countries who will contribute for the first time to \n     this facility.\n       It is important to note that other governments are \n     providing more than 80% of the new funding required, and \n     Japan, China and countries in Europe have already approved \n     their new IMF contributions. As the global economic leader, \n     it is now incumbent on the United States to promptly to meet \n     its obligations.\n       A stronger and more responsive IMF is essential to the \n     restoration of confidence in the global economy and financial \n     system and thus to our own economic recovery. We urge \n     Congress to move expeditiously on the President's request.\n           Respectfully yours,\n         James A. Baker, III; Nicholas F. Brady; Frank C. \n           Carlucci; Henry Paulson; Lee H. Hamilton; Colin L. \n           Powell; Henry Kissinger.\n         Condoleezza Rice; W. Anthony Lake; Robert Rubin; Robert \n           McFarlane; Brent Scowcroft; Paul H. O'Neil; Paul A. \n           Volcker.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I emphasize that the signatures on this \nletter come from both sides of the aisle, from respected public \nservants and admired strategists, such as GEN Brent Scowcroft, Henry \nKissinger, Colin Powell, James Baker, Robert Rubin, Lee Hamilton, and \nPaul Volcker. All of them urge us to complete the task of providing the \nsupport funding for the IMF.\n  If there is one lesson we should take away from the worst impacts of \nthis global crisis, it is that we should never underestimate the \nseverity of these economic challenges or the urgency of tackling them \nhead on rather than deferring the tough decisions. The IMF needs a \nrobust contingency fund. Let me emphasize this is a contingency fund. \nThis is a fund that doesn't represent money that is transferred to the \nIMF, and then they take on some spending spree, nor does it represent \nmoney that goes to the IMF and is used for IMF expenses. This is a \ndirect loan program--loan only--and in the past the United States has \nactually made money when we have made these loans.\n  The fact is that this financial crisis is still brewing. For example, \nin central and Eastern Europe, in this part of the world where we saw \nthe Berlin Wall and a repressive Communist regime of Eastern Europe \ncrash down 20 years ago, we see the risk that if we don't act, it is \npossible that the economies of Eastern Europe will come crashing down \ntoo. Then we will replace an era of promise and progress in Eastern \nEurope with one of soaring unemployment, instability, and a \nretrenchment of the influence and ideals that we have been investing in \nand helping those countries to put more permanently in place.\n  The IMF is the best channel for providing balance of payment \nassistance to emerging and developing markets that are currently \nsuffering as a consequence of their economies and banking systems. In \nsome cases, political systems are collapsing around them. The \nalternative to having a legitimate and robust IMF to deal with \ncountries at risk is, frankly, not a pretty one. IMF loans come with \nstrings attached, but they are mainly financial strings not strategic \nstrings.\n  As we balance the domestic and global demands of this crisis, we need \nto be warned that in cutting corners for short-term savings, we risk \ncreating far greater costs down the road. As it stands now, the large \nand urgent financing needs projected for emerging markets and \ndeveloping countries cannot be met from existing IMF lending reserves. \nThere is no cost-free, risk-free option, and lendings to the new \narrangements for borrowing allows us to leverage our contribution \ntoward a global capacity to manage economic risks. Managing those risks \nbenefits all of us.\n  The reasons to act, in fact, go well beyond foreign policy interests. \nThis is not a foreign policy issue. In fact, our domestic economic \ninterests are also vulnerable if we fail to stem economic crises in \nother countries.\n  Why is that? Well, for a very simple reason. Expanding the IMF's NAB \nresources is actually essential to our overall strategy for restoring \nthe health of the U.S. economy, for our exports, and it helps us to \nsecure U.S. jobs.\n  Some in America might take the short-term view. We have heard that \nbefore. Some in America may try to appeal to the lowest common \ndenominator and say to people: Well, why on Earth are we sending money \nto some fund that might, in fact, help a foreign country, when we ought \nto be just focused on the bailout at home? Well, the reality is that is \na completely, totally false choice. The truth is, America's economic \nrecovery depends not just on our own stimulus package and on spending \nhere, and not just on fiscal and monetary policy and programs that \nsustain domestic demand, but we also need to sustain demand abroad. We \nsell to those countries. We have millions of Americans making products \nthat go to those countries and, in fact, those emerging markets in \ndeveloping countries have been, up until now, some of the best growth \nopportunities for American investment and for American jobs to be able \nto supply goods.\n  Economic growth abroad helps us to kick economic growth into gear at \nhome. That is why we need the IMF to help protect the markets we export \nto and from which they import American products.\n\n[[Page S5666]]\n\n  Let me just be specific about that. Between 2003 and 2008, U.S. \nexports grew by 8 percent per year in real terms. Since 2000, our \nexports show a 95-percent correlation to foreign country growth rates. \nIn large part, our economy was benefiting from the rapid growth of \nother economies in other parts of the world. During that period, the \nrole of exports in driving American economic growth actually increased. \nThe share of all U.S. growth attributable to export growth rose from 25 \npercent in 2003 to almost 50 percent in 2007, and then almost 70 \npercent in 2008.\n  Now, unfortunately, our exports peaked in July of last year, and they \nhave been falling ever since then. Most of our partners are in \nrecession. In the first quarter of 2009, our real exports were 23 \npercent lower than in the first quarter of 2008.\n  Our export decline is now contributing to the recession in the United \nStates. With an export share in GDP of 12 percent, a 23-percent decline \nof that share of GDP, if you sustain that 23 percent over the course of \nthe year it actually makes a negative contribution to the GDP of the \nUnited States of 2.5 percent. In other words, if our domestic demand \nwere stagnant, our GDP would fall by nearly 3 percent. With that, we \nlose a lot of jobs and a lot of the struggle to get our economy back \ninto gear just becomes that much more complicated and that much more \ndelayed.\n  Congress passed, and the President signed, a stimulus plan that is \ndesigned to boost domestic demand. But if we fail to act, all the money \nwe have spent to stimulate our own economy could actually be offset \ncompletely by the decline in exports.\n  We need to help these foreign countries lift themselves out of \nrecession. Our recovery now depends on many of these countries that are \nnow at risk. Some foreign countries can take care of themselves with a \nstimulus of their own and in cleaning up their own banking sectors. But \nmany other countries, especially emerging market economies, have been \nso hard hit that they need a helping hand.\n  Some countries have been cut off abruptly from capital markets and \nshut out of the credit markets by the banking problems originating in \nthe United States and Europe. Let me give an example. We exported to a \nlot of countries our notions about how one ought to bank and how you, \nin fact, use banks to leverage and to go out and create jobs by \ninvesting in businesses. The fact is that many banks in Western Europe \npracticed that so effectively that they bought up banks in Eastern \nEurope, and so banks in parts of Eastern Europe, when they stopped \nlending, stopped lending because the banks in the western part of \nEurope are taking care of their immediate home-based problems and their \ncapital problems, and the result is those eastern economies are \nparticularly hard hit. This crisis actually started with us, and it is \nreverberating because of this and these systemic failures, and it will \nhurt more if it reverberates back to us because we failed to help some \nof those countries to hold up the export demand as well as to sustain \ntheir political systems which we have invested in very deeply since the \nend of the Cold War.\n  As countries recover, the United States is going to gain. We are \ngoing to be spared the risk of an even more precipitous decline in our \nexports, with greater job loss. In time, our export growth will resume \nand people in export industries across our country are going to be able \nto go back to work.\n  While we take part in a global effort to increase the NAB, we also \nhave to shore up our influence inside the IMF and give greater voice to \nthe emerging markets. The President is looking to increase by \napproximately $8 billion America's quota subscription to the IMF. These \nquotas actually determine how the IMF assigns voting rights, and it \ndecides on access to IMF funding. This increase in the U.S. quota is \npart of a larger practice to address long overdue governance reform and \ncreate greater legitimacy for the IMF.\n  It is also part of a two-way street. If we want major exporting \ncompanies to step up and contribute for the first time to, amongst \nother things, this expanded NAB facility, then we need to show that \nthey can have a larger voice in the IMF itself. It also makes certain \nthe United States can keep its current voting weight in order to \nmaintain our leadership in the IMF so we have the ability to shape the \nfuture of the institution.\n  Before I finish, I would like to directly speak to two misconceptions \nthat I think are involved in the amendment that will seek to strike \nthis particular portion. The first is a very important point, and I \nwish to emphasize it. I spoke about it a moment ago, but I really wish \nto emphasize it.\n  The United States, in providing lending money to the New Arrangements \nto Borrow, to the IMF, is not giving away money. We are not spending \nmoney. This is a deposit fund. It goes into an account, and we get an \nIMF interest-bearing asset in exchange for those funds. It actually can \nturn out to be a good investment because, while we participate in the \nIMF because of the enormous benefit it brings to the United States and \nto the world in terms of emerging countries and their markets, in fact, \nthe United States has earned money historically on its participation in \nthe IMF. According to the Treasury Department's most recent report to \nCongress, the fact is, we have been on the plus side. This is not a \npayout, therefore, of the IMF; it is an exchange of assets. We put \nassets in the fund, and we get an interest-bearing asset in exchange \nfor those funds. This is a particular arrangement that has worked out \nvery sufficiently for the U.S. Treasury in the past.\n  Second, let me be very clear on what is being asked here. The NAB, \nthe New Arrangements to Borrow, is a contingency fund to be used only \nwhen other resources of the IMF are exhausted. The United States and \nother members of the NAB have control over these funds, and the IMF \nneeds to get approval from the NAB providers in order to draw down on \nthese funds. So we have to think of this as an insurance fund over \nwhich the United States continues to have control.\n  We have before us legislation to replenish the IMF's resources just \nin time for it to be able to stand up and help fight this crisis. With \nthis money, the IMF will be able to help many countries revive their \neconomies. With this money, the IMF will be ready in case the crisis \ndeepens and creates more victims. With this money, America is able to \nlead at a moment of crisis and keep the promise of the President and \nhelp us to sustain the viability of emerging markets and countries, \nwhich is vital in the context of the struggle against extremism and \nreligious fanaticism and terrorism, which we see has its prime targets \nin places that are failing. The ability to be able to prevent that \nfailure is in the strategic as well as in the economic interests of our \ncountry. The world is looking to us to keep our word.\n  I urge support for the request of the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator form Georgia is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1164\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

I know the Senator from Iowa wishes to speak, but first \nI ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd, Senator Lieberman, and \nSenator Chambliss be added to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, this amendment is very simple. You \nheard me many times come to the floor to talk about the housing tax \ncredit. The tax credit we finally amended to repeal the payback \nprovision of $8,000 for first-time home buyers has brought an \nimprovement in home sales of 40 percent at the entry level.\n  This amendment merely removes the means test of a maximum income of \n$150,000 for a couple and $75,000 for an individual, and it removes the \nmeans test that they have to be a first-time home buyer, which means \nany home buyer buying a home for their principal residence would \nreceive an $8,000 tax credit and there would be no limitation to their \nincome to disqualify them.\n  I have always fought on this floor for a maximum tax credit of \n$15,000, and I know how difficult that has been. But in the evidence of \nwhat has happened with the current $8,000 with the means test, by \nremoving it I am confident we will have a significant improvement in \nthe housing market in America, which in turn will cause a significant \nimprovement in the economy of the United States of America, as happened \nin 1968, 1974, 1981, 1982 and 1990 to 1991. Housing took America into a \nrecession, and it was only when it recovered that America began to come \nout.\n  This improvement in that amendment, with this amendment, will be \nbetter for the people of the United States of America and better for \nour economy. I encourage my colleagues at an appropriate time to cast a \nfavorable vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1140, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I have a unanimous consent request that \nhas been cleared. I ask unanimous consent that the pending Brownback \namendment be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n      Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Secretary of Defense should consult with State and local \n     government officials before making any decision about where \n     detainees at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, might be \n     transferred, housed, or otherwise incarcerated as a result of \n     the implementation of the Executive Order of the President to \n     close the detention facilities at Naval Station Guantanamo \n     Bay.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I wish to speak about the effort that \nseems to be underway here now--and I guess we will be having some more \namendments this afternoon from the other side of the aisle--to prevent \nthe President from addressing a serious national security problem: the \ncontinued operation of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n  It is long past time we close this facility. On May 23, 2007, almost \nexactly 2 years ago, I introduced legislation to close that detention \ncenter. Since that time, unfortunately, it has only become more \nimperative that we act. It remains the case that there is simply no \ncompelling reason to keep the facility open and not to bring the \ndetainees to maximum-security facilities here in the United States.\n  This Nation has long been a beacon of democracy, a champion of human \nrights throughout the world. Over the past 8 years, however, we have \nrepeatedly betrayed our highest principles. Torture was authorized in \ndirect violation of the law, and we intentionally put detainees beyond \nthe most basic rules of law, including secret tribunals where detainees \nlacked opportunities to challenge their confinement and lacked \nsufficient due process.\n  These errors are manifest in the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, \nwhere the very purpose was to avoid providing legal safeguards that are \nenshrined in our Constitution and the Geneva Conventions to detainees \nand to prevent independent courts from reviewing the legality of the \nadministration's actions. That was the purpose of Guantanamo as a \ndetention center. Now that the Supreme Court has definitively ruled \nthat constitutional protections apply at Guantanamo, it truly serves no \npurpose.\n  Closing the facility, however, does not just follow from a commitment \nto our most cherished values and constitutional principles; rather, \nclosure is essential for our national security. As long as the \ndetention center at Guantanamo Bay is open, it remains a recruiting \ntool for those who wish to do us harm and provides ammunition for our \nenemies.\n\n[[Page S5668]]\n\n  This is not just my view but is the view of military and foreign \npolicy officials. The Director of National Intelligence, Dennis Blair, \nhas said:\n\n       The detention center has become a damaging symbol for the \n     world . . . it is a rallying cry for terrorist recruitment \n     and harmful to our national security, so closing it is \n     important for our national security.\n\n  That is from Dennis Blair, our Director of National Intelligence.\n  Former Navy general counsel Alberto Mora has said:\n\n       There are serving U.S. flag-rank officers who maintain that \n     the first and second identifiable causes of U.S. combat \n     deaths in Iraq--as judged by their effectiveness in \n     recruiting insurgent fighters into combat--are, respectively, \n     the symbols of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.\n\n  Retired Air Force MAJ Matthew Alexander, who led the interrogation \nteam that tracked down Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaida in \nIraq, said:\n\n       I listened time and time again to foreign fighters, and \n     Sunni Iraqis, state that the number one reason they had \n     decided to pick arms and join al-Qaida was the abuses at Abu \n     Ghraib and the authorized torture and abuse at Guantanamo \n     Bay.\n\n  Let me repeat that. Matthew Alexander, a retired Air Force major who \nled the interrogation team who tracked down the leader of al-Qaida in \nIraq said this.\n\n       I listened time and time again to foreign fighters, and \n     Sunni Iraqis, state that the number one reason that they had \n     picked up arms and joined al-Qaida was the abuse at Abu \n     Ghraib and the authorized torture and abuse at Guantanamo \n     Bay.\n\n  It cannot get much clearer than that. Colin Powell, Henry Kissinger, \nMadeline Albright, James Baker, Warren Christopher have all called for \nGuantanamo to be closed, as has Secretary of Defense Gates and Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs Admiral Mullen.\n  As former Secretary of State Colin Powell said:\n\n       Guantanamo has become a major, major problem . . . if it \n     were up to me, I would close Guantanamo not tomorrow but this \n     afternoon.\n\n  That was Colin Powell.\n  Indeed, even President Bush repeated time and time again his desire \nto shut down Guantanamo, I am sure because of all the information that \nwas given to him by his Joint Chiefs of Staff and by his intelligence \nservices. So President Obama should be applauded for taking a step that \nmilitary and foreign policy officials insist will directly and \nimmediately improve our national security.\n  The President has set up a special task force to review the status of \nthe detainees remaining at Guantanamo and to make recommendations on \nwhat to do with these individuals. The administration faces some \ndifficult decisions it inherited from the previous administration.\n  Guantanamo was conceived--Guantanamo as a detention center, I should \nsay, was conceived outside the law. And bringing detainees back into \nour legal system, as the Supreme Court has rightly found necessary, \ninvolves some very difficult policy issues.\n  I, myself, greatly look forward to the President's plan, and I will \njudge it carefully. Closing Guantanamo and simply replicating the same \ndeficient legal process in the United States would be purely symbolic \nand meaningless.\n  As the administration undertakes its review of the detainees at \nGuantanamo and considers the most appropriate way to close the \nfacility, the last thing Congress should do is handcuff the President.\n  What I am hearing are some arguments on the other side of the aisle \nbasically saying, through these amendments they are offering, \nGuantanamo Bay should remain open. That is the thrust of the \namendments: Guantanamo should remain open.\n  Make no mistake, if these amendments become law, the President's \nability to take the step that military and foreign policy officials--\nRepublicans and Democrats and Independents alike--have all said is \nneeded will be very difficult. It will be difficult for the President \nto take the steps necessary to close Guantanamo Bay. Al-Qaida and those \nwho wish to cause us harm will continue to have a major recruiting tool \nat their disposal.\n  I would not say this is the intention of the people offering those \namendments, but listen to what our intelligence officers have said and \nwhat our military officers have said, that the biggest recruiting tool \nfor those in Afghanistan and the Taliban and al-Qaida is a continued \ndetention center at Guantanamo Bay.\n  So while it may not be the intention of those people offering the \namendments to have this as a recruiting tool for al-Qaida and the \nTaliban, those who have been in our intelligence service tell us that \nis, in fact, what is happening. It is the biggest recruiting tool for \nthose who wish to do us harm. While it may not be the intention of \nthose offering the amendments, that is what is going to be the \npractical effect, if those amendments are adopted.\n  One other thing. President Obama's decision to close Guantanamo Bay \nis already starting to pay some dividends. Countries such as Portugal \nand Ireland have made offers to join Albania in accepting detainees who \ncannot be returned to their home countries.\n  Just last week, France accepted Lakhdar Boumediene, an Algerian \nsuspected in a bomb plot against the Embassy of the United States in \nSarajevo. The assistance of our allies is critical. Yet to obtain that \nassistance will only be more difficult if we, ourselves, are unwilling \nto do what we ask our allies to do; that is, to accept detainees on our \nown soil in secure detention facilities.\n  We say: Oh, no, we cannot take them here but, France, you can take \nthem and, Ireland, you can take them, and Portugal. They will say what \nkind of fairness is there in that?\n  Indeed, I feel the statements and the arguments of many on the other \nside of the aisle are simply to scare the American people, unduly scare \nthe American people, and spread this kind of fear and misinformation by \nsuggesting that closing the facility at Guantanamo Bay will somehow \nmean the terrorists will be walking Main Street or, as the junior \nSenator from Arizona claimed: Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and his partners \nwill be our neighbors--will be our neighbors if they are in secure \ndetention facilities.\n  This is the kind of language that rightfully gets Americans fearful \nthat they are going to be our neighbors. Well, the fact is, those \nindividuals who can be tried in Federal court can and will be \nvigorously prosecuted. Federal courts have successfully prosecuted \nterrorists in the past. In fact, between September 12, 2001, and the \nend of 2007, 145 terrorists were convicted in American courts. How many \nAmerican people know that, that 145 were convicted in American courts.\n  Likewise, U.S. prisons are already holding some of the world's most \ndangerous terrorists in the United States. Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind \nof the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, is in jail in the United \nStates.\n  Zacarias Moussaoui, the 9/11 coconspirator, is in jail in the United \nStates; Richard Reid, the ``shoe bomber,'' in jail in the United \nStates. Several al-Qaida terrorists responsible for bombing Embassies \nin Kenya and Tanzania are in jail in the United States.\n  The men, women, and military officials who run these facilities have \na proven track record. I ask those who are saying that Khalid Shaikh \nMohammed and his partners will be our neighbors, I ask them: Can you \npoint to any prisoner who has escaped from a Federal maximum security \nfacility? Point to one. Just point to one.\n  Well, we have no greater duty than to protect the American people. \nThat is the oath we all take. National security is our first job. In \nthis regard, the President is undertaking a process that will result in \nthe closing of a national stain on our character and a recruiting tool \nfor those who wish to do us harm.\n  He is taking a step our military and foreign policy officials make \nclear will make us safer. The President should not be handcuffed and \nshould not be prevented from improving our national security, as the \nother side in those amendments wish to do.\n  Finally, we must never forget that people around the world know we \nare right and the terrorists are wrong. Of the 5 or 6 billion people \nwho live in the world, only a handful think the terrorists are right. \nAll the rest are on our side. They know we are right and the terrorists \nare wrong.\n  If we wish to defeat the terrorists, therefore, we should remain \nfaithful to our ideals and our values. We will not win this war with \nsecret prisons, with torture chambers, with degrading treatment, with \nindividuals denied basic human rights.\n\n[[Page S5669]]\n\n  Rather, we will win this by upholding our values and insisting on \nlegal safeguards that are the very basis of our system of Government \nand democracy. It is time to close Guantanamo Bay. There is no reason \nto keep it open and every reason, for our national security, to shut \nits doors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nLugar, Isakson, Collins, and Bennett be added as cosponsors to this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I am pleased to offer this amendment \nwith my colleagues, Senator Graham of South Carolina and Senator \nLieberman. This amendment would basically do two things.\n  Today, we have before us a supplemental appropriations bill. A large \namount of the money in this bill is for our military operations and \nother operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This amendment is being \noffered without criticism. But, in fact, what we have today is a major \nshift in our policies in Afghanistan and Pakistan. I doubt that there \nis a person in this body who can clearly articulate what our mission is \nin these two countries, to the standpoint of actually laying out \nobjectives.\n  I think many Senators were part of a luncheon we had 2 weeks ago \nwhere, when the President of Afghanistan was asked what our mission was \nin Afghanistan, he could not articulate in any way that was \ncomprehendible what our mission was in that country.\n  I do not offer those comments again in criticism. I realize there are \na lot of changes underway. I realize there is going to be a new general \non the ground; possibly it will take until August for that confirmation \nto take place.\n  I realize this administration is working with many agencies in trying \nto develop a plan that will be effective in this country. If one were \nto listen to the state of the mission, one would think our mission is \nvery similar in Afghanistan to that of Iraq, minus actually having a \ndemocratically functioning government.\n  I know all of us have had some concerns about some of the issues \nwithin Government in both countries and where Government funding \nactually ends up. So this is an amendment, a bipartisan amendment, that \nis being put forth asking the administration to do two things: Asking \nthat we, in essence, all understand this policy so that, in fact, we \nhave a policy that is equal to the tremendous sacrifice our men and \nwomen in uniform are putting forth on our behalf and do so daily.\n  First of all, the amendment would require the President to submit to \nCongress a clear statement of objectives for Afghanistan and Pakistan \nand the benchmarks that will be used to quantify progress toward \nachieving those objectives.\n  Again, this is not tying their hands. There are no timetables that \nsay certain things have to happen by a certain time. This is, in \nessence, asking the administration to lay out to us so we all know and \ncan articulate those and, hopefully, even our men and women in the \nfield can articulate these, to lay those out in a way by which we can \nunderstand the benchmarks.\n  Then, secondly, it asks that they come before us and actually give us \nquarterly updates, after a period of time, toward those objectives and \nhow they are actually progressing. I would hope that actually, at some \npoint, the managers of the bill might be able to even accept this by \nunanimous consent because I cannot imagine why anybody in this body \nwould want to vote the billions and billions of dollars toward these \nefforts that we rightfully are supporting today--do not get me wrong, \nbut I cannot imagine not wanting the administration to come back to us \nwith these benchmarks and these objectives so we all can measure our \nprogress there.\n  We have been there 8 years. Our men and women in uniform have given \nand given and given; many have lost their lives, many have lost limbs. \nIt would seem to me that everyone in this body, regardless of which \nside of the aisle they are on, would want to clearly understand what \nour mission is there and our way of evaluating that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S5670]]\n\n   (Purpose: To increase the authorized end strength for active duty \n                         personnel of the Army)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n       Sec. 315. (a) Increase in Fiscal Year 2009 Authorized End \n     Strength for Army Active Duty Personnel.--Paragraph (1) of \n     section 401 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417; \n     122 Stat. 4428) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) The Army, 547,400.''.\n       (b) Increase in Permanent Active Duty End Strength Minimum \n     Level for Army Personnel.--Paragraph (1) of section 691 of \n     title 10, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) For the Army, 547,400.''.\n       (c) Funding.--\n       (1) Military personnel, army.--The amount appropriated by \n     this title under the heading ``Military Personnel, Army'' is \n     hereby increased by $200,000,000, with the amount of such \n     increase to be available for purposes of costs of personnel \n     in connection with personnel of the Army on active duty in \n     excess of 547,400 personnel of the Army.\n       (2) Operation and maintenance, army.--The amount \n     appropriated by this title under the heading ``Operation and \n     Maintenance, Army'' is hereby increased by $200,000,000, with \n     the amount of such increase to be available for purposes of \n     costs of operation and maintenance in connection with \n     personnel of the Army on active duty in excess of 547,400 \n     personnel of the Army.\n       (3) Limitation on availability.--Amounts appropriated by \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be available only for the \n     purposes specified in such paragraph.\n       (4) Emergency requirement.--For purposes of Senate \n     enforcement, the amounts appropriated by paragraphs (1) and \n     (2) are designated as an emergency requirement and necessary \n     to meet emergency needs pursuant to section 403 of S. Con. \n     Res. 13 (111th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2010.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I am very pleased to rise now to \noffer this amendment on behalf of a bipartisan group: Senators Thune, \nBegich, Graham, and Burris, all of us members of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  I take the floor today to speak on their behalf and mine for a \nconstituency that every Member of the Senate represents; and that is, \nthe men and women who serve in the U.S. Army.\n  On September 11, 2001, the Army's active-duty strength was just \n480,000, after a decade in which we in Congress cut it nearly in half \nafter the Cold War ended.\n  In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, many Members of \nCongress urged a major expansion of the military and the Army for the \nyears of war that were clearly ahead. But, unfortunately, that did not \nhappen. We watched with growing concern as our soldiers--members of a \nforce too small for the missions we had assigned to them--served \nthrough repeated deployments, heroically, but under increasing stress.\n  Finally, 3 years ago, the administration and Congress increased the \nsize of the active-duty component of the U.S. Army from 480,000--the \nlevel on 9/11--to 547,400. That was to be realized over a period of \nyears.\n  In February of this year, the Army reached that goal well ahead of \nthe schedule that had been originally anticipated, fortunately, because \nevery man and woman who joined the Army is necessary and has been \ncritically necessary. So now we actually have 549,000 active-duty \nsoldiers.\n  Recall that I said the statutory end strength of the Army is 547,400. \nSo the Army now is literally at a strength greater than its current \nauthorization. This achievement expresses the patriotic commitment of \nthe American men and women who have answered the call of duty. In other \nwords, recruitments and reenlistments have been so high that there are \nmore people in the Army than the statutory end strength.\n  But there is still not enough. I will explain why.\n  Growing the force was clearly necessary to support our troops in the \nArmy, our soldiers who are bearing the major responsibility for the \nwars we have been fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. But these increased \nnumbers simply have not proved sufficient to relieve the continued \nstrain on our soldiers. That is what this amendment intends to do \nduring the remainder of this fiscal year, covered by this supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  I want to talk about dwell time. It is a term the military uses. What \nis ``dwell time''? It is down time but not R time. It is time that is \nspent back here at home in the bases, with the families, not just \nrecovering from the last deployment, but also, obviously, preparing and \ntraining and upgrading for the next. And perhaps most significantly to \nthe men and women of the Army, it is precious time for our soldiers to \nspend with their families.\n  Today, dwell time of members of the U.S. Army is about slightly more \nthan 1 to 1. That means for every year of deployment, they are back \nhome at the base, training, preparing, spending time with their family, \nfor a year--1 to 1.\n  General Casey said--and everybody in our military says--that is \nsimply inadequate; too much duty, too quickly, too much stress on our \nmen and women in the U.S. Army, in the military.\n  General Casey said he has the goal to get the ratio to 1 to 2--2 \nyears at home for every 1 year out at war--and to do so by 2011. In \nfact, he would like to take it higher than the 1 to 2--beyond that--\nhoping that our conflicts we are in in Iraq and Afghanistan do not \nrequire that many American military by that time.\n  Incidentally, the dwell-time ratio is particularly dire for a \ncategory in our Army called ``enablers.'' They are involved as Army \naviators, engineers, people involved in intelligence, surveillance, and \nreconnaissance work. They really are under dwell-time pressure.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, the Obama administration is \nimplementing what I consider to be a very responsible strategy, and a \ncorrect strategy, for drawing down our force in Iraq. But if you \ncombine the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and the planned increase in Army \npresence in Afghanistan, as we slowly decrease in Iraq, Army \ndeployments will actually increase for the rest of this year.\n  This is what General Casey, the Army Chief of Staff, said to the \nArmed Services Committee the other day: It is a simple question of \nsupply and demand. If the supply of the Army stays only constant or \neven goes down, and yet the demand--which is the increasing deployments \nfor at least the remainder of this year, and probably well into next \nyear--goes up, the dwell time--the time these soldiers of ours, heroes \nof ours, have to spend away from the war zone back at base--will not \nrise from the unacceptable level it is at now.\n  Our military leadership has made clear in public statements that \nthings are going to get worse before they get better.\n  Army Chief of Staff Casey recently warned that the number of deployed \nsoldiers will actually, as I said, rise through the rest of the year. \nAdmiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate \nArmed Services Committee last week that the Army faces a ``very rough \ntime'' over at least the next 2 years before it reaches what Admiral \nMullen called the ``light at the end of the tunnel.''\n  Keep in mind, these predictions do not reflect or absorb the \npossibility of a new crisis or new crises elsewhere in the world \noutside of Iraq and Afghanistan--what such a crisis would place in the \nway of additional demands on our soldiers--a possibility that recent \nexperience warns us to at least keep in mind as a possibility.\n  So we are in a situation now where we have a constant level of \nsoldiers on Active Duty, demand in the short term going up, and, \ntherefore, dwell time--time away from the battlefield--not rising. This \nequation leads to strain and stress on our soldiers. Unfortunately, \nthere are facts that show this strain and stress. The Army is on track \nthis year to overtake the grim record of suicides of our Active-Duty \nArmy personnel that we saw last year, in 2008. The murder a week or two \nago of five soldiers by a fellow soldier in Baghdad was a devastating \nexample, I fear, of the stress on our deployed force. We hear \nincreasingly stories of the stress on the families back home. Any of us \nwho have visited military bases, spoken to the families, hear this \nconstantly as a growing appeal to do something to increase the dwell \ntime. The fact is, we are not, and that really does hurt.\n  I think we can say--as was said the other day at an Armed Services \nCommittee hearing by witnesses before us from the Defense Department \nwho were talking about all we are doing to improve the quality of life \nof our men and women in uniform, including housing for their families, \nhealth care, childcare, et cetera, et cetera--benefits--all true. So we \nare improving the benefits to our men and women in the\n\n[[Page S5671]]\n\nU.S. Army, but so long as there are not enough of them, which there are \nnot today, the major factor of stress, which is how often, how many \ntimes are they going to be sent back to Iraq and Afghanistan, or how \nfrequently, will not change. That is what this amendment aims to do \nsomething about.\n  I wish to make clear what is obvious to everyone: that our Army is \nnot broken. This is the greatest--this is the next greatest generation \nof the American military, performing with unbelievable skill, heroism, \nresilience, agility, and personal compassion in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nOur Army is not broken, but it is, as General Casey said the other day, \nout of balance. Secretary of the Army Geren said--summarizing this part \nof his testimony before the Armed Services Committee--the U.S. Army is \n``busy, stretched, and stressed.'' And he is right. We have to give \nthose heroes in uniform some help, and the best help we can give them \nis more people in uniform fighting alongside them.\n  Here is a strange twist. In the face of the current crisis in \nmanpower, the administration has been forced to effectively direct the \nArmy to not only stop growing but to actually shrink by the end of the \nyear as deployments overseas increase, dropping back from over 549,000 \nsoldiers to the statutory limit of 547,400. In other words, this \nsupplemental appropriations bill closes a gap that existed in the \nArmy's ability to pay for the 547,400 they are entitled to, but they \nare still over by 1,600 soldiers. Therefore, there is a guidance out \nthat directs the Army to take drastic measures to cut back; in fact, \nreducing their recruiting goals this year by 13,000 soldiers, which the \nArmy knows it can meet, and cutting its retention goal by 10,000 \ntroops, which the Army also knows it can meet. So here we have this \nironic--really worse than that--moment where we need more troops and \nmore soldiers and the Army is going to be forced to cut back.\n  I must tell my colleagues that I think it is going to be hard to \nshrink the Army in this way by the end of this year because so many of \nour troops are reenlisting, which is quite remarkable--so committed to \nthe cause, proud of their service, want to keep fighting for the United \nStates alongside the others in their unit. Obviously, some are affected \nby the economy and the instability and difficulty in finding job \nopportunities in the economy.\n  So I think it would be a terrible mistake to order the Army to cut \nits ranks at this time, which would mean less dwell time for our \nsoldiers. That is why Senators Graham, Begich, Thune, Burris, and I \nintroduced this bipartisan amendment which would enable the Army to \nmaintain its current strength and continue to grow for the remainder of \nthis fiscal year as the Secretary of Defense determines. No compulsion \nhere.\n  Current law forces the Army to get smaller before the end of the \nyear. This amendment would say it can grow beyond the 547,400 within \nthe limit of the waiver that the Army has, and it provides the money to \ndo that, which is an additional $400 million for the remainder of this \nfiscal year--frankly, a small price. It is a significant amount of \nmoney, but when we think about the impact it will have on the lives of \njust about every man and woman wearing the proud uniform of the U.S. \nArmy, it is more than worth it.\n  I wish to explain, while I have a moment and while I see no one else \non the Senate floor, that the amendment literally will increase the \nminimum end strength for the Active-Duty Army from the statutory level \nit is at now up to 547,400. When that point is reached, it gives the \nSecretary of the Army a 2-percent waiver, and that means that working \nwith the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army could actually \nraise the Army as high as 558,000 by the end of the fiscal year. I \ndon't expect that to be possible in the next few months, but it gives \nthat latitude and the money to back it up.\n  The second part of the amendment provides additional funds to help \nthe Army cover the immediate personnel shortfall it faces because of \nthe toll the ongoing conflicts are taking on the force.\n  If I may add just this final argument of reality. The Vice Chief of \nStaff, Peter Chiarelli, told the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on \nReadiness last month that the Army has about 30,000 soldiers among that \ncurrent 549,000 who are, for one reason or another--three reasons, \nactually--not available to meet the requirements of the Army, not able \nto be directly involved.\n  For example, nearly 10,000 soldiers now either serve as Wounded \nWarriors or support their recovery, while thousands more are not \ndeployable because of injuries they have suffered, often not in \nconflict, but that are, nonetheless, though less severe, disabling \nenough that they can't be deployed. So the truth is, there already is a \n30,000-gap beneath the 549,000 that is on the books as actively \ndeployed.\n  The best way to honor the sacrifice and service of these soldiers \nwill be to ensure that their brothers and sisters in arms go to battle \nwith reinforcements who can take their place; to guarantee that the \nArmy can build those enabler units I talked about that the service \nneeds most now on the front lines in Afghanistan and Iraq--and both \nbattlefields are now beginning to compete for those uniquely trained \nenablers; and to provide the Army leadership with the flexibility it \nneeds to have the manpower for the theater while giving our troops more \ntime at home.\n  I wish to go to two final questions. Would growing the force today \nrelieve the strain on the force when it matters most? And is this a \nproposal we can afford? In terms of the first, we know the greatest \ndemand in the theater falls upon our most junior soldiers, such as the \nArmy's privates and specialists who face the most difficult dwell time \nratios in the force and keep going back and forth.\n  If we commit to growing the force now, these are the types of troops \nwe can recruit, train, and deploy in this time of greatest need, and we \ncan retain them. In short, if provided the additional personnel, the \nU.S. Army can definitely use them and use them well.\n  In terms of the second question, of course, I am concerned about the \nlong-term costs of increasing the size of the force. The price of \nmilitary personnel has risen over the past decade because we better \nrecognize the service of our soldiers, and we are taking better care of \nthem. Nonetheless, I don't see how we can explain to our soldiers and \ntheir families that we in Congress decided that we could not afford \nreinforcements at a time when the force is so stressed under the strain \nof war and still performing so brilliantly.\n  The Army is not broken, I wish to stress. It is out of balance, and \nit needs our support to come into balance. This amendment would provide \nthe funds to give the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of \nDefense the option--not mandatory--to raise the number of Active-Duty \nmilitary personnel, from now until the end of this fiscal year, to a \nlevel above--slightly above--the 547,400 now statutorily authorized.\n  I hope our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join us in \ngiving this amendment unanimous support. I honestly think it is just \nabout the best thing we can do for the heroes of the U.S. Army who \nserve us every day to protect our security and our freedom.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I call up the Lieberman-Graham amendment \nNo. 1157.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I will talk about the amendment, if I \nmay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for that purpose.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I wished to thank Senator Lieberman for \nhis leadership on this issue. We have been working together on what I \nthink is a very big deal for the American people in the overall war \neffort. As many of you know, particularly our colleagues and the public \nat large, we have had a discussion in this Nation about whether we \nshould release more\n\n[[Page S5672]]\n\nphotos showing detainee abuse in the past.\n  The President of the United States has decided to stand for the \nproposition that releasing these photos would jeopardize the safety of \nour men and women serving overseas and Americans abroad, as well as \ncivilians serving in the war zones. He has indicated the photos don't \nadd anything to the past debate about detainee abuse. They are more of \nthe same. No new person is implicated. These photos, again, were taken \nby our own folks, detailing abuse, and a lot of that has been dealt \nwith already and prosecuted.\n  The President, I think rightfully, has determined, after consulting \nwith his combat commanders, that if we release these photos, it would \nnot help us understand any more about detainee problems in the past \nthan we already know. But it would be a tremendous benefit to the \nenemy. The enemy used these photos in the past to generate resentment \nagainst our troops. It has been a propaganda tool. The President is \nrightfully concerned that to release more photos would add nothing to \nthe overall knowledge base we have regarding detainee abuse, and it is \nsimply going to put American lives in jeopardy. I applaud the \nPresident, who stood for our troops and men and women and the civil \nservants overseas.\n  There are a lot of mysteries in this world, but there is no mystery \non what would happen if we release those photos. I can tell you, beyond \na shadow of a doubt, that if these photos get into the public domain, \nthey will inflame populations where our troops are serving overseas and \nincrease violence against our troops.\n  What we have done--Senator Lieberman and myself--is we came up with \nan amendment that addresses the lawsuit before our judicial system \nabout the photos. This amendment says any detainee photos that are \ncertified by the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with others, \nthat would result in harm to our men and women serving overseas, \njeopardize the war effort, and put our troops in harm's way, with \nPresidential approval, those photos cannot be released for a 5-year \nperiod of time. To me, that is a reasonable compromise. It doesn't \nchange FOIA, in its basic construct, but it provides congressional \nsupport to the President's decision that we should not release these \nphotos.\n  Senator Lieberman and myself have been to the theater of operations \nmany times. We have met with al-Qaida operatives who have switched \nsides, basically, and they have told us firsthand how at prison camps \nin Iraq, the Abu Ghraib photos were used in the past to recruit new \nmembers to al-Qaida and generate resentment against our troops.\n  I applaud the President. This legislation will help the \nadministration in court. I thank Senator Lieberman, who, above all \nelse, puts his country and the security of our men and women ahead of \nany political calculation. For that, I very much appreciate his \nleadership and his friendship. I wish to recognize what he did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from South Carolina \nfor his kind words, first, but also for working together on this in a \nbipartisan way. Senator Graham serves in the Senate, but he also serves \nin the U.S. Air Force. When we travel with him, he usually remains \nbehind to do some time and be of service in the battle zones. That is \nthe kind of person he is. He is an extremely skilled lawyer.\n  We approached this trying to do what was right from a legal point of \nview but also understanding what the President, to his great credit, \nunderstood and expressed in the decision he has made on these photos. \nThese are old photos. They portray, I fear, behavior that is \nunacceptable and, in fact, has been made illegal by the Detainee \nTreatment Act and the Military Commissions Act, which Senator Graham \nplayed the leading part in drafting. This behavior portrayed in the \npictures already has also been made illegal by Executive order of \nPresident Obama. So what purpose is served by putting these pictures \nout now? What good purpose? None. It is a kind of voyeurism, frankly, \nto see the pictures just for the sake of seeing the pictures. Maybe in \na normal time that would be OK; it probably would be. Disclosure and \ntransparency are values our country, our Government, holds high. But \nthere is something different now, and this is what President Obama \nrecognizes. We are at war. When you are at war, you have to ask the \nquestion the President asked General Petraeus, General Odierno, and \nothers: Will the public release of these pictures endanger America, \nAmerican military personnel, and American Government personnel serving \noverseas?\n  The answer came back loud and clear: Yes, it will. So the President, \nwith strength and decisiveness, stepped onto what I am sure he knew was \npolitically controversial ground. He did what he thought was right for \nthe country as Commander in Chief. As Senator Graham said, we applaud \nhim greatly for that. We are at war, and you don't do the things when \nyou are at war that you might do at other times.\n  This proposal basically codifies into law the process President Obama \nsuggested in reaching the decision he made to fight the release of \nthese pictures.\n  Last week, the President made exactly the right decision as Commander \nin Chief that will protect our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan and \nelsewhere and make it easier for them to carry out the missions that we \nhave asked them to do.\n  After consulting with General Petraeus, General Odierno and others, \nthe President decided to fight the release of photographs that depict \nthe treatment of detainees in U.S. custody. Those photographs are the \nsubject of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the American \nCivil Liberties Union.\n  Last fall, the Second Circuit court of appeals ordered the release of \nthose photographs. Instead of appealing that decision to the Supreme \nCourt, government lawyers agreed to release the images as well as \nothers that were part of internal Department of Defense investigations.\n  I strongly believe that the President's decision to fight the release \nof the photographs was the right one. Today, Senator Graham and I \nintroduced this amendment to H.R. 2346, the supplemental appropriations \nbill for Iraq and Afghanistan, that will codify the President's \ndecision and establish a procedure to prevent the detainee photos from \nbeing released.\n  Before the President decided to fight the Second Circuit decision, \nSenator Graham and I sent a letter to the President making the case \nthat the release of the photographs serves no public good.\n  The behavior depicted in those photographs has been prohibited by \nCongress in the Detainee Treatment Act and the Military Commissions Act \nas well as by Executive orders issued by President Obama. Meanwhile, \nthe Department of Defense has investigated the allegations of detainee \nabuse for the purpose of holding those responsible accountable.\n  We also know that the release of the photographs will make our \nservice men and women deployed overseas less safe. There is compelling \nevidence that the images depicting detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib was a \ngreat spur to the insurgency in Iraq and made it harder for our troops \nto succeed in their mission there.\n  Now we learned valuable lessons from those pictures. And as I said, \nCongress and this President have taken steps to prevent that abuse from \never happening again.\n  But the same is not true about these pictures. These pictures depict \npast abuses that have already been addressed and we know that the \nrelease will only empower the propaganda operations of al-Qaida and \nother Islamist terrorist organizations.\n  Even before 9/11, terrorist groups like al-Qaida recognized the \nimmense value of using propaganda to recruit and radicalize followers \naround the world. Since 9/11, the al-Qaida propaganda operation has \nonly gotten more sophisticated. Should pictures like these be released, \nwe know that they will be circulated immediately on al-Qaida connected \nWeb sites and many other Web sites that readily post images just like \nthis.\n  And to be clear, it is not al-Qaida leadership we are worried about--\nthey are committed to destroying America regardless of what happens \nwith these photos. Rather it is the thousands of\n\n[[Page S5673]]\n\nyoung men--and some women--around the world who may not otherwise be \ninclined to sympathize with or support al-Qaida but may change their \nminds after seeing these photos. Those recruits are the ones that keep \nal-Qaida and other Islamist terrorist groups vibrant and capable of \nplanning and executing attacks against us.\n  By introducing this legislation today, we do not condone the behavior \ndepicted in the photographs. We expect that those responsible for the \nmistreatment of detainees will be held accountable. And that is exactly \nwhat the Department of Defense has done with the internal \ninvestigations it has conducted.\n  This bill--the Detainee Photographic Records Protection Act--would \nestablish a procedure just like the one that led to the President's \ndecision not to release the photos.\n  This legislation would authorize the Secretary of Defense, after \nconsultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, to certify to the \nPresident that the disclosure of photographs like the ones at issue in \nthe ACLU lawsuit would endanger the lives of our citizens or members of \nthe Armed Forces or civilian employees of the U.S. Government deployed \nabroad.\n  The certification would last 5 years and could be renewed by the \nSecretary of Defense if the threat to American personnel continues. \nAlso, the language in the bill is clear that it would apply to the \ncurrent ACLU lawsuit that gave rise to the President's decision last \nweek.\n  Let me state clearly that we cannot become complacent about the stark \nreality that we are still at war with enemies who continue to seek to \nattack America and kill Americans. In the heated partisan environment \nin Washington, we are unfortunately sometimes more engaged in finger \npointing and recriminations than being focused on defeating the vicious \ndetermined enemy we face.\n  I applaud President Obama for the actions he has taken in the past \nweek on the photos and the military commissions and I believe that this \nlegislation will provide him with an important tool to assist him in \nleading the war on terror.\n  Bottom line: I hope, again, this can be a bipartisan amendment, which \nit is, but I hope it will be supported by Members across the aisles. \nWhen we do that, we are all going to be saying we know we are at war \nand that we have no higher responsibility than to protect the security \nof our country and our military personnel, which would be endangered if \nthese pictures go out.\n  For a quick moment, I speak as chairman of the Homeland Security \nCommittee, which I am privileged to lead. These pictures will be a \nrecruiting device for al-Qaida and the rest of the terrorist ilk. These \npictures will go up instantaneously on jihadist terrorist recruiting \nWeb sites. Not just people elsewhere in the world but people in the \nUnited States will be drawn to those Web sites and perhaps recruited \nthrough these pictures into a life of terrorism, where the essential \ntarget will be America and Americans. There is no reason to let that \nhappen, and this amendment will make sure, in an orderly and fair way, \nthat it doesn't happen while we are at war.\n  Again, I thank my friend from South Carolina. I gather we are waiting \nfor word on whether we can introduce the amendment soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, here is a closing thought. The President \nunderstands very well, and I know Senator Lieberman does, and I think \nwe all understand we have some damage to repair. We have made mistakes \nin this war. Detainee operations are essential in every war. Part of \nwar is to capture prisoners and how you dispose of them can help or \nhurt the war effort. There have been times in the past where detainee \noperations have hurt the war effort. We need to start over. That is why \nwe need to look at a new system to replace the one we have regarding \nmilitary commissions--but keep it in the military setting--and a way to \nstart over with basic detainee operations in a comprehensive manner. \nBut in repairing the damage of the past, you have to make sure you are \nnot creating future damage. If you release these photos, you will not \nrepair damage from the past, and you will not bring somebody to justice \nthat is in these photos whom we already don't know about. There will \nnot be a new person named. It is more of the same. So it doesn't \ncontribute to repairing the damage of the past, but it sure does create \ndamage for the future.\n  The one fact I am very aware of is that the young men and women \nserving overseas today--soldiers, military members, and civilians--have \ndone nothing wrong. They should not pay a price for the people who did \nsomething wrong in the past whom we already know about.\n  If you release these photos, Americans are going to get killed for no \ngood reason. That is why we need to pass this amendment--to help the \nPresident defeat this lawsuit that would lead to violence against \nAmericans who are doing their job and have done nothing wrong. They \nshould not be punished for something somebody has done in the past, \nwhich has already been addressed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me briefly describe what this amendment \ndoes. The administration, as well as Members of Congress, have all been \nrecently saying some important things about our ability to influence \nthe actions of the country of Iran relative to their acquisition of a \nnuclear capability. Let me quote a couple of these statements that I \nthink make a lot of sense.\n  Secretary Gates said:\n\n       The regional and nuclear ambitions of Iran continue to pose \n     enormous challenges to the U.S. Yet I believe there are \n     nonmilitary ways to blunt Iran's power to threaten its \n     neighbors and sow instability throughout the Middle East.\n\n  The Secretary said that at an Armed Services Committee hearing in \nJanuary of this year.\n  In March of this year, after an important NATO meeting, Secretary \nClinton said the following:\n\n       I know that there's an ongoing debate about what the status \n     of Iran's nuclear weapons production capacity is, but I don't \n     think there is a credible debate about their intention. Our \n     task is to dissuade them, deter them, prevent them from \n     acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\n  I think we would all agree with these two sentiments. One way to \n``dissuade'' Iran from pursuing this nuclear capability, as Secretary \nClinton put it, is to focus on the vulnerabilities of Iran and its \nleaders to cause them to change their plans by putting significant \npressure on Iran and its leadership.\n  Where might those pressure points be? One of them that President \nObama talked about in his campaign was the fact that Iran imports about \n40 percent of the refined gasoline and diesel that its citizens use. It \ndoes not have an indigenous capability. That represents a vulnerability \nsince there are only a few companies, maybe five, that supply that \nrefined petroleum product to Iran. So one of the things we can do is to \nensure that those companies have to decide whether they want to do \nbusiness with Iran's $250 billion economy or our $13 trillion economy. \nThere is legislation pending that Senator Bayh, Senator Lieberman, and \nI have introduced that would deal with that subject.\n  But there is another way that we can deal with it, and it is focused \non this legislation in front of us. That is how we spend U.S. money and \nwhether, in fact, we pay money to these companies.\n  It turns out that the answer is yes. For example, in January, the \nDepartment of Energy announced its award of a contract to purchase 10.7 \nmillion barrels of crude oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to two \ncompanies, Vitol and Shell Trading. The total cost of these contracts \nis $552 million. These two firms play a critical role in importing \ngasoline to the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n  Despite protests from the Congress, the Department of Energy actually \ncompleted those sales and the transfers of money in April of 2009. So \nthat is not a contract we can affect. That is half a billion dollars of \nU.S. taxpayer money going to these two companies that do business \ndirectly with Iran. We should stop doing that. What this amendment says \nis that we are going to stop doing that with money that would be \nordinarily spent on companies such as Vitol and Shell Trading.\n\n  The Department of Energy has outstanding contracts to add 6.2 million \nbarrels of crude oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve with Shell \nTrading and a company called Glencore, which also sells gasoline to \nIran. Last month, the Senate unanimously approved an amendment--it was \namendment No. 980 to S. Con. Res. 13--to the budget to prevent Federal \nexpenditures to companies doing business in the energy sector of the \nIslamic Republic of Iran on the matter I spoke to before. So this would \nbe a complementary way for us to assure that Iran is not supported by \nthese companies. This amendment would make clear our opposition to the \nuse of taxpayer funds to pay to these companies that sell refined \npetroleum products to Iran. We wouldn't be able to use American \ntaxpayer dollars, for example, to pay them to fill our Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. There are plenty of other companies that can do \nthat.\n  So if we are serious about confronting the Islamic Republic of Iran, \nwe have to use all the economic and diplomatic tools at our disposal to \nfocus pressure on that country and its leadership to cause them to stop \npursuing their plans to become a nuclear power. I think most of us \nwould agree that companies doing business with Iran should have to make \na choice: Do they do business, as I said, with our $13 trillion economy \nor do they do business with Iran's $250 billion economy? This amendment \ndoesn't get to that larger issue, but it does at least say that we are \nnot going to spend taxpayer money with these five or so companies--some \nof which we are currently doing business with--by buying their oil for \nour Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to answer any questions or have debate \nabout this amendment. If my colleagues are willing to accept it without \na vote, that is fine with me too. I think the important point is to get \nthis proposition established. I can't imagine there is a great deal of \ncontroversy about this here in the body, but if anyone would like to \ndebate me about it, I would be happy to do that at this time or when \nthey are here.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require the United States Executive Director of the \n International Monetary Fund to oppose loans and other programs of the \nFund that do not exempt certain spending by the governments of heavily \n    indebted poor countries from certain budget caps and restraints)\n\n       On page 106, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. 1303. (a) Exemption of Certain Government Spending \n     From International Monetary Fund Restrictions.--The Secretary \n     of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive \n     Director of the International Monetary Fund to oppose any \n     loan, project, agreement, memorandum, instrument, plan, or \n     other program of the Fund that does not exempt spending on \n     health care, education, food aid, and other critical safety \n     net programs by the governments of heavily indebted poor \n     countries from national budget caps or restraints, hiring or \n     wage bill ceilings, or other limits on government spending \n     sought by the Fund.\n       (b) Conforming Repeal.--Section 7030 of the Omnibus \n     Appropriations Act, 2009 (Public Law 111-8; 123 Stat. 874) is \n     amended by striking subsection (c) and redesignating \n     subsection (d) as subsection (c).\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the senior Senator from \nMississippi for his good work and for his cooperation on bringing this \namendment forward. I rise to offer amendment No. 1161, which is \nintended to ensure that the International Monetary Fund fulfills its \nmission in a manner consistent with American values and American \nobjectives. This amendment would help ensure that the human cost of \nthis economic crisis is not exacerbated, is not made worse, by cuts to \nnutrition and to health and to education programs.\n  Without a doubt, we are facing the greatest economic crisis in \ndecades, a crisis that has worldwide implications. Unemployment is up, \nnot just in my home State of Ohio or in the State of the Presiding \nOfficer, of New Mexico, but across this Nation and around the world. In \nlow-income countries, workers are toiling away for increasingly lower \nwages and children are all too often going without health care, without \nenough food, and with little education.\n  The World Bank estimates the global economic crisis will push an \nadditional 46 million people into poverty this year. If the crisis \npersists, an additional 2.8 million children under 5 may die from \npreventable and treatable diseases between now and 2015.\n  As governments across the globe find themselves in dire straits, the \nIMF has stepped in to provide badly needed loans to countries in \ntrouble but often at the expense of social spending programs. In the \npast, the IMF has loaned money to nations, often with the requirement \nthat these countries balance their budgets, cut spending and raise \ninterest rates. Of course, there is nothing wrong with balanced \nbudgets, but in an economic crisis such as the one we currently face, \nhow can the IMF ask countries to cut spending on education, on health \ncare, on nutrition, in order to undertake policies that might actually \ncause more harm than good? The upshot of these policies is the world's \nweakest and most vulnerable are the ones who suffer. The first items \ncut from budgets are social spending programs. In fact, the IMF has \nactually required that countries cap spending on health care and \neducation and nutrition.\n  If these conditions continue to be placed on countries receiving IMF \nfunds, our attempts to provide assistance to those in need will be \nundercut, all in the name of fiscal responsibility. Let me be clear: \nThe purpose of this amendment is not to inhibit IMF lending. I \nrecognize the importance of the IMF and I recognize the role it will \nplay in stabilizing the global economy, but it is especially for this \nreason we must be able to hold it accountable.\n  The administration's inclusion of IMF money in the supplemental \nappropriation is an opportunity for us to make a statement to the \nInternational Monetary Fund, to make sure that the money we loan to the \nIMF is used for programs that do not adversely affect the most \nvulnerable in the world. We must ensure the IMF doesn't force countries \nto cut spending for health care or education or nutrition at the \nexpense of balanced budgets or shoring up central banks.\n  We must ensure that social spending--education, health care, \nnutrition--is protected not only for humanitarian and moral reasons but \nalso for the long-term security and stability of those countries.\n  We must be able to hold the IMF accountable for its policies. We must \nuse our voice and our vote to reflect our commitment to education, to \nthe fight against global poverty, and to the welfare of workers \neverywhere. That is what this amendment will accomplish.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1188\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, amendment No. 1188 is at the desk.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be waived.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To make available from funds appropriated by title XI an \n          additional $42,500,000 for asssistance for Georgia)\n\n       At the end of title XI, add the following:\n       Sec. 1121. (a) Additional Amount for Assistance for \n     Georgia.--The amount appropriated by this title under the \n     heading ``Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia'' is hereby \n     increased by $42,500,000, with the amount of the increase to \n     be available for assistance for Georgia.\n       (b) Source of Funds.--\n       (1) In general.--The amount of the increase in subsection \n     (a) shall be derived from amounts appropriated or otherwise \n     made available by this title, other than amounts under the \n     heading ``Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia'' and available \n     for assistance for Georgia.\n       (2) Administration.--Not later than 30 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall--\n       (A) administer the reduction required pursuant to paragraph \n     (1); and\n       (B) submit to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate \n     and the Committee of the House of Representatives a report \n     specifying the account and the amount of each reduction made \n     pursuant to the reduction required pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment that will \nrestore assistance to the Republic of Georgia, thereby fulfilling the \ncommitment the United States has made to that country.\n  Last year, following the Russian invasion of Georgia, and the \nwidespread destruction that took place throughout the country, the \nUnited States pledged $1 billion in aid to Georgia. The move had wide \nbipartisan support.\n  Thus far approximately three-quarters of the assistance has been \ndelivered to Tblisi. Now the administration has requested that final \nstep in fulfilling the U.S. pledge be incorporated into the \nsupplemental bill and requested the remaining $242.5 million in \nassistance for Georgia.\n  The House measure includes this full funding. The Senate version, on \nthe other hand, provides only $200 million, which makes it available \nnot just for Georgia but other central Asian countries as well.\n  The amendment I am offering would move $42.5 million in existing \nfunds under the international affairs title of the bill to fulfill the \nfull amount of the American pledge. I would emphasize--I wanted to \nheavily emphasize--that in\n\n[[Page S5676]]\n\ndoing so, this amendment does not increase the top line of the State \nDepartment budget by one penny, nor does it mean one penny more in \ntaxpayer expenditure. It is consistent with the administration's budget \nrequest and with the promise that our Nation made to the Republic of \nGeorgia following last year's strife.\n  The Georgian Government has stated that it plans to devote the \nassistance to projects that will address urgent requirements identified \nby the World Bank's recent Joint Needs Assessment. These include \nresettling internally displaced persons, rebuilding vital \ninfrastructure following last year's Russian invasion, strengthening \ndemocratic institutions and law enforcement capabilities, and enhancing \nborder security.\n  In fulfilling our pledge, we have the opportunity not only to enhance \nthe stability of the democratic progress of Georgia but also to send a \nclear message to the region that the United States will stand by its \nfriends. Such a signal is one of the utmost importance.\n  It has been just 8 months since the world's attention was riveted by \nRussia's invasion. Following the violence, there was talk of sanctions \nagainst Moscow. The Bush administration withdrew its submission to \nCongress of a nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia, and NATO \nsuspended meetings of the NATO-Russia Council. That outrage quickly \nsubsided, however, and it seems that the events of last August have \nbeen all but forgotten in some quarters.\n  A casual observer might guess that things returned to normal in this \npart of the world and that war in Georgia was a brief and tragic \ncircumstance that has since been reversed. But, in fact, this is not \nthe case.\n  While the stories have faded from the headlines, Russia remains in \nviolation of the terms of the ceasefire to which it agreed last year. \nRussian troops continue to be stationed on sovereign Georgian \nterritory. Thousands of Russian troops remain in South Ossetia and \nAbkhazia, greatly in excess of the preconflict levels.\n  Rather than abide by the ceasefire's requirement to engage in \ninternational talks on the future of the two provinces, Russia has \nrecognized their independence, signed friendship agreements with them \nthat effectively render them Russian dependencies, and have taken over \ntheir border controls.\n  All of this suggests tangible results to Russia's desire to maintain \na sphere of influence in neighboring countries, dominate their \npolitics, and circumscribe their freedom of action in international \naffairs.\n  Russian President Medvedev recently denounced NATO exercises in \nGeorgia, describing them as ``provocative.'' Yet these ``provocative'' \nexercises did not involve heavy equipment or arms and focused on \ndisaster response, search and rescue, and the like. Russia was even \ninvited to participate in the exercises, an invitation Moscow declined.\n  We must not revert to an era in which the countries on Russia's \nperiphery were not permitted to make their own decisions, control their \nown political futures, and decide their own alliances. Whether in \nKyrgyzstan, where Moscow seems to have exerted pressure for the \neviction of U.S. forces from the Manas base, to Estonia, which suffered \na serious cyber-attack some time ago, to Georgia and elsewhere Russia \ncontinues its attempts to reestablish a sphere of influence.\n  Yet such moves are in direct contravention to the free and open \nrules-based international system that the United States and its \npartners have spent so many decades to uphold.\n  So let's not forget what has happened in Georgia and the pledges we \nhave made to support a friend. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment and stand by the Republic of Georgia in its continuing time \nof need.\n  I want to emphasize again, the amendment does not increase the top \nline of the State Department budget by one penny, nor does it mean one \npenny more in taxpayer expenditures, consistent with the \nadministration's budget request, and with the promise that our Nation \nmade to the Republic of Georgia following last year's strife.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  I, first of all, want to say a special thanks to Chairman Inouye and \nthe ranking member, my neighbor from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, for \ntheir good work on this effort and really being thoughtful and timely \non that we need in this bill we have before us.\n  The amendment I am offering today deals with an emergency challenge \nthat is faced in our State of Arkansas. It is a specific problem just \nto us, and we need the Senate's help to immediately address that issue.\n  Unfortunately, as a result of the economic challenges our Nation now \nfaces, these challenges are magnified for us in our State, and \nimmediate and emergency intervention is essential; otherwise, our \nState's recovery will lag behind due to a lack of capital in our State \nbecause of the circumstances we are experiencing, as I said, with an \nunusual cap that is tied to the Federal rate. So we are working hard to \nsolve this problem in our State. We are asking our Senate colleagues to \nwork with us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Pryor be added as \na cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Acting President pro tempore.\n  Again, we look forward to being able to work with our colleagues to \nmeet this challenge our State, and our State\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\nalone, faces.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To appropriate, with an offset, an additional $2,000,000,000 \n               for National Guard and Reserve Equipment)\n\n       At the appropriate in title III, insert the following:\n\n                  National Guard and Reserve Equipment\n\n       For an additional amount for ``National Guard and Reserve \n     Equipment'', $2,000,000,000, to remain available for \n     obligation until September 30, 2010: Provided, That the Chief \n     of the National Guard Bureau and an appropriate official for \n     each of other reserve components of the Armed Forces each \n     shall, not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, submit to the Committee on Armed Services and \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives a report on \n     the modernization priority assessment for the National Guard \n     and for the other reserve components of the Armed Forces, \n     respectively: Provided further, That the amount under this \n     heading is designated as an emergency requirement and as \n     necessary to meet emergency needs pursuant to sections 403(a) \n     and 423(b) of S. Con. Res. 13 (111th Congress), the \n     concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2010.\n\n                             (rescissions)\n\n       (a) In General.--Of the discretionary amounts (other than \n     the amounts described in subsection (b)) made available by \n     the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (123 Stat. \n     115; Public Law 111-5) that are unobligated as the the date \n     of enactment of this Act, $2,000,000,000 is hereby rescinded.\n       (b) Exception.--The rescission in subsection (a) shall not \n     apply to amounts made available by division A of the American \n     Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 as follows:\n       (1) Under title III, relating to the Department of Defense.\n       (2) Under title VI, relating to the Department of Homeland \n     Security.\n       (3) Under title X, relating to Military Construction and \n     Veterans and Related Agencies.\n       (c) Administration.--Not later than 30 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall--\n       (1) administer the rescission specified in subsection (a); \n     and\n       (2) submit to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate \n     and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives a report specifying the account and the \n     amount of each reduction made pursuant to the rescission in \n     subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President and fellow Senators, I come to the floor to \noffer this important amendment. What this amendment does is simply \nappropriates $2 billion to the National Guard and Reserve equipment \naccount. Mechanically, it does this by permitting the OMB to rescind $2 \nbillion that has been previously appropriated in the stimulus package. \nIt exempts from the rescission funds related to the Department of \nDefense, the Department of Homeland Security, and part of title X of \nthat bill relating to military construction and veterans and related \nagencies. Otherwise, the OMB is directed to rescind $2 billion, which \nis the amount authorized for the National Guard and Reserve equipment \naccount.\n  The reason for the amendment is that as our Guard units and Reserve \nunits have been asked to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan over recent \nyears, their equipment has been badly depleted. I have personal \nexperience with this, as our Guard unit from Idaho had been dispatched \nto Iraq and spent time there. When they came back, a lot of their \nequipment was necessarily left behind for the use of the Iraqis and for \nthe use of other American troops who were going to stay in Iraq. We \nhave in Idaho over a period of time gone through a process by which \nsome of this equipment has been replaced but not all. Obviously, this \namendment does not apply just to Idaho; it applies to all States, all \nNational Guard units, all Reserve units.\n  This is something that is badly needed. The National Guard certainly \nperforms a valuable service to the Governors of each of the States, to \nthe people of each of the States. This bill will help them get the \nequipment that badly needs replacing back in the queue where it belongs \nand back where it can be used by these Guard units and Reserve units.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I wish to compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho. He puts his finger on a problem that affects not \nonly Idaho but some other States as well, including my State of \nMississippi, where we have had a large number of National Guard and \nReserve officers, too--but his amendment goes directly to the National \nGuard--deployed to the theater, engaged in serious and dangerous \noperations in the theater, and we appreciate the fact that they are in \nneed of having equipment and weapons that are suitable for the tasks \nand the challenges they face. It is a dangerous environment. This \namendment will help deal with that serious problem. I thank the Senator \nfor bringing it to the attention of the Senate.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. As has been pointed \nout, this is a situation that a number of States face. It will not cost \nany additional taxpayer dollars. It is a wise expenditure of taxpayer \ndollars.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I am grateful to the chairman and ranking \nmember for their work on this critical bill.\n  I am happy to be joined by Senators Lugar and Reed in introducing an \namendment to ensure that civilians deployed to Afghanistan receive \ntraining that cultivates greater civilian-military unity of mission and \nemphasizes the importance of counterinsurgency and stability \noperations.\n  Last month, I had the distinct privilege of traveling with Senator \nReed to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq to visit our troops and assess \nregional developments and challenges.\n  During the trip, it was abundantly clear that we must build greater \nunity of mission between civilians and military in order to meet our \ngrowing needs in the region.\n  In Iraq and Afghanistan, we are engaged in a four-stage process of \nfighting insurgency by shaping the environment, clearing insurgents \nwith military power, holding the area with effective security forces \nand police, and building through a combination of governance and \neconomic development.\n  As we increase our military commitment and civilian capacity in \nAfghanistan, we must ensure that all U.S. personnel have the tools they \nneed to succeed in this increasingly difficult mission.\n  In addition to sending 21,000 additional troops and trainers to \nAfghanistan, President Obama recently announced that we will send \nhundreds of civilians from the State Department, USAID, and other \nagencies to partner with the Afghan people and government in promoting \neconomic development and governance.\n  These civilians will continue to work in tandem with the military in \nstabilizing Afghanistan and should therefore train in tandem to prepare \nfor their deployment.\n  When surveyed, civilians serving in Afghanistan have confirmed that \njoint training with the military was the single most effective \npreparation. This sentiment underscores the urgency of this amendment, \nand highlights the critical need for increased joint training so we can \nmeet current and future needs in Afghanistan.\n  Integrated training, specifically for military and nonmilitary \npersonnel participating in provincial reconstruction teams, PRTs, is \nongoing, and the next course will be held later this month at Camp \nAtterbury in Indiana.\n  Still, this training will include only about 25 nonmilitary personnel \nfrom State and USAID, and it is not scheduled to recommence for 9 \nmonths, after many of our brave men and women have already left for the \nregion.\n  Especially given the increased need, this 9-month training cycle is \nwoefully inadequate. We do not have 9 months to wait and we should not \nrisk sending civilians to Afghanistan without the training they need to \nbe safe, secure, and effective.\n  We must therefore increase the frequency of training programs, such \nas the one at Camp Atterbury and we also must ensure this training \nincludes a greater focus on counterinsurgency and stability operations.\n  The military challenges we are facing today are unlike conventional \nwars of the past. I strongly agree with the assessment of leading \ndefense experts that we must better prepare to win the wars we are in, \nas opposed to those we may wish to be in.\n  According to Secretary Gates, this will require ``. . . a holistic \nassessment of capabilities, requirements, risks, and needs'' which will \nentail, among other things, a rebalancing of our defense budget.\n  This also includes changing the way we prepare U.S. personnel for \ntheir mission, as reflected by the creation of the Counterinsurgency \nAcademy in Kabul, where more civilians should train in greater numbers \nwith the military once they are in Afghanistan.\n  An increased focus on counter-\ninsurgency reflects the fact that we must undergo a military \nrebalancing to be better prepared to face an asymmetric threat.\n  Thanks to the leadership, vision, and integrity of Secretary Gates, \nGeneral Petraeus, and others, we have moved in that direction, and we \nmust continue along this path.\n  That is why I strongly support this supplemental, which contains \nincreased funding for mine resistant ambush protected vehicles, or \nMRAPS, and other equipment to counter unconventional threats like \nimprovised explosive devices. Such equipment is critical to advancing \nour security goals in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  But most importantly, it provides needed defenses for our troops, so \nthat we can keep our brave men and women out of harm's way in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  It is in this same vein that we must also take every opportunity to \nprepare our civilians better. Increased civilian-military training \nfocused on counter-\ninsurgency and stability operations is essential to meeting this goal, \nand that is why I urge my colleagues to join Senators Lugar, Reed, and \nme in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President I appreciate the chairman and ranking member's \nassistance on this amendment, as well as the guidance I have received \nfrom Senator Leahy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Cuban Independence Day\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, for Americans, Independence Day is the \nday we celebrate our freedom and the ideals on which our Nation was \nfounded.\n  Today is a special day for Cubans who won their formal independence, \nwith help from the United States, 107 years ago today. Today is \nindependence day in Cuba, which serves as a reminder that there are \nthose still struggling to exercise their fundamental rights, having \nspent the past 50 years under the repressive rule of a one-family \nregime.\n  Last month, 17 peaceful Cuban activists wrote to President Obama, \nnoting that:\n\n       A great majority of Cubans . . . desire profound democratic \n     change in Cuba. The shining example of the civil rights \n     movement in the United States is a beacon of hope so that \n     full dignity for each Cuban can be restored. We want to \n     determine our future through a democratic process.\n\n  His administration has taken actions with the well-being of Cubans in \nmind.\n\n  While I appreciate the President's willingness to address some of the \nchallenges facing the Cuban people, I also ask that he consider \nimplementing policies that will empower the Cuban people, not empower \nthe regime.\n  Wholesale change in Cuba won't come from Washington. It can only come \nfrom Havana. The Cuban people will not truly be free until all \nprisoners of conscience are freed from prison.\n  Additionally, the regime must end the practice of harassing and \ndetaining those who exercise their fundamental human rights.\n  The Cuban people are also entitled to freedom of the press, freedom \nto assemble, and freedom to worship. Finally, the Cuban people must be \ngiven the right to freely choose who governs them and how they will be \ngoverned.\n  On the day we recognize Cuba's independence from Spain 107 years ago, \nwe should also recognize the Cuban people's right to independence from \nthe repressive regime that currently denies them these fundamental \nfreedoms.\n  Mr. President, 107 years ago, as the United States and those freedom \nfighters in Cuba who struggled mightily for more than a quarter of a \ncentury, by that time, to free themselves from the yoke of colonialism, \nthe United States and Cuba, after freeing Cuba from Spain, sat together \nto form the new Cuban Republic. And 107 years ago on a day like today, \nthe United States ceded to the Cuban people their right to be an \nindependent nation.\n  It is amazing how nurtured and closely bound the history of our \nNation is with the history of the nation that saw\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\nmy birth. It is with that in mind that this unique role and the fact \nthat only a very small body of water, called the Florida Straits, \nseparates us, has created this entangled web of history between these \ntwo nations that have so much been a part of my life.\n  As we look to the future, it is right that we continue to be the \ngreatest single beacon of hope, as these dissidents expressed to \nPresident Obama, for those in Cuba who look for freedom, who look for \nthe opportunity to have a democratic government they can elect.\n  Today the Cuban people continue to be ruled by the tyrannical hand of \ntwo brothers who seized power in 1959 on January 1. That is a long time \nago. Since that day until today, there has not been a legitimate \nelection, there has never been the opportunity for the Cuban people to \nfreely express themselves without the fear of repression or political \nprison.\n  Today there are dozens of Cuban people who are in prison merely for \nexpressing the ideas that this country has so nurtured over the time of \nits existence--freedom, democracy, and rule of law. It is with that \nhope that today I have come to the Senate floor to commemorate this \nvery important date on the calendar in history that intertwines Cuba \nand the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1155\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, Senator Landrieu and I have \nfiled an amendment that we hope the Appropriations Committee will \naccept for $2 million to be appropriated, set aside for the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission.\n  You would wonder why a sum of money of that size compared to the \nscope of the appropriations bills out here would need to have direction \nto the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Of course, I wonder the same \nthing because they have a budget that is certainly much more robust \nthan it has been in the past as a result of the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission authorization bill we passed last year. Nevertheless, we \nhave an emergency that has arisen with regard to a consumer product for \nwhich the Safety Commission Acting Chairman has said they do not have \nenough money. So Senator Landrieu and I are offering this amendment.\n\n  Let me tell you what this consumer threat is. On or about the years \n2004-2005, because of the high demand for construction in the aftermath \nof two very active hurricane seasons--2004 and 2005--as a matter of \nfact, we had four hurricanes just in my State of Florida within a 6-\nweek period. Those four hurricanes covered up the entire State. Then, \nof course, you remember the active hurricane season of 2005, which \nended in the debacle in New Orleans, with Hurricane Katrina and hitting \nthe Mississippi coast. Then along came Hurricane Rita, which also hit \nthe Texas coast as well as Louisiana.\n  In the aftermath of that, of course, there was a lot of construction. \nOne of the essential items in construction, even in the State of the \nesteemed ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, is something \nknown as drywall because you put up the studs in a unit--let's say a \nhome--and you put drywall on it, and that makes the walls.\n  Drywall is usually made with gypsum, which is mined and produced in \nAmerica. It is actually a byproduct of the mining of phosphate. On the \noutside of the gypsum they put something like a cardboard-thick paper, \nand that becomes a drywall sheet that actually is the facing of a wall. \nBut because there was such a demand for this drywall in the aftermath \nof those hurricane years, they started importing from China something \nknown as Chinese drywall.\n  Well, we think Chinese drywall is in as many as 100,000 homes in this \ncountry. Just in my State, the State of Florida, it may be in 36,000 to \n50,000 homes.\n  Here is what is happening. People who live in homes with Chinese \ndrywall are getting sick. First of all, if you enter the home--as I \nhave, in several homes in Florida--there is a pungent kind of smell \nthat is something like rotten eggs. For this Senator, whose respiratory \nsystem is very sensitive to any of these things, once I was in there \nfor 5 or 10 minutes, suddenly I found my respiratory system choking up.\n  When you talk to these people whose homes have this Chinese drywall, \nsure enough, that is what is happening. But that is not what is only \nhappening. Normally, copper tubing--whether it is part of the plumbing \nor whether it is part of an air conditioner--as it gets old, it gets \ngreen. The bright shiny copper turns green. Not so in a home with \nChinese drywall. It starts turning black and crusty, and it starts \ndeteriorating the coils on an air conditioner.\n  Mr. President, this is no kidding. Some of those houses I visited \nhave had to replace the coils in the air conditioner three times.\n  Or what about the house outside of Bradenton, FL, that I went to, \nwhere just a month before the elderly couple had gone on a trip to \nCozumel, Mexico, where they had bought for the wife a silver bracelet. \nThey brought it back. It had been in the house a month, and it had \nturned completely black. So, obviously, you can see that something has \nhappened.\n  What about going into the bathroom? You have a mirror in the bathroom \nand, suddenly, you start seeing the reflective part of the mirror start \nchunking off.\n  What about the kids who have respiratory problems and their \npediatrician is telling the parents: Get that child out of the house. \nWell, where do they go?\n  I visited one single mother. She took her child and moved in with her \nmother. But she is still paying the mortgage payments. What about that \nother family down the street who did not have family close by? They had \nto move out and rent a place. But they are still, because their \nmortgage company will not work with them, having to pay the mortgage in \norder not to lose their house.\n  What about the poor homebuilder? The poor homebuilder is having \ntrouble enough as it is in the economy we are in with the sale of \nhouses going down. The poor homeowner asks: Who is responsible for \nthis? And maybe the homebuilder is not even around because they might \nhave gone bust because of the economy. So who does the poor homeowner \nturn to?\n  Well, I can tell you, a lot of those homeowners are turning to their \nelected officials.\n  The sad thing is we have people in dire need, and all of the pleas to \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission--which, by the way, drug their \nfeet 2 and 3 years ago on defective toys coming in from China--they say \neven though they have the legal authority--and they do--to impound this \nstuff, to freeze the assets of the distributing company of this stuff--\nthey have the authority under existing law to stop the importation of \nthis Chinese drywall--they have refused thus far to do anything about \nit.\n  Now, they did do this: They got with the EPA and the EPA did a test. \nThe EPA is releasing that test result, I believe, today. That test \nresult is showing that when they compared Chinese drywall to American \ndrywall--in the first chemical composition test--the difference from \nAmerican drywall is that the Chinese drywall contains sulfur; thus, the \nsmell of rotten eggs; strontium, which is some derivative, possibly, of \nsome kind of nuclear process; and elements found in acrylic paint. \nThose are the results thus far.\n  Thus, we come to the amendment of Senator Landrieu and myself for $2 \nmillion to the Consumer Product Safety Commission to go to the next \ntest--which will take most of that $2 million--and that is, to subject \nthe Chinese drywall to conditions one finds in a house--and now we are \nfinding it in about 20 States, not just in the South--subjecting it to \nthe conditions of humidity and the heat of the summer to see what gases \nare emitted so that doctors can analyze this stuff as to how it is \naffecting the health of our people.\n  If you are a homeowner with this Chinese drywall, this is no little \nemergency. The least we can do, even though the CPSC has drug its feet, \nis to give them the resources to go to\n\n[[Page S5680]]\n\nthat next step and make this additional test so we know what we are \ndealing with to protect the health of our people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1189\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an amendment I \nhave filed, amendment No. 1189. I am told the Democrats will object to \nmy asking that it be pending, but I am going to talk about it. I hope \nvery much I will have the opportunity to offer this amendment in \nregular order. As a right of a Senator, I hope that will be given. I \ndon't know why it is being objected to, but I would very much like to \nspeak on it. I hope I am not going to be prohibited from the \nopportunity to offer it, since I am on the floor in a timely manner \ntrying to offer an amendment, as we have been asked to do.\n  The amendment I hope to call up is amendment No. 1189. It is an \namendment to try to help those automobile dealers that have been \nnotified, particularly by Chrysler, with a deadline of June 9, and told \nthey are going to have to shut their doors of those dealerships by June \n9. They were given 3 weeks' notice.\n  The President's task force on the auto industry has taken \nunprecedented steps to negotiate with each of the affected stakeholders \nto bring General Motors and Chrysler closer to sustainable viability. I \nknow Members of this body sincerely appreciate the enormity of their \ntask; however, there are many growing concerns with their actions. The \ngroup that has arguably taken the biggest hit by their negotiations is \nthe auto dealers.\n  Auto dealers are some of the biggest and best employers in our \nNation, in small towns across my State and every State. Many of them \nare the largest employers in their entire counties. Auto dealers run a \ntough business. They assume a lot of risk. They purchase the vehicles \nfrom the manufacturer. Each dealer is forced to move their product in \norder to make payroll, to cover overhead, to pay property taxes, or \nclose their doors, all of which is no cost to the manufacturer. These \nare all dealer expenses.\n  While I understand that if an auto dealer is forced to close their \ndoors because the dealer is unable to make the business profitable, of \ncourse, we can understand that would be the choice of the dealer and \nthey would be closed. But I don't understand why General Motors or \nChrysler would arbitrarily shut down thousands of operating and \nprofitable dealers across our country.\n  The Treasury Department has back-pedaled from any involvement in the \ndecision to shut down auto dealers across the Nation. A recent Treasury \npress release states:\n\n       As was the case with Chrysler's dealer consolidation plan, \n     the task force was not involved in deciding which dealers or \n     how many dealers were part of GM's announcement.\n\n  An earlier press release from the Treasury said:\n\n       The sacrifices by the dealer community alongside those of \n     auto workers, suppliers, creditors, and other Chrysler \n     stakeholders are necessary for this company and the industry \n     to succeed.\n\n  I don't think that is any kind of help for our dealers that are \ntaking the risk and the responsibility for all the costs of their \ndealership.\n  Before the closing announcements were made, another Treasury press \nrelease regarding Chrysler Fiat, on April 30, says:\n\n       It is expected that the terminated dealers will wind down \n     their operations over time and in an orderly manner.\n\n  However, Chrysler, in their notification to close 789 dealers on May \n14--last Thursday--has given dealers until June 9 to wind down. That is \njust over 3 weeks--3 weeks. Chrysler determined that an orderly wind-\ndown--an orderly manner--to sell all their inventory, sell all their \nparts, get rid of all their special equipment--3 weeks.\n  My amendment simply states that no funds shall be expended from the \nTreasury to an auto manufacturer which has notified a dealership that \nit will be terminated without providing at least 60 days for that \ndealership to wind down its operations and sell its inventory. Sixty \ndays, that is what we are asking for.\n  We are not asking that any decisions be changed. It is not our place \nto do that. However, we are saying that with all the taxpayer dollars \nthat are going into the automobile manufacturers, the road kill here is \nthe auto dealer and they have done nothing that would be \nunbusinesslike. They have taken the risks. They employ people in the \ncommunity. They pay the taxes in the community. Sometimes they are the \nlargest employer in the community. Yet they are given 3 weeks to close \ndown their operations. If we are going to help anyone in this country \nwithout one taxpayer dollar going into it, it should be these auto \ndealers, by giving them 60 days to have an orderly process to close \ndown their operations.\n  I wish we could go further. I disagree with the decision to \narbitrarily close down profitable auto dealers. I wish to give my \ncolleagues an example. There is a town in my State called Mineral \nWells. In that town of less than 20,000 people is Russell Whatley, a \nChrysler dealer, whose family has owned his dealership for 90 years. It \nis the oldest dealership in Texas. Russell doesn't sell 1,000 cars a \nyear, but he has been profitable. He actively supports his community. \nHe has actively supported many employees. What is it going to save \nChrysler to close Mr. Whatley's profitable dealership in Mineral Wells? \nI can't even imagine, but it isn't my decision to make. However, I am \ngoing to say that I do think Mr. Whatley deserves 60 days to have the \norderly process that Treasury itself said they would expect from the \nauto manufacturers.\n  I am worried about Mineral Wells when Mr. Whatley's dealership is \nclosed, just as I am worried about communities all over this country \nwith dealerships that are going to be arbitrarily closed. If they have \n3 weeks to sell their inventory, what is that going to do to them and \nto the people who have to go out and find jobs? I don't think it is \nright. I think we should pass my amendment.\n  The reason I am offering it on this bill is because this is a bill \nthat is going to go through quickly, and this is a deadline that is \ncoming very fast. If we can let those dealers know they are going to \nhave 60 days, at least, for the orderly processing of their closures, I \nam told by dealers this will help them immensely in that process, and \nit will not cost the taxpayers one dime--not one dime.\n  I hope we will pass this amendment. I hope the majority will allow \nthis to be brought up in the regular order. I was told when I came to \nthe floor that I would have the opportunity to offer this amendment and \nget into the line for a record vote. I hope that will be done, because \nwe don't have much time to help these dealers. With all the money we \nare putting into the automobile manufacturers, and all of the help we \nare giving to others affected by that industry, the ones who have been \nleft out are the auto dealers.\n  I hope that giving them 60 days--2 months--to shut down a business \nthat may have been in place for 25, 30, or 90 years is the least we can \ndo in these troubling times. We are taking some very different \npositions that we have never taken as a Senate because these are tough \ntimes, and sometimes that is necessary. But this is the least we can do \nin fairness to a business that has done nothing to produce cars that \nwon't sell. It has done nothing that has caused any of the financial \nproblems of General Motors, and I think they deserve a break that will \nnot cost the taxpayers a penny.\n  I am going to be here, and I will ask the majority to allow amendment \nNo. 1189 to become pending right after the votes that will occur very \nshortly.\n  Mr. President, I have another amendment, and it is an amendment that \nI hope will help all of the hospitals in this country that are giving \nmedical care on an emergency basis to illegal immigrants in our country \nget some reimbursement from the Federal Government for those costs.\n  We have had in place funding--called section 1011 funding--for 5 \nyears. I am only trying to extend this program so that all of the \nStates that deal with\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\nthe growing problem of taxpayer dollars--that the hospitals that have \nto absorb these costs will be able to recoup some of those costs from \nthe Federal Government. The program provided $200 million over 5 years \nto help hospitals and doctors recoup these costs. It was not 100 \npercent reimbursement, I assure you.\n  In my State of Texas, we had about $600 million in uncompensated care \nin 1 year, and we were able to obtain $50 million in reimbursement. \nThat was a little bit of help that helped many of the hospitals make \nit. These are eligible for any hospital in America. I hope we will be \nable to pass an amendment on this bill to alleviate that situation.\n  I am told that the Finance Committee is objecting to this amendment \nbecause it is in their jurisdiction. You know, I think it is incumbent \nupon the Finance Committee to work with me on this very important issue \nfor all the States in our country, because this is a Federal problem, \nand it should not be put on the local communities to foot the bill for \nemergency care that they are required by Federal law to give, but not \nget reimbursement from the Federal Government.\n  I hope the Finance Committee will agree to work with me on that. I \nurge the majority to allow amendment No. 1189, which is filed and has \nno objections, that I know of, to be in the next set of votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, would the regular order bring back \namendment No. 1136?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1136, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, that is an amendment of mine, and I \nsend a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order has been called for.\n  The Senator has a right to modify the amendment at this time.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n       Sec. 315. (a) Reports Required.--Not later than 60 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act and every 90 days \n     thereafter, the President shall submit to the members and \n     committees of Congress specified in subsection (b) a report \n     on the prisoner population at the detention facility at Naval \n     Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n       (b) Specified Members and Committees of Congress.--The \n     members and committees of Congress specified in this \n     subsection are the following:\n       (1) The majority leader and minority leader of the Senate.\n       (2) The Chairman and Ranking Member on the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the Senate.\n       (3) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Select Committee \n     on Intelligence of the Senate.\n       (4) The Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n       (5) The minority leader of the House of Representatives.\n       (6) The Chairman and Ranking Member on the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the House of Representatives.\n       (7) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Permanent Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives\n       (c) Matters To Be Included.--Each report submitted under \n     subsection (a) shall include the following:\n       (1) The name and country of origin of each detainee at the \n     detention facility at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as \n     of the date of such report.\n       (2) A current summary of the evidence, intelligence, and \n     information used to justify the detention of each detainee \n     listed under paragraph (1) at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.\n       (3) A current accounting of all the measures taken to \n     transfer each detainee listed under paragraph (1) to the \n     individual's country of citizenship or another country.\n       (4) A current description of the number of individuals \n     released or transferred from detention at Naval Station \n     Guantanamo Bay who are confirmed or suspected of returning to \n     terrorist activities after release or transfer from Naval \n     Station Guantanamo Bay.\n       (5) An assessment of any efforts by al Qaeda to recruit \n     detainees released from detention at Naval Station Guantanamo \n     Bay.\n       (6) For each detainee listed under paragraph (1), a threat \n     assessment that includes--\n       (A) an assessment of the likelihood that such detainee may \n     return to terrorist activity after release or transfer from \n     Naval Station Guantanamo Bay;\n       (B) an evaluation of the status of any rehabilitation \n     program in such detainee's country of origin, or in the \n     country such detainee is anticipated to be transferred to; \n     and\n       (C) an assessment of the risk posed to the American people \n     by the release or transfer of such detainee from Naval \n     Station Guantanamo Bay.\n       (d) Additional Matters To Be Included in Initial Report.--\n     The first report submitted under subsection (a) shall also \n     include the following:\n       (1) A description of the process that was previously used \n     for screening the detainees described by subsection (c)(4) \n     prior to their release or transfer from detention at Naval \n     Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n       (2) An assessment of the adequacy of that screening process \n     for reducing the risk that detainees previously released or \n     transferred from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay would return to \n     terrorist activities after release or transfer from Naval \n     Station Guantanamo Bay.\n       (3) An assessment of lessons learned from previous releases \n     and transfers of individuals who returned to terrorist \n     activities for reducing the risk that detainees released or \n     transferred from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay will return to \n     terrorist activities after their release or transfer.\n       (e) Form.--Each report submitted under subsection (a), or \n     parts thereof, may be submitted in classified form.\n       (f) Limitation on Release or Transfer.--No detainee \n     detained at the detention facility at Naval Station \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as of the date of the enactment of this \n     Act may be released or transferred to another country until \n     the President--\n       (1) submits to Congress the first report required by \n     subsection (a); or\n       (2) certifies to the members and committees of Congress \n     specified in subsection (b) that such action poses no threat \n     to the members of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1136\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the amendments which is being \ndiscussed and has been filed by the minority leader, Senator McConnell \nof Kentucky, relates to detainees at Guantanamo. I am hoping we will \nhave an opportunity to debate this amendment because I think it is an \nimportant amendment, and I hope colleagues will pay close attention to \nit. It is not an amendment which is casual or inconsequential. It is an \namendment which could have a very negative impact on our treatment of \ndetainees who are guilty of crimes or involved in terrorist activities.\n  It is interesting that Senator McConnell has brought this amendment \nbefore the body to be considered. It appears that when President Bush--\nthe previous President--announced that he was closing Guantanamo, we \ndidn't have this rush to the microphones on the Republican side of the \naisle and objecting. In fact, I don't recall any objection from their \nside of the aisle when President Bush made that recommendation.\n  It is also interesting that during the years the Guantanamo Detention \nFacility has been open the requests that are being made now of this \nPresident were not made of the previous President. All the suggestions \nthat perhaps there would be release of detainees from Guantanamo who \nmay cause harm in some part of the world, those suggestions weren't \nmade under the previous President.\n  Literally hundreds of detainees at Guantanamo have been released by \nPresident Bush in the previous administration. It was found that many \nof them were either brought in with no charges that could be proved or \nonce investigation of the evidence was commenced, they learned there \nwas nothing that could be established. They were released and returned \nto countries of origin and other places around the world--hundreds of \nthem in that case. I don't recall a single Republican Senator, or any \nSenator for that matter, coming to the floor and objecting to the \nrelease of those hundreds of detainees from Guantanamo by President \nBush. It happened. They did not object.\n  But now there is a new President and a new approach by the Republican \nside of the Senate. Senator McConnell has come forward with a proposal \nthat calls on the President--not the Attorney General but the \nPresident--to provide detailed information about every detainee at \nGuantanamo--information which has never been requested by previous \nSenators and the previous administration.\n  I will make an exception to what I just said. At one point, when the \nBush administration was asked for the names of the detainees and their \ncountries of origin, the Bush administration objected and said it could \ncompromise national security to release their\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\nnames. That was the only request made. It was denied.\n  Now come the Republicans, with the new Obama administration, with a \nbrandnew outlook, and they want to know everything about the detainees. \nIt is a long amendment. It goes on for five pages and a lot of detail \nhere about the detainees at Guantanamo. Basic information--name and \ncountry of origin, and it goes on for quite a while. Most of it, I \nthink, may be salutary and wouldn't have a negative impact, but there \nis one paragraph in particular which I think is dangerous. It is a \nrequest for information in the McConnell amendment of the President of \nthe United States, and let me read what the request is. It is a request \nfor ``a current summary of the evidence, intelligence, and information \nused to justify the detention of each detainee listed under paragraph \n(1) at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.''\n  Paragraph (1) refers to all the detainees in custody at Guantanamo. \nSo what Senator McConnell is asking for is a summary of the evidence, \nintelligence, and information justifying detention. This could \ncompromise a prosecution of a detainee. It could put us in a position \nwhere someone who truly is dangerous cannot be prosecuted because of \nthis request for information by Senator McConnell.\n  Senator McConnell wants, I guess, 535 Members of Congress to have a \nchance to read through the evidence, intelligence, and information \nabout each detainee. Well, some of that may be classified; some may \nnot. Even the information that is classified may leak, with 535 Members \nof Congress and other staff people. Do we want to run the risk of \njeopardizing the prosecution of someone who is a danger to the United \nStates to satisfy the curiosity of a Senator? I don't think so.\n  Secondly, once this has been presented, if Senator McConnell has his \nway, then there is a very real possibility that should someone--a known \nterrorist--be brought to the United States, or any other place for \ntrial under the laws of the United States, they could, in fact, ask--as \nthey do in ordinary criminal cases--for the presentation of all the \nevidence the State has against them, which would include this document, \nwhich would include not only the evidence, intelligence, and \ninformation, but quite possibly the work product of the prosecutors who \nare holding this detainee.\n  We could not only compromise his prosecution, we could end up with a \n``not guilty'' of someone who is dangerous to the United States simply \nto satisfy the curiosity of a Senator who files this amendment. I think \nthat goes too far. I can't believe that it is in the best interests of \nthe safety of this country for us to allow this McConnell amendment to \npass and to require the President to provide to Senator McConnell a \ncurrent summary of the evidence, intelligence, and information used to \njustify the detention of each detainee.\n  Why? Why in the world would we want to compromise any attempt at \nprosecution? We don't want to do that. Men and women--career \nprosecutors--are currently reviewing each of these cases to determine \nwhether we can go forward with prosecution. The record of the previous \nadministration is not very good when it comes to prosecuting these \ndetainees. President Obama has said he wants to put that behind us and \nto deal with these people on an honest basis.\n  I have listened to the statements that have been made on the floor by \nthe Republican Senators who have come forward with amendments. Many of \nthem clearly want to keep Guantanamo open forever. They talk about a \n$200 million state-of-the-art facility in glowing terms. Well, I have \nbeen there, and I have seen it. I have seen the men and women in \nuniform who toil there each day under tough climate conditions. It gets \npretty hot down there. I know they are working hard for their country. \nBut I think they know, and we know, that continuing Guantanamo is going \nto continue to deteriorate the reputation of the United States around \nthe world--not because of what our soldiers and sailors and military \nhave done there, but simply because it has become a symbol that is \nbeing used by terrorists around the world to recruit enemies against \nthe United States.\n  That is why President Bush called for the closure of Guantanamo, and \nthat is why President Obama has done the same thing. Yet the Republican \nplatform now seems to be ``Guantanamo forever.'' They have built this \nplatform on fear--fear that somehow this administration would be so \nnegligent that it would release terrorists into the United States, into \nthe communities and neighborhoods of this country. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. Not this President, or any President I can \nrecall of either political party, would ever find themselves in a \nposition to jeopardize the safety of this country by releasing \ndetainees who would be dangerous to the United States.\n  But this fear mongering is what has been the basis for their position \non the other side of the aisle when it comes to the security of the \nUnited States.\n  Those who are arguing that we cannot safely hold a terrorist in the \nprisons of America--that is the argument; don't let a detainee from \nGuantanamo ever be considered for a jail or prison of the United \nStates--have overlooked the obvious. Currently, we have 208 inmates in \nthe Bureau of Prison facilities of the United States who are sentenced \nto international terrorism--208 already there; 66 U.S. citizens, 142 \nnon-U.S. citizens. In addition to that, 139 inmates in our U.S. Bureau \nof Prisons have been sentenced for domestic terrorism; 137 U.S. \ncitizens and 2 non-U.S. citizens. Do the math. That is 347 people who \nhave been convicted of terrorism, international and domestic, currently \nbeing held in the prisons of the United States.\n\n  Do I feel less safe in Illinois--in Springfield or Chicago--because \nof that? No, because I know they are being held by professionals in \nfacilities that have a record of safely holding these individuals.\n  The other side suggests if we put one of these Guantanamo detainees \nin a U.S. prison, they will be on the street in a heartbeat. I can't \nimagine that. That is not going to happen. The President wouldn't let \nit happen. Our Bureau of Prisons wouldn't let that happen either.\n  Then there is this other aspect. If we decided at some point to \nprosecute a Guantanamo detainee in the courts of the United States for \na crime, some of the language that has been brought to us by the \nRepublicans would make that impossible. You know why. Well, one \namendment by the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, would not allow \nthe Attorney General to bring that person from Guantanamo Naval Station \ninto the continental United States. The amendment prohibits that. We \ncouldn't even bring them in to try them for a crime, couldn't even \nbring them in to hold them accountable in a court of law for terrorism.\n  Another amendment says we can't hold these prisoners in any U.S. \nprison facility. How do we try a person in the United States and not at \nleast, when they are not in trial, hold them in some prison facility? \nThat is just common sense. The person is dangerous. They are, of \ncourse, detained in a secure facility during the course of the trial. \nSome of the Republican amendments would make that impossible.\n  I don't understand what they are headed to. I think they want to keep \nthis Guantanamo facility, as we have known it, open forever, without \nresolution of the people who are there. That is fundamentally unfair. I \nhave said on the floor of the Senate before, and it is worth repeating, \nthat there are people being held at Guantanamo for whom there are no \ncharges. I know one person in particular who is being represented by a \npro bono lawyer in Chicago. This man has been held for 7 years at \nGuantanamo. Originally, he was from Gaza in the Middle East. There was \na report that he was dangerous. With that report, he was arrested, \ntaken to Guantanamo, and held. After 6 years, he was notified there \nwere no charges against him; he would be free to go if he could figure \nout where to go. And that has been the problem. He has been waiting for \na year for permission to return to Gaza. He is now 26 years old. From \nthe age of 19 to 26 he has been sitting in Guantanamo. Guantanamo \nforever? For him, it must feel like forever.\n  It is about time that we mete out justice. For those being held \nunfairly, they should be released. For those where there are no \ncharges, we should acknowledge that and return them as quickly and \nsafely as possible. For those who are a danger to the United States, we \nshould continue to detain\n\n[[Page S5683]]\n\nthem so they never pose a hazard to our country. For those who can be \ntried, let's try them before our courts of law.\n  President Obama is going through that arduous, specific process now \non each one of these detainees. While his administration is working to \nclean up this mess that he inherited from the previous administration, \nthe Republicans in the Senate are doing everything they can to block \nhis way and make it impossible for him to resolve the situation at \nGuantanamo.\n  I would say the McConnell amendment, page 3, paragraph (2), is a \ndangerous amendment. It is an amendment that could compromise the \nability of the United States of America to prosecute those who could be \na danger to our country. Why would we possibly do that?\n  I urge my colleagues, if I am not given the authority under the rules \nof the Senate to strike that paragraph, to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I begin by thanking him for his \nleadership, his really nonpartisan addressing of this compelling issue.\n  The last time I was on the floor, I talked a lot about the terrible \ncost overruns that were associated recently with literally every new \nweapon system we have acquired. When I tell some of my constituents and \nfriends, they are staggered by the numbers--a small littoral combat \nship that is supposed to cost $90 million ends up costing $400 million \nand has to be scrapped; airplanes costing, depending on how you look at \nit, half a billion dollars each.\n  Working together on both sides of the aisle, and under the leadership \nof Chairman Levin, we have come up with legislation that has gone \nthrough the Congress rather rapidly.\n  I would also like to say that the President of the United States \ncalled us, Members of the House, leaders of the Armed Services \nCommittees, to the White House, where we pledged our support and our \nrapid addressing of this challenge.\n  The only thing more important than the substance of this conference \nreport is the demonstration of bipartisanship that went into how the \nunderlying bills were created and guided through the legislative \nprocess.\n  As I said, I know the chairman of the committee is going to be here \nshortly, and he will discuss many of the specific aspects of this bill. \nBut it does emphasize starting major weapons systems off right by \nhaving those systems obtain reliable and independent cost estimates and \nsubjecting them to rigorous developmental testing and systems \nengineering early in their acquisition cycle. It does a lot of things. \nAs I say, Senator Levin will enumerate many of them.\n  What we are trying to do is address a process where there is a need \nfor a weapon system which takes years to develop. Technical changes are \nincorporated time after time in a desire--and a laudable one--to reach \n100 percent perfection. But then the cost overruns grow and grow.\n  The Future Combat Systems, an Army innovation to address conflicts of \nthe future, was supposed to cost $90 billion. It is up to $120 billion. \nEven more, we still do not have operational vehicles. So, very \nappropriately, the Secretary of Defense announced that he would be \neliminating much of this program to try to get the costs under control.\n  I would like to say a word about the Secretary of Defense, who has \nagreed to continue to serve this country under one of the most \ndifficult and trying positions one can have in Government. The \nSecretary of Defense has announced, I think very appropriately, that we \nwould be reducing and eliminating some programs that have maybe had a \ngood reason for a beginning but certainly have had such incredible cost \noverruns that they no longer are a worthwhile expenditure of the \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  Early in the first couple of weeks of the new administration, a group \nof us attended a gathering. The President of the United States and I \nhad an exchange about the Presidential helicopter. Some years ago, we \ndecided the Presidential helicopter, which is 30 years old, needed \nreplacement. We finally reached a point where we had not built one \ncompletely yet, and it was more than the cost of Air Force One--you \ncannot make that up; it is hard to believe--as one technological change \nafter another was piled on, to the point where neither the President \nnor the Secretary of Defense felt it was worth the cost. The President \ndoes need a new helicopter. We need to embark on that effort. But what \nwe just went through should be an object lesson, and we should learn \nfrom the lessons and cost overruns.\n  I note the presence of the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee in the Chamber. I again thank him for his \nleadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator McCain in \nbringing to the floor the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act. We \nintroduced this bill. We did it on February 23, I believe, and we did \nit to address some of the problems in the performance of the Department \nof Defense major defense acquisition programs at a time when growth and \ncost overruns on these programs have simply reached levels which are \nunaffordable, unsustainable, and unconscionable, in some cases. Since \nthat time, the bill has made rapid legislative progress.\n  I thank Senator McCain for all he has done. This was a bipartisan \neffort. Our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee worked out the \ndifferences that existed, and we unanimously recommended it to the \nSenate. But the magnitude of this problem is such that we must move \nquickly on it. The President has asked us to get the bill to his desk \nby Memorial Day, and it is our hope we will be able to do that.\n  On May 7, the bill passed the Senate unanimously. A week later, a \ncompanion bill passed the House. We\n\n[[Page S5684]]\n\nworked out the differences between the Senate and the House in record \nspeed. The ability to do this was based on the working relationship \nwhich has been built up here. We work on a bipartisan basis in the \nArmed Services Committee. We work on a bicameral basis with the House \nand the Senate. When it comes to issues of national security, \nparticularly, we are able to act so quickly.\n  I publicly thank not only Senator McCain, as I have, and colleagues \nof ours on the Armed Services Committee, but also Chairman Ike Skelton \nand John McHugh of the House Armed Services Committee.\n  This is a tremendously important bill. It has major reforms. It is \ngoing to address some of the most persistent underlying problems we \nhave had that led to the failure of defense acquisition programs. What \nare those problems? The Department relies too often on unreasonable \ncost and schedule estimates. Second, too often the Department insists \non unrealistic performance expectations. Third, the Department too \noften uses immature technologies. Fourth, too often the Department \nadopts these very costly changes to program requirements, to production \nquantities, and to funding levels right in the middle of the ongoing \nprogram.\n  The conference report I hope we will be able to consider in the next \nfew minutes is going to address these problems in the following ways:\n  First, we provide for a strong new Senate-confirmed Director of Cost \nAssessment and Program Evaluation. That person is going to report \ndirectly to the Secretary of Defense to ensure that defense acquisition \nprograms are based on sound cost estimates. The independence of that \noffice is new, and it is essential. That person goes directly to the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense, not as the situation is now where \nthere is a level of bureaucracy between the cost estimator and assessor \nand the Secretary of Defense.\n  Second, we require the Department to rebuild systems engineering and \ndevelopmental testing organizations and capabilities which have been \nalmost dismantled or reduced significantly. We want to ensure that \ndesign problems are understood and addressed early in the process.\n  Third, we establish mechanisms to ensure early tradeoffs are made \nbetween cost, schedule, and performance objectives so that we do not \novercommit to what the Secretary of Defense has called ``exquisite'' \nprogram requirements.\n  Fourth, we require the increased use of competitive prototyping so \nthat we select the best systems and prove they can work before we start \nbuilding them.\n  Fifth, we establish new requirements for continuing competition.\n  Sixth, we address the problem of organizational conflicts of interest \nto ensure we get the best possible results out of the defense industry.\n  Seventh, we require regular program reviews and root cause analyses \nto address developing programs in acquisition programs.\n  Finally, we establish tough new Nunn-McCurdy requirements, so-called. \nWe put teeth in the Nunn-McCurdy approach. We establish a presumption \nof program termination and the requirement that continuing programs be \njustified from the ground up to ensure we do not throw good money after \nbad on failing programs. If a program is failing, now it is too easy to \nget by the Nunn-McCurdy test of continuing a program. It is going to be \na lot harder to jump that hurdle should programs be failing in the \nmiddle or costing a lot more or taking a lot longer.\n  So we have a strong bill. It is going to help change the acquisition \nculture of the Department of Defense, and it is going to point our \nacquisition system in the direction it needs to go. We hope Members of \nthe Senate will join us in supporting this effort and send the bill to \nthe President for his signature.\n  Our staff has done extraordinary work, particularly Peter Levine and \nCreighton Greene on my staff, and Chris Paul and Pablo Corrillo on \nSenator McCain's staff. And, again, I thank all Members and the \nleadership for bringing this bill, pushing it along, and giving us the \nencouragement and support that is so essential to get a bill of this \nmagnitude to the floor of the Senate in record time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the conference report to accompany S. 454 and vote \nimmediately on adoption of the conference report; that upon adoption of \nthe conference report, the Senate then resume consideration of H.R. \n2346 and the McConnell amendment No. 1136, as modified by the Levin \nlanguage to the McConnell amendment, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators McConnell and Durbin or their designees; \nthat upon disposition of the McConnell amendment, the Senate then \nproceed to vote in relation to the Brownback amendment No. 1140, as \nmodified; that prior to the first and third vote, there be 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided and controlled in the usual form; that after the \nfirst vote in this sequence, the succeeding votes be 10 minutes in \nduration, with no amendments in order to the amendments in this \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to the \nconsideration of the conference report to accompany S. 454. The report \nwill be stated.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. 454) \n     to improve the organization and procedures of the Department \n     of Defense for the acquisition of major weapon systems, and \n     for other purposes, having met, after full and free \n     conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to \n     their respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of \n     the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of today, May 20, 2009.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act \nof 2009 would strengthen and reform the Department of Defense \nacquisition processes by bringing increased accountability and \ntransparency to major defense acquisition programs. Simply put, the \nbill would build discipline into the planning and requirements process, \nkeep projects focused, help prevent cost overruns and schedule delays, \nand ultimately save taxpayer dollars.\n  I would like to thank Senators Carl Levin and John McCain, and \nRepresentatives Ike Skelton and John McHugh for their work on this \nimportant issue and their continued efforts to improve procurement at \nthe Department of Defense. I was proud to join Senators Levin and \nMcCain in co-sponsoring this bill in the Senate.\n  This legislation would improve DOD's planning and program oversight \nin many ways. First, the bill would create a new Senate-confirmed \nDirector of Independent Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation to be \nthe ``principal cost estimation official'' at the Department.\n  The bill also mandates that the Department carefully balance cost, \nschedule, and performance as part of the requirements development \nprocess, building discipline into the procurement process long before a \nrequest for proposals is issued or a contract is awarded.\n  I applaud the ``bright lines'' this legislation would establish \nregarding organizational conflicts of interest by DOD contractors. \nThese reforms would strengthen the wall between government employees \nand contractors, helping to ensure that ethical boundaries are \nrespected. While contractors are important partners with military and \ncivilian employees at DOD, their roles and responsibilities must be \nwell defined and free of conflicts of interest as they undertake their \ncritical work supporting our Nation's military.\n  I appreciate the conferees including an amendment that I offered on \nthe floor with Senator Claire McCaskill regarding earned value \nmanagement, EVM. EVM provides important visibility into the scope, \nschedule, and cost of a program in a single integrated system, and when \nproperly applied, EVM\n\n[[Page S5685]]\n\ncan provide an early warning of performance problems.\n  GAO has observed that contractor reporting on EVM often lacks \nconsistency, leading to inaccurate data and faulty application of the \nEVM metric. In other words, garbage in, garbage out.\n  The conference report would require that the Department of Defense \nissue an implementation plan for applying EVM consistently and reliably \nto all projects that use this project management tool.\n  The implementation plan would also provide enforcement mechanisms to \nensure that contractors establish and use approved EVM systems and \nrequire DOD to consider the quality of the contractor's EVM systems and \nreporting in the past performance evaluation for a contract. With \nimproved EVM data quality, both the government and the contractor will \nbe able to improve program oversight, leading to better acquisition \noutcomes.\n  The conference report would strengthen the Department's acquisition \nplanning, increase and improve program oversight, and help prevent \ncontracting waste, fraud, and mismanagement. Ultimately, it will help \nensure that our military personnel have the equipment they need, when \nthey need it, and that tax dollars are not wasted on programs that were \ndoomed to fail.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act \nof 2009 takes steps in the right direction to reform the way the \nDepartment of Defense buys major weapons systems.\n  When it comes to these multi-billion-dollar systems, the challenges \nof managing acquisitions are tremendous.\n  Officials at the Department of Defense manage 96 major defense \nacquisition programs--the Department's most expensive programs.\n  Each program costs hundreds of millions of dollars to research and \ndevelop and billions of dollars more to purchase. Together, these \nprograms account for $1.6 trillion in defense spending.\n  These major defense acquisition programs have seen a shocking growth \nin cost. Over the last 20 years, the costs of these programs have \nballooned by $296 billion.\n  Costs especially exploded during the previous administration. Since \n2003, the cost of major defense acquisition programs rose by $113 \nbillion.\n  The Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 takes important \nsteps to bring this spending under control, without compromising on the \nquality of the systems purchased.\n  This is not the first time Congress has tried to reform the defense \nacquisition process. Nor will it likely be the last. But it is an \nimportant step at a critical time.\n  The legislation would create an independent director of cost \nassessment who would verify the estimated cost of a program before \nallowing it to go forward.\n  It builds in additional checkpoints to help make sure that programs \nare ready on time.\n  It enhances the R capabilities at the Department of Defense. \nNumerous studies have found that the R capabilities of the Army, \nNavy, and Air Force are in desperate need of strengthening.\n  It requires defense contractors to build a strong wall between their \nR and construction offices when both offices work on the same defense \nproject.\n  Finally, it gives combatant commanders more authority to procure \nproducts that meet the immediate needs of troops in theater.\n  Secretary Gates has been rightly frustrated with the inability of the \nregular procurement process to field equipment, like MRAPs, that are \nneeded immediately by troops on the ground. This legislation will help \nchange that.\n  I commend Senators Levin and McCain for their leadership in \ndeveloping this thoughtful and needed legislation. I look forward to \nits being signed into law by President Obama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on the adoption of the conference report.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, both Senator McCain and I spoke on this \nmatter. I ask unanimous consent to yield back all remaining time. I \nthink I can do this with the consent of Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator \nfrom West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from West \nVirginia (Mr. Rockefeller), would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Utah (Mr. Hatch).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2346, and there will be 10 minutes of \ndebate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 1136 offered by the \nSenator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to take a close look \nat Senator Mitch McConnell's amendment, which is next up to be \nconsidered. Particularly, I ask you to turn to page 3 of this \namendment. You will find in the first paragraph on page 3 a troubling \nrequirement which Senator McConnell will make of this administration.\n  What Senator McConnell is asking is that 60 days from the passage of \nthis bill and every 90 days thereafter, the President of the United \nStates provide to Members of the Senate and the House:\n\n       a current summary of the evidence, intelligence, and \n     information used to justify the detention of each detainee \n     listed under paragraph (1) at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.\n\n  It is not enough for Senator McConnell to ask for the identity of \nthese people, the countries they are from, the likelihood they will be \ntransferred to some other place, the likelihood they might be engaged \nin terrorism, he is asking for the President to disclose the work \nproduct of the prosecutors who are holding these detainees and \ndetermining whether a criminal case can be brought against them. For \nwhat\n\n[[Page S5686]]\n\nearthly purpose? Why would we possibly want to jeopardize the \nprosecution of someone who may be guilty of terrorism or a crime \nthreatening the United States? To satisfy our curiosity? I think it is \na mistake.\n\n  I will tell my colleagues, if it is sent to us even in classified \nform, it might be leaked. In addition, if a trial should follow, one of \nthe first discovery motions from any defendant is this information: \nJudge, if the President can share this information with 535 Members of \nCongress, the defendant should be able to see the information as well. \nWhy would we possibly want to jeopardize a prosecution to satisfy the \ncuriosity of the Senator from Kentucky, or any Senator for that matter?\n  This paragraph should have been stricken. The rest of it you may find \ngood or bad, but this is a dangerous paragraph.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that earlier in \nthe day my good friend from Illinois was suggesting that I had been a \nJohnny-come-lately on the issue of Guantanamo. So I would like to \nremind my colleagues that I offered an amendment 2 years ago right here \non the floor of the Senate that passed 94 to 3 opposing bringing people \nat Guantanamo to the United States, and I believe my good friend from \nIllinois was not among the 3.\n  I would also remind him that I differed with the opinion of the \nprevious President that Guantanamo ought to be closed. I don't think it \nought to be closed; I think it ought to be left open. I also have \ndiffered with other Republicans on our side who have believed that \nGuantanamo ought to be closed, but none of them have said: Until you \nhave a game plan for what to do with them.\n  We had the vote earlier today, with only six Senators dissenting on \nthis Guantanamo issue and about whether there would be money not only \nin this bill but in any other bill spent for the purpose of bringing \nthese detainees to the United States.\n  Now let's talk about what this amendment does--the one the Senator \nfrom Illinois was just describing incorrectly, in my view. My amendment \ncalls on the administration to share its findings with Congress in a \nclassified report--a classified report--that would indicate the \nlikelihood of detainees returning to terrorism--we know many of them \nhave been doing that--the likelihood of their returning to terrorism. \nIt would also report on any effort al-Qaida might be making to recruit \ndetainees once they are released from U.S. custody. The last \nrequirement is particularly important, given that many of the remaining \n240 detainees at Guantanamo are from Yemen, which has no rehabilitation \nprogram to speak of, and from Saudi Arabia which has a rehab program \nbut which hasn't been entirely successful at keeping detainees from \nrejoining the fight after rehabilitation.\n  This is a simple amendment that reflects the concerns that Americans \nhave about the danger of releasing terrorists, either here or in their \nhome countries, where they could then, of course, return to the fight. \nUntil now, the administration has offered vague assurances--quite vague \nassurances--that it will not do anything to make Americans less safe. \nThis amendment says Americans expect more than a vague assurance, and \nit would require it.\n  Some have argued such a reporting requirement would reveal classified \ninformation. We just heard the Senator from Illinois say that. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. It would simply require the \nadministration to share this information with a very limited, specific \ngroup in Congress with relevant oversight responsibilities which \nalready has access to the most classified information imaginable--the \nvery same people who already have access to this information.\n  Some have said a reporting requirement isn't necessary. This is also \nfalse. First, because we know the recidivism rate of detainees who \nweren't even considered a serious threat--this is the people they let \ngo because they didn't think they were a serious threat--12 percent of \nthem have gone back to the fight. It is perfectly clear we need to know \nwhether any of the current detainees who may be released in the future \npose a similar or even greater threat of returning to the battle. \nMoreover, a reporting requirement has proven to be necessary by the \nsimple fact that the administration has been so reluctant to share any \ndetails whatsoever about its plans for the inmates at Guantanamo.\n  Senator Sessions, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, has \nmade at least two formal requests for information from the Attorney \nGeneral: First, in a letter of April 2 and, second, in a letter of \nApril 4. To this day, Senator Sessions has not received a reply to \neither one. If the administration isn't willing to share information on \nthese terrorists voluntarily, except, of course, with those folks in \nEurope, then Congress will have to require it through the kind of \nlegislation my amendment represents.\n  Some have argued this reporting requirement would also hinder \nprosecutions by making evidence public. We just heard that from my good \nfriend from Illinois. This is also false for reasons I have already \nenumerated. It would only require a summary of the administration's \nfindings, and the summary would only have to be shared with a small \ngroup--a very small group--of Members in a classified setting. This has \nnever disrupted prosecutions in the past. It will not disrupt \nprosecutions in the future.\n  Some have further suggested that a reporting requirement would be \nonerous. This is false. The administration says it already has begun \nits review of detainees. My amendment simply asks that it share with us \nthe details of that review. Subsequent reports would be made on a \nquarterly basis, which is hardly onerous, particularly given the \ngravity of the issue.\n  Americans would like to have assurance that the President's arbitrary \ndeadline to close Guantanamo by next January will pose no threat to \nthemselves or their families. In fact, just today--this very day--FBI \nDirector Mueller testified before a House Judiciary Committee about his \nconcerns that detainees who are currently held at Guantanamo could \npresent a serious risk not only upon transfer to their home countries \nbut even upon transfer to maximum security prisons in the United \nStates. He cited concerns for their ability to radicalize others and to \nconduct terrorist operations.\n  As to the latter, he cited gang leaders who have been able to run \ntheir gangs from prison as proof that terrorists could--I will continue \non leader time, Mr. President.\n  The FBI Director just today cited the following: The possibility that \ngang leaders who have been able to run their gangs from prison as proof \nthat terrorists could do the same. Imagine that. Terrorists in a prison \nin your home State organizing other prisoners.\n  The Director of the FBI has access to classified information. We \nrecognize him as one of our Nation's top law enforcement officials. He \nis someone who should be taken seriously. That is what he said today.\n  Americans don't want terrorists plotting attacks against us anywhere. \nThey certainly don't want them doing so in our backyards or down the \nroad in the local prison. And Americans don't want terrorists whom we \nrelease attacking our service men and women overseas. That is why the \nadministration should be required to let us know whether any terrorists \nreleased or transferred from Guantanamo pose a risk to our military \nservicemembers overseas. That is what my amendment would do.\n  With all due respect to my friend from Illinois, any other \ncharacterization of it, I must suggest, would be inaccurate.\n  I urge the approval of the amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I won't dwell on the double standard. I \nwon't dwell on the fact that when President Bush suggested Guantanamo \nbe closed, I don't recall a single Republican Senator--certainly not \nSenator McConnell or those who have spoken recently--objecting. I won't \ndwell on the fact that when there were releases of hundreds of \ndetainees from Guantanamo, there was no requirement of an accounting by \nthe Republican side of\n\n[[Page S5687]]\n\nthe aisle about these people and where they were headed. I certainly \nwon't argue the double standard that this President has stepped forward \nand said he will come forward with a plan in detail of how to do this \nin a responsible way.\n  Does anyone in this Chamber seriously believe President Obama would \nrelease a terrorist into their community, into their neighborhood? Can \nyou really say that with a straight face? I don't think you can. The \nAmerican people know better. This President is responsible. Like every \nPresident, he wants to protect us, and to suggest otherwise is not \nresponsible.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has discussed many things today. He has \nfailed to note that we currently have in U.S. prisons 347 inmates being \nheld for terrorism. Currently, in your Federal prison in your State in \nyour backyard, in your neighborhood, according to the Senator from \nKentucky, 347 convicted terrorists are in our prisons today--not at \nGuantanamo, in our prisons.\n  I will get back to the bottom line. Why in the world would we \njeopardize the prosecution of any detainee at Guantanamo with the \nrequirement of the McConnell amendment that the President disclose \nevidence, intelligence, and information to justify the detention of the \ndetainee? It is far better for us not to request that information and \nsuccessfully prosecute that person than to satisfy the curiosity of the \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to retain some of my leader time \nfor rebuttal.\n  Let me just use a moment of my leader time to reiterate the \nfundamental point. The Director of the FBI thinks this is a problem; he \njust said so today. I know the Senator from Illinois is a great lawyer \nand understands all of these matters fully. We think it is important \nfor the relevant Members of Congress to be assured that these \nterrorists do not have the kind of profile that would warrant their \nrelease.\n  This is not an attack on the current administration. The previous \nadministration mistakenly released a number of detainees who went back \nto the battlefield. Why should we not learn from the experience of the \npast and apply it to the future? I hope my amendment will be adopted.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator \nfrom West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. I hope \nwe can get everybody's support. I wish to read it because it is so \nshort, simple, and straightforward:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Defense \n     should consult with State and local government officials \n     before making any decision about where detainees at Naval \n     Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, might be transferred, housed, \n     or otherwise incarcerated as a result of the implementation \n     of the Executive Order of the President to close the \n     detention facilities at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.\n\n  We should all be for that. We put this as ``should'' instead of a \nrequirement. In Leavenworth, KS, they are very concerned about this. \nThey need to be consulted. In Alexandria, VA, the 20th hijacker, \nMoussaoui, was tried, and here is what the mayor of Alexandria said:\n\n       We would be absolutely opposed to relocating Guantanamo \n     prisoners to Alexandria. We would do everything in our power \n     to lobby the President, the Governor, Congress, and everybody \n     else to stop it. We have had this experience and it was \n     unpleasant. Let someone else have it.\n\n  I think we need to consult with the local communities and let them \nspeak. That is why I urge a unanimous vote in favor of this sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am for it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I would like to call up amendment No. \n1189, also for the purposes of having it pending, and then I would like \nto speak about what I am trying to do with the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1189.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                   (Purpose: to protect auto dealers)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n       No funds shall be expended from the Treasury to an auto \n     manufacturer which has notified a dealership that it will be \n     terminated without providing at least 60 days for that \n     dealership to wind down its operations and sell its \n     inventory.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this amendment I have put on the \ntable, and which is now pending, I think is so important because we \nmust try to help the Chrysler dealers that have only gotten 3 weeks' \nnotice to shut down. I am working with the Senators from Michigan who \nhave concerns about whether this amendment would in any way delay the \nbankruptcy proceedings so that Chrysler can come out of that, and I do \nnot want to disrupt that whole effort that is being made to help \nChrysler. So we are working with the White House and with the Senators \nfrom Michigan and the people who are representing Chrysler to try to \ncome up with language that will assure that nothing that we do would \naffect the timeliness of Chrysler being able to come out of bankruptcy \nand the courts.\n  What we are trying to do, however, should not cost Chrysler anything. \nWe want to try to move forward, if we can, to get this agreement and \nthe correct language so as not to affect the bankruptcy in any way but \nto give these dealers more than 3 weeks' notice for shutting down a \ndealership that has been in their family or one that they own and in \nwhich they have made their investments. They are looking at bankruptcy \ntoo.\n  Many times these dealerships are the largest employer in a whole \ncommunity, in a whole county, and we know hundreds of them--over 700 \nacross this country, 789 on May 14--3 weeks' notice to shut down.\n  I know we can do better in this country, Mr. President, and I want to \nwork with everyone who is affected. I have talked to the chairman of \nthe Banking Committee who has agreed to clear this if it meets all the \ntests so it will not hurt the bankruptcy. But these dealers are forced \ninto bankruptcy too, and I hope we can give them just 60 days instead \nof 3 weeks. It is only adding 3 weeks. They will then have much more \ncapability to have an orderly process to shut down their businesses. We \nare not trying to affect the decision. We are not trying to reach into \nChrysler's decisions that they have made that will shut down these \ndealerships. We are just asking for 3 more weeks to let them shut down \nin, hopefully, a little bit better situation. Let them get some help to \nknow what they have to do and to sell all the parts, all the equipment, \nand try to get their financial arrangements in order.\n  This will also be good for the surviving dealerships because, \nhopefully, they are going to buy some of this equipment, and they will \nneed financing to do that as well. Our taxpayers are funding a lot of \nauto manufacturers' operations. I think the least we can do for many of \nthose people who are paying these taxes--and that is the dealers--is to \ngive them a chance.\n  I have a list of the number of dealers in these States that are \ngetting shut down, and I am just asking for some kind of equity for \nthem. It is not equity when they are going to be shut down anyway, but \n3 weeks is just not rational.\n  So I don't want to hurt the Chrysler situation. I don't want to delay \ntheir bankruptcy. I don't want to in any way obstruct what they are \ntrying to do because I want Chrysler to succeed. I do. So I am going to \nwork with the Senators from Michigan, and I am going to work with the \nWhite House to try to come up with language that would say this doesn't \ndelay the bankruptcy, and try to go forward and give these dealers that \n3 extra weeks--the 3 weeks that will help them have an orderly shutdown \nand, hopefully, keep their employees a little longer because this is a \nbig hit to many people in this country--789 dealerships, 3 weeks' \nnotice, Mr. President. I don't think that is the way our country should \nbe operating in this crisis.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I will only take a moment because I know the Senator \nfrom Oregon is on a tight schedule and wants to call up his amendment. \nBut is the Senator proposing legislation?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am proposing an amendment that would give just 3 \nmore weeks to the Chrysler dealers that are going to be shut down--3 \nmore weeks for that process.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for answering the question. I, too, \nam deeply troubled by the plight of these dealers, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to be listed as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator, and I would be glad to list the \nSenator as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Cochran, Brown, McCaskill, and Bond be listed as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1185\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 1185, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is the sense of the Senate that funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of \n     Defense by this title for operations in Iraq should be \n     utilized for those operations in a manner consistent with the \n     United States-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, including \n     specifically that--\n       (1) the United States combat mission in Iraq will end by \n     August 31, 2010;\n       (2) any transitional force of the United States remaining \n     in Iraq after August 31, 2010, will have a mission consisting \n     of--\n       (A) training, equipping, and advising Iraqi Security Forces \n     as long as they remain non-sectarian;\n       (B) conducting targeted counter-terrorism missions; and\n       (C) protecting the ongoing civilian and military efforts of \n     the United States within Iraq; and\n       (3) through continuing redeployments of the transitional \n     force of the United States remaining in Iraq after August 31, \n     2010, all United States troops present in Iraq under the \n     United States-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement will be \n     redeployed from Iraq by December 31, 2011.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWhitehouse be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the amendment I offer this evening is \nvery straightforward. Put simply, I offer\n\n[[Page S5690]]\n\nthis amendment to support and affirm President Obama's plan to end the \nwar in Iraq. This amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nfunding provided in this bill will be used in accordance with the \nUnited States-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement signed this past fall. \nThis agreement--SOFA as it is often referred to--makes it clear that \nour combat mission in Iraq will end next summer.\n  President Obama has been unwavering in his commitment to get our \ntroops out of Iraq. He has repeatedly stated--and in very \nstraightforward terms--that by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in \nIraq will end. President Obama has gone further and declared that any \ntroops remaining in Iraq after that date will be either training Iraqi \nforces, conducting targeted counterterrorism missions, or protecting \nU.S. personnel still in Iraq.\n  After 6 years of intense military operations in Iraq, the time has \ncome to empower the Iraqis to provide their own national security. We \nmust continue to provide training to protect U.S. personnel in the \ncountry and to conduct narrowly focused counterinsurgency missions when \nnecessary. The United States should also provide funding for projects \nthat rebuild Iraq's infrastructure, strengthen its economy, and improve \nthe living conditions of its citizens.\n  Colleagues, next month, the 41st Brigade Combat Team of the Oregon \nNational Guard will send 3,000 soldiers to Iraq. This is the largest \ndeployment of the Oregon National Guard since World War II. I honor \nthese men and women for their valiant and critical service, but I hope \nin the near future we will know that this is the last such deployment \nof our men and women we will send to Iraq.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1138\n\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator DeMint, I would like to call up \namendment No. 1138 and ask that it be reported by number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Merkley], for Mr. DeMint, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1138.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Amending the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, as I address the Chamber this evening, our \ngreat country is in the grips of an unprecedented economic crisis. In \nour lifetime, it has never been harder for American men and women to \nfind a job, to get a loan, or to make ends meet. This Congress has \nboldly taken action in the form of a landmark stimulus package, but \nmillions of Americans are still waiting and wondering. It is a question \nI hear each and every time I travel home to Illinois: Where is our \nstimulus relief? They are waiting for help, waiting for results, \nwaiting to fulfill the promise of the American dream, which suddenly \nseems just out of reach. It is our duty to provide relief in a timely \nmanner, Mr. President. But in the rush to allocate stimulus funds, we \nmust not be too hasty. As we work to get this economy back on track, we \nneed to make sure that every dollar--every dollar--is spent wisely.\n  I have vast experience in this area. During my three terms as \nComptroller of the State of Illinois, I worked hard to maintain \naccountability as money was distributed, so I know how difficult it is.\n  I will also understand the importance of transparency and robust \noversight. That is why I, along with my colleagues, Chairman Lieberman, \nRanking Member Collins, and Senator McCaskill, have introduced S. 104, \nthe Enhanced Oversight of State and Local Economic Recovery Act to \namend the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This measure would \nset aside up to one-half of 1 percent of all the stimulus funds and \nallow State and local governments to use this administrative expense \nreserve to distribute and track the stimulus money as it is received \nand spent.\n  These costs are currently unfunded, leaving taxpayers with no \nconcrete assurance that their money is being efficiently delivered to \nwhere it is most needed. Our legislation would change that, mandating \ncareful oversight and strict regulation as every dollar is spent. This \nmeasure represents common sense and simple good governance. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me as we work to ensure transparency and \naccountability.\n  This bill would be an excellent start, but I think we should even go \nfurther. The American people demand not just basic reform but a \nsweeping expansion of oversight and accountability for their stimulus \ndollars. When this Congress passed the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act, and President Obama signed it into law, we took a \nbold step toward starting to rebuild our economy. But we must ensure \nthat our efforts are not penny wise and pound foolish. Without \ntransparency, without accountability, without oversight, we will not be \neffective. We cannot allow billions of dollars to disappear blindly \ninto State treasuries. Perhaps these dollars would be spent wisely, \nperhaps not. Perhaps is not good enough for the American people and it \nis also not good enough for me. As a former comptroller, I know better \nthan to simply trust that these funds will be put to good use. That is \nwhy I have introduced this bill, to make available the funds to track \nand regulate every dollar of taxpayers' money, to keep government \nofficials honest and accountable to the people they serve.\n  We owe it to the hard-working men and women of this country to send \ntargeted relief on swift wings, and this legislation is an essential \npart of that.\n  I thank Chairman Lieberman, Ranking Member Collins, and my friend \nfrom the great State of Missouri, Senator McCaskill, for joining me in \nthis effort. I ask all my colleagues to support this essential \nlegislation. We must act without delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5691]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1167\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendments so that I may call up my amendment No. 1167.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Bennet], for himself, and \n     Mr. Casey, proposes an amendment numbered 1167.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require the exclusion of combat pay from income for \n purposes of determining eligibility for child nutrition programs and \n  the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and \n                               children)\n\n       On page 4, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 103. MILITARY FAMILY NUTRITION PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Child Nutrition Programs.--Section 9(b) of the Richard \n     B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1758(b)) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(14) Combat pay.--\n       ``(A) Definition of combat pay.--In this paragraph, the \n     term `combat pay' means any additional payment under chapter \n     5 of title 37, United States Code, or otherwise designated by \n     the Secretary to be appropriate for exclusion under this \n     paragraph, that is received by or from a member of the United \n     States Armed Forces deployed to a designated combat zone, if \n     the additional pay--\n       ``(i) is the result of deployment to or service in a combat \n     zone; and\n       ``(ii) was not received immediately prior to serving in a \n     combat zone.\n       ``(B) Exclusion.--Combat pay shall not be considered to be \n     income for the purpose of determining the eligibility for \n     free or reduced price meals of a child who is a member of the \n     household of a member of the United States Armed Forces.''.\n       (b) Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, \n     Infants, and Children.--Section 17(d)(2) of the Child \n     Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786(d)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D); \n     and\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following:\n       ``(C) Combat pay.--For the purpose of determining income \n     eligibility under this section, a State agency shall exclude \n     from income any additional payment under chapter 5 of title \n     37, United States Code, or otherwise designated by the \n     Secretary to be appropriate for exclusion under this \n     subparagraph, that is received by or from a member of the \n     United States Armed Forces deployed to a designated combat \n     zone, if the additional pay--\n       ``(i) is the result of deployment to or service in a combat \n     zone; and\n       ``(ii) was not received immediately prior to serving in a \n     combat zone.''.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, my amendment ensures that active-duty \nsoldiers do not lose family benefits, nutrition benefits that they have \ncome to count on. It is wrong that a combat family would actually loose \nWIC benefits and child nutrition benefits just because the military \nloved one gets called up.\n  I thank my colleagues Senators Johanns and Casey for their support of \nthis amendment.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the actions of the \nfive young Americans who are this year's School Safety Patrol \nLifesaving Award recipients as chosen by the American Automobile \nAssociation.\n  The American Automobile Association, AAA, began the School Safety \nPatrol Program in 1920 as a way to promote traffic safety amongst \nschool children. Since 1949, the AAA School Safety Patrol Program has \nawarded its highest honor, the Lifesaving Award, to those patrollers \nwho have acted to save the life of another. This year five heroic \nSchool Safety Patrollers are receiving this award, and it is my great \nhonor to recognize their courageous actions.\n  In nearby Alexandria, VA, Norman Wallace was at his bus patrol post \nhelping to safely direct fellow Hybla Valley Elementary School students \nexit the bus when he spotted a vehicle coming towards a 5-year-old girl \nwho was crossing in front of the bus. Acting quickly, Norman pulled the \nyoung girl from harm's way. His courageous actions ensured that the \ngirl went unharmed.\n  Lulu Beltran showed great foresight while performing her duty as an \nAAA school safety patroller at Dixie Downs Elementary School in St. \nGeorge, UT. While a fellow student was crossing the street, Lulu \nnoticed that an approaching vehicle was not slowing down. After \nassessing the situation, Lulu moved swiftly and pulled her fellow \nstudent out of harm's way.\n  Working with her patrol advisor at Minnehaha Elementary School in \nVancouver, WA, Sierra Clark acted bravely to prevent a fifth-grade girl \nfrom being hit when a vehicle suddenly sped around a corner. As the \nvehicle approached the crossing, Sierra snapped into action and pushed \nthe girl out of danger.\n  Hunter Turner was patrolling a busy intersection near his Strassburg \nSchool in Sauk Village, IL, when a student began to cross the street \nwithout checking for cars first. As a car turned the corner, Hunter \npulled the student back onto the sidewalk. If not for Hunter's valiant \naction, the student would have been struck.\n  After only 2 weeks at his school safety patrol post at Waterville \nPrimary School in Waterville, OH, Matthew Krause prevented a \nkindergartener from stepping off a sidewalk just as a truck passed. \nMatthew's awareness of his surroundings and attentiveness to his duties \nensured that this 5-year-old remained unscathed.\n  The five patrollers whom I have spoken of exemplify values such as \ncourage, alertness, and a commitment to safety, all of which the AAA \nSchool Safety Patrol Program has promoted over the years. Patrollers \nthroughout our Nation serve an important role in ensuring that our \nyoung people safely navigate traffic hazards to and from school, and I \nthank them for their work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/20/senate-section/article/S5691-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5691-S5692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CUBAN INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

I rise today to support the nomination of a \nman I am proud to call my friend--Larry Echo Hawk. He is President \nObama's nominee to be Assistance Secretary of Indian Affairs. He was \napproved unanimously by this body last night. And he is a wonderful \nchoice.\n  Before I talk about why Larry is so qualified for this position, I \nwant to say a few quick words about how committed he is to this job.\n  Larry was a law professor. And as many of you know, that is a pretty \nnice job.\n  More importantly, as a former BYU quarterback, Larry was named to be \nthe faculty member who oversees the BYU Athletics Department.\n  What I am saying is, rather than spending his days being worshipped \nby law students, publishing ground-\nbreaking articles, and watching college football games from the 50-yard \nline, Larry has chosen to serve his country in the Interior Department. \nIf that is not commitment, I don't know what is.\n  We are very lucky that Larry is so committed to this position because \nI can think of nobody who is better suited for it.\n  Larry's resume speaks for itself. He has the kind of depth and \nbreadth of experience that would make him equal to any job. Over the \ncourse of his career, he has been an advocate and an academic--an \nelected official, a private attorney and a marine. He has worked to put \ncriminals behind bars and to keep children in school. He has fought \ndrug use, domestic violence, and bigotry. And throughout this broad and \nvaried career, he has retained a passionate commitment to his people--\nthe first Americans. As he moved from job to job and even State to \nState, he never stopped working to improve the lives of our country's \nNative Americans.\n  Larry's work has won him awards and acclaim from around the country \nand across the political spectrum. Just recently, a respected law \nprofessor suggested that Larry replace Justice Souter on the Supreme \nCourt. This is a man who really could do anything.\n  And Larry is more than a very accomplished lawyer and public servant. \nHe is a deep and innovative thinker.\n  Larry grew up in Farmington, NM, but I first got to know him when we \nwere both elected state attorneys general in 1990. At the time, Larry \nwas the first Native American to be elected to a statewide \nconstitutional office anywhere in the United States.\n  And Larry's path breaking did not stop there. Shortly after his \nelection, he began to spread what, at the time, was a very new idea--\nconflicts with tribes should not be settled in court.\n  Back then, state AGs were in court with the tribes all the time. \nNobody won those cases because the bad blood on both sides turned any \noutcome into a defeat.\n  Larry was the first to say, ``We can do better.'' And he was right.\n  I followed Larry's advice, and as a result New Mexico's relationship \nwith our tribes was more productive for everybody involved.\n  The author Dov Seidman has written that, ``Laws tell you what you can \ndo. Values inspire in you what you should do.''\n  Larry knows the law well enough to understand what is possible. But, \nmore importantly, he has the values to know when it is time to expand \nthe realm of the possible--to break old habits and try new ideas. He is \na leader who can bring change to a Bureau that desperately needs it.\n  At BIA, we need somebody who can work with tribal governments and \ntribal members with an attitude of respect. We need somebody who \ncombines a deep knowledge of Indian issues with the compassion that \ncomes from common experience and common culture. We need a great mind \nconnected to a great heart.\n  In short, we need Larry Echo Hawk. I thank you all for supporting his \nnomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/20/senate-section/article/S5692-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          CELEBRATING THE 100 YEAR BIRTHDAY OF POWELL, WYOMING\n\n Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, on May 25, 2009, we will \ncelebrate the centennial of Powell, WY. Located in the valley of the \nShoshone River, Powell is surrounded by the Absaroka and Big Horn \nmountain ranges, and is east of Yellowstone National Park.\n  One hundred years ago, the U.S. Reclamation Service offered for sale \nlots in a tract of land designated as the Powell Townsite. The sale \nbegan the last week in May 1909 and by June 30 of that year all lots in \nthe square mile tract were purchased. The sale totaled $16,750. While a \nthriving community was officially born May 25, 2009, the area had been \noccasionally populated for tens of thousands of years. Stone circles \nprovide the archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence to show that \nthe Shoshone and Crow had active family organizations, camp activities, \nand domestic life in the area.\n  Perhaps the first White man to view what would become Powell was \nLewis and Clark's colleague, John Colter. During the winter of 1807, \nColter made the solitary trek from Fort Manuel Lisa to inform the \nNative Americans living near the Clark Fork River that a new trading \npost had been established. On his way back, he viewed the sagebrush \nflats along the Stinking Water River. Just a century later, the town of \nPowell would be born--and the river renamed Shoshone.\n  In 1906, the U.S. Reclamation Service established an engineering camp \non the sagebrush flats and called it Camp Colter. Yet when the townsite \nwas offered for sale, a new name was necessary since another location \nin the Big Horn Basin was also named for the Lewis and Clark explorer. \nThe town's forefathers chose to honor Major John Wesley Powell, an \nearly explorer, conservationist and reclamationist--and the former head \nof the U.S. Reclamation Service Geodetic Survey.\n  Powell is a terrific community. On the town's centennial blog, Cathy \nHoward Miller writes, ``Powell--a small town where everyone knows you \nand you know them, a place to raise children, where you can feel \nsafe.'' Cathy's words sum up the reason why Powell was elected as one \nof 10 All-America Cities in 1994. With a population of 5,381, its \neconomy is based upon oil, irrigated farming, ranching, tourism, and \nagricultural support services.

MYLES BRAND\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I recognize a constituent and a \ndear friend, Dr. Myles David Brand, a man of uncommon integrity and \nvision whose leadership has restored an ethos of scholastic achievement \nto collegiate athletics in America.\n  Dr. Brand took over as the fourth chief executive officer of the \nNational Collegiate Athletics Association, NCAA, in January 2003, and \nthe intervening years have been marked by an unyielding focus on \nreorienting the NCAA's priorities in ways aimed to nurture and support \nthe student athlete.\n  Dr. Brand delivered a watershed speech in 2001 at the National Press \nClub, in which he enunciated the mission statement that would come to \ndefine his tenure leading the NCAA: ``Academics must come first.''\n  Dr. Brand warned against the ``bleeding of the entertainment industry \nwith intercollegiate athletics'' and cautioned that falling academic \nperformance ``risks undermine the integrity of a system of higher \neducation that is without question right now leading the world.''\n  ``Athletic success,'' he said, ``cannot substitute for academic \nsuccess. Universities must be seen, and understood, and judged by their \nachievements as\n\n[[Page S5693]]\n\nacademic institutions, not sports franchises.''\n  As NCAA president, Dr. Brand spearheaded the most comprehensive \npackage of academic reforms governing college athletics in our \nlifetime. Under his leadership, the NCAA raised eligibility standards \nfor freshmen and toughened requirements that its 400,000 scholarship \nathletes make annual progress toward a degree to maintain their \neligibility. Dr. Brand's reforms subjected teams with poor overall \nacademic performance to unprecedented penalties, including bans on bowl \ngames and postseason play.\n  The result: Today, NCAA graduation rates exceed those of the general \nstudent population in every demographic category. Last year, the NCAA's \noverall graduation rate for its student athletes stood at 79 percent. \nThe graduation rate of female student athletes outpaced nonathletes by \n8 percent, while the graduation rate for African-American male student \nathletes was 10 percent higher than their nonathletic peers.\n  For redefining what is scholastically possible in such a short time \nspan, Dr. Brand will forever be known as the NCAA's ``Education \nPresident.''\n  It should be noted that despite Dr. Brand's unrelenting focus on \nhelping students make the grade, he has never lost sight of the joy of \nmaking the shot. ``Anyone who thinks that college is only about the \nlibrary, the lecture hall, and the laboratory really doesn't understand \nwhat happens in college,'' he once told a journalist.\n  I can personally attest that Myles Brand harbors an unsurpassed love \nfor the game played on the field and a belief in the power of the NCAA \nto be a dreammaker for young people.\n  Yet he has remained true to his pledge that ``academics must come \nfirst.'' In 2003, Dr. Brand became the first university president ever \nchosen to lead the NCAA. A philosopher by training and inclination, Dr. \nBrand has earned admiration as a level-headed leader interested in \ncritical examination and reform. USA Today called him ``the strongest, \nmost vocal and influential leader college sports has had in . . . \ndecades.''\n  Prior to taking over the NCAA, the people of the great State of \nIndiana enjoyed a front-row seat to his many accomplishments in \nacademia. From 1994 to 2002, he served as the 16th president of my alma \nmater, Indiana University. Dr. Brand led IU through a period of \nremarkable growth, attracting record enrollments, doubling research \nfunding, and establishing the university as a national leader in the \nlife sciences and information technology. He increased the school's \nendowment by a factor of four and tripled the number of endowed chairs. \nUnder Dr. Brand's leadership, IU created a nationally renowned School \nof Informatics and developed the Central Indiana Life Sciences \nInitiatives. His trailblazing leadership was recognized in 2001 when \nTime Magazine named Indiana University its ``College of the Year.''\n  When Dr. Brand left IU to assume the NCAA presidency, he did not have \nto go far--traveling 40 miles up State Road 37 from Bloomington to \nIndianapolis, where the NCAA is headquartered.\n  The NCAA has been a model corporate constituent under Dr. Brand's \nmanagement, employing more than 410 Hoosiers with well-paying jobs \nwhile maintaining a strong community presence. It has helped hundreds \nof charities, schools and local organizations throughout Indiana, such \nas United Way and the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. After \nHurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast, the NCAA dispatched teams of \nstudent athletes and considerable financial resources to the region to \nrebuild family homes.\n  Dr. Myles David Brand is a loving and devoted husband to his wife, \nPeg; a wonderful father and grandfather; and a special leader who I am \nproud to recognize today for his contributions to college sports, the \nState of Indiana, and the country as a whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/20/senate-section/article/S5693-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING PEGGY BURGIN\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the life of a \nvery special resident of my home State of Alaska, Peggy Burgin.\n  Mrs. Burgin was the embodiment of a true Alaskan. While living in \nAlaska, she witnessed such historical events as the 1964 earthquake and \nthe construction of the Trans-Alaska pipeline. Mrs. Burgin devoted much \nof her life to volunteering for many community groups. She leaves \nbehind many friends who are grateful to have known this remarkable \nwoman.\n  On behalf of her family and her many friends, I ask today we honor \nPeggy Burgin's memory. I ask that her obituary, published May 12, 2009, \nin the Anchorage Daily News, be printed in the Record.\n  The information follows:\n\n       [From the Anchorage Daily News, May 12, 2009]\n\n       Peggy Arlene Burgin, 89, died peacefully May 5, 2009, at \n     Alaska Regional Hospital, where she received exceptional \n     loving care from the entire staff. A celebration of life is \n     being planned for June. Born Aug. 16, 1919, in Bellingham, \n     Wash., to Michael and Minnie Burns, she worked from an early \n     age to help her widowed mother and younger brother. She went \n     to business college, was president of the Alpha Chapter of \n     Beta Sigma Phi sorority and was a lifelong Democrat. She \n     moved to Anchorage in July 1947 to marry Lee Morrow, a \n     veteran Air Force pilot with postwar Alaska dreams. Ten \n     months later the small plane he was co-piloting disappeared \n     in the Susitna Valley and was never recovered. Shaken, she \n     returned briefly to Washington, but her love for Alaska drew \n     her right back. Working for an air cargo firm and later First \n     National Bank of Anchorage, she made an impact as a single \n     determined woman in a rough young town. She met and married \n     another Alaska enthusiast, Fred Burgin, and together with \n     their children, Salli, Jim and Judi, they experienced many \n     adventures including the 1964 earthquake, pipeline \n     construction and homesteading in Point MacKenzie. There she \n     homeschooled the kids, shot a bear that tried to join them in \n     the cabin and ran the homestead while Fred was away at \n     construction jobs.\n       As a Teamster, Peggy was hired to start the Teamster Credit \n     Union (now Denali Alaskan Federal Credit Union), where she \n     achieved her goal of helping members start businesses and buy \n     homes. Politically involved, both Peggy and Fred received \n     their territorial voter registrations from Senator E.L. \n     ``Bob'' Bartlett and often canceled each other's vote. Peggy \n     was one of the founding members of the Bartlett Democratic \n     Club, rarely missing the weekly meetings. She chaired and \n     worked on many campaigns and was a delegate for Alaska at \n     Clinton's presidential caucus.\n       Although busy with career and family, she was the ultimate \n     volunteer and contributor with this partial list of \n     organizations that benefited from her enthusiasm: Inlet View \n     PTA, Alaska Regional Hospital Auxilliary, Alaska Native \n     Hospital gift shop, Anchorage Senior Activity Center, \n     Anchorage Unitarian Fellowship, Teamster 959 Retirees, \n     Alaskan Commission on Aging, Pioneers of Alaska, STAR, \n     Victims for Justice, Blood Bank of Alaska, women's equality \n     groups and several credit unions. Peggy was a devoted friend \n     to people of all ages and walks of life, always willing to \n     give kids a hand up or a haven. She valued education, writing \n     and courtesy and was described by one friend as one of the \n     last true pioneer ladies--elegant, gracious, generous and as \n     tough as nails. She loved traveling to Hawaii, Washington and \n     New York and even toured China. She enjoyed staying connected \n     to her myriad friends, watching Alaska politics on cable and \n     getting her hair ``fluffed'' (her word) at Trendsetters.\n       Peggy was predeceased by her daughter Judi, and her \n     husbands, Lee and Fred. She is survived by her son and \n     daughter-in-law, Jim Burgin and Janice Ray, daughter, Salli \n     Burgin; grandchildren, Erin Malone (Jason Dallman), Devin \n     Malone, Dante Modaffari, and Bryant Burgin; great-\n     granddaughters, Ava and Lena Malone-Dallman, all of Alaska \n     and Washington; and by her brother, Robert Burns and family \n     of Idaho. The family wishes to thank Peggy's doctors, \n     Kathleen Case and Vernon Cates, for her many years of \n     energetic health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/20/senate-section/article/S5693-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5693-S5694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING NORVAL POHL\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Dr. Norval \nPohl, former president of the University of North Texas, who passed \naway last week after a courageous battle against pancreatic cancer.\n  Dr. Pohl joined the UNT com unity in 1999 as the executive vice \npresident and provost and became the university's 13th president in \nOctober 2000.\n  Under Dr. Pohl's leadership at UNT, enrollment grew from 27,000 to \nover 32,000 students. During the same period, the university's Latino \nenrollment increased by 48 percent and African-American enrollment \nincreased by 43 percent. Financial aid awards increased from $57.8 \nmillion to $172.2 million, and annual giving to UNT increased from $4.7 \nmillion to $13.4 million. Dr. Pohl is also recognized for addressing \ntitle IX issues with the acquisition of the Liberty Christian School\n\n[[Page S5694]]\n\nproperty, which increased both academic and athletic space for the \nuniversity.\n  Among his other accomplishments, he worked to advance UNT as a public \nresearch institution. He fulfilled a long held desire at UNT for an \nengineering school by establishing the College of Engineering and \ncreating a permanent home for engineering at the UNT Research Park.\n  After leaving UNT, he joined the faculty at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical \nUniversity's Prescott campus and was named chief academic officer in \nJanuary of this year.\n  Dr. Pohl spent the better part of his career in higher education \nserving as both an administrator and a professor at several \nuniversities across the southwest. Dr. Norval Pohl was a great asset to \nthe academic communities he served and he will be missed at the \nuniversities he leaves behind. I would like to express my condolences \nto Dr. Pohl's family and friends and my admiration for his devotion to \nhigher education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/20/senate-section/article/S5694-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL JOHN HENRY TOWERS\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to honor and commemorate in \nthe Record of the Senate ADM John Henry Towers, pioneer naval aviator, \non the 90th anniversary of the first crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in \nan airplane on May 8, 2009.\n  Admiral Towers was born and raised in Rome, GA, and graduated from \nthe U.S. Naval Academy with the class of 1906. As one of the earliest \nof all naval aviators, he participated in the development of new \naviation technology and the application of air power as a part of the \nsurface fleet. By the time World War II was over, Admiral Towers was \nthe senior surviving aviator of the Navy.\n  In every chapter of the early development of naval aviation, John \nTowers made his mark. He organized the Navy's entry into aviation in \n1911. Admiral Towers worked very closely with Glenn Curtiss in \ndesigning the first naval aircraft and due to his efforts became known \nto his peers as the ``Crown Prince of Aviation.''\n  Towers held aviation records for endurance, altitude, and speed. He \nsurvived a fall out of an airplane in 1913 by hanging onto the aircraft \nstrut as it crashed into the Severn River from 1,300 feet. \nUnfortunately, his pilot-in-training, ENS, William Billingsly, was \nkilled and became the first naval aviation fatality. As a result, \nTowers mandated seat belts and harnesses in all naval aircraft after \nthe crash. He also took the Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt, future President of the United States, for his first \nairplane ride, which secured a special friendship that lasted their \nwhole careers.\n  Admiral Towers was the first to use naval aircraft in combat in the \nMexican War in 1914. Then, in 1919, he conceived, organized, and \ncommanded the first flight of three Navy NC-flying boats to fly across \nthe Atlantic Ocean, fulfilling his early vision to be the first flight \nacross the Atlantic Ocean. The flights began at Rockaway Beach, NY, on \nMay 8, 1919, and one of the planes made it to Plymouth, England, on May \n31, 1919. It was Towers' vision that inspired others and changed the \nworld forever. The flight actually lasted 52 hours 31 minutes, for a \ndistance of 3,936 nautical miles.\n  Towers and his group became international celebrities. During their \nAtlantic crossing, the Nation was on pins and needles reading about the \nhappenings each day, particularly when they received the news that \nTowers' float boat NC-3 went down and was lost at sea for 5 days. After \nhe sailed the seaplane 200 miles to the Azores, his became a household \nname around the world.\n  The significance of this epic flight affected the psyche of the \nAmerican public because until that time, we were largely protected from \ninvasion by having two oceans on either side of us. When the airplane \nmade that first Atlantic crossing, Americans became aware that we were \nnot immune from future wars on our soil. In addition, Britain, France, \nand Germany were more advanced in aviation than the United States. When \nthe United States beat them across the Atlantic, we were immediately \nthrust into a ``super power'' status. The U.S. Navy beat the world in \ncrossing the Atlantic.\n  Admiral Towers' career was a stubborn, determined battle to gain \nacceptance for aviation from a Navy that was dominated by battleship \nadmirals. He was the first to integrate women into the U.S. Navy and \nU.S. Marines by creating the W.A.V.E.S. in 1942. The W.A.V.E.S. \neventually grew to 12,000 women officers and 75,000 enlisted women. He \nwas also the first to obtain four stars in any branch of service in the \nState of Georgia and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.\n  Apollo 17 honored the admiral and his contribution to aviation by \nnaming a crater on the Moon in his name. In addition, he was honored by \nTime magazine and placed on the front cover for his efforts during \nWorld War II. Towers began in naval aviation at its inception in 1911 \nand remained dedicated to the field through his retirement in 1947. He \nis a member of five Aviation Halls of Fame.\n  It is a privilege to pay tribute to the remarkable life of ADM John \nHenry Towers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/20/senate-section/article/S5694-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING CECIL E.

For his \nheroic actions in World War II, Cecil received the Navy Cross, Silver \nStar, Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal. His bravery is \nagain being honored in with the dedication of the Cecil E. Harris \nHighway in northeast South Dakota.\n  This Cresbard native was enrolled in the Northern State Teachers \nCollege when he enlisted in the Navy in March 1941 and was sent to \nnorthern Africa. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor nine months \nlater, Cecil's remarkable flying abilities were noted and he was moved \nto the Pacific to combat the Kamikaze attacks. Cecil shot down 24 enemy \nwarplanes in 81 days while never taking a single bullet on his own \nplane, making him the second-ranking World War II Naval Ace.\n  After the war, Cecil returned home to become a teacher and coach. In \n1951, he was called to Tennessee to train pilots for the Korean war. He \nwas then promoted to captain and sent to the Pentagon. He retired in \nJune 1967 after serving 27 years in the Navy. He passed away in 1981 \nand is buried in Arlington Cemetery.\n  This stretch of Highway 20 will bear the name of a dedicated and \ndecorated war hero. Cecil Harris exemplified South Dakota values in his \nunwavering commitment to his country, and I commend the South Dakota \nDepartment of Transportation for honoring this outstanding \nindividual.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/20/senate-section/article/S5694-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5694-S5695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING ROSEPINE CONCERT BAND\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize 72 \nyoung musicians from Rosepine High School. On April 29, 2009, these \nstudents travelled from the heart of Vernon Parish in Louisiana to \ncompete against 28 bands at the Music in the Parks Festival in \nWilliamsburg, VA. Although Rosepine was the smallest school to compete \nin their class, hailing from a town of approximately 1,300 people, they \nreceived a superior rating and were ranked ``Top of All Bands.''\n  As a reward for this outstanding accomplishment, the entire band \nreceived an educational tour of both historic Williamsburg and \nWashington, DC. I trust that they were inspired and motivated by their \ntrip to our Nation's Capital.\n  These bright young stars are proof that with hard work, \ndetermination, and the right amount of support and encouragement, \nanything is possible. I believe that constant support and supervision \nfrom families and instructors can guide students to a path of success \nand achievement. In addition, I would like to congratulate Rosepine's \nband director, Tra Lantham, and thank him for his dedication and \ncommitment to the students as well as the school's music department.\n  I ask that these names be printed in the Record.

Mr. President, this week is National Small Business \nWeek, a time when our country focuses on the immense efforts our 27 \nmillion small businesses make to the health and vitality of our \nNation's economy. As we are presently engaged in two wars, innovative \ncompanies that produce cutting-edge defense products are critical to \nour Nation's military success. In that vein, I rise to recognize the \ncolossal efforts of one such small business from my home State of \nMaine, Howe and Howe Technologies.\n  Located in the southern Maine town of Eliot, Howe and Howe \nTechnologies focuses on the design and production of extreme vehicles, \nspecifically tanks. And for brothers Mike and Geoffrey Howe, the \ncompany's owners, building tanks has been a passion for over a decade. \nAfter high school, they began work on the original Ripsaw 1, their \nfirst unmanned vehicle, in the garage of their childhood home. By 2004, \nthey were entering their vehicle in an endurance test for unmanned \nvehicles that was sponsored by the military. While they did not win \nthat trial, the brothers received a boost of confidence that their \nproducts could compete in the long run, leading to the establishment of \nHowe and Howe Technologies in 2006.\n  Each of the company's tanks is designed with a particular use in \nmind. For instance, the Subterranean Rover 1, or SR1, was commissioned \nby the Shoal Creek Mine in Alabama to specifically withstand the harsh \nconditions of coal mines. The PAV1, or Badger, was built for the \nCalifornia Protection Services for use by SWAT teams and other law \nenforcement agencies. And the Ripsaw MS1, which is currently being \ntested by the U.S. Army, is an unmanned ground vehicle, or UGV, \ndesigned especially for military use. Howe and Howe's vehicles are \ncritical to our military's mission, as they are unmanned vehicles that \ncan be placed in dangerous situations without harm to personnel. \nAdditionally, the vehicles can operate for almost 300 miles until \nrefueling, can be controlled remotely, and provide the military with a \nfaster alternative to the unmanned vehicles they presently have.\n  The Howe brothers take pride in their work, and industry experts are \ncertainly taking notice. The Ripsaw MS1, which is Howe and Howe's \nlatest vehicle, was just selected by Popular Science magazine as ``The \nFastest Tank'' in the listing of its 2009 Invention Awards. The \nmagazine publishes these awards annually to highlight a diverse array \nof creative and innovative products America's businesses are \nmanufacturing, from power shock absorbers to IV catheters. \nAdditionally, Howe and Howe has recently learned that its PAV1 Badger \nwill be acknowledged as the ``World's Smallest Tank'' in the ``2010 \nGuinness Book of World Records.''\n  Last Saturday was Armed Forces Day, a day to reflect on the \nsignificant sacrifices our men and women in uniform have made on behalf \nof our Nation's security. Let us also pay homage to those civilians who \nassist them by creating state-of-the-art products that make their \nmissions safer and stronger, and that ultimately save lives. I \ncongratulate Mike and Geoffrey Howe and everyone at Howe and Howe \nTechnologies for their exceptional work ethic and inventive products, \nand wish them continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/20/senate-section/article/S5695-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING SERGEANT AUBIE L. ATKINS, JR.\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to honor and recognize SGT \nAubie L. Atkins, Jr., for making the ultimate sacrifice in service to \nour country. Nearly 67 years after his death in WWII, he will be home \nfor good and laid to rest next to his parents in their Claiborne Parish \ntown of Athens. I would like to take a few moments to speak of his \ncourage and heroism.\n  Atkins grew up in Athens, LA, and attended Louisiana Tech University \nfor 1 year before enlisting in the Army in 1941. He was trained in \ncommunications and assigned to the crew of a B-25 Mitchell bomber in \nthe 405th Bombardment Squadron in the southwestern Pacific. Atkins, \nalong with seven other crew members, took off aboard a bomber nicknamed \n``The Happy Legend'' from Port Moresby on a mission to bomb Buna on \nDecember 5, 1942. Unfortunately, their plane went down and disappeared \nnear the Kokoda Pass, Papua New Guinea. Military authorities believed \nthe plane was shot down by the Japanese during a bombing run. The crew \nwas declared dead, and all were memorialized on the tablets of the \nmissing at Manila American Cemetery, Philippines, by the American \nBattle Monuments Commission.\n  Members of the 1st Australian Corps found the crash in February 1943 \nalong with the pilot's remains and Atkins' identification tags, but \nbecause enemy troops remained in the vicinity, the allied soldiers had \nto abandon the site. Several attempts were launched to retrieve \nwreckage and the airmen's remains, but the wreckage was in a water-\nfilled crater making it too difficult and dangerous. But, in 2005 \nAtkins' remains were identified using DNA that was donated in 2007 by \nhis last surviving sibling, just months before her own death.\n  There is no doubt that December 5, 1942, was a tragic day, not only \nfor the families of the fallen crew members but also for the B-25 \nfamily, the community, and the Nation. On Saturday, May 16, Sergeant \nAtkins was properly buried with full military honors, including a jet \nflyover and a 21-gun salute. Although all of Atkins' seven siblings are \ndeceased, three subsequent generations were present to honor and pay \ntheir respects.\n  Thus, today, I honor the memory of fellow Louisianan Aubrey Atkins, \nJr., and thank him for his devotion and service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/20/senate-section/article/S5695-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/20/senate-section/article/S5695-4", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the presiding officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/20/senate-section/article/S5695-5", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5695-S5696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13303 OF MAY 22, 2003, WITH \n              RESPECT TO THE STABILIZATION OF IRAQ--PM 20\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to the United States Fish and \n     Wildlife Service working cooperatively with the state's \n     regulatory agencies and energy producers; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Joint Memorial 8001\n\n       Whereas, in 2006 the voters passed Initiative No. 937, \n     targets for energy conservation and the use of eligible \n     resources, including wind, by the state's large utilities; \n     and\n       Whereas, in 2007 the Legislature adopted the goals of \n     reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, \n     reducing emissions to 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2035, \n     and reducing emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by \n     2050; and\n       Whereas, during this time of economic uncertainty, the \n     construction and operation of wind and other alternative \n     energy sites presents an opportunity to bring new jobs and \n     valuable economic opportunities to Washington communities; \n     and\n       Whereas, the increased use of wind and other alternative \n     energy resources produced in Washington will help move the \n     state towards energy independence, and help to decrease the \n     billions of dollars Washingtonians currently pay each year \n     for imported fuel; and\n       Whereas, the federal endangered species act (16 U.S.C. Sec. \n     1531 et seq.) can pose significant challenges, including \n     regulatory uncertainty, for those seeking to develop wind and \n     other alternative energy projects in locations that could \n     potentially impact any wildlife listed as threatened or \n     endangered; and\n       Whereas, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, \n     housed within the United States Department of the Interior, \n     is the agency with primary responsibility for implementing \n     and enforcing the federal endangered species act;\n       Now, Therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     the United States Fish and Wildlife Service work \n     cooperatively with the state's regulatory agencies and energy \n     producers to resolve these federal endangered species act \n     issues in a manner that allows the continued development of \n     Washington's wind and other alternative energy resources \n     while at the same time protecting threatened and endangered \n     wildlife.\n       Be it resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the \n     United States, the Secretary of the Department of the \n     Interior, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-21. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to urging the enactment of \n     legislation to eliminate the 24 month Medicare waiting period \n     for participants in Social Security Disability Insurance; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Joint Memorial 8013\n\n       Whereas, created in 1965, the federal Medicare program \n     provides health insurance coverage for more than 40 million \n     Americans; although most of those enrolled are senior \n     citizens, approximately 6 million enrollees under the age of \n     65 have qualified because of permanent and severe \n     disabilities, such as spinal cord injuries, multiple \n     sclerosis, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other illness \n     or disorder; and\n       Whereas, despite the physical and financial hardships \n     wrought by these conditions and the fact that Social Security \n     Disability Insurance (SSDI) is designed for individuals with \n     a work history who paid into the social security system \n     before the onset of their disability, federal law mandates a \n     24 month waiting period from the time a disabled individual \n     first receives SSDI benefits to the time Medicare coverage \n     begins; a prerequisite to Medicare, the SSDI program itself \n     delays benefits for 5 months while the person's disability is \n     determined, effectively creating a 29 month waiting period \n     for Medicare; and\n       Whereas, this restriction affects a significant number of \n     Americans in need; as of January 2002, there were \n     approximately 1.2 million disabled persons who qualified for \n     SSDI and were awaiting Medicare coverage, many of whom were \n     unemployed because of their disability; consequently, under \n     these conditions, by the time Medicare began, an estimated 77 \n     percent of those individuals would be poor or nearly poor, 45 \n     percent would have incomes below the federal poverty line, \n     and close to 40 percent would be enrolled in state Medicaid \n     programs; and\n       Whereas, furthermore, it has been estimated that as many as \n     one-third of the individuals currently awaiting coverage may \n     be uninsured and likely to incur significant medical expenses \n     during the 2 year waiting period, often with devastating \n     consequences; studies indicate that the uninsured are likely \n     to delay or forgo needed care, leading to worsening health \n     and even premature death, and the American Medical \n     Association has determined that death rates among SSDI \n     recipients are the highest in the first 24 months of \n     enrollment; and\n       Whereas, eliminating the 24 month waiting period not only \n     would prevent worsening illness and disability for SSDI \n     beneficiaries, thereby reducing more costly future medical \n     needs and potential longterm reliance on public health care \n     programs, but could also save the Medicaid program as much as \n     4.3 billion dollars at 2002 program levels, including nearly \n     1.8 billion dollars in savings to states and 2.5 billion \n     dollars in federal savings that would help offset a \n     substantial portion of the accompanying increase in Medicare \n     expenditures; and\n       Whereas, recognizing the consequences of the waiting period \n     to those suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), \n     or Lou Gehrig's disease, the 106th Congress passed H.R. 5661 \n     in 2000 and eliminated the requirement for enrollees \n     diagnosed with the disease; in passing H.R. 5661, the \n     congress acknowledged the enormous difficulties faced by \n     those diagnosed with severe disabilities and established \n     precedent for the exception to be extended to all the \n     disabled on the Medicare waiting list;\n       Now, therefore, your Memorialists respectfully urge the \n     United States Congress to enact legislation to eliminate the \n     24 month Medicare waiting period for participants in Social \n     Security Disability Insurance.\n       Be it resolved, that copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-22. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to the United Nations Convention \n     on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against \n     Women; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                       Senate Joint Memorial 8012\n\n       Whereas, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Discrimination Against Women was adopted by the United \n     Nations General Assembly on December 18, 1979, became an \n     international treaty on September 3, 1981, and by August \n     2006, one hundred eighty-five nations including all of the \n     industrialized world, except the United States, have agreed \n     to pursue the Convention's goals; and\n       Whereas, the United States supports and has a position of \n     leadership in the United Nations, was an active participant \n     in the drafting of the Convention and signed the Convention \n     in 1980, but to date has not ratified it; and\n       Whereas, the spirit of the Convention is to affirm faith in \n     fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of each \n     person, and in the goal of equal rights, opportunities, and \n     protections for women and girls; and\n       Whereas, the Convention provides a comprehensive framework \n     for advancing the rights, opportunities, and protections for \n     women and girls, half the world's population, which framework \n     is implemented by individual countries in ways appropriate to \n     their own countries; and\n       Whereas, much research has found that discrimination based \n     on sex results in less education for girls and women, fewer \n     job opportunities and lower pay for women, slower national \n     economic productivity and growth, and retards the ability of \n     developing countries to grow their economies and contribute \n     to global economic recovery; and\n       Whereas, women in every country play fundamentally \n     important economic roles in their economies and frequently \n     constitute the major economic support for their families; and\n       Whereas, although women in many parts of the world have \n     made major gains in struggles for equality in social, \n     business, political, legal, education, and other fields, much \n     more needs to be accomplished; and\n       Whereas, through its active support and moral leadership, \n     the United States can help create a world where women and \n     girls have equal legal protections, human rights, education \n     and economic opportunities, personal safety, health care, and \n     more;\n       Now, therefore, your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     President Obama and Secretary Clinton place the United \n     Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Discrimination Against Women in the highest category of \n     priority in order to accelerate the treaty's passage through \n     the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the full United \n     States Senate with the goal of ratification by the United \n     States; and that the Washington State Legislature urge the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee to pass this treaty \n     favorably out of Committee and recommend it be approved by \n     the full United States Senate: Be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the \n     United States, Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State, Hilda \n     Solis, Secretary of Labor, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each\n\n[[Page S5699]]\n\n     member of Congress from the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-23. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington relative to electronic medical and health \n     records; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                       Senate Joint Memorial 8003\n\n       Whereas, expanded health information technology has the \n     potential to revolutionize the delivery of health care in the \n     United States by enabling continuity of care, improving cost \n     efficiency, lowering rates of medical malpractice, decreasing \n     duplicative care, providing better care management for \n     patients, and producing better health outcomes; and\n       Whereas, major investments in the hardware and software \n     infrastructure required to facilitate the expansion of health \n     information technology are being made now by health care \n     providers; and\n       Whereas, the health information systems currently being \n     constructed are often incapable of communicating with each \n     other; and\n       Whereas, the costs to providers of maintaining incompatible \n     systems in the name of proprietary licensing will grow \n     exponentially with every delay in reaching a universal \n     standard of interoperability; and\n       Whereas, the benefit from health information technology is \n     only derived from the ability of systems to communicate with \n     each other on a fully compatible platform; and\n       Whereas, a national public-private partnership has recently \n     commenced with leadership from the United States department \n     of health and human services to define standards of \n     interoperability with the goal of implementing electronic \n     health records for all Americans by the year 2014;\n       Now, therefore, your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     Congress institute a date certain, no later than January 1, \n     2013, at which time all vendors, suppliers, and manufacturers \n     of health information technology must comply with a uniform \n     national standard of interoperability, such that all \n     electronic medical and health records can be readily shared \n     and accessed across all health care providers and \n     institutions while at the same time preserving the \n     proprietary nature of health information technology producers \n     that will encourage future innovation and competition: Be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the \n     United States, the Secretary of the United States Department \n     of Health and Human Services, the Governor of the State of \n     Washington, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-24.

A bill to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to \nprohibit the use of certain anti-competitive forward contracts; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ENZI. President, I rise to speak on the introduction of the \nLivestock Marketing Fairness Act. I want to also acknowledge that I am \njoined in introducing this legislation by Senators Dorgan, Grassley, \nand Johnson. The Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 was enacted at a \ntime when there was significant concentration in the livestock and \npoultry industry. That law has since provided livestock producers, the \nfamily farmers and ranchers of our country, with a remedy to protect \nthemselves against manipulative and anti-competitive practices in the \nmarketplace. However, since the early 1920s our domestic livestock \nindustry has changed significantly and so too have the ways in which \nproducers market their livestock. Gone are the days when a simple \nhandshake between buyer and seller was all you needed. Changes in \nmarketing have introduced new ways for bad actors to manipulate prices \nand this legislation is designed to strengthen the laws originally \nenacted in the Packers and Stockyards Act.\n  It is no secret that the packing industry in the U.S. has again \nbecome increasingly consolidated. In 1985, the four largest packers \naccounted for 39 percent of all cattle slaughtered in the U.S. Twenty \nyears later, the top four firms controlled over 69 percent of the \ndomestic cattle slaughter and this statistic does not even include the \nacquisitions that have taken place in the industry since 2007. Being \nbig in agriculture is not bad, but it does present opportunities for a \nselect few to manipulate the market for their own gain. The Livestock \nMarketing Fairness Act strikes at the heart of one particular anti-\ncompetitive practice. Over the years, livestock producers, feeders, and \npackers have been given a number of new marketing tools for price \ndiscovery and hedging risk. One of those tools is the forward contract \nwhere a buyer and seller agree to a transaction at a specified point of \ntime in the future. However, certain types of forward contracting \nagreements have become ripe for price manipulation. This is because a \ngrowing number of packing operations own their own livestock or control \nthem through marketing agreements. These firms then can buy from \nthemselves when prices are high and buy from others when prices are \nlow. Captive supplies are animals that packers own and control prior to \nslaughter. The Livestock Marketing Fairness Act prohibits certain \narrangements that provide packers with the opportunity use their \ncaptive supplies to manipulate local market prices. First, the \nlegislation requires that forward contracts contain a ``firm base \nprice'' which is derived from an external source. Though not outlined \nin the legislation, commonly used external sources of price include the \nlive cattle futures market or wholesale beef market. This ensures that \nboth buyers and sellers have a basis for how pricing in a contract will \nbe derived at the time\n\n[[Page S5703]]\n\nthe contract is agreed upon. Second, the bill requires that forward \ncontracts be traded in open, public markets. This guarantees that \nmultiple buyers and sellers can witness bids as well as offer their \nown. The Livestock Marketing Fairness Act also ensures that trading of \ncontracts be done in a manner that provides both small and large buyers \nand sellers access to the market. Contracts are to be traded in sizes \napproximate to the common number of cattle or pigs transported in a \ntrailer, but the law does not prohibit trading from occurring in \nmultiples of those contracts for larger livestock orders.\n  I travel to Wyoming nearly every weekend and have heard the same \nconcerns from many of our ranchers. They want to be competitive in the \nmarket and sell the best animals possible so that they can continue the \nwork that so many in their family have done for so many years. However, \nthis problem is not isolated to Wyoming. Livestock producers from coast \nto coast are finding that with consolidation there are fewer and fewer \nbuyers for their animals and their options for marketing too are being \nlost. This legislation not only increases openness in forward \ncontracting but preserves the right for ranchers to choose the best \nmethods for selling their animals without worry that their agreements \nwill be subject to manipulation. The bill does not apply to producer \ncooperatives who often own their processing facility. The legislation \nalso carefully targets the problem--large packers owning captive \nsupplies--by also exempting packers that only own one facility and \nthose that do not report for mandatory price reporting. The Livestock \nMarketing Fairness Act does not apply to agreements based on quality \ngrading nor does it affect a producer's ability to negotiate contracts \none-on-one with buyers. Therefore, sellers can still choose from a \nvariety of methods including the spot market, futures market, or other \nalternative marketing arrangements.\n  This bill is common sense and ensures that our ranchers have access \nto a competitive market in these difficult economic times. Ranchers \naren't asking for a handout. What I am asking for is a level-playing \nfield and an equal opportunity for our ranchers to succeed. I am \npleased to say that I am joined by my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle in working to address this problem. I encourage my other \ncolleagues to support the Livestock Marketing Fairness Act and to join \nme in giving ranchers an honest chance to make a living.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1086\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \ncertain tax incentives related to oil and gas; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Energy Fairness \nfor America Act which repeals tax incentives for the oil and gas \nindustry. This is the third consecutive Congress in which I have \nintroduced this legislation. Some of the provisions of prior versions \nof my legislations were enacted last year, but more can be done. At a \ntime when we are trying to incentivize clean energy, we should not \ncontinue to provide unnecessary tax incentives to the oil and gas \nindustry.\n  The Energy Fairness for America Act would repeal the section 199 \nmanufacturing deduction for income attributable to domestic production \nof oil and gas. The domestic manufacturing deduction was designed to \nreplace export-related tax benefits that were successfully challenged \nby the European Union. Producers of oil and gas did not benefit from \nthis tax break. Initial legislation proposed to address the repeal of \nthe export-related tax benefits and to replace them with a new domestic \nmanufacturing deduction. That legislation only provided the deduction \nto industries that benefited from the export-related tax benefits. \nHowever, the final product extended the deduction to include the oil \nand gas industry as well.\n  The tax code provides numerous other preferences to the oil and gas \nindustry. This legislation would repeal provisions that do not promote \nlow-carbon energy sources and further our addiction to oil. The Energy \nFairness\n\n[[Page S5704]]\n\nfor America Act would repeal the credit for the crude oil and natural \ngas produced from marginal wells, expensing of intangible drilling \ncosts and 60-month amortization and capitalized intangible drilling \ncosts, exception from the passive loss rules for working interests in \noil and gas properties, and percentage depletion for oil and gas wells. \nIn addition, it would increase the amortization period from two years \nto seven years for geological and geophysical expenditures incurred by \nindependent producers in connection with oil and gas exploration in the \nU.S.\n  This legislation will help align our tax code with our broader energy \ngoals. Our focus should be on lowering carbon emissions and encouraging \nrenewable energy sources, not rewarding the oil and gas industry. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in eliminating these unnecessary tax \nbreaks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Roberts, \n        Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Bond, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n        Wyden, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. McCaskill, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1089. A bill to facilitate the export of United States \nagricultural commodities and products to Cuba as authorized by the \nTrade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, to establish \nan agricultural export promotion program with respect to Cuba, to \nremove impediments to the export to Cuba of medical devices and \nmedicines, to allow travel to Cuba by United States citizens and legal \nresidents, to establish an agricultural export promotion program with \nrespect to Cuba, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this Nation and this body have debated \ndivisive trade issues for more than a century. In the 1820s, the \ncotton, indigo, and rice exporting southern States quarreled with \nnorthern States intent on protecting nascent manufacturing In the \n1930s, President Hoover's appeals to save American jobs brought the \nSmoot-Hawley tariff.\n  Since the Second World War, America has moved to open the world's \nmarkets and our own. We are better for it. But divisive trade debates \ndo and will continue. Few debates have been as long and contentious as \nthose regarding our economic sanctions on Cuba.\n  I am introducing legislation today to bring this divisive debate to \nan end. I do so not as an ideologue or a partisan. I am neither the \nCuban government's friend nor its staunchest enemy. I instead am a \nMontanan. Like most Montanans, I take no pleasure in disagreement. Like \nmost Montanans, I try to make a deal when I can. Like most Montanans, I \nstick to the facts.\n  Here is how I see the facts. Opening Cuba to our exports means money \nin the pockets of farmers and ranchers across America. Lifting \nfinancing and other restrictions on U.S. agriculture could increase \nU.S. beef exports from states like Montana and Colorado from $1 million \nto as much as $13 million. Lifting these restrictions could allow \nagricultural exporters in States like North Dakota and Arkansas to \nobtain nearly 70 percent of Cuba's wheat market, nearly 40 percent of \nits rice market, and more than 90 percent of its poultry market. \nLifting these restrictions could allow America's farmers and ranchers \nto export as much as $1.2 billion in total agricultural goods to Cuba.\n  The facts also show that European and other exporters already reap \nthese benefits. Europe has scrapped its Cuba sanctions. Just last week, \nEU officials were in Havana calling for full normalization of ties. \nThose officials made no secret of wanting to solidify ties with Cuba \nnow to get the jump on the U.S.\n  Those are the facts as I see them. But that is not all I see. I am \nnot blind to the Cuban people's suffering or the crimes of their \ngovernment. I am not deaf to the calls for political and religious \nfreedom just 90 miles off our shores. But I also see that increased \ntrade ties historically have led to improved political ties, whether \nbetween Argentina and Brazil in this hemisphere or between former rival \nnations in Europe.\n  Am I certain that increased trade will improve our political ties \nwith Cuba? I am not. But I am certain that we have had these sanctions \nin place for over 5 decades. I am certain that five decades of \nsanctions have made no Cuban freer, no nation more prosperous, and no \ngovernment more democratic. I am certain that one side has gotten its \nchance and its way. I am certain that the status quo must now change.\n  Here is how I propose to change our status quo with Cuba. My bill, \nwhich 15 other Democratic and Republic Senators have joined, would help \nU.S. farmers and ranchers sell their products to Cuba by facilitating \ncash payment for agricultural goods, authorizing direct transfers \nbetween U.S. and Cuban banks, and creating a U.S. agricultural export \npromotion fund. This bill also eases restrictions on exports of \nmedicines and medical devices. It allows all Americans to travel to \nCuba--not just one particular group.\n  John Stuart Mill wrote that ``Commerce first taught nations to see \nwith goodwill the wealth and prosperity of one another. Before, the \npatriot . . . wished all countries weak, poor, and ill-governed but his \nown . . .'' For too long, America has stood atop our barricade of \nsanctions and looked down upon a weak, poor, and ill-governed Cuba. Let \nus now open our commerce with Cuba. Let us wish them wealth, \nprosperity, and an abundance of all that we value and hold dear in \nAmerica.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1090. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax credit parity for electricity produced from renewable resources; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the subject of U.S. \nenergy policy and to introduce a series of bills to address this issue, \nS. 1090-S. 1098.\n  Americans consume too much oil, and they pay too high a price for it. \nNational security pays a price. The environment pays a price and the \neconomy clearly pays a price. It's clear that Americans can no longer \nafford the energy policy of the status quo.\n  Last summer, when crude oil prices approached $150 dollars a barrel, \nAmericans were sending roughly $1.7 billion dollars a day to foreign \ncountries to pay to cover their addiction to oil. That's $1.7 billion a \nday that was not invested here at home. Rather it went into the pockets \nof oil producers in foreign countries--and often to countries that \noppose America's interests and undermine American security. A third of \nthe oil Americans use comes from the OPEC oil cartel--a cartel that \nincludes governments who are either openly hostile to the United States \nor who provide a haven and support to those who are. American \ndependence on their oil is a recipe for disaster.\n  Oil prices have retreated, but America's addiction to oil has not let \nup. The Nation's transportation system is almost entirely fueled by it. \nWhen the price of oil goes up, transportation costs go up, which means \nshipping costs and the cost of everything that has to be shipped goes \nup right along with it.\n  On top of all the other faults oil brings with it, burning fossil \nfuels is bad for our health and the health of our planet. Burning \nfossil fuels produces 86 percent of the man-made greenhouse gases \nreleased into the environment every year in the U.S. Motor fuels have \nbecome cleaner over the years, but they still heat up the environment \nwith greenhouse gases, just like burning coal at electric generation \nplants. Continuing to rely on energy sources that do harm to the air, \nland and water is a failed policy and bad for America's future.\n  Spelling out the problem, however, is the easy part. There is no \nsilver bullet when it comes to remaking the way the entire nation \nconsumes energy and encouraging the development of viable alternatives. \nNo one person, organization or piece of legislation can do it alone.\n  If America is going to get on the path to real energy independence, \nAmericans not only have to build that path, every American is going to \nhave to commit to changing course in the way they use energy. While I \nbelieve that Government cannot simply legislate such transformative \nchange, it is my view that government can provide the incentives and \nframework needed to empower Americans to rise to the challenge.\n  While I cannot tell you where the next advancement in green energy \nwill\n\n[[Page S5705]]\n\ncome from, I know that given the right tools and incentives there is no \nlimit to what American ingenuity can achieve. This is why today I am \noffering a series of proposals to speed up our progress toward a \ncleaner energy future. My proposals address the spectrum of solutions \nneeded to get there. They start with harnessing the intellectual power \nof our colleges and universities to invent new energy technologies. \nThey create new incentives for businesses to turn those technologies \ninto new energy products. They give consumers incentives to buy and \ninstall those new energy technologies in their homes and businesses.\n  If America is going to cut back in its use of oil, then it needs to \ntake a hard look at the single largest user of oil, the transportation \nsector. Today, I am proposing a three-pronged program to dramatically \nreduce the amount of oil Americans use every day to get to work, do \ntheir errands, and transport American products to market.\n  First, I propose to dramatically revise the Renewable Fuel Standard \nthat now requires gasoline and diesel fuel providers to blend larger \nand larger amounts of ethanol and other biofuels into motor fuel. I \nstrongly support the continued development of biofuels, especially \nthose that do not require the use of food grains like corn and oils \nused to make them. But as we have seen in recent years, you cannot \ndivert large amounts of food grains and oils without impacting the \nsupply and price of those commodities. Last year, nearly a third of the \nU.S. corn crop was used for ethanol production, leading to more \nexpensive food for families at a time when they can least afford it. \nThat does not make sense to me.\n  The current standard also does not do enough to genuinely reduce the \namount of oil being consumed. In part this is because fuels like \nethanol simply do not contain as much energy per gallon as the gasoline \nit is intended to replace. The existing standard is aimed at replacing \nless than 15 percent of U.S. gasoline and diesel fuel with renewable \nfuels. I think we can do better, which is why my proposal aims to \nreplace a third of those fuels with new low-carbon fuels. Right now a \nthird of the United States gasoline is imported from OPEC countries. \nLet us aim to get this country off OPEC oil once and for all.\n  I want to make it clear that I am not proposing these changes because \nI am opposed to using renewable fuels. I have already introduced \nlegislation--S. 536--to allow biomass from Federal lands to be used in \nthe production of biofuels. Under the existing Renewable Fuel Standard, \nbiomass from Federal lands is prohibited from being used as a renewable \nfuel. This makes no sense from either an energy perspective or an \nenvironmental perspective. Allowing for the use of fuel derived from \nbiomass from Federal lands will reduce the threat of catastrophic wild \nfires, help make those forests healthier, and open up a variety of \neconomic opportunities for hard hit rural communities. It is also a \nstep towards a sound national energy policy.\n  However, if the U.S. is going to have a Renewable Fuel Standard for \nmotor fuels, then it really ought to be a standard open to all \nrenewable fuels, not just a chosen few. This is why my legislation \nwould allow a range of energy sources to qualify as motor ``fuels'' \nincluding electricity for plug-in cars, methane to fuel compressed \nnatural gas vehicles, and hydrogen for fuel cells. Initially, these \nlow-carbon fuels could come from conventional sources, such as \nelectricity from the electric grid, but eventually they would need to \ncome from renewable energy sources.\n  Singling out ethanol as the only additive approved for motor fuel \nonly creates a market for ethanol, which in turn discourages research \nand investment in other promising fuels. Creating a technology neutral \n``low-carbon'' standard to replace traditional fossil fuels with \nalternative lower-carbon domestic fuels opens the door for a whole host \nof advancements and innovations yet unknown.\n  In addition to supplying new, cleaner, renewable transportation \nfuels, I will also be introducing legislation to authorize the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation to designate ``Energy Smart Transportation \nCorridors'' so that these fuels will be readily available for \nconsumers. By working with trucking companies, fuel providers, and \nState and local officials, the Transportation Department would \nestablish which alternative fuels would be available and where they \ncould be purchased. They would standardize other features such as \nweight limit standards geared towards reducing fossil fuel use and the \nrelease of greenhouse gases. The corridors would also include \ndesignation of other methods of freight and passenger transportation, \nsuch as rail or mass transit--to help reduce transportation fuel use.\n  Beyond empowering Americans to make more energy efficient choices, my \nlegislation would make sure that energy efficient choices are within \nthe reach of more Americans. Because I believe that energy efficient \nvehicles should not just be a luxury item for affluent Americans, I \nwill be reintroducing legislation to provide tax credits to Americans \nwho purchase fuel efficient vehicles. Vehicles getting at least 10 \npercent more than national average fuel efficiency would get a $900 tax \ncredit. The credit would increase up to $2,500 as vehicle fuel \nefficiency increased. The bill also provides a tax credit for heavy \ntruck owners to install fuel saving equipment. And it would increase \nboth the gas guzzler tax and the civil penalty for vehicle \nmanufacturers who miss their legally-required Corporate Average Fuel \nEconomy, CAFE, requirements. The technology-neutral tax credit is \ndesigned to get more fuel-efficient vehicles on the road by making \nfuel-efficient vehicles an affordable choice for more Americans.\n  But reducing oil use by the transportation sector alone is not \nenough. Some forty percent of energy use in the U.S. is consumed in \nbuildings. So I am introducing legislation to empower American \nfamilies--as well as small and mid-sized businesses--to save energy and \ninstall clean energy equipment. The ``Re-Energize America Loan \nProgram'' will create a $10 billion revolving loan program to allow \nhome and property owners and small and mid-sized businesses, schools, \nhospitals and others to make clean energy investments. This zero-\ninterest loan program would be administered at the State level, not by \nbureaucrats in Washington, DC, so it will be tailored to regional \nneeds. It would be financed through the transfer of Federal energy \nroyalties paid on the production of coal, gas and oil, and renewable \nenergy from Federal land. It would empower Americans and businesses to \nhelp themselves and help their country start laying the groundwork for \nan entirely different energy future.\n\n  States like Oregon have enormous potential for development of \nrenewable energy--solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, wave and tidal. The \nchallenge is to find new ways to harness these energies. Renewable \nenergy is also not just about fuel that goes into cars or electricity \nfor homes or buildings. Renewable energy can also be used to heat homes \nand buildings, and power factories and businesses. So I am introducing \nlegislation to provide tax credits for the production of energy from \nrenewable sources, such as steam from geothermal wells, or biogas from \nfeedlots or dairy farms that is sold directly to commercial and \nindustrial customers. A separate credit would be available if this \nrenewable energy is used right on site to heat a building or provide \nenergy for the dairy.\n  The goal of this bill is to foster the development of new renewable \nenergy technologies while expanding the market for renewable energy \nbeyond the wind farms and electric generation plants already in place. \nThe amount of the tax credit will no longer be tied to the way energy \nis produced but rather the amount of energy produced. This will help \nnew energy technologies get in the game, and reward solutions that \ncreate the most energy. I am also introducing legislation to end the \ncurrent tax penalty on biomass, hydroelectric, wave and tidal energies \nand other forms of renewable energy that are only eligible for half of \nthe available Federal production tax credit. America needs all of these \nresources if it is going to move into a new energy future. My goal is \nto create a level playing field and give all of these technologies the \nfull tax benefit in order to stimulate investment and get more \nrenewable energy projects built.\n  One big advantage of renewable energy is that some form of it can be \nfound on every corner, and in every\n\n[[Page S5706]]\n\ncorner of the country. Whether it's a solar panel on a home or store--\nor geothermal power plant--there is renewable energy potential \nvirtually everywhere. One set of technologies that can make renewable \nenergy even more available are energy storage technologies. These are \nsolutions that can store solar energy during the day for use at night, \nor store wind energy when the wind blows, to be used when it does not.\n  Simply put, not enough attention has been paid to the use of energy \nstorage technologies, which can also address daily and seasonal peaks \nin energy demand such as all of those air conditioners that Americans \nwill soon be putting to good use during the summer's hottest days. \nFederal funding for energy storage technologies has been virtually \nnonexistent. So I am introducing legislation to create an investment \ntax credit that will help pay for the installation of energy storage \nequipment both by energy companies who connect it to the electric \ntransmission and distribution system and for on-site use in buildings, \nhomes, and factories. Any number of different types of storage \ntechnology can qualify--batteries, flywheels, pumped water storage, to \nname a few. The credit would be based on the energy stored, not on the \ntechnology used.\n  The goal throughout the bills I am introducing today is not to pick \nwinners and losers. The goal is to encourage innovation and \ninstallation.\n  Last but not least, America not only needs new solutions to our \nenergy problems. It needs a skilled workforce to make them a reality. \nSo, I am also proposing an ``Energy Grant'' Higher Education program to \nprovide $300 million a year to America's colleges and universities to \nwork on regional energy problems. This program is modeled on the highly \nsuccessful SeaGrant research and education program that has been run by \nthe U.S. Department of Commerce for more than 30 years and the SunGrant \nprogram established to research biofuels. The EnergyGrant program would \nfund groups of colleges and universities to do research and develop \neducation programs aimed at unique opportunities and challenges in each \nregion of the country. Why rely solely on the Federal Government \nresearch programs to come up with solutions for regional energy issues \nwhen labs and research departments at colleges and universities around \nthe country can contribute to the effort?\n  The Senate Energy Committee has already adopted legislation I have \nproposed to create a $100 million a year, community college-based \ntraining program for skilled technicians to build, install and maintain \nthe new American energy infrastructure of wind turbines, geothermal \nenergy plants, fuel cells, and other 21st Century technologies. Without \nthese skilled workers, this future will not happen and without \neffective training programs there won't be skilled workers to fill the \njobs. I am also introducing this proposal as a stand-alone bill to help \nensure that job training gets the attention that it needs. What good \nwill ``green jobs'' do for Americans if Americans don't have the skills \nthat these jobs will demand?\n  My goal in formulating this agenda has been to mobilize Americans and \nAmerican resources to achieve authentic energy independence and a new \nenergy future. To really accomplish this goal, I believe we must employ \nevery tool at our disposal. But in the end the success or failure of \nany effort to transform the way Americans use energy will ultimately \nrest with the American people. There is no question that this will not \nbe easy, but I have faith that the energy challenges facing the nation \ntoday are no match for the collective ingenuity, talent and energy of \nthe American people. Let us put those resources to work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1090\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide comprehensive solutions for the health \ncare system of the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the pressing issue \nof health care in America. Millions of Americans go without health \ninsurance each year. Especially during these tough economic times, many \nfamilies are looking to Washington to fix the health care crisis in \nthis country.\n  This year, Congress is poised to make significant changes to our \nhealth care system. Ultimately, the American people want solutions that \nwork. In that vein I am pleased to join today with my colleague, \nSenator Coburn, to introduce, S. 1099, the Patients' Choice Act. It \nwill start to build a health care system that is responsive to \npatients' needs and conscious of their budgets.\n  As we developed the framework of the Patients' Choice Act, we had to \nthink about what would truly transform the failing health care system \nin America right now. Typically, the problems with our health care \nsystem relate to cost, quality, and our inability to make important \nlifestyle interventions before treatable symptoms become chronic \nconditions. With that thought in mind, Senator Coburn and I set out to \nreform our health care system so it met the following requirements. We \nbelieve that any truly transformational health care plan must guarantee \nthat every American can get affordable coverage.\n  It must demand more value for our health care dollar instead of \nimposing a new tax or passing on a new obligation to future \ngenerations.\n  It must transform the health care system so that we focus on keeping \npeople healthy and well instead of only treating them when they are \nsick.\n  It must make health coverage affordable for those with pre-existing \nconditions.\n  It must end the current discrimination in the tax code that benefits \nthe wealthy and corporations but fails the poor and those who can't get \ncoverage through their employer.\n  It must ensure that health care is accessible when people want it, \nwhere people want it.\n  It must be sustainable so that it will be there for future \ngenerations.\n  We believe the Patient's Choice Act will meet all of these \nrequirements. The bill focuses on 6 key areas: preventing disease and \npromoting healthier lifestyles; creating affordable and accessible \nhealth insurance options; equalizing the tax treatment of health care; \nestablishing transparency in health care price and quality; and \nensuring compensation for injured patients.\n  S. 1099 transforms health care in America by strengthening the \nrelationship between the patient and the doctor and relying on choice \nand competition rather than rationing and restrictions. In doing so, we \ncan ensure universal, affordable health care for all Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1102. A bill to provide benefits to domestic partners of Federal \nemployees; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favour of the \nDomestic Partner Benefits and Obligations Act, which I am introducing \nwith my colleague and friend on the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, Senator Susan Collins.\n  Last year, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nheld a hearing on this legislation, but time ran out before we were \nable to move the measure to the Senate floor.\n  I also want to thank my former cosponsor, Senator Gordon Smith of \nOregon, with whom I and more than 20 other Senators introduced \nidentical legislation in the 110th Congress. We expect about 20 \ncosponsors again this year, and I want to express my appreciation to \nthem for helping us get an early enough start in the 111th Congress so \nthat we can pass the bill, hopefully, this year.\n  This legislation makes eminent sense for two reasons: It will help \nthe Federal Government attract the best and the brightest and it is the \nfair and right thing to do from a human rights perspective.\n  Let me explain. The Domestic Partners Benefits and Obligations Act \nwould provide the same employee benefit programs to same-sex domestic \npartners of Federal employees that are now provided to the opposite-sex \nspouses of Federal employees. In other words, same-sex domestic \npartners--living in a committed relationship and unrelated by blood \nwould be eligible to participate in health benefits, long-term care, \nFamily and Medical Leave, federal retirement benefits, and all other \nbenefits for which married employees and their spouses are eligible. \nFederal employees and their domestic partners would also be subject to \nthe same responsibilities that apply to married employees and their \nspouses, such as anti-nepotism rules and financial disclosure \nrequirements.\n  When the domestic partners of Federal employees are granted the same \nbenefits and obligations as the spouses of federal employees, the \nFederal Government will be able to attract from a larger pool of \napplicants the best possible employees to carry out the Government's \nresponsibilities to the American people. In the coming years, as a \nlarge percentage of federal employees become eligible for retirement, a \nnew generation of employees will be hired, and the Federal Government \nwill be competing with the private sector for the most qualified among \nthem. This legislation will help put the Federal Government on equal \nfooting to compete for those new recruits and then retain them.\n  From a human rights perspective, this legislation is one more step on \nthe long road to bring the gay and lesbian community equality under the \nlaw.\n  We are not talking about an insignificant number of people. According \nto UCLA's Williams Institute, over 30,000 federal workers live in \ncommitted relationships with same-sex partners who are not Federal \nemployees.\n  We often hear--and I have often said--that Government should be run \nmore like a business. While the purpose of Government and business are \ndifferent, I believe Government has a lot to learn from private sector \nbusiness models including in the matter before us today. The fact is \nthat a majority of U.S. corporations--including more than half of all \nFortune 500 companies--already offer benefits to domestic partners.\n  General Electric, IBM, Eastman Kodak, Dow Chemical, the Chubb \nCorporation, Lockheed Martin, and Duke Energy are among the major \nemployers that have recognized the economic reward of providing \nbenefits to domestic partners. Overall, almost 10,000 private-sector \ncompanies of all sizes provide benefits to domestic partners. The \ngovernments of 13 States, including my home State of Connecticut, about \n145 local jurisdictions across our country, and some 300 colleges and \nuniversities also provide these benefits.\n\n  Surveys show that many private sector employers offer these benefits \nbecause it is the right thing to do. You can bet each one knows that \nthe policy makes good business sense; it is good management policy, it \nis good employee policy, and it is good recruitment and retention \npolicy.\n  In fact, employers have told analysts that they extend benefits to \ndomestic partners to boost recruitment and retain quality employees--as \nwell as to be fair. If we want the Government to be able to compete for \nthe most qualified employees, we are going to have to provide the same \nbenefits that job seekers can find elsewhere.\n  The experts tell us that 19 percent of an employee's compensation \ncomes in the form of benefits, including benefits for family members. \nEmployees who do not get benefits for their families are,\n\n[[Page S5716]]\n\ntherefore, not being paid equally. Of course, the supporters of this \nlegislation understand that covering domestic partners will add some \nincrement to the total cost of providing federal employee benefits. And \nwe understand that we have to be particularly careful about government \nspending right now and perform rigorous cost benefit analyses of all, \nnot just new, federal expenditures.\n  Based on the experience of private companies and state and local \ngovernments, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \nbenefits to same-sex domestic partners of federal employees would \nincrease the cost of those programs by less than one-half of one \npercent. The Office of Personnel Management says the cost of health \nbenefits for domestic partners over 10 years would be $670 million. In \nthe name of fairness and raising the appeal of federal employment, this \nis affordable legislation.\n  Among the many stories I have heard about the impact of this \ninequality on real people, I particularly remember the words of Michael \nGuest, who was ambassador to Romania in the Bush Administration and \nDean of the Foreign Service Institute before he left public service. In \nhis resignation letter, Mr. Guest made a moving and eloquent case for \nextending benefits to same sex partners. I believe Ambassador Guest was \nthe first publicly gay man to be confirmed for an U.S. ambassadorship \nfrom the U.S. When he resigned the Foreign Service in 2007, he said, \nand I quote here from his farewell address to his colleagues ``. . . I \nhave felt compelled to choose between obligations to my partner--who is \nmy family--and service to my country. That anyone should have to make \nthat choice is a stain on the Secretary's leadership and a shame for \nthis institution and our country.''\n  Those are convincing words from a talented and loyal former public \nservant--who once described the Foreign Service as the career he was \n``born for . . . what I was always meant to do.'' It is a great loss to \nthe nation that he felt compelled to leave the Foreign Service--\nparticularly at a time when our nation so desperately needs talented \ndiplomats to help meet the challenges we face abroad. He may have left \npublic service for many reasons--but one of them should not have been \nthat his federal employee benefits did not allow him to care for the \nneeds of his family in an adequate manner.\n  The Domestic Partners Benefits and Obligations Act makes good \neconomic sense. It is sound policy. And it is the right thing to do. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na bill summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1102\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Federal employees and their domestic partners will \n     also be subject to the same employment-related obligations \n     that are imposed on married employees and their spouses.\n       In order to obtain benefits and assume obligations, an \n     employee must file an affidavit of eligibility with the \n     Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The employee must \n     certify that the employee and the employee's same-sex \n     domestic partner have a common residence, share \n     responsibility for each other's welfare and financial \n     responsibilities, are not related by blood, and are living \n     together in a committed intimate relationship. They must also \n     certify that, as each other's sole domestic partner, they \n     intend to remain so indefinitely. If a domestic partnership \n     dissolves, whether by death of the domestic partner or \n     otherwise, the employee must file a statement of dissolution \n     with OPM within 30 days.\n       Employees and their domestic partners will have the same \n     benefits as married employees and their spouses under--\n       Employee health benefits.\n       Retirement and disability plans.\n       Family, medical, and emergency leave.\n       Group life insurance.\n       Long-term care insurance.\n       Compensation for work injuries.\n       Death, disability, and similar benefits.\n       Relocation, travel, and related expenses.\n       For purposes of these benefits, any natural or adopted \n     child of the domestic partner will be treated as a stepchild \n     of the employee.\n       The employee and the employee's domestic partner will also \n     become subject to the same duties and responsibilities with \n     respect to federal employment that apply to a married \n     employee and the employee's spouse. These will include, for \n     example, anti-nepotism rules and financial disclosure \n     requirements.\n       The Act will apply with respect to those federal employees \n     who are employed on the date of enactment or who become \n     employed on or after that date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Udall, of New Mexico):\n  S. 1105. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Commissioner of Reclamation, to develop water \ninfrastructure in the Rio Grande Basin, and to approve the settlement \nof the water rights claims of the Pueblos of Nambe, Pojoaque, San \nlldefonso, and Tesuque; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today Senator Udall and I are \nintroducing a bill that will help end a contentious dispute over water \nrights claims in the Rio Pojoaque general stream adjudication in New \nMexico. This is accomplished by authorizing an Indian water rights \nsettlement of the claims being pursued by the Nambe, Pojoaque, San \nIldefonso, and Tesuque Pueblos in the Rio Pojoaque basin north of Santa \nFe.\n  This general stream adjudication is known as the Aamodt case, and I \nbelieve it is the longest active case in the Federal court system \nnationwide. The case began in 1966, and since that time has been \nactively litigated before the New Mexico District Court and the Tenth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Forty years of litigation has resolved very \nlittle in the basin. Fortunately, the parties to the case took matters \ninto their own hands. By engaging directly with each other they have \nresolved their differences, something the litigation could not \naccomplish. The Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act represents an \nagreement by the parties that will secure water to meet the present and \nfuture needs of the four Pueblos involved in the litigation; protect \nthe interests and rights of longstanding water users, including \ncentury-old irrigation practices; and ensure that water is available \nfor municipal and domestic needs for all residents in the Pojoaque \nbasin. Negotiation of this agreement was a lengthy process. In the end, \nhowever, the parties' commitment to solving water supply issues in the \nbasin prevailed.\n  Legislation to implement this settlement was introduced in the 110th \nCongress. Hearings were held in both the House and Senate and based on \nthe submitted testimony a number of changes were made to address \nconcerns with the legislation. These changes help standardize the \nPueblos' waivers of claims as part of the settlement; limit the \nsettlement's impact on the Federal budget; and allows for flexibility \nin developing the size and scope of the regional water system in \nresponse to local concerns.\n  This settlement is widely supported in the region and it is time to \nmove swiftly to enact this legislation. The State of New Mexico \ndeserves recognition for actively pursuing a settlement of this matter \nand committing significant resources so that the Federal government \ndoes not bear the entire cost of the settlement. The bill is critical \nto New Mexico's future since it provides certainty in allocating water \nin a perennially water-short area of the state. It also helps address a \nlong-neglected responsibility of the Federal Government to protect the \nrights and interests of these Pueblos. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues in the Senate as well as the House of Representatives to \nenact this legislation as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1105\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join Senator Bingaman \nin introducing a bill to complete the Aamodt water settlement in \nnorthern New Mexico. Introduction of this bill represents a major \nmilestone in the resolution of water rights claims for four tribes \nalong the Rio Grande in northern New Mexico. Decades of work and \nnegotiation have gone into the settlement, and I am pleased that the \ntribes, city, county, and community groups involved were able to come \nto an agreement that is mutually beneficial to all water users in the \nPojoaque valley.\n  The Aamodt settlement resolves the water claims of the Pueblos of \nNambe, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso, and Tesuque, and addresses the needs of \nthe surrounding communities in Santa Fe County for water and sanitation \nsystems. The settlement is a result of long negotiations between the \ncounty and pueblos, and will result in the development of a mutually \nbeneficial water infrastructure system. This system will ensure that \nthe pueblos have access to clean running water into the future, and \nwill allow the surrounding communities to work with the county and \nstate to connect in to the water system. I applaud the efforts and \nsuccess of these groups in coming to an agreement that both settles \ndisputes and benefits each community.\n  New Mexico is a State rich with tradition and culture, where water \nresources are scarce and precious. Diverse communities have depended on \nthe on ground and surface water along the Rio Grande for centuries. As \nour population grows and communities expand to welcome newcomers, the \nimpact on water resources in New Mexico is vivid. With such stress on \nthis vital but limited commodity, conflict easily develops between \ncommunities and individuals, and in a State where the history is long \nand complex, disputes over water are uniquely complicated. But, ay. \ndespite the potential for disagreement over water tenure, New Mexicans \nare united in a common respect for this resource. From the pueblos and \ntribes of New Mexico, to the historic acequias and growing communities, \nwater is fundamental to both survival and cultural traditions, and is \nrespected as such. The Aamodt settlement is an example of communities \nand tribes coming together to foster compromise rather than conflict. \nThe parties involved have worked tirelessly to ensure that everyone has \naccess to this precious and respected resource.\n  It has been said that the wars of the future will be fought over \naccess to water. In New Mexico, we are setting a different precedent--a \nprecedent of respect and compromise, one that will help us move into \nthe future with well-established partnerships and a commitment to \nconserve and manage this vital resource to the benefit of all. I am \nhonored to join Senator Bingaman today in introducing this legislation \nthat will bring the Pueblos of Nambe, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso, and \nTesuque and the surrounding communities one step closer to establishing \na secure water future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1107. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to provide for \na limited 6-month period for Federal judges to opt into the Judicial \nSurvivor' Annuities System and begin contributing toward an annuity for \ntheir spouse and dependent children upon their death, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, together \nwith my Republican colleague Senator Orrin Hatch, that will help the \nfinancial security of Federal judges and their families. It will do so \nwithout costing the Federal Government a penny.\n  Our bill, the Judicial Survivors Protection Act of 2009, will create \nan open season for active and senior federal judges to enroll in the \nJudicial Survivors' Annuities System, JSAS, if they are not currently \nenrolled. JSAS provides an annuity for the surviving spouses and \ndependent children of a deceased federal judge. Depending on the \njudge's length of service, the annuity for a surviving spouse can be as \nhigh as 50 percent of the judge's average annual salary, and the \nannuity for surviving dependent children can be as high as 20 percent.\n  In addition, our bill would provide an important health insurance \nbenefit for the surviving family members of decease Federal judges. For \na surviving spouse or dependent child to continue to receive health \ninsurance coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefit, FEHB, \nprogram after the judge's death, the judge must have been enrolled in \nJSAS. Otherwise, they can no longer participate in FEHB.\n  Federal judges have only 6 months from the date of their appointment \nto sign up for JSAS and, for a variety of reasons, many do not do so. \nFor example, many individuals take substantial pay cuts when they leave \na law firm to become a Federal judge, and they are unable to afford \nJSAS contributions, which amount to a 2.2 percent of a judge's annual \nsalary. Nearly 900 federal judges, representing about 40 percent of the \nfederal judiciary, currently do not participate in JSAS. However, if \ngiven the opportunity, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts \nestimates between 200 and 300 judges would sign up.\n  Take, for example, the case of Judge Michael Mihm, who is a federal \njudge in the Central District of Illinois, my home State. Judge Mihm \nwrote a letter and said:\n\n       In 1982, when I came on the bench, the survivor's pension \n     (JSAS) was so bad that almost no incoming judge signed up for \n     it. Plus, the percentage of salary involved was very high. So \n     I didn't sign up for it then. In the early 90s I was a member \n     of the Judicial Branch Committee, and at that time the \n     Committee and the judiciary succeeded in getting a bill \n     passed that improved the benefits (established a 25% floor) \n     and the percentage of salary paid. There was an open season. \n     That would have been the time to join. However, at that time \n     I had four children attending private universities . . . I \n     simply couldn't afford to bring home a smaller paycheck. I \n     have for some time now been very interested in `buying in' to \n     the survivor's pension, that is, pay in everything I would \n     have paid in if I had joined during the open season, plus a \n     penalty amount for waiting until now to join.\n\n  I also received a letter from U.S. District Court Judge Robert \nGettleman in the Northern District of Illinois, who said: ``Especially \ngiven the circumstances of our current economic crisis, providing for \nmy family in the event of a death is of urgent importance to me. I \nthink I speak for many of those in my circumstance that I am happy to \nmake a make-up payment and contribute a greater share of my income to \nparticipate in this program.''\n  The bill that Senator Hatch and I are introducing would allow Judge \nMihm, Judge Gettleman, and the hundreds of other nonparticipating \nfederal judges around the country to pay a penalty and buy into the \nJSAS program. Such judges would be required to pay an enhanced \ncontribution rate of 2.75 percent of their salary each year rather than \nthe 2.2 percent rate they would pay if they had enrolled within 6 \nmonths of taking office.\n  As a result, the cost of our bill would be borne by these new \nenrollees and not by the Federal Government or by previously enrolled \njudges. The Congressional Budget Office has conducted an informal \nreview of this bill and determined that the cost of this bill is \ninsignificant. Therefore, the bill would require no Federal funds and \nhave no\n\n[[Page S5724]]\n\nPAYGO implications. The higher ongoing contribution rates for new \nenrollees will offset the value of any potential future liabilities \nthat would be incurred by the JSAS fund, which currently has assets of \nover $500 million.\n  One of the highest priorities of the federal judiciary in recent \nyears has been the pursuit of a pay raise. Federal judges have not \nreceived a pay raise from Congress since 1991, other than occasional \ncost-of living adjustments, and there is a concern that some of this \nNation's best and brightest attorneys no longer seek Federal judgeships \nbecause of the financial sacrifice they and their families would have \nto make. The bill that Senator Hatch and I are introducing today would \nnot raise the judicial pay of our federal judges, but it would at least \nprovide a modest benefit that might make judicial service more tenable \nand more attractive. I hope Congress will take up and pass the Judicial \nSurvivors Protection Act of 2009 as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1107\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act, including the amendment made by section 6, shall \n     take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nIllinois and fellow Judiciary Committee member, Senator Durbin, in \nintroducing the Judicial Survivors' Protection Act of 2009. This \nlegislation will provide more Federal judges with an opportunity \nfinancially to provide for their own families after their death. Under \nthis legislation, the cost of this opportunity will be borne by the \njudges themselves, not by the taxpayers, and I hope all my colleagues \nwill support it.\n  Congress created the Judicial Survivors' Annuity System in 1956. It \nallow Federal judges to devote a portion of their salary toward an \nannuity for their spouses and dependent children upon the judges' \ndeath. Enrollment in JSAS is also necessary for a judge's family \nmembers to continue receiving health insurance coverage under the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n  The catch is that judges must enroll within 6 months of taking \njudicial office or 6 months of marriage while in office. Approximately \n40 percent of current Federal judges did not do so, some for financial \nreasons. Many judges who had been in private practice, for example, \ntook a substantial pay cut to enter public service. The enrollment \nperiod for JSAS was the very time when they and their families were \nmaking that financial adjustment, when maximizing current income was \nthe priority. This is just one of the scenarios which have led judges \nto decline enrollment in JSAS, and it will become more likely, more \npronounced, as Congress refuses to give Federal judges a much needed \npay raise.\n  Congress may authorize an open-season period for sitting judges to \nenroll but has not done so since 1992, the year after Congress last \ngave Federal judges a real salary increase. The legislation we \nintroduce today would provide for such a one-time, 6 month period for \nsitting Federal judges to enroll in JSAS. Doing so would not cost the \ntaxpayers anything because these judges would commit a higher \npercentage of their salary than those who enroll during the ordinary \nperiod.\n  Congress' refusal to provide appropriate judicial compensation limits \njudges' ability to provide for their families financial future. \nProviding this one-time opportunity for judges to enroll in JSAS, \ntherefore, is almost the least we can do. It will also allow more \njudges to ensure that their family members will continue receiving \nhealth insurance coverage. And since it will not cost the taxpayers \nanything, I think it is a win-win which I trust will receive wide \nbipartisan support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1110. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ncreate a sensible infrastructure for delivery system reform by renaming \nthe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, making the Commission an \nexecutive branch agency, and providing the Commission new resources and \nauthority to implement Medicare payment policy; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission MedPAC Reform Act, legislation to \nelevate MedPAC to an executive branch entity and give it the resources \nand authority to implement Medicare payment policies. It is a fact that \nthe quality of U.S. health care is mediocre\n\n[[Page S5725]]\n\nand its costs are unsustainable. Nonetheless, a modern health care \ndelivery system is within our reach and something that we can start to \nachieve this year. Payment reforms, particularly in Medicare, are the \ncornerstone for driving quality improvement and improving the \nefficiency of our health care system. However, Congress must adopt a \nmechanism to implement and maintain Medicare reimbursement policies \nthat are based on the best evidence and driven by the right incentives. \nThis is simply not the case today.\n  Currently, Congress has the sole authority to change the cost curve \nfor Medicare. Unfortunately, this process is riddled with political \ninfluence and is slowed by an inadequate structure to research, \nanalyze, test, and implement successful delivery system reforms. Given \nthe role of Medicare in determining market norms among all health care \npayers, both public and private, the federal government has an \nopportunity to realign our nation's health care system to drive quality \nimprovement and greater efficiency.\n  The federal government already has a well-respected, independent \nentity--the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC--that \ncurrently advises Congress on Medicare payment policies. MedPAC, \nestablished by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33), employs a \nnumber of mechanisms to inform Congress on issues affecting the \nMedicare program. Specifically, MedPAC analyzes provider reimbursement, \nbeneficiary access to care, and quality of care; delivers this \ninformation to Congress through regular reports and recommendations; \nengages in public meetings to discuss policy issues and formulate its \nrecommendations to the Congress; and seeks input on Medicare issues in \nnon-public forums through frequent meetings with a wide variety of \nparties.\n  Despite MedPAC's reputation for providing thoughtful, evidence-based \nrecommendations to improve Medicare's payment policies, MedPAC has no \npower to implement its recommendations. That power rests solely with \nCongress. Unfortunately, Members of Congress face unyielding pressure \nfrom the health care industry to pick and choose which MedPAC \nrecommendations they consider, despite the evidence. This routinely \nleads to the passage of laws that put the special interests of industry \nover the needs of patients.\n  MedPAC has proven, through its objectivity and its open and \ndeliberative process, that they have the appropriate expertise to \nchange the cost curve for Medicare and strengthen it for the future. \nThe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission Reform Act of 2009 helps to \nachieve this goal. Specifically, this legislation would restructure \nMedPAC as an independent executive branch entity, like the Federal \nReserve Board. This would provide MedPAC the appropriate authority to \nimplement its recommendations for Medicare provider reimbursement \npolicies.\n  In addition to extending the terms and requirements of the \nCommissioners to be full-time employees of the Commission, this \nlegislation also establishes three new advisory councils to assist them \nin their decision-making--a Council of Health and Economic Advisors, a \nConsumer Advisory Council, and a Federal Health Advisory Council with \nrepresentatives from the health care industry.\n  Lastly, MedPAC's authority to analyze health services research is \nalso enhanced in this legislation by providing them with additional \nresources and staff to bolster their current analytical role. Given the \nlimitations of the current Medicare demonstration process, this \nlegislation provides new authority and resources to MedPAC to design \nand evaluate new payment models through Medicare demonstrations.\n  I strongly feel that establishing MedPAC as an independent executive \nbranch agency--which can only happen through an act of Congress--is the \ntype of bold step forward that can truly transform our delivery system. \nCongress has proven itself to be inefficient and inconsistent in making \ndecisions about provider reimbursement under Medicare. If we want \nserious improvements in our health care delivery system, then Congress \nshould leave the reimbursement rules to the independent health care \nexperts. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of a policy that \ntruly improves Medicare today and in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1110\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto enter into agreements with States to resolve outstanding claims for \nreimbursement under the Medicare program relating to the Special \nDisability Workload project; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Special \nDisability Workload Liability Resolution Act, legislation that will \nresolve Medicare's longstanding liability to state Medicaid programs \nfor individuals who were covered by Medicaid when they should have been \ncovered by Medicare.\n  For the past several decades, hundreds of thousands of disabled \npeople have had their health care paid for by Medicaid; however, their \nhealth care was actually the responsibility of Medicare. Therefore, \nstates have been left financially responsible for individuals whose \ncare should have been paid for entirely by the Federal Government. Both \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, and the Social \nSecurity Administration, SSA, acknowledge Medicare's responsibility for \nthese beneficiaries. The Social Security Administration is in the \nprocess of correcting the cash insurance payments that were due to \ndisabled individuals. However, CMS has not acted to establish a means \nof satisfying Medicare's liability.\n  This is unacceptable. Nearly every state is struggling to balance its \nbudget in the midst of this terrible economic crisis, and it is \nestimated that the Medicare program owes the states an estimated $4 \nbillion. This figure continues to grow as the SSA corrects additional \ncases. When it is determined that a state owes the Federal Government \nmoney for Medicaid expenses, states have only 60 days to pay this debt. \nYet, now that the situation is reversed, the Federal Government has not \neven established a timeline with which to pay its debt to the States.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, the Special Disability \nWorkload Liability Resolution Act, would provide $4 billion in Federal \nfunding to settle this debt to the States. It requires the Social \nSecurity Administration and CMS to develop an accurate payment \nmethodology to reimburse states within 6 months of the bill's \nenactment. Resolving this Federal debt would inject critical funds into \nState and local economies and help maintain state jobs.\n  This bill is based on language successfully included in the Senate-\npassed American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, but it was dropped in \nconference. It is my hope that my colleagues will once again support \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1111\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Special Disability Workload \n     Liability Resolution Act of 2009''.\n\n[[Page S5728]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to direct the \nSecretary of Transportation to establish and maintain a national \nclearinghouse for records related to alcohol and controlled substances \ntesting of commercial motor vehicle operators, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSenators Snowe, Nelson of Nebraska, and Wicker. The legislation that we \nare introducing today is aptly named The Safe Roads Act of 2009, as it \nwill go a long way toward improving the safety of our Nation's roads by \nclosing loopholes that have allowed commercial truck and bus drivers to \nuse and abuse drugs and continue to drive without receiving required \ntreatment necessary to return to duty. The bill is designed to save \nlives by preventing unnecessary deaths on our Nation's roads.\n  Nearly every day Americans can open their newspapers to learn about a \ndeath caused by drivers under the influence of drugs and alcohol. \nSometimes, these drivers are behind the wheel of an 18-wheeler or a \ncommercial bus, which due to their size and weight bring a destructive \nforce on any road. On May 8th of this year, the Arkansas Democrat \nGazette reported about a commercial bus driver involved in an accident \non Interstate 40 near Forrest City, AR, in 2007 that resulted in four \nfatalities. The driver was reportedly under the influence of \namphetamines, one of the substances tested for under Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration, FMCSA, testing regulations. The driver \nof this commercial vehicle has been sentenced to jail and four lives \nwere lost as a result of the accident.\n  Some other similar accidents involving truck drivers that have \noccurred in recent years include: in October 2008, Kane County, IL, a \ntruck driver rear-ended a passenger vehicle killing a woman. The truck \ndriver was indicted for reckless homicide and driving under the \ninfluence of narcotics.\n  In January 2008, in Franklin County, AL, a truck driver was arrested \nfor being under the influence of drugs or alcohol after crossing the \ncenter line and killing a woman in a head-on accident.\n  In July 2007, in Little Rock, AR, a truck driver killed a family of \nfive in a crash. The driver admitted smoking crack cocaine a few hours \nbefore the crash.\n  In May 2007, Centre County, PA, a truck driver ran over a car killing \na woman. The driver faces charges including homicide by vehicle while \ndriving under the influence of suspected methamphetamines.\n  While drug abuse among the at least 3.4 million truck drivers in the \nindustry is estimated by FMCSA to only represent 2 to 5 percent of the \nentire truck driving workforce, that still represents roughly 68,000 \ntruck drivers that have a drug or alcohol abuse problem. That is a high \nand unacceptable risk that needs to be addressed in a serious fashion. \nOur goal is to prevent accidents of this nature, and I would like to \nbriefly explain how we intend to do so.\n  Our bill will establish within the FMCSA a national drug and alcohol \ndatabase and clearinghouse listing positive alcohol and drug test \nresults or test refusals by commercial truck and bus drivers. The bill \nwill expand current drug and alcohol testing regulations to require \nMedical Review Officers, MROs, and other FMCSA-approved agents \nconducting already-required testing to report positive test results and \ntest refusals to the FMCSA drug and alcohol clearinghouse. Employers \nseeking new employees would then be required to not only follow the \nlaws already in place for testing prospective employees, but they would \nalso be required to examine the prospective employees' record in the \nFMCSA clearinghouse to determine if the prospective employee has \nrecently failed or refused to take a drug and alcohol test. If the \nprospective employee has a positive test result or test refusal in the \nclearinghouse, an employer would not be allowed to hire the prospective \nemployee unless it can be proven that he or she has not violated\n\n[[Page S5729]]\n\nthe requirements of the testing program, or that he or she has fully \ncompleted a return-to-duty program as required by the testing program.\n  There are major loopholes that exist today in the current drug and \nalcohol testing regime. Drivers have a tendency to ``job-hop'' after \nfailing drug and alcohol tests, moving from one company to another \nwithout reporting past drug and alcohol test failures. Some States have \nsince closed this loophole by establishing clearinghouses similar to \nour proposal, but not all States have these laws, and they do not do \nanything to prevent drivers with past drug and alcohol test failures \nfrom moving State-to-State to seek and gain employment. Our legislation \nwould go to considerable lengths in closing both of these well-known \nand well-reported loopholes. Our bill would also provide extensive \nprivacy protection for individuals whose data is collected at the \nclearinghouse or accessed from the clearinghouse. The bill would \nprovide individuals with the means to challenge records in the \nclearinghouse and rights of actions against those who misuse \ninformation contained in the clearinghouse or accessed from the \nclearinghouse.\n  The Government Accountability Office, GAO, and the FMCSA have \nacknowledged these loopholes. Both have published reports describing a \nnational clearinghouse as a feasible, cost-effective measure to address \nthis problem and improve highway safety. In addition, a clearinghouse \nis something that Congress has examined since implementing drug and \nalcohol testing requirements in 1995. In 1999, Congress required the \nFMCSA to evaluate the viability of a national clearinghouse database \nfor positive test results and test refusals, and in 2004 the results of \ntheir study supported a need for such a system and revealed the safety \nbenefits that would come from it. As recently as last year, the GAO \nreleased a report to Congress titled `Motor Carrier Safety: \nImprovements to Drug Testing Programs Could Better Identify Illegal \nDrug Users and Keep Them off the Road' that recommended the \nestablishment of a national database and clearinghouse of drivers who \nhave tested positive or refused to test. There is a clear need to close \nthese well-known loopholes, and I believe our bill goes a long way in \nthat direction.\n  It is my hope that Congress will support this legislation and move \nforward quickly to enact this legislation. I believe it is an \nimperative step to enhance drug and alcohol testing requirements and \nimprove pre-employment background reviews to reduce the number of \naccidents and needless deaths resulting from drivers that are under the \ninfluence of these types of substances.\n  I want to thank Senators Snowe, Nelson of Nebraska, and Wicker for \ntheir hard work, leadership and support on this very important safety \nissue, and I urge the rest of my colleagues to support its swift \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Burr):\n  S. 1114. A bill to establish a demonstration project to provide for \npatient-centered medical homes to improve the effectiveness and \nefficiency in providing medical assistance under the Medicaid program \nand child health assistance under the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation with \nSenator Burr to help States improve quality and reduce the costs of \nhealth care for Medicaid and CHIP enrollees. The Medical Homes Act \nwould create a pilot project in Medicaid and the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program to encourage hospitals and health clinics to \ncreate a medical home for the low-income people they serve.\n  Those of us who have a medical home take it for granted. We see the \nsame doctor, in the same setting, for extended periods of time. Our \nmedical history is in one place, and even if we are seeing specialists \nor different doctors in the same practice, there is continuity in \ndecisions about our health care.\n  But many people do not have this luxury. Think about people who move \nfrom place to place whose home lives are less than stable, who do not \nhave health insurance, whose medical care is sporadic. For these \nmembers of our community, each visit to a clinic or an emergency room \nmeans starting over again.\n  Everyone should have access to a medical home, but it requires some \nchanges in behavior and expectations and, perhaps most importantly, it \nrequires a commitment by local providers to work together. The medical \nhome model makes sense for improving health care for everyone. And it \nis a model of care that makes sense for stretching our limited Federal \nhealth care dollars.\n  States like Illinois and North Carolina are already seeing progress \nwith implementing the medical home model. Illinois Health Connect is a \nnew program at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family \nServices that uses the medical home model to deliver primary and \npreventive care for children and adults covered through the All Kids \nprogram. This emphasis on coordinated and ongoing care is leading to \nbetter health outcomes, and it is saving money.\n  Community Care of North Carolina launched a medical home model in \n1998, through nine physician-led networks. North Carolina started by \ncreating medical homes for 250,000 Medicaid enrollees. Today, it is a \nstate-wide program that has saved the State at least $60 million in \nMedicaid costs in 2003 and $120 million in 2004.\n  Cost savings is not the only benefit. Several studies show that the \nmedical home approach improves quality of care. Early analyses are \nfinding that having regular access to a particular physician through \nthe medical home is associated with earlier and more accurate \ndiagnoses, fewer emergency room visits, fewer hospitalizations, lower \ncosts, better care, and increased patient satisfaction. Many studies \nconclude that having both health insurance and a medical home leads to \nimproved overall health for the entire population, which brings down \nthe cost of care and reduces health care disparities.\n  The bill that Senator Burr and I introduce today would make it easier \nfor other States to implement a medical home model, much like Illinois \nand North Carolina have. Congress passed a medical home demonstration \nproject for Medicare last year. The Medical Homes Act of 2009 would do \nthis for Medicaid and SCHIP beneficiaries by making Federal funding \navailable for a demonstration project in 8 States to provide care \nthrough patient-centered medical homes.\n  The approach we propose requires a per-member, per-month care \nmanagement fee to help pay for participating doctors and provides \ninitial start-up funding for participating states. The start-up funds \nare used for the purchase of health information technology, primary \ncare case managers, and other uses appropriate for the delivery of \npatient-centered care.\n  This is a critical time in our country We have a President who wants \nhealth care reform. We have a Congress ready to act. We have an \nhistoric level of cooperation among stakeholders. Unlike the last time, \nthere is substantial agreement this time among insurers, employers, \nconsumers and lawmakers on the need for change and the broad outlines \nof reform. Change will only happen if everyone--doctors, patients, \ninsurance companies, everyone--work with each other, not against each \nother. The specifics of the reform package still have to be worked \nout--and that will be difficult. But there is broad agreement that we \nmust do a better job of delivering health care, not just treatment for \nillness.\n  If patients, provider, payers, and the government continue to work \ntogether to create a system that values the patient more than payments \nand the health outcome of the patient more than the number of patients \nseen, we can really change the way primary care is provided. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Medical Homes Act of 2009 and help stabilize \nhealth care delivery for low-income Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1114\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Homes Act of 2009''.\n\n[[Page S5730]]\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Medical homes provide patient-centered care, leading to \n     better health outcomes and greater patient satisfaction. A \n     growing body of research supports the need to involve \n     patients and their families in their own health care \n     decisions, to better inform them of their treatment options, \n     and to improve their access to information.\n       (2) Medical homes help patients better manage chronic \n     diseases and maintain basic preventive care, resulting in \n     better health outcomes than those who lack medical homes. An \n     investigation of the Chronic Care Model discovered that the \n     medical home reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease in \n     diabetes patients, helped congestive heart failure patients \n     become more knowledgeable and stay on recommended therapy, \n     and increased the likelihood that asthma and diabetes \n     patients would receive appropriate therapy.\n       (3) Medical homes also reduce disparities in access to \n     care. A survey conducted by the Commonwealth Fund found that \n     74 percent of adults with a medical home have reliable access \n     to the care they need, compared with only 52 percent of \n     adults with a regular provider that is not a medical home and \n     38 percent of adults without any regular source of care or \n     provider.\n       (4) Medical homes reduce racial and ethnic differences in \n     access to medical care. Three-fourths of Caucasians, African \n     Americans, and Hispanics with medical homes report getting \n     care when they need it.\n       (5) Medical homes reduce duplicative health services and \n     inappropriate emergency room use. In 1998, North Carolina \n     launched the Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) program, \n     which employs the medical home concept. Presently, CCNC has \n     developed 14 regional networks that include all of the \n     Federally qualified health centers in the State and cover \n     740,000 recipients. An analysis conducted by Mercer Human \n     Resources Consulting Group found that CCNC resulted in \n     $244,000,000 in savings to the Medicaid program in 2004, with \n     similar results in 2005 and 2006.\n       (6) Health information technology is a crucial foundation \n     for medical homes. While many doctors' offices use electronic \n     health records for billing or other administrative functions, \n     few practices utilize health information technology \n     systematically to measure and improve the quality of care \n     they provide. For example, electronic health records can \n     generate reports to ensure that all patients with chronic \n     conditions receive recommended tests and are on target to \n     meet their treatment goals. Computerized ordering systems, \n     particularly with decision-support tools, can prevent medical \n     and medication errors, while e-mail and interactive Internet \n     websites can facilitate communication between patients and \n     providers and improve patient education.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) a lack of affordable housing and limited scale of \n     housing assistance programs are the primary causes of \n     homelessness; and\n       (2) homelessness affects all types of communities in the \n     United States, including rural, urban, and suburban areas.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this division are--\n       (1) to consolidate the separate homeless assistance \n     programs carried out under title IV of the McKinney-Vento \n     Homeless Assistance Act (consisting of the supportive housing \n     program and related innovative programs, the safe havens \n     program, the section 8 assistance program for single-room \n     occupancy dwellings, and the shelter plus care program) into \n     a single program with specific eligible activities;\n       (2) to codify in Federal law the continuum of care planning \n     process as a required and integral local function necessary \n     to generate the local strategies for ending homelessness; and\n       (3) to establish a Federal goal of ensuring that \n     individuals and families who become homeless return to \n     permanent housing within 30 days.\n\n     SEC. 1003.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Women Airforce Service Pilots of WWII, known as the \n     ``WASP'', were the first women in history to fly American \n     military aircraft;\n       (2) more than 60 years ago, they flew fighter, bomber, \n     transport, and training aircraft in defense of America's \n     freedom;\n       (3) they faced overwhelming cultural and gender bias \n     against women in nontraditional roles and overcame multiple \n     injustices and inequities in order to serve their country;\n       (4) through their actions, the WASP eventually were the \n     catalyst for revolutionary reform in the integration of women \n     pilots into the Armed Services;\n       (5) during the early months of World War II, there was a \n     severe shortage of combat pilots;\n       (6) Jacqueline Cochran, America's leading woman pilot of \n     the time, convinced General Hap Arnold, Chief of the Army Air \n     Forces, that women, if given the same training as men, would \n     be equally capable of flying military aircraft and could then \n     take over some of the stateside military flying jobs, thereby \n     releasing hundreds of male pilots for combat duty;\n       (7) the severe loss of male combat pilots made the \n     necessity of utilizing women pilots to help in the war effort \n     clear to General Arnold, and a women's pilot training program \n     was soon approved;\n       (8) it was not until August 1943, that the women aviators \n     would receive their official name;\n       (9) General Arnold ordered that all women pilots flying \n     military aircraft, including 28 civilian women ferry pilots, \n     would be named ``WASP'', Women Airforce Service Pilots;\n       (10) more than 25,000 American women applied for training, \n     but only 1,830 were accepted and took the oath;\n       (11) exactly 1,074 of those trainees successfully completed \n     the 21 to 27 weeks of Army Air Forces flight training, \n     graduated, and received their Army Air Forces orders to \n     report to their assigned air base;\n       (12) on November 16, 1942, the first class of 29 women \n     pilots reported to the Houston, Texas Municipal Airport and \n     began the same military flight training as the male Army Air \n     Forces cadets were taking;\n       (13) due to a lack of adequate facilities at the airport, 3 \n     months later the training program was moved to Avenger Field \n     in Sweetwater, Texas;\n       (14) WASP were eventually stationed at 120 Army air bases \n     all across America;\n       (15) they flew more than 60,000,000 miles for their country \n     in every type of aircraft and on every type of assignment \n     flown by the male Army Air Forces pilots, except combat;\n       (16) WASP assignments included test piloting, instructor \n     piloting, towing targets for air-to-air gunnery practice, \n     ground-to-air anti-aircraft practice, ferrying, transporting \n     personnel and cargo (including parts for the atomic bomb), \n     simulated strafing, smoke laying, night tracking, and flying \n     drones;\n       (17) in October 1943, male pilots were refusing to fly the \n     B-26 Martin Marauder (known as the ``Widowmaker'') because of \n     its fatality records, and General Arnold ordered WASP \n     Director, Jacqueline Cochran, to select 25 WASP to be trained \n     to fly the B-26 to prove to the male pilots that it was safe \n     to fly;\n       (18) during the existence of the WASP--\n       (A) 38 women lost their lives while serving their country;\n       (B) their bodies were sent home in poorly crafted pine \n     boxes;\n       (C) their burial was at the expense of their families or \n     classmates;\n       (D) there were no gold stars allowed in their parents' \n     windows; and\n       (E) because they were not considered military, no American \n     flags were allowed on their coffins;\n       (19) in 1944, General Arnold made a personal request to \n     Congress to militarize the WASP, and it was denied;\n       (20) on December 7, 1944, in a speech to the last \n     graduating class of WASP, General Arnold said, ``You and more \n     than 900 of your sisters have shown you can fly wingtip to \n     wingtip with your brothers. I salute you . . . We of the Army \n     Air Force are proud of you. We will never forget our debt to \n     you.'';\n       (21) with victory in WWII almost certain, on December 20, \n     1944, the WASP were quietly and unceremoniously disbanded;\n       (22) there were no honors, no benefits, and very few \n     ``thank you's'';\n       (23) just as they had paid their own way to enter training, \n     they had to pay their own way back home after their honorable \n     service to the military;\n       (24) the WASP military records were immediately sealed, \n     stamped ``classified'' or ``secret'', and filed away in \n     Government archives, unavailable to the historians who wrote \n     the history of WWII or the scholars who compiled the history \n     text books used today, with many of the records not \n     declassified until the 1980s;\n       (25) consequently, the WASP story is a missing chapter in \n     the history of the Air Force, the history of aviation, and \n     the history of the United States of America;\n       (26) in 1977, 33 years after the WASP were disbanded, the \n     Congress finally voted to give the WASP the veteran status \n     they had earned, but these heroic pilots were not invited to \n     the signing ceremony at the White House, and it was not until \n     7 years later that their medals were delivered in the mail in \n     plain brown envelopes;\n       (27) in the late 1970s, more than 30 years after the WASP \n     flew in World War II, women were finally permitted to attend \n     military pilot training in the United States Armed Forces;\n       (28) thousands of women aviators flying support aircraft \n     have benefitted from the service of the WASP and followed in \n     their footsteps;\n       (29) in 1993, the WASP were once again referenced during \n     congressional hearings regarding the contributions that women \n     could make to the military, which eventually led to women \n     being able to fly military fighter, bomber, and attack \n     aircraft in combat;\n       (30) hundreds of United States servicewomen combat pilots \n     have seized the opportunity to fly fighter aircraft in recent \n     conflicts, all thanks to the pioneering steps taken by the \n     WASP;\n       (31) the WASP have maintained a tight-knit community, \n     forged by the common experiences of serving their country \n     during war;\n       (32) as part of their desire to educate America on the WASP \n     history, WASP have assisted ``Wings Across America'', an \n     organization dedicated to educating the American public, with \n     much effort aimed at children, about the remarkable \n     accomplishments of these WWII veterans; and\n       (33) the WASP have been honored with exhibits at numerous \n     museums, to include--\n       (A) the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC;\n       (B) the Women in Military Service to America Memorial at \n     Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia;\n       (C) the National Museum of the United States Air Force, \n     Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio;\n       (D) the National WASP WWII Museum, Sweetwater, Texas;\n       (E) the 8th Air Force Museum, Savannah, Georgia;\n\n[[Page S5766]]\n\n       (F) the Lone Star Flight Museum, Galveston, Texas;\n       (G) the American Airpower Museum, Farmingdale, New York;\n       (H) the Pima Air Museum, Tucson, Arizona;\n       (I) the Seattle Museum of Flight, Seattle, Washington;\n       (J) the March Air Museum, March Reserve Air Base, \n     California; and\n       (K) the Texas State History Museum, Austin, Texas.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Award Authorized.--The President pro tempore of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall \n     make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf of the \n     Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design in \n     honor of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) \n     collectively, in recognition of their pioneering military \n     service and exemplary record, which forged revolutionary \n     reform in the Armed Forces of the United States of America.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, \n     and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n       (c) Smithsonian Institution.--\n       (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in \n     honor of the Women Airforce Service Pilots, the gold medal \n     shall be given to the Smithsonian Institution, where it will \n     be displayed as appropriate and made available for research.\n       (2) Sense of the congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Smithsonian Institution shall make the gold medal \n     received under this Act available for display elsewhere, \n     particularly at other locations associated with the WASP.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the \n     Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the \n     gold medal struck under this Act, at a price sufficient to \n     cover the costs of the medals, including labor, materials, \n     dyes, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.\n\n     SEC. 4. NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\n       Medals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals for \n     purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5.
