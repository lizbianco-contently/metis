Mr. President, I ask that the time be divided as follows: \nI ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed for 10 minutes \nand then reserve the remainder of our time; the Senator from Idaho will \ncontrol the time of the Republicans. They will proceed to use up all \nbut 10 minutes of their time. I will come back and respond, at which \npoint they would have 10 minutes held at the back end.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. RISCH. That is agreeable, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me begin very quickly. First of all, I \nwish to thank the Senator from Idaho for his amendment. I appreciate \nthe thought he has put into the consideration of this treaty and his \nrole on the Foreign Relations Committee and the work he has done over \nthe 4 days, and now the fifth day of consideration of this treaty on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  The amendment the Senator proposes to put into the treaty is an \namendment to the preamble. So we have the same problem we had \nyesterday. I would just say that up front. But that said, we have great \nagreement with the substance of what he is trying to put forward in \nterms of the need to deal with tactical nuclear weapons. We will say \nmore about that afterwards.\n  If the Senator would be willing, I think we can find a way to \nincorporate into the resolution of ratification a genuine, meaningful, \nadequate statement with respect to this linkage between tactical \nnuclear weapons and overall strategic understanding. I would like to do \nthat, but I know the Senator wants to proceed with this amendment \nfirst. I just want him to have that understanding, that we are prepared \nto say something important, and I think substantive, about tactical \nnuclear weapons.\n  I wish to use a couple of minutes, if I may, to respond to a couple \nof comments made this morning by the minority leader on one of the \nmorning television shows.\n  First of all, obviously, I regret he will not support the treaty \nitself. We had an understanding that was probably going to be the case. \nIt is not a surprise. But I find it disappointing, given the entire \nRepublican foreign policy, national security, experienced statesmen \ngroup who are sort of emeritus for our Nation today--including former \nSecretary of State Larry Eagleburger, former Secretary of State Colin \nPowell, and former Secretary of State Jim Baker, as well as the list of \nall of the former Secretaries of State from the Republican side, \nincluding former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice--all support this \ntreaty.\n\n  The military supports this treaty. The leader of the Strategic \nCommand, current, and the past former seven, support this treaty. The \nnational intelligence community supports this treaty.\n  So I hope that in these waning days of this session, as we approach \nthis holiday season which is so focused on the concept of renewal and \nhope and peace, that we could find the ability in the Senate to embrace \nin a bipartisan way the security interests of our country.\n  Particularly with regard to the notion about more time on this \ntreaty, we are now on the fifth day of debate on this treaty. Let's \ndebate today. Even if we had the cloture filing tonight or something, \nwe would still have 2 days more of debate before that ripens and a vote \non it, after which we then have 30 hours of debate providing it will \npass.\n  So we are looking at the prospect of having more days of debate on \nthis treaty, a simple building block on top of the START I treaty. We \nare looking at having more days of debate on this treaty than the START \nI, START II, and Moscow Treaty all put together.\n  So I think the Senate, which is appropriate, has time to focus on \nthis treaty. I thought we had a good debate yesterday. The President \nsaid:\n\n       Regardless of Russia's actions, as long as I am President \n     and as long as the Congress provides the necessary funding, \n     the United States will continue to develop and deploy \n     effective missile defenses to protect the United States.\n\n  So I hope our colleagues will give credence to the Secretary of \nDefense, the Secretary of State, the military, the President of the \nUnited States, and to the budget. The chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee informed me yesterday they have fully funded the\n\n[[Page S10707]]\n\nmodernization, once again, in the CR, just as we did in the previous \nCR--a sign of good faith of the direction in which we are going.\n  So all I can say is we have bent over backwards to meet the concerns \nof our colleagues in a completely nonpolitical, apolitical, totally \nbipartisan, substantive way that meets the security concerns of the \ncountry. I hope we can find reciprocity with respect to that kind of \naction in the Senate.\n  So I reserve the remainder of my time. We will respond appropriately \non the substance of this amendment at the appropriate time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank the chairman \nof the committee and the ranking member of the committee for the \ncooperation we have had throughout this matter. As I said when I \nstarted my debate on this amendment, I believe everyone is working in \ngood faith, in the best interests of the United States, to attempt to \ndevelop and ratify a treaty that will be in the best interests of the \nUnited States.\n  I was particularly encouraged this morning to hear the chairman of \nthe committee indicate he believes the substance of what we are talking \nabout is an important issue, and I know he believes that. I know the \nintelligence community believes it. I know a lot of other parties that \nare involved believe this is a very important issue. We are going to \ntalk about why this is an important issue as we go forward. After all, \nwhen we are dealing with a subject such as this, we are talking about \nthe security of the people of the United States of America. It is not a \npartisan issue. It is not a win or a loss for anyone. It is developing \nthe best we can possibly do to protect the American people.\n  I am nonetheless disappointed by yesterday's vote regarding missile \ndefense. I am going to talk about that a little bit when I get into the \nsubstance of tactical weapons, but the issue of missile defense, just \nlike the issue of strategic versus tactical weapons, is one that has \nbeen around for a long time.\n  It is not new. It is one of a couple of issues that were around 40 \nyears ago when the people who originally brought us to the table with \nthe Russians to do the work that they did. As I said before, those \npeople were real heroes. They were patriots and did a great job of \ngetting us to the table with the Russians, at a time when nuclear \nweapons was probably the most important issue facing the world.\n  A lot of us grew up in an era when we remember having air raid \ndrills. I remember going to friends' houses who actually had shelters \nin their homes, so if indeed there was a nuclear war, they could take \nshelter. It is hard to believe that was the situation 40 years ago, but \nit was. Most people today don't have a recollection of what a serious \nissue that was. Those people who brought us to the table were real \npatriots. That was 40 years ago.\n  As I said before, the world has changed greatly in 40 years. \nUnfortunately, the dialog regarding strategic missiles has not \ndramatically changed in the last 40 years. We have been focused almost \nexclusively on numbers and to the great credit of those originally \ninvolved and to the credit of the ranking member, Senator Lugar, who is \nhere with me today, those numbers have been dramatically reduced. We \nstarted out with each side having over 6,000 weapons that could be \nlaunched on the other side. We have continuously ratchetted that back \nunder this treaty to 1,550. I don't want to, in any way, denigrate the \nfact that we have greatly reduced the number of those strategic weapons \non each side.\n  Having said that, one has to wonder what is the difference between \n6,000 and 1,550? If either party pushes the button at 6,000 or at \n1,550, the world is over as we know it. So although it is important to \ntalk about numbers, I think that in today's world, because of changing \nconditions, we should be as much focused on a couple of other--well, at \nleast two other issues, one being the missile defense issue, which we \ntalked about at great length yesterday, and the other is the \nrelationship between strategic and tactical weapons.\n  Frankly, we have been pacifying the Russians regarding missile \ndefense and regarding strategic versus tactical weapons in order to get \nthese treaties. I understand that when you are doing treaty work, when \nyou are negotiating, it has to be a give-and-take proposition. Having \nsaid that, these two issues have moved to the forefront and have moved \nto importance, compared to simply the bare number of weapons and the \nverification process. Again, I don't want to denigrate the verification \nprocess itself; that is important.\n  Today, Russia is not the threat to us when it comes to nuclear \nissues, as it was 40 years ago. Indeed, there was no truly great threat \nto us other than Russia 40 years ago. However, today, most everybody \nagrees the likelihood of Russia pushing the button or us pushing the \nbutton and destroying each other is very unlikely. We have a 40-year \nhistory, where we have been through good times and bad times. Neither \nparty--with the exception of the Cuban missile crisis--has come close \nto or remotely close to or even threatened to push the button and start \na nuclear war.\n  In my judgment, and I think in the judgment of people who deal with \nthis regularly, Russia is not the nuclear threat it was 40 years ago. \nBut there are threats out there that indeed are as bad and worse than \nwhat the Russian threat was 40 years ago. How many people believe the \nrogue countries, North Korea and Iran, would not threaten us--at the \nvery least threaten us--to push the button if they indeed had the \nability to immediately do so. We all know it has been reported in the \npress that both those countries are working feverishly to get \nthemselves in the position where they can have a nuclear weapon \nmounted, poised, and ready to go, so that when they sit down at the \ntable with us, they can look us in the eye and say: Look, we will push \nthe button if you don't--fill in the blank.\n  Our media today mocks and jokes about Ahmadinejad and Kim Jong Il as \nbeing dysfunctional people--I think that is the kindest way of putting \nit. But they will not be joking about it if they get themselves in the \nposition where they are able to legitimately threaten us with pushing \nthe button or pulling the trigger on us with a nuclear attack.\n  We need to be focusing on the other aspects, starting with missile \ndefense, because if we sit across the table from Kim Jong Il or his \nrepresentatives or Ahmadinejad and the best we have to offer is a \nretaliatory strike, that isn't nearly as effective as having an \numbrella over the top of us that can knock an errant missile out of the \nsky. We need a robust missile defense system.\n  I believe, as we said earlier, that this treaty chills that, because \nno matter what you say, if you read the unilateral statements made by \nthe parties, the Russians have said that if we go forward with \nimproving, either quantitatively or qualitatively, our missile defense \nsystem, this is grounds for withdrawing from this treaty. I don't think \nwe should have a treaty in place that in any way chills the thinking \nabout what we do to protect the American people with a robust missile \ndefense system that could knock out of the sky an attack by either \nNorth Korea or Iran or even an accidental launch by the Russians, \nwhich, although remote, is a possibility.\n  Well, today, let's talk about something we can agree on; that is, the \nimportance of tactical weapons in this discussion. As the distinguished \nchairman mentioned in his opening statement, the importance of the \ntactical weapons issue is a matter we should be concerned about and we \nshould talk about. I am delighted to hear his offer that, assuming this \ngoes by the bye, we can talk about getting something into the \nresolution of ratification as opposed to into the treaty.\n  First, for those who aren't daily speaking on this issue, the \ndifference between strategic and tactical weapons is important. The \ndifference is distance. A strategic weapon can reach your enemy on the \nother side of the ocean. A tactical weapon is a theater or short-range \nweapon that can be used on the battlefield. That is the difference \nbetween the two. It is a huge difference in a lot of different ways.\n  Although we all agree it is an important issue, and we all talk about \nit, nothing is done about it. Indeed, according to the statements that \nhave\n\n[[Page S10708]]\n\nbeen made, before we ever sat down at the table with the Russians on \nthis issue, it was agreed we would do nothing about this issue. I hope \nand I urge that the President, the State Department, and all the others \ninvolved will pursue this issue aggressively and quickly once we have \nthis treaty behind us, one way or the other.\n  What I want to do is to amend the preamble to the treaty, once and \nfor all, that lays this issue on the table and tells the Russians this \nis an important issue and that we are no longer going to look the other \nway and ignore this issue. They have an advantage on us on this issue. \nEveryone agrees with that. But this is what I want to put into the \npreamble, and it is not extensive. I have heard the chairman say over \nand over again that the preamble doesn't mean anything or very little. \nWith all due respect, I disagree with that. I compare it to the \npreamble of the Constitution of the United States, which means a lot \nand is frequently quoted in court cases on constitutional issues.\n  This is what I want to put in:\n\n       Acknowledging there is an interrelationship between \n     nonstrategic and strategic offensive arms, that as the number \n     of strategic offensive arms is reduced [as this treaty does] \n     this relationship becomes more pronounced and requires an \n     even greater need for transparency and accountability, and \n     the disparity between the parties' arsenals could undermine \n     predictability and stability.\n\n  That is a factual statement that, on our side, virtually everybody \nagrees to. Obviously, the Russians, I suspect, probably agree to that \nbut don't want to talk about it.\n  Well, the problem, in its simplest terms, is that we are greatly \noutgunned by the Russians at this time on the tactical front. Right \nnow, on the strategic front, according to media sources we have \napproximately 2,100 strategic weapons. The Russians have approximately \n1,100 strategic weapons. From an intelligence standpoint, I am not \nconfirming those numbers, but that is what is reported in the press--\nassuming those numbers are accurate or modestly accurate. We, \nobviously, are not in parity. We are in a little better shape than the \nRussians from a strategic standpoint.\n  When you consider that neither of us believe we will reach for use of \nour strategic weapons, it doesn't make a lot of difference that we have \n1,000 more than they do and probably not that much of a difference if \neither one pulls the trigger. On the tactical side, however, that is a \nvery different ball game. As we all know, we have defense treaties. The \nbiggest one is NATO, but we have defense partnerships with many \ncountries around the world. Under our nuclear defense umbrella, many \ncountries take refuge. It is here that the tactical weapons become \nimportant.\n  On these tactical weapons, as I said, the Russians have a 10-to-1 \nadvantage over us. Just as important, without getting into intelligence \ndetails, they have a vast array of weapons, not only a delivery system \nbut the weapons themselves, which again outgun us and is a serious \nproblem.\n  Thirdly, just as important, they continue cranking out every day new \ndesigns, new technology, new development, and new production of these \ntactical weapons--continuing to add to the disparity between us and the \nRussians.\n  Well, this disparity in our nuclear posture is very well demonstrated \nby the report Congress commissioned, entitled ``America's Strategic \nPosture.'' It is published in a book and known as the Perry-Schlesinger \nCommission. I am going to refer to that briefly because I think \nprobably this, as much as anything, is what people use as a guide to \ndescribe where we are as far as our posture on nuclear weapons and \nespecially on tactical weapons, which is what I am focusing on with \nthis particular amendment.\n  First, let me say the Russians are relying on more tactical nuclear \nweapons. The Commission report, at page 12, explained that:\n\n       As part of its effort to compensate for weaknesses in its \n     conventional forces, Russia's military leaders are putting \n     more emphasis on nonstrategic nuclear forces [what they call \n     NSNF] particularly weapons intended for tactical use on the \n     battlefield. Russia no longer sees itself as capable of \n     defending its vast territory and its nearby interests with \n     conventional forces.\n\n  So in very short order, they have explained why the Russians are \ndoing this, why they have us 10-to-1 on this part of the issue, and why \nthey continue to develop it. Well, they do not have the money or the \nresources or the ability, because of the large territory they have, to \ndefend with conventional forces, and so they reach for these tactical \nweapons that are smaller and more easily deployed.\n  There is a description of the tactical nuclear threat in this \ndocument at page 13, which, again, I want to quote because I think it \nsays it as concisely as it can be said:\n\n       As the Cold War ended, and as noted above, these NSNF--\n\n  That is, nonstrategic nuclear forces, short-range weapons--\n\n     were reduced under the auspices of the PNIs--\n\n  That is, Presidential Nuclear Initiatives--\n\n     and also the Treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces of \n     1987. Nonetheless, Russia reportedly retains a very large \n     number of such weapons. Senior Russian experts have reported \n     that Russia has 3,800 operational tactical nuclear warheads \n     with a large additional number in reserve. Some Russian \n     military experts have written about use of very low-yield \n     nuclear ``scalpels'' to defeat NATO forces. The combination \n     of new warhead designs, the estimated production capacity for \n     new nuclear warheads, and precision delivery systems, such as \n     the Iskander short-range tactical ballistic missile (known as \n     the SS-26 in the West), open up new possibilities for Russian \n     efforts to threaten to use nuclear weapons to influence \n     regional conflicts.\n\n  That is at page 13.\n  There is a lack of Russian transparency on this particular issue. One \nof the things this treaty does that we are talking about today--and I \nthink everyone concedes that this is one of the important aspects of \nthis treaty--is it gives us transparency with the Russians, at least to \nsome degree. One could argue the degree, but at least there is some \ntransparency. Not so with tactical weapons.\n  This is what the Commission said:\n\n       Like China, Russia has not shown the transparency that its \n     neighbors and the United States desire on such matters. It \n     has repeatedly rebuffed U.S. proposals for nonstrategic \n     nuclear forces transparency measures and NATO's request for \n     information. And it is no longer in compliance with its PNI \n     commitments.\n\n  So that describes the transparency problem, page 13 of this \nparticular report.\n  There is a need to have effective deterrence against Russian tactical \nweapons, and again the report points this out.\n\n       Even as it works to engage Russia and assure Russia that it \n     need not fear encirclement and containment, the United States \n     needs to assure that deterrence will be effective whenever it \n     is needed. It must also continue to concern itself with \n     stability in its strategic military relationship with Russia. \n     It must continue to safeguard the interest of its allies as \n     it does so. Their assurance that extended deterrence remains \n     credible and effective may require that the United States \n     retain numbers of types of nuclear capabilities that it might \n     not deem necessary if it were concerned only with its own \n     defense.\n\n  Again, this provides a description of the serious issue tactical \nweapons puts on the table.\n  Well, there is a very substantial concern about the imbalance between \nstrategic and tactical weapons. As I said, on tactical weapons we are \nnot only balanced, but we probably have an advantage of 1,000, but who \ncares if neither party really believes it is going to be used. So then \nyou turn to the tactical weapons, which are obviously very different.\n  This is what the Commission says:\n\n       But that balance does not exist in nonstrategic nuclear \n     forces, where Russia enjoys a sizable numerical advantage. As \n     noted above, it stores thousands of these weapons in apparent \n     support of possible military operations west of the Urals. \n     The United States deploys a small fraction of that number in \n     support of nuclear sharing agreements in NATO.\n\n  Let me say that again: The United States deploys a small fraction of \nthat number in support of nuclear sharing agreements in NATO.\n\n       Precise numbers for the U.S. deployments are classified, \n     but their total is only about 5 percent of the total at the \n     height of the Cold War. Strict U.S.-Russian equivalents in \n     NSNF numbers is unnecessary, but the current imbalance is \n     stark and worrisome to some U.S. allies in Central Europe.\n\n  And to this Senator personally.\n\n       If and as reductions continue in the number of \n     operationally deployed strategic nuclear weapons, this \n     imbalance will become more apparent and allies less assured.\n\n\n[[Page S10709]]\n\n\n  Further in this report, they say:\n\n       The imbalance favoring Russia is worrisome, including for \n     allies, and it will become more worrisome as the number of \n     strategic weapons is decreased.\n\n  Which, of course, is what we are trying to do with this treaty.\n\n       Dealing with this imbalance is urgent and, indeed, some \n     commissioners would give priority to this over taking further \n     steps to reduce the number of operationally deployed \n     strategic nuclear weapons.\n\n  Obviously for the reasons I said because nobody believes we will ever \nreach to the strategic nuclear weapons to use them.\n  U.S. policy should seek reductions in Russian tactical weapons. I \nthink everyone agrees on that, and that is precisely what I am \nattempting to do with this amendment to the preamble.\n  The Strategic Posture Commission says:\n\n       U.S. policy should be guided by two principles. First, the \n     United States should seek substantial reductions in the large \n     force of Russian nonstrategic nuclear forces (Non-Strategic \n     Nuclear Forces). Second, no changes to the U.S. force posture \n     should be made without comprehensive consultation with all \n     its U.S. allies (and within NATO as such). All allies \n     depending on the U.S. nuclear umbrella should be assured that \n     any changes in its forces do not imply a weakening of the \n     U.S. extended nuclear deterrence guarantees. They could \n     perceive a weakening if the United States (and NATO) does not \n     maintain other features of the current extended nuclear \n     deterrence arrangements than the day-to-day presence of U.S. \n     nuclear bombs. Some allies have made it clear to the \n     commission that such consultations would play a positive role \n     in renewing confidence in U.S. security assurances.\n\n  Finally, the Perry-Schlesinger Commission endorsed tactical weapons \nreductions talks.\n  The Commission said:\n\n       The commission is prepared strongly to endorse negotiations \n     with Russia in order to proceed jointly to further reductions \n     in our nuclear forces as part of a cooperative effort to \n     stabilize relations, stop proliferation, and promote \n     predictability and transparency. The large Russian arsenal of \n     tactical nuclear weapons must be considered in this regard.\n\n  Well, obviously everyone is concerned. I am not the only one \nconcerned. Obviously, the Commission isn't the only one concerned about \nthis. Members of this body are and have been for a long time concerned \nabout this.\n  My distinguished colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, wrote to the \nSecretary of State on December 3, 2010, and she stated:\n\n       The characteristics of tactical nuclear weapons, \n     particularly their vulnerability for theft and misuse for \n     nuclear terrorism, make reducing their numbers important now.\n\n  Senator Collins focused on another aspect of this that we haven't \nreally talked about that much, but certainly strategic weapons have \nvery little opportunity--in fact, in the United States, no \nopportunity--for access by terrorists. Not so much on the other side. \nBut clearly there is a great difference between tactical and strategic \nweapons, primarily because of the way they are deployed.\n  Senator Collins also said:\n\n       President Obama's 2010 Nuclear Posture Review echoes the \n     concern of nuclear terrorism. ``The threat of nuclear war has \n     become remote, but risk of nuclear attack has increased. \n     Today's most immediate and extreme danger is nuclear \n     terrorism. Al-Qaida and their extremist allies are seeking \n     nuclear weapons.''\n\n  That probably summarizes as clearly as anything the discussion I had \nat the outset about the difference of 40 years ago versus today and \nunderscores what, in my judgment, is so important about moving this \ndialog forward instead of staying in the rut of where we were 40 years \nago and focusing just on numbers.\n  Again, it is not just the Republican side of the aisle. Almost a \ndecade ago, the SORT treaty, or Moscow treaty--another nuclear arms \nreduction treaty--was discussed here on the floor of the Senate, and a \nnumber of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle raised this \nexact question regarding tactical weapons and also underscored how \nimportant it was to take on this issue. Again, even though we have \nadvanced 40 years, nothing has happened, and nothing has happened in \nthe last decade. About 10 years ago, the distinguished Members of this \nbody underscored how important it was to take this issue on, and \nnothing has happened.\n  Then-Senator Biden said on July 9, 2002, in this Chamber:\n\n       My question is, if the impetus for this treaty was going \n     down to 1,700 to 2,200, related to the bottom line of what \n     our consensus in our government said we are going to need for \n     our security, and the rationale for the treaty was in part to \n     avoid this kind of debate that took place over tactical \n     nuclear weapons, then it sort of reflects that this is what \n     the President thinks are the most important things to proceed \n     on relative to nuclear weapons. Does he think that dealing \n     with the tactical nuclear weapons are not that relevant or \n     that important now, or that things as they are relative to \n     tactical nuclear stockpiles are OK? Talk to me about that? \n     You understand where I am going?\n\n  Well, I do, Mr. Vice President, because that is where I am going \ntoday, but nothing has happened over the last decade.\n  My distinguished colleague, Senator Dorgan, said in this Chamber, \nwhen we were talking about that treaty:\n\n       And this treaty deals with only strategic nuclear weapons, \n     not theater nuclear weapons. There are thousands and \n     thousands of theater nuclear weapons, such as the nuclear \n     weapons that go on the tips of artillery shells. That is not \n     part of the agreement. It has nothing to do with this \n     agreement.\n\n  He was right then, and he is right now as to this agreement.\n  Senator Reed, the Senator from Rhode Island, stated:\n\n       The treaty does not specifically address the problem of \n     tactical weapons or MIRV'd ICBMs. The number of Russian \n     tactical nuclear weapons is believed to be between 8,000 and \n     15,000, while the United States has approximately 2,000. \n     Russian tactical nuclear weapons are subject to fewer \n     safeguards and more prone to theft and proliferation. These \n     are the proverbial suitcase weapons, often discussed in the \n     press, which are the ones that are most mobile, most \n     difficult to trace and detect. And the treaty does not deal \n     with these weapons at all.\n\n  Senator Reed was right then on that treaty, and he is right on this \ntreaty.\n  Regarding that treaty, Senator Conrad stated:\n\n       I was therefore disappointed that a requirement for Russian \n     tactical warhead dismantlement and United States inspection \n     rights were not part of the treaty of Moscow.\n\n  Well, he was right, and I share his disappointment today on this, and \nI think everyone shares that disappointment. That is what I am trying \nto move forward with this particular amendment.\n  Senator Conrad went on to say:\n\n       The disconnect between the ability of the United States to \n     maintain current strategic force levels almost indefinitely, \n     and Russia's inevitable strategic nuclear decline due do \n     economic realities, gave our side enormous leverage that I \n     believe we should have used to win Russian concessions on \n     tactical nuclear arms. While I am encouraged that the \n     resolution of ratification before us includes a declaration \n     on accurate accounting and security, it does not mention \n     Russian tactical nuclear reductions. I have prepared a \n     corrective amendment and would welcome the support of the \n     chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations \n     Committee.\n\n  Thank you, Senator Conrad. I expect him to come through the door any \nmoment and join me as a cosponsor on this amendment. He had an \namendment to the last treaty and that is exactly what I am trying to do \non this treaty.\n  Finally, Senator Feinstein, in talking about that treaty, said:\n\n       [T]he treaty does not address tactical nuclear weapons. As \n     my colleagues know, there is a great deal of uncertainty \n     about the number, location, and secure storage of Russian \n     tactical nuclear weapons. Smaller and more portable than \n     strategic weapons, they are vulnerable to theft or sale to \n     terrorist groups. Yet the treaty does not even mention them. \n     This is a glaring oversight and the dangers posed by tactical \n     nuclear weapons--especially now in the post-September 11 \n     world of global terrorism--warrants the immediate attention \n     and action by both Russia and the United States.\n\n  She also said:\n\n       This treaty marks an important step forward in the \n     relationship between the United States and Russia and reduces \n     the dangers posed by strategic nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, \n     I am concerned that the treaty does not go far enough and I \n     believe its flaws must be addressed if we truly want to make \n     the threat of nuclear war a thing of the past.\n\n  What has changed in the last 8 years, indeed in the last 40 years, \nwhen it comes to tactical weapons? Not much. As my colleague said 8 \nyears ago, we should have had, in these negotiations, tremendous \nleverage over the Russians on this particular issue. We have a 1,000-\nwarhead advantage on them. They are already under the numbers, and I am \nstill not clear what we got when we agreed that the number would be \n1,550, when they were already below it and we had to get down to 1,550. \nI am not\n\n[[Page S10710]]\n\nsure what we got for that. But it would seem to me at least we should \nhave gotten something in that regard and that something should have had \nto do with tactical weapons.\n  As I am winding down, let me correct one thing that is out there in \nthe public domain and that is the State Department's Web site. The \nState Department has a Web site up that addresses this treaty and deals \nwith many questions surrounding this treaty and has answers for the \npublic, for the media, and for anyone who wants to go there and learn \nabout this particular issue.\n  I wish to focus on one particular aspect of that; that is, the part \nthat deals with tactical weapons that I am dealing with. The State \nDepartment Web site posts--I suppose it is under ``frequently asked \nquestions,'' the question: ``Why doesn't the New START Treaty cover \ntactical weapons?''\n  That is a good question: ``Why doesn't the new START treaty cover \ntactical weapons?''\n  It goes on and states that:\n\n       From the outset, as agreed by Presidents Obama and [the \n     President of Russia] . . . the issue of tactical weapons was \n     not raised.\n\n  I guess that begs the question: Why wasn't it? But nonetheless, the \nquestion is still out there: Why doesn't it address that? This is what \nthey state:\n\n       Deferring negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons until \n     after a START successor agreement had been concluded was also \n     the recommendation of the Perry-Schlesinger Strategic Posture \n     Commission.\n\n  That is an inaccurate statement. You recall, as I read from the \nPerry-Schlesinger Report, that is an inaccurate statement. Some members \nof the Perry-Schlesinger Commission were disturbed by the fact that the \nWeb site said they had recommended they put this off.\n  On December 17, 2010, half a dozen members of that Commission wrote \nto Senator Kerry and ranking member Senator Lugar and were protesting \nthat particular statement on the Web site. I am going to quote from \nthis letter. I am going to put the letter in the Record, but I am going \nto quote some small parts. The letter said:\n\n       As Members of the Strategic Posture Commission, we write to \n     provide our own reality check that this does not resemble the \n     recommendation the commission made on Russian tactical \n     nuclear weapons.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The Commission specifically said on page 67 of its report \n     that, ``The imbalance favoring Russia is worrisome, including \n     for allies, and it will become more worrisome as the number \n     of strategic weapons is decreased. Dealing with this \n     imbalance is urgent and, indeed, some commissioners would \n     give priority to this over taking further steps to reduce the \n     number of operationally deployed strategic nuclear weapons.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter of \nDecember 17 I referred to, to Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar, from \nmembers of the Strategic Posture Commission.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 17, 2010.\n     Senator John Kerry,\n     Russell Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Richard Lugar,\n     Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kerry and Lugar: During Senate consideration \n     of New START, Members of the Senate have rightly raised their \n     concern that New START leaves untouched Russia's ten-to-one \n     advantage in tactical nuclear weapons. The official State \n     Department response to this concern is provided by a document \n     on its web site purporting to be a ``reality check,'' which \n     states that ``Deferring negotiations on tactical nuclear \n     weapons until after a START successor agreement bad been \n     concluded was also the recommendation of the Perry-\n     Schlesinger Congressional Strategic Posture Commission.'' As \n     Members of the Strategic Posture Commission we write to \n     provide our own reality check that this does not resemble the \n     recommendation the Commission made on Russian tactical \n     nuclear weapons.\n       The Commission was in fact very concerned about Russian \n     tactical nuclear weapons. At page 21 of its report, the \n     Commission noted that the current imbalance in tactical \n     nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia ``is \n     stark and worrisome to some U.S. allies in Central Europe.'' \n     We took note of the ``evidently rising value in Russian \n     military doctrine and national security strategy'' of \n     tactical nuclear weapons, and found that ``there is a clear \n     allied concern about this development.''\n       The Commission specifically said on page 67 of its report \n     that ``The imbalance favoring Russia is worrisome, including \n     for allies, and it will become more worrisome as the number \n     of strategic weapons is decreased. Dealing with this \n     imbalance is urgent and, indeed, some commissioners would \n     give priority to this over taking further steps to reduce the \n     number of operationally deployed strategic nuclear weapons.'' \n     (Emphasis added). In addition, page 68 says, ``The United \n     States will need to consider additional initiatives on those \n     NSNF [non-strategic nuclear forces] not constrained by the \n     INF Treaty--i.e., tactical nuclear weapons. U.S. policy \n     should be guided by two principles. First, the United States \n     should seek substantial reductions in the large force of \n     Russian NSNF.'' Second, ``no changes to the U.S. force \n     posture should be made without comprehensive consultations \n     with all U.S. allies.''\n       These quotes from the Commission's report demonstrate the \n     error of the State Department's assertion that the \n     administration's approach to New START and tactical nuclear \n     weapons is consistent with the Commission's recommendations.\n       As members of the Strategic Posture Commission, we have \n     brought this matter to your attention because we believe that \n     the Commission's recommendations regarding negotiations with \n     Russia remain pertinent and that any reference to the \n     Commission's report should be accurate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Harry Cartland.\n     John S. Foster, Jr.\n     Fred C. Ikle.\n     Keith B. Payne.\n     James R. Schlesinger,\n       Vice-Chairman.\n     R. James Woolsey, Jr.\n       Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Let me conclude. Here we are, 40 years later and, indeed, \na decade later than our most recent foray into this. Other than the raw \nreduction of numbers of strategic weapons, not a whole lot has changed. \nBut the world has changed dramatically and I urge and I suggest our \napproach with Russia on these very important issues needs to, likewise, \nchange--and it has not.\n  Once again, in this Senator's humble opinion and that of a number of \nother Senators also, we have been bested by the Russians on the missile \ndefense issue. They have convinced us that if we even think about \nimproving, either quantitative or qualitatively, missile defense \nissues, they will withdraw.\n  Once again, they convinced us before we ever sat down at table that \nthey would not talk about nuclear weapons.\n  That is wrong. That is wrongheaded thinking. It was wrong to approach \nthis treaty with that type of thing on the table. So when we are all \ndone and the high-fiving starts and the champagne bottles are opened \nand the fancy documents are signed, before everybody gets all worked up \nabout what a great and glorious thing this treaty is, I would say it is \nmissing some important things. No. 1 is missile defense, and I guess we \nalready crossed that bridge yesterday; but the other is the oh-so-\nimportant issue of tactical weapons.\n  Fellow Senators, this is your opportunity. If you want to press the \nreset button with Russia, this gives you your opportunity to press the \nreset button with Russia and take up this issue that is so important \nand, indeed, in the minds of many, more important than the issue of \nstrategic weapons.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Kyl.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. First, let me thank Senator Risch on a fine statement about \na very important aspect of this START treaty. He covered the waterfront \nvery well. I only wish there were more than two other colleagues on the \nSenate floor to hear this debate. Part of the reason I suggested, a \nlong time ago, it was not a good idea to bring up the START treaty just \nbefore Christmas is Members would be preoccupied, especially if we \ntried to go through Saturday and Sunday. Here we are on a Sunday \nafternoon and there are four Senators, in addition to the Presiding \nOfficer, on the Senate floor. This is a shame because it is an \nimportant issue.\n  Yesterday, the Senate rejected an amendment by Senators McCain and \nBarrasso. What they said was that there is some language in the \npreamble of this treaty that states the interrelationship between \nstrategic defensive and offensive weapons and that is not a good idea \nbased upon how the Russians intend to use that language. The argument \nagainst it was that it is just a statement of fact, nothing more than \nthat. There is an interrelationship between defense and offense. In \neffect, what is the big deal?\n  The Risch amendment is also merely just a statement of fact. In fact, \nthe language of the Risch amendment is virtually identical to the \npreamble language dealing with missile defenses except it, in effect, \nsubstitutes tactical or\n\n[[Page S10711]]\n\nnonstrategic nuclear weapons for missile defense. It states the \ninterrelationship. I cannot imagine anyone would deny that \ninterrelationship. The Perry-Schlesinger Commission cited by Senator \nRisch confirms that interrelationship.\n  As I said, I can't imagine anyone denying it, and I can't imagine \nanyone denying the fact that as we reduce our strategic offensive \nweapons, then the numbers of tactical nuclear weapons becomes all the \nmore important, especially because of the large difference between the \nRussians and everyone else in the world. It is said to be about 10 to \n1--Russia vis-a-vis the United States in tactical nuclear weapons--and \nall the more discouraging because there is no transparency in what the \nRussians have and their military doctrine is to actually use those \nweapons. Our strategic offensive tactical weapons are a deterrent to \nattack. To the Russians, tactical nuclear weapons are a battlefield \nweapon just like artillery. There is clearly an interrelationship \nbetween the two. It clearly would be to our detriment if we reduce our \nstrategic offensive weapons down to the point that these tactical \nnuclear weapons could create an imbalance in power. Because the United \nStates has commitments to 31 other countries, it is very important to \nthem, especially the European countries that are in the backdoor of \nwhere the Russian tactical missiles could be most effective.\n  Yesterday, we were told we had to defeat the McCain amendment because \nit was simply trying to remove from the preamble this statement of fact \nof this interrelationship. Today, we have the Risch amendment, which is \nsimply to insert a statement of fact about an interrelationship between \nthe strategic and the tactical. There is no principled argument against \nthe Risch amendment. The only argument is the Russians wouldn't like it \nand they would require that we renegotiate the preamble. I can't think \nof a better argument for the Risch amendment. We should renegotiate the \npreamble. All the statements Senator Risch quoted from Democratic \nSenators then--one of the most eloquent by the Vice President, who was \nthen a Senator, who said we have to negotiate further any reductions of \nthese tactical nuclear weapons of the Russians. We should have done it \nin the 2002 treaty. This was a missed opportunity by the Bush \nadministration. That should be our first order of business.\n  So the Obama administration, with Vice President--the Obama \nadministration, with Vice President Joe Biden, comes into office and \nwas that their first priority? No. Was it any priority? No. Did it get \nincluded in the treaty? No. Why? Because the Russians said nyet. All \nthe Risch amendment would do is simply insert the words into the \npreamble. Remember, this is the document that is meaningless, just a \nthrowaway piece of paper, so what harm could it be of making this \nstatement of fact of the interrelationship?\n  As I said, there is no principled argument against this. The only \nargument can be the Russians would require some renegotiation. I say, \nfine, let's bring it on. That should have been negotiated when the \ntreaty was negotiated, not now after the fact.\n  I appreciated the fact that Senator Risch put into the Congressional \nRecord the statement of the six Commissioners of the Perry-Schlesinger \nCommission, who had to correct the State Department Web site, which \nwrongly asserted that they did not believe we should attack this \nproblem of the disparity in tactical nuclear weapons. Senator Risch \nquoted from the Commission report that noted the urgency of dealing \nwith this problem.\n  But did the Obama administration negotiators deal with the problem? \nNo. Why? Because Russia didn't want to.\n  OK. Sorry. We are sorry about that. But when they asked us to deal \nwith missile defense, and we said: No, not in this treaty, they \ninsisted we put language about missile defense, and if the \ninterrelationship between that and the strategic weapons in the \npreamble and more important, not just language about the \ninterrelationship but the fact that as strategic numbers come down, \nthen that relationship becomes even more important because defense \nbecomes more important--precisely the same point about tactical nuclear \nweapons.\n  People should understand one other thing. There is not a huge \ndifference between strategic and tactical weapons. The actual explosive \npower of some tactical weapons exceeds that of some strategic weapons. \nThe difference is in the delivery mechanism. One is intended more as a \nshorter range kind of weapon and the other is a much longer range, \nordinarily an intercontinental range. That is the strategic definition.\n  I cannot think of a principled argument against this. It is not as if \nwe are saying the treaty has to be renegotiated. It is not as if we are \nsaying we have to deal with tactical nuclear weapons. Then-Senator \nBiden said:\n\n       After entry into force of the Moscow Treaty [that was done \n     in 2002] getting a handle on Russian tactical nuclear weapons \n     must be a top arms control and nonproliferation objective of \n     the United States government.\n\n  So why wasn't it a top objective of the Obama and Biden \nadministration?\n  Let me make some other points and I think there are some other \ncolleagues who would like to speak to this and then there are some \nquotations from other people who supported this treaty who said this is \na problem that needs to be dealt with.\n  One of the things that came up during the course of the negotiations \ninvolved a particular kind of Russian tactical nuclear weapon. These \nare the weapons that could be deployed on submarines. They are \nbasically cruise missile weapons, nonstrategic nuclear weapons.\n  These could actually reach the United States when deployed on \nsubmarines, so, insofar as the United States is concerned, it is a \ndistinction without a difference as to whether they are tactical or \nthey are strategic.\n  They could be used against the United States with submarines because \nthey are delivered by cruise missiles. These are exactly the kinds of \nsystems that were limited in a binding side agreement reached between \nthe United States and the Soviet Union during negotiation of the first \nSTART treaty. Why did the administration forgo a similar agreement in \nNew START?\n  In other words, you have a precedent, a particular kind of then \nSoviet nonstrategic nuclear weapon was dealt within a side agreement to \nthe START I treaty, because we understood its importance. This treaty \ndoes not inhibit in the least the Russians' ability to deploy a cruise \nmissile, submarine-based, nonstrategic weapon, nuclear weapon.\n  They did not want us to have the ability to deploy conventional \nPrompt Global Strike, at least not without counting it against the \nvehicles that deliver nuclear weapons. So that got into the treaty. The \nRussians did not want it, so we acceded to their request. When we \nwanted to put something in about the cruise missiles that would be \ndelivered by submarine, no, we cannot do that, the Russians said.\n  I presume the administration made this argument. I do not know that \nthey did in the negotiations. You see, we, the Senate, being asked to \ngive our consent to this treaty, have been denied the negotiating \nrecords. The Russians know what our negotiators said, but we do not \nknow. The State Department knows, the Russians know, but we do not \nknow.\n  I do not even know if the United States tried to get that same \nagreement that was in the START I treaty in this New START treaty. I do \nnot know. But it is not in there. So either we did not try--\nnegligence--or the Russians said no. This is why it is important to \nrecognize the relationship somewhere--maybe we will get a letter from \nthe President. Maybe he will send another letter to Senator McConnell \nand say something about this, which, of course, does not mean anything \nvis-a-vis the Russians.\n  Why do we not do this in the preamble? Well, we have a chance to do \nit now, to correct the problem, by adopting the Risch amendment. A \nfinal point. The resolution of ratification actually recognizes this \nlittle problem, not very effectively, but it recognizes the problem by \ncalling on the President to pursue an agreement with the Russians that \nwould address this disparity in tactical nuclear weapons in the future.\n  Well, that is what then-Senator Biden asked to be done in 2002, when \nthe last treaty was debated in the Senate. We did not do it. So now the \nresolution of ratification says, well, this is a pretty good idea, \nactually. We ought to do that in the future sometime. Well, our \nbargaining power in the future is gone. This is the treaty to do it\n\n[[Page S10712]]\n\nin. What is the quid pro quo going to be when we go to the Russians \nnext and say, now we want to talk about tactical nuclear weapons. They \nare going to say, now we want to talk about U.S. missile defenses. How \ndo you like them apples? What is the Obama administration going to say?\n  One theory I heard was--and this was from a knowledgeable source--\nthat the Russians actually would like to move the bulk of their \ntactical nuclear weapons from the European theater to their southern \nborder and their eastern border, where they fear some day they may have \nto use these weapons against a potential invasion from China or from \nMuslim states to their south, and that they might agree to a \nconcession--if the United States insisted that they move those weapons \nback from the European theater, they might be willing to do that. That \nis exactly the kind of concern we have. The Russians want to do that. \nThey are prepared to move their missiles. They know they are going to \nhave to do so for their own self-interests. They are waiting, however, \nuntil we say we wish to bring up this question of tactical nukes. They \nwill say: I tell you what, if you will give us something on missile \ndefense, we will be happy to move them back from the European theatre. \nThat is the kind of thing we are looking at. The Russians are great \nchess players, the best in the world. And they are great negotiators. \nWith all due respect to our negotiators--I cannot blame our \nnegotiators. I do not know whether it was because of a lack of \ndirection from the Commander in Chief or poor negotiation. But one way \nor the other, we got snookered. We got snookered on missile defense, we \ngot snookered on conventional Prompt Global Strike, we got snookered on \ntactical nuclear weapons, we got snookered on verification. All of \nthese are issues that we want to try to deal with in the Senate now \nduring this ratification process.\n  But Senator Kerry, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nhas said, we are not going to amend the treaty. So what are we doing \nhere on a Sunday afternoon? If we are not going to do it, and he has \ngot the votes to see that we do not do it, about all we can do is to \nmake the case to the American people that this was a flawed process and \na flawed treaty.\n  I hope our colleagues will consider the prospect of making some \nchanges here, so that if, in fact, there does have to be some \nrenegotiation, we welcome that. I do not know why the other side \nbelieves the Senate is only here as a rubberstamp. You cannot change \nthe treaty, so vote for it. I think that explains this matter of time. \nWhy do you need any time to debate this treaty? Let's get it over with. \nWe have got to ratify the treaty here. Why are you raising all of those \nobjections and questions? We are not going to let you amend it. So why \ndo you think we need to take all of this time?\n  I think that explains their rationale. I heard one of my colleagues \non the other side this morning on national TV say, we have been on this \ntreaty for 2 weeks. No, we have not. We have been on it for 3\\1/2\\ \ndays. That is interspersed with all of the other stuff we have been \ndoing on the Senate floor, which I will not bother to repeat. We are \nall well aware of it.\n  But here we are on a Sunday afternoon. We should be debating a very \nserious proposal by Senator Risch to simply put wording in the preamble \nthat tracks almost identically the wording that is already in there \nrelative to missile defense, and this would relate to tactical nuclear \nweapons. Why would we not do that, unless we do not want to change the \ntreaty in any way?\n  I do not think we should be wasting our time here. The advice and \nconsent clause of the Constitution meant something. The administration \ndid not follow our advice that we gave them when we passed the defense \nbill last year on missile defense, on Prompt Global Strike. So we do \nnot have to give them our consent, or at least we can say let's make a \nfew changes--a change such as this, that I cannot see any principled \nargument against. There will be an argument, and the argument will be: \nWell, the Russians will not like it, we will have to renegotiate. I \nwill be interested to see if there is any other argument.\n  I hope my colleagues will gradually filter in here on a Sunday \nafternoon, turn off the football game, come in for a few hours of \nedification about some very important matters to American security, \nand, at the end of this afternoon when we vote, support the amendment \nof my colleague Senator Risch.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me state at the outset that the \namendment offend by the distinguished Senator, Mr. Risch, would, in \nessence, terminate the treaty. We have been down this trail yesterday \nwith a long debate about missile defense.\n  But, in fact, the net result of amending the preamble, and thus the \ntext of the treaty, is to kill it. That is the issue before the Senate. \nThere may be Members in our body who do not like the treaty. There have \nbeen some, apparently, who from time to time have not been prepared to \nsupport any treaty with Russia.\n  I have recited, at least from my recollection of previous debates, \nthat many Senators simply said, you can never trust the Russians. You \ncannot deal with the Russians. Simply what we ought to be doing is to \nbuild up defenses of our own so that quite regardless of what the \nRussians have, what the Russians intend to do, we are prepared for \nthat.\n  Indeed, that was some of the argumentation at the time President \nRonald Reagan first seriously got into these issues. There were persons \nat that point, and there may still be persons, who believe that somehow \nor other a complex system of missile defense can be set up that would \nprotect our country against intercontinental ballistic missiles flying \nin from Russia, from North Korea, from Iran, from whomever might obtain \nthem.\n  That argument has gone on for decades. To this point, there has not \nbeen scientific backup that such a comprehensive missile system could \nbe created, quite apart from what its expense might be, and quite apart \nfrom the lack of attention to the recognition of what else is going on \nin the world.\n  Indeed it is a curious fact that in this debate some Senators have \nargued that the Russians are one thing, but a rather diminishing focus, \nas far as they are concerned; that the real problem is not how ever \nmany intercontinental ballistic missiles the Russians may have, how \nmany warheads that are aimed at our military installations and our \ncities but, rather, that development of a few nuclear weapons in North \nKorea, or the possibility of development of some in Iran ought to be \nthe focus for those who are moderate as opposed to those who are still \ntalking ancient history.\n  Let me be very clear. We are talking this afternoon about an \namendment that terminates the treaty and that means we have no New \nSTART. Some Senators would say, well, that is fine. Now let's go back \nto work. Let's send our negotiators into the fray, as if, for some \nreason or other, we anticipate the Russians, after this rejection, are \neager to engage.\n  In the meanwhile, let me say that for what I would call an indefinite \nperiod, while these negotiations might come about, although it is \ndubious given at least the rejection not only to the Russians, but the \nimpression of the rest of the world, that we will have an inability, \nonce again, to inspect what is proceeding in Russia.\n  In other parts of the debate, we may talk about the verification \nprocedures and their adequacy. Some Senators have already suggested \nthat in their judgment those verification procedures may lack the \nadequacy that would give us confidence, even though the number of bases \non which Russia has weapons has decreased by at least a half, and it is \na very different situation with regard to inspection.\n  But, at the same time, many of us have lamented since a year ago \nDecember 5 that we have not had so-called boots on the ground; that is, \nAmericans inspecting what is proceeding. I think that is very \nimportant. If we reject the treaty today by passing this amendment, \nthat problem will continue. I believe that has to be faced squarely, \nregardless of what Senators might feel ought to be in the treaty or \nleft out of it. I would say each day that goes by, I do not predict \nthat the Russians are going to construct something especially new and \ndifferent, but we have come into a mode of feeling, that although that \nmay be important, it has not been important enough for us to take up \nthis treaty, even though it has\n\n[[Page S10713]]\n\nbeen clearly signed by the two Presidents of the United States and \nRussia for some months.\n  Thank goodness we finally have the treaty before us. I would say that \nthe costs associated with requiring renegotiation of the treaty, I \nbelieve, far outweigh the benefits the Senate might gain by demanding a \nnew treaty, new changes in due course. I would say, from my \nperspective, a rejection of the treaty today will make further \nlimitations on Russian tactical nuclear arms far less likely, not more \nlikely.\n  The United States has made clear that any future nuclear arms \nreduction agreement with Russia should include tactical nuclear \nweapons, and I share that objective. Some critics have overvalued the \nutility, however, of Russian tactical nuclear weapons, and undervalued \nour deterrent to them.\n  Only a fraction of those weapons; that is, the Russian tactical \nweapons, could be delivered significantly beyond Russia's borders. \nPursuant to the INF treaty, the United States and the Soviet Union long \nago destroyed intermediate range and shorter range nuclear-armed \nballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles, which have a \nrange of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers.\n  In fact, most of Russia's tactical nuclear weapons have very short \nranges. They are used for homeland air defense. Most, as has been \nsuggested, are devoted to the Chinese border or are in storage now. A \nRussian nuclear attack on NATO countries is effectively deterred by \nNATO conventional superiority, our own tactical nuclear forces, French \nand British nuclear arsenals, and U.S. strategic forces. In short, \nRussian tactical nuclear weapons do not threaten our strategic \ndeterrent. Our NATO allies that flank Russia in eastern and northern \nEurope understand this. I think we need to underline that because we \nhave NATO allies. We have discussed this subject very frequently.\n  Our NATO allies would seemingly be the most in harm's way of a short-\nrange tactical nuclear weapon. It could be a very short range into the \nBaltics, for example, or into Poland, but the NATO allies have all \nstrongly endorsed the New START treaty for the reasons I have \nsuggested. They understand the deterrents that are already present to \nthe Russian use of these particular weapons.\n  It is important to recognize that the science differential between \nRussian and American tactical nuclear arsenals did not come to pass \nbecause of American inattention to this point. During the first Bush \nadministration, our national command authority, with full participation \nby the military, deliberately made a decision to reduce the number of \ntactical nuclear weapons we deployed. So it goes back to the first Bush \nadministration, a deliberate decision to reduce the number. They did \nthis irrespective of Russian actions because the threat of a massive \nground invasion in Europe had largely evaporated due to the breakup of \nthe former Soviet Union.\n  In addition, our conventional capabilities had improved to the extent \nthat battlefield nuclear weapons were no longer needed to defend \nwestern Europe. That was a military judgment. In this atmosphere, \nmaintaining large arsenals of nuclear artillery shells, land mines, and \nshort-range missile warheads was a bad bargain for us in terms of cost, \nsafety, alliance cohesion, and proliferation risk. In my judgment, \nRussia should make a similar decision. The risks to Russia of \nmaintaining their tactical nuclear arsenal in its current form are \ngreater than the potential security benefits those weapons might \nprovide. They have not done this in part because of their threat \nperceptions about their border, particularly their border with China--\nwhich, apparently, they want to give an impression to the Chinese who \nare along a large border and territory largely unoccupied or sparsely \noccupied by Russians, that these weapons might be utilized against the \nChinese.\n  An agreement with Russia that reduced, accounted for, and improved \nsecurity around tactical nuclear arsenals is in the interest of Russia \nand the United States. Rejection of New START, however, makes it \nunlikely that a subsequent agreement concerning tactical nuclear \nweapons will ever be reached. One of the basic points of the exercise \nwe are now proceeding on, the passage and ratification of a New START \ntreaty, means we have another opportunity to move ahead with the \nRussians around the negotiating table.\n  Logically, rejection of the treaty does not offer a promising benefit \nfor at least the short run, and maybe the intermediate run to either \ncountry to proceed.\n  The resolution of ratification encourages the President to engage the \nRussian Federation on establishing measures to improve mutual \nconfidence regarding the accounting and security of Russian \nnonstrategic weapons. That has been deliberately put into the text we \nare discussing today. For this reason, I oppose the amendment because, \nin fact, it would require renegotiation of the treaty. I have suggested \nthat is unlikely to come about very rapidly and very readily.\n  One of the amazing things about the current situation was that with \nthe expiration of the START treaty a year ago December, we were able to \nget together with the Russians, admittedly on a limited agenda. Those \nwho are proponents of the treaty have said from the start that it is a \nlimited agenda, small reductions in strategic arms, an ideal, once \nagain, of verification and the possibilities that having at least \nreached limited agreements, we might in fact meet again around the \nnegotiating table to think through the tactical weapons situation and \nother aspects and the very important objective we do have with the \nRussians of limiting the building of nuclear weapons or an industry \nthat could field those in other countries.\n  We believe it will be in the interest of the Russians, as well as our \nown, to have that cooperation on the basis of our knowledge of how the \nsystems work and how that deterrence might be effected.\n  I appreciate very much the importance of the issue. But for the \nreasons I have suggested, I believe it would be unwise to adopt the \nmotion of the distinguished Senator. Furthermore, I would not like to \nsee the treaty completely obliterated today by the adoption of this \namendment because that, in fact, would be the effect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak for 15 minutes, to be followed by Senator Cornyn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, we are grateful to be here on a weekend \ntalking about a critically important treaty for the country. This \ntreaty has been the subject for many months now of review by the \nForeign Relations Committee, as well as other committees. There have \nbeen between 900 and 1,000 questions asked of the administration and \nanswered. I think we should start with some basic fundamentals about \nthe context within which this treaty is being debated and, I hope, \nratified in the next couple of days.\n  First, this treaty is entirely consistent with our concern in making \nsure our nuclear arsenal is safe, secure, effective, and reliable. \nThere is no question about that in terms of our goal. That underpins \nour national security and is no way reduced or compromised because of \nthis treaty.\n  I wish to speak to the amendment offered by Senator Risch. Any \namendment to the treaty would require renegotiation with the Russian \nFederation. That would lead to a prolonged delay for the U.S. nuclear \nweapons inspectors to return to Russia to get on the ground to inspect \nand to verify.\n  As we sit here today on this Sunday, we can say, unfortunately, on \nthis date, Sunday, December 19, we mark day 379 since we have had \ninspectors on the ground. That is a problem for our security. That is a \nproblem, obviously, for verification. That is one of the reasons--only \none, but one--we must ratify this treaty.\n  Let me get to the amendment offered by Senator Risch. Senator Risch \nand I serve on the Foreign Relations Committee. I am the chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South and Central Asian Affairs. \nSenator Risch is our ranking member. We work well together. I think we \nhave a basic disagreement about this amendment. This amendment involves \nwhat are known as tactical nuclear weapons. I\n\n[[Page S10714]]\n\nrecognize the importance of addressing the basic imbalance that exists \nwith respect to the Russians and the scores of tactical nuclear weapons \nat their disposal. It is important that upon ratification of the New \nSTART accord, we proceed quickly to negotiations with the Russians on \ntactical nuclear weapons. But as we engage in this debate, it is also \nimportant to clearly define what we are talking about for the American \npeople.\n  The Congressional Research Service says the United States and the \nSoviet Union--what we used to call the Soviet Union--both deployed \nthousands of ``nonstrategic'' nuclear weapons during the Cold War that \nwere intended to be used in support of troops in the field during a \nconflict. These included nuclear mines, artillery, short, medium, and \nlong-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and gravity bombs.\n  So we are talking about tactical weapons--in this case, tactical \nnuclear weapons--which were not included in the New START treaty \nbecause this is a strategic weapons treaty. We can all agree future \nnegotiations must take place on tactical nuclear weapons. But the only \nway to get there, the only path forward, is by finalizing New START and \nratifying this important treaty.\n  Our allies in Europe are perhaps the most vulnerable to the threat \nposed by tactical nuclear weapons. Our allies in eastern Europe are \nespecially so. Yet here is what Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw \nSikorski wrote on November 20:\n\n       Without a [New START] treaty in place, holes will soon \n     appear in the nuclear umbrella that the US provides to Poland \n     and other allies under article 5 of the Washington Treaty, \n     the collective security guarantee for NATO members. Moreover, \n     New START is a necessary stepping-stone to future \n     negotiations with Russia about reductions in tactical nuclear \n     arsenals and a prerequisite for a successful survival of the \n     Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE).\n       In effect, New START is a sine qua non for effective US \n     leadership on arms-control and non-proliferation issues that \n     matter to Europe--from reviving the CFE treaty to preventing \n     Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.\n\n  The Polish Foreign Minister said this. He represents the very people \nunder direct threat from the Russians and from their tactical nuclear \nweapons. He believes New START should be done first, followed by \nnegotiations on tactical nuclear weapons.\n  Secretary General of NATO Rasmussen has said:\n\n       The New START treaty would also pave the way for arms \n     control and disarmament initiatives in other areas that are \n     vital to the Euro-Atlantic security. Most important would be \n     transparency and reductions of short-range, tactical nuclear \n     weapons in Europe which allies have called for in our new \n     ``Strategic Concept.'' This is a key concern for allies--not \n     only those closest to Russia's borders--in light of the great \n     disparity between levels of Russian tactical nuclear weapons \n     and those of NATO. But we cannot address this disparity until \n     the New START treaty is ratified. Which is another reason why \n     ratification would set the stage for further improvements in \n     European security.\n\n  Franklin Miller, the Senior Director for Defense Policy and Arms \nControl under President George W. Bush said:\n\n       If we don't ratify New START, we're back to the drawing \n     boards on some sort of approach to strategic arms and the \n     tactical that are still going to get left behind. I do not \n     see a treaty in the future that will lump the large Russian \n     tactical stockpile in with the smaller strategic stockpiles \n     on both sides.\n\n  End of quotation from President George W. Bush's Senior Director for \nDefense Policy and Arms Control.\n  Finally, I would note that in April 2009, both President Obama and \nPresident Medvedev indicated that arms control would be a step-by-step \nprocess, with a replacement for the 1991 START treaty coming first but \na more comprehensive treaty that might include deeper cuts in all types \nof warheads, including nonstrategic weapons, following in the future.\n  Russian tactical weapons must be decreased, there is no question \nabout that, and experts across the political and international spectrum \nagree that completing New START is the essential first step in reducing \nRussian tactical nuclear weapons.\n  Even if this amendment to the treaty were to be passed, the treaty \nitself would still be about strategic arms. Nothing in the amendment \nwould actually change that fact. But it would unnecessarily continue to \ndelay U.S. inspectors returning to Russia to verify nuclear weapons. So \nif this amendment were to pass, we not only make no progress--no \nprogress--on tactical nuclear arms, but efforts to decrease the weapons \nactually pointed at the American people--the Russian ICBMs would grind \nto an immediate halt. This is not acceptable to the American people, I \nwould argue, but certainly not to many of us supporting the \nratification of the treaty. As a result, I will be voting no on the \nRisch amendment.\n  I would also like to reiterate that the resolution of ratification \nthat came out of the Foreign Relations Committee covers this issue by \ncalling on the President to ``pursue, following consultation with \nallies, an agreement with the Russian Federation that would address the \ndisparity between the tactical nuclear weapons stockpiles of the \nRussian Federation and of the United States and would secure and reduce \ntactical nuclear weapons in a verifiable manner.'' So says the \nresolution of ratification. This bipartisan resolution passed out of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee by a vote of 14 to 4.\n  So we have spent lots of time on this treaty. We have spent a good \ndeal of time as well on this basic question. But I think we have to do \nmore than talk tough when it comes to this treaty and when it comes to \nmaking sure our arsenal is safe, secure, effective, and reliable. Tough \ntalk is not enough. We need tough actions. The ratification of this \ntreaty is one of those tough actions to make sure the American people \nare more secure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Risch amendment \nand would refer all of us to the constitutional provision under which \nwe are discharging our responsibility. Of course, it is article II, \nsection 2 of the Constitution that says:\n\n       [The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice \n     and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties. . . .\n\n  The problem here is that even though Congress has told the \nadministration about our concerns about constraining our missile \ndefense capability and has told the administration about our concerns \nwith regard to the exclusion of tactical weapons that are covered by \nthe Risch amendment, in reality, the administration really does not \nwant our advice but merely seeks our consent.\n  I believe this matter is being treated with the kind of gravity and \nseriousness on a bipartisan basis that it deserves. But there are some \nvery real differences between those of us who think this treaty is as \ngood as we can get and that Congress's role is really to consent to \nsomething negotiated without our advice having been taken, and those \nwho believe the Senate should play more than a rubberstamp role when it \ncomes to matters as serious as these. Indeed, in section 1251 of the \nnational defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2010, the Senate \ndid provide advice on these matters. But, as I indicated earlier, most \nof that advice was ignored in favor of a strategy of seeking our \nconsent after this treaty was basically a fait accompli.\n  It concerns me that--and I admire our distinguished floor leader, \nSenator Lugar, who has a wealth of experience in this area, and I think \nwe all acknowledge that--it worries me that any attempts by the Senate \nto offer amendments are called treaty killers. I do not really \nunderstand what our role is here if it is not to offer amendments to \nconform the treaty to what we believe is the best national security \ninterests of the American people.\n  But one of the treaty's problems that I think the Risch amendment \nreveals is, that by excluding tactical nuclear weapons, we are giving \nthe Russians a huge advantage and increasing rather than decreasing \ninstability. The Congressional Research Service has written a document \nthat illustrates this, a research document dated January 14, 2010, \nentitled ``Nonstrategic Nuclear Weapons,'' otherwise called tactical \nnuclear weapons. On pages 4, 5, and 6, they go through a factual \ndistinction between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those pages be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n\n[[Page S10715]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Congressional Research Service points out that the \ndistinction between strategic nuclear weapons that are covered by this \ntreaty and nonstrategic or tactical nuclear weapons that are not \ncovered by this treaty is, frankly, a muddled topic. We do know that \nsome types of weapons, by exclusion, are left out and not included \nunder the treaty. In other words, intercontinental ballistic missiles, \nsea-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers are included as \nstrategic weapons, and, by definition, everything that is not included \nwould be a nonstrategic or tactical weapon. They also point out in \nthose pages that are being made part of the Record that part of the \ndefinition has traditionally been determined by the range of delivery \nvehicles and the yield of the warheads. But I think it is important to \ntry, as well as we can, to paint a clearer picture of what we are \ntalking about when we say nonstrategic or tactical nuclear weapons.\n  I have in my hand an unclassified report taken from Jane's \nInformation Group publications called ``Strategic Weapon Systems, \nFighting Ships, Naval Weapon Systems, and All the World's Aircraft'' \nthat covers a so-called nonstrategic Russian weapon known as the SH-11 \nGorgon ABM, otherwise called the UR-96.\n  The reason I raise this example of a type of weapon that the Russians \nreportedly have, which is not covered by this treaty, is that the yield \nof this weapon is 1 megaton--1 megaton. If you look at the size of the \nnuclear weapon that was used on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, that \nkilled anywhere from 80,000 to 140,000 people--actually, no one knows \nthe exact number because of radiation-induced injuries and the like, \nbut suffice it to say it caused enormous devastation and brought \nImperial Japan to its knees in World War II--that was, by contrast, a \n10-kiloton nuclear warhead. In other words, this so-called nonstrategic \nnuclear warhead not covered by this treaty is 100 times more powerful \nthan the nuclear warhead that killed perhaps 100,000 people or more in \nHiroshima in 1945.\n  So I mention this example--and this is, by the way, an unclassified \ndocument. We cannot go into, here on the floor, more detail about the \ndistinction or, frankly, really, what we should call a continuum \nbetween tactical and strategic nuclear weapons. But we are not talking \nabout firecrackers. We are not talking about bottle rockets. We are \ntalking about weapons that can wreak death and destruction that really, \nI think, most of us hesitate to even contemplate.\n  So this is not an inconsequential amendment. This is a very important \namendment that the Senator has brought. I listened to him a little \nearlier. I was in my office in the Hart Office Building, but I listened \nto Senator Risch cite some very distinguished authorities on the other \nside of the aisle, and this comes from the Congressional Record in \nMarch of 2003, talking about the Moscow Treaty. Senator after Senator--\nSenator Dorgan, the distinguished Senator from North Dakota; Senator \nBiden, now Vice President Biden but then a Senator from Delaware; \nSenator Reed from Rhode Island, a distinguished expert on the Armed \nServices Committee on national security matters; Senator Conrad, the \nother Senator from North Dakota--to a man, they noted and expressed \nconcern about the failure to deal with tactical nuclear weapons in the \nMoscow Treaty of 2003. The Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, \nalso noted the absence of any dealing with tactical nuclear weapons. I \nmention this to say, again, no one is talking about divisions among us. \nWe are talking about a unified concern with the threat tactical nuclear \nweapons poses.\n  So I think it is simply a mistake--but it is a correctable mistake--\nthat the negotiators of this treaty and the administration have \nexcluded tactical nuclear weapons. As others have stated, the United \nStates has an advantage at this time on strategic nuclear weapons. So \nbasically we are going to have to cut our stockpile, while the Russian \nFederation, which does not currently have as many weapons as this \ntreaty would allow, would be allowed to build up to that cap. But in \nthe area of tactical nuclear weapons, the Russian Federation has--one \nclassified estimate was around 10 times what the United States has in \nterms of tactical nuclear weapons.\n  I was talking in my office with Tom D'Agostino, the head of the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration, someone who has long served \nin this area and who has confirmed that this tactical nuclear asymmetry \nis very real. According to him--he said--``the actual numbers are \nclassified''--as I alluded to earlier--but he confirmed that ``there's \na ten to one ratio, roughly, give or take. You know, it's a big \ndifference between the two.''\n  It seems to me that from a bargaining standpoint, it would have made \nall of the sense in the world for the Obama administration to have \ninsisted on reductions in the Russian tactical nuclear weapons as part \nof the New START. If not now, I would say, when. If not in 2003--if all \nof our colleagues whose names I have mentioned earlier thought it was a \ngood idea to deal with tactical nuclear weapons back in 2003, it \nstrikes me as even more important to do it now rather than kick the can \ndown the road and not take advantage of the leverage we would have due \nto the Russians' desire to maintain their current arsenal of tactical \nnuclear weapons.\n  But Vice President Biden recognized, in 2003, that this omission was \npotentially dangerous. I will quote him. He said:\n\n       Getting a handle on Russian tactical nuclear weapons must \n     be a top arms control and nonproliferation objective of the \n     United States Government.\n\n  So one has to question why that top objective remains unmet under New \nSTART.\n  James Schlesinger, former Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the \nnow-defunct U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, has testified that ``the \nsignificance of tactical nuclear weapons rises steadily as strategic \nnuclear arms are reduced.'' This is a sobering conclusion, and it helps \nillustrate the importance of this glaring omission in the New START \ntreaty.\n\n  Simply put, this treaty in its current form represents a lost \nopportunity to compel the Russian Federation to downsize their tactical \nnuclear arsenal. This amendment provides an opportunity to lay the \ngroundwork for that goal to be accomplished in the future.\n  Following Senate ratification of the START I treaty, President George \nHerbert Walker Bush committed the United States to unilaterally \nreducing our tactical nuclear weapons. Not surprisingly, while the \nRussians made a similar commitment, they failed to follow through and \nnever completed their promised reductions.\n  Today, Russia's widespread deployment of tactical nuclear weapons \nraises concerns with their safety and security. These weapons are often \nlocated at remote bases close to potential battlefields, sometimes far \nfrom central command authority. Questions have been raised regarding \nthe stability and reliability of those Russian troops charged with \nmonitoring and securing those weapons. In 2008, Secretary Gates said he \nwas worried that the Russians themselves didn't even know the numbers \nand locations of old land mines, nuclear artillery shells, and so on, \nthat would be of interest to rogue states and terrorists.\n  In addition, unlike strategic nuclear weapons, tactical weapons have \nvery little transparency and very little accounting. The treaty should \nat least take a step in the direction to provide more transparency and \nan accounting requirement.\n  Achieving reductions in Russian tactical nuclear weapons would also \nreduce the supply of those weapons that could be acquired by groups \nsuch as al-Qaida. Tactical nuclear weapons are among those that are the \nmost susceptible to theft or illicit transfer because they are \nrelatively small and compact, including so-called suitcase nukes. They \nare the most susceptible to theft and illicit transfer to terrorists \nand also rogue states.\n  During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was known to have produced and \ndeployed smaller tactical weapons, sometimes called suitcase nukes, as \nI mentioned a moment ago. These nuclear weapons--unlike large strategic \nweapons that New START would limit--are the terrorist's dream. They are \neasily concealed and highly transportable. They could all too easily be\n\n[[Page S10716]]\n\nmoved across our border and positioned in almost any building in the \nUnited States.\n  Additionally, the Strategic Posture Commission, in its 2009 report to \nCongress, found that Russia's tactical nuclear weapons advantage opens \nup new possibilities for Russian efforts to threaten the use of nuclear \nweapons to influence regional conflicts and threaten our allies. The \nCommission observed that there is an ``evidently rising value in \nRussian military doctrine and national security strategy'' of tactical \nnuclear weapons.\n  These fears are coming to fruition, as U.S. officials say that Russia \nhas moved tactical nuclear weapons to facilities near NATO allies \nseveral times in recent years, most recently this past spring. These \nactions, again, would run counter to pledges made by Moscow that they \nwould pull back tactical nuclear weapons and reduce their numbers.\n  By ratifying the New START treaty without addressing this asymmetry, \nthe United States would squander valuable leverage to negotiate a \nfuture reduction in Russian tactical nuclear weapons. The \nadministration says no matter, we must ratify the New START treaty and \nwe can deal with the tactical nuclear weapons sometime in the future. \nWell, again, we didn't do it in 2003 when Vice President Biden and \nothers pointed out the omission and the potential danger, and here we \nare in 2010 being asked in a lameduck session to ratify this treaty and \nleave tactical nuclear weapons excluded once again. It leads me to \nwonder whether instead of the doctrine of ``trust, but verify,'' we are \nembracing a doctrine of ``ignore it and it will simply go away.'' We \nall know it won't. Russia would have little reason to agree to reduce \nits arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons in a future treaty without \nextracting major concessions from the United States. We can fix this \nissue now if we would simply adopt the Risch amendment.\n  I join my colleagues in urging the adoption of the Risch amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, would the Senator from Texas yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Texas has mentioned a statement I and \nsome others have made with respect to the Moscow Treaty. I simply \nwanted to observe that then and now, I wish we had included tactical \nnuclear weapons, but I then voted for the Moscow Treaty and I will vote \nfor this treaty. The reason for that is making progress on strategic \nnuclear weapons, reducing the stock of nuclear weapons, and reducing \ndelivery vehicles, it seems to me, is major progress. This \nadministration has indicated it intends to move forward on tactical \nweapons negotiations with the Russians. I didn't want it to stand that \nsomehow my concern--back in the discussion about the Moscow Treaty, the \nconcern about not including tactical weapons had me voting against the \ntreaty. I did not. I voted for that, and I will vote for this treaty \nbecause I think it advances the ball in a very significant way with \nrespect to arms control.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota \ncoming out and making that statement. I didn't mean to suggest that he \nvoted against the Moscow Treaty, but I do believe I accurately quoted \nhis concerns, which he has reconfirmed here, in the failure to deal \nwith tactical nuclear weapons.\n  I would say in response to my colleague that we are making a \nunilateral reduction in strategic nuclear weapons and the Russians are \nnot going to have to reduce any in their current stockpile because we \nare presently over the cap set by the treaty and they are under the \ncap. So it seems to me there is even further evidence we got out-\nnegotiated on this, and particularly when it omits this important part \nof the nuclear arsenal and a threat to the stability of not only the \nregion but also of the world.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   The Distinction Between Strategic and Nonstrategic Nuclear Weapons\n\n       The distinction between strategic and nonstrategic (also \n     known as tactical) nuclear weapons reflects the military \n     definitions of, on the one hand, a strategic mission and, on \n     the other hand, the tactical use of nuclear weapons. \n     According to the Department of Defense Dictionary of Military \n     Terms, a strategic mission is:\n       ``Directed against one or more of a selected series of \n     enemy targets with the purpose of progressive destruction and \n     disintegration of the enemy's warmaking capacity and will to \n     make war. Targets include key manufacturing systems, sources \n     of raw material, critical material, stockpiles, power \n     systems, transportation systems, communication facilities, \n     and other such target systems. As opposed to tactical \n     operations, strategic operations are designed have a long-\n     range rather than immediate effect on the enemy and its \n     military forces.''\n       In contrast, the tactical use of nuclear weapons is defined \n     as ``the use of nuclear weapons by land, sea, or air forces \n     against opposing forces, supporting installations or \n     facilities, in support of operations that contribute to the \n     accomplishment of a military mission of limited scope, or in \n     support of the military commander's scheme of maneuver, \n     usually limited to the area of military operations.''\n\n\n                 Definition by Observable Capabilities\n\n       During the Cold War, it was relatively easy to distinguish \n     between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons because \n     each type had different capabilities that were better suited \n     to the different missions.\n\n\n                Definition by Range of Delivery Vehicles\n\n       The long-range missiles and heavy bombers deployed on U.S. \n     territory and missiles deployed in ballistic missile \n     submarines had the range and destructive power to attack and \n     destroy military, industrial, and leadership targets central \n     to the Soviet Union's ability to prosecute the war. At the \n     same time, with their large warheads and relatively limited \n     accuracies (at least during the earlier years of the Cold \n     War), these weapons were not suited for attacks associated \n     with tactical or battlefield operations. Nonstrategic nuclear \n     weapons, in contrast, were not suited for strategic missions \n     because they lacked the range to reach targets inside the \n     Soviet Union (or, for Soviet weapons, targets inside the \n     United States). But, because they were often small enough to \n     be deployed with troops in the field or at forward bases, the \n     United States and Soviet Union could have used them to attack \n     targets in the theater of the conflict, or on the battlefield \n     itself, to support more limited military missions.\n       Even during the Cold War, however, the United States and \n     Russia deployed nuclear weapons that defied the standard \n     understanding of the difference between strategic and \n     nonstrategic nuclear weapons. For example, both nations \n     considered weapons based on their own territories that could \n     deliver warheads to the territory of the other nation to be \n     ``strategic'' because they had the range needed to reach \n     targets inside the other nation's territory. But some early \n     Soviet submarine-launched ballistic missiles had relatively \n     short (i.e., 500 mile) ranges, and the submarines patrolled \n     close to U.S. shores to ensure that the weapons could reach \n     their strategic targets. Conversely, in the 1980s the United \n     States considered sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs) \n     deployed on submarines or surface ships to be nonstrategic \n     nuclear weapons. But, if these vessels were deployed close to \n     Soviet borders, these weapons could have destroyed many of \n     the same targets as U.S. strategic nuclear weapons. \n     Similarly, U.S. intermediate-range missiles that were \n     deployed in Europe, which were considered nonstrategic by the \n     United States, could reach central, strategic targets in the \n     Soviet Union.\n       Furthermore, some weapons that had the range to reach \n     ``strategic'' targets on the territory of the other nations \n     could also deliver tactical nuclear weapons in support of \n     battlefield or tactical operations. Soviet bombers could be \n     equipped with nuclear-armed anti-ship missiles; U.S. bombers \n     could also carry anti-ship weapons and nuclear mines. Hence, \n     the range of the delivery vehicle does not always correlate \n     with the types of targets or objectives associated with the \n     warhead carried on that system. This relationship between \n     range and mission has become even more clouded since the end \n     of the Cold War because the United States and Russia have \n     retired many of the shorter and medium-range delivery systems \n     considered to be nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Further, both \n     nations may develop the capability to use their longer-range \n     ``strategic'' systems to deliver warheads to a full range of \n     strategic and tactical targets, even if long-standing \n     traditions and arms control definitions weigh against this \n     change.\n\n\n                    Definition by Yield of Warheads\n\n       During the Cold War, the longer-range strategic delivery \n     vehicles also tended to carry warheads with greater yields, \n     or destructive power, than nonstrategic nuclear weapons. \n     Smaller warheads were better suited to nonstrategic weapons \n     because they sought to achieve more limited, discrete \n     objectives on the battlefield than did the larger, strategic \n     nuclear weapons. But this distinction has also dissolved in \n     more modern systems. Many U.S. and Russian heavy bombers can \n     carry weapons of lower yields, and, as accuracies improved \n     for bombs and missiles, warheads with lower yields could \n     achieve the same expected level of destruction that had \n     required larger warheads in early generations of strategic \n     weapons systems.\n\n[[Page S10717]]\n\n                        Definition by Exclusion\n\n       The observable capabilities that allowed analysts to \n     distinguish between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear \n     weapons during the Cold War have not always been precise, and \n     may not prove to be relevant or appropriate in the future. On \n     the other hand, the ``strategic'' weapons identified by these \n     capabilities--ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers--are the only \n     systems covered by the limits in strategic offensive arms \n     control agreements--the SALT agreements signed in the 1970s, \n     the START agreements signed in the 1990s, and the Moscow \n     Treaty signed in 2002. Consequently, an ``easy'' dividing \n     line is one that would consider all weapons not covered by \n     strategic arms control treaties as nonstrategic nuclear \n     weapons. This report takes this approach when reviewing the \n     history of U.S. and Soviet/Russian nonstrategic nuclear \n     weapons, and in some cases when discussing remaining stocks \n     of nonstrategic nuclear weapons.\n       This definition will not, however, prove sufficient when \n     discussing current and future issues associated with these \n     weapons. Since the early 1990s, the United States and Russia \n     have withdrawn from deployment most of their nonstrategic \n     nuclear weapons and eliminated many of the shorter and \n     medium-range launchers for these weapons (these changes are \n     discussed in more detail below). Nevertheless, both nations \n     maintain roles for these weapons in their national security \n     strategies. Russia has enunciated a national security \n     strategy that allows for the possible use of nuclear weapons \n     in regional contingencies and conflicts near the periphery of \n     Russia. The Bush Administration also stated that the United \n     States would maintain those capabilities in its nuclear \n     arsenal because it might need to counter the capabilities of \n     potential adversaries. The Bush Administration did not, \n     however, identify whether these capabilities would be \n     resident on strategic or nonstrategic nuclear weapons. That \n     distinction will reflect the nature of the target, not the \n     yield or delivery vehicle of the attacking warhead.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Procedurally, so not to come out of either side's time, if \nI can ask: I understand the Senator from Oklahoma wants to propose an \namendment, so I think we would both yield to him for that purpose.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4833\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. Following the \ndisposition of the Risch amendment, we will be scheduling my amendment \nNo. 4833 having to do with verification and numbers of inspections. I \nwill be wanting to speak on this. I don't want to take time from the \nRisch amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set aside the Risch amendment \nfor consideration of amendment No. 4833.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4833.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase the number of Type One and Type Two inspections \n                       allowed under the Treaty)\n\n       In paragraph 2 of section VI of Part V of the Protocol to \n     the New START Treaty, strike ``a total of no more than ten \n     Type One inspections'' and insert ``a total of no more than \n     thirty Type One inspections''.\n       In paragraph 2 of section VII of Part V of the Protocol to \n     the New START Treaty, strike ``a total of no more than eight \n     Type Two inspections'' and insert ``a total of no more than \n     twenty-four Type Two inspections''.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I will consume such time as I use for a moment. Let me say, first of \nall, again, I appreciate this amendment. There is not a lot of \ncontention about the importance of addressing a lot of short-range \ntactical weapons, as we call them. The administration wants to do this \nas much as our friends on the other side of the aisle do, and I think \nthe Senator from Idaho knows that.\n  Let me correct one fact for a minute that both the Senator from Texas \nand the Senator from Idaho said. They said the Russians will not have \nto reduce their strategic warheads and that they are already below the \nnumber of 1,550. That is not accurate. I won't go into detail here. We \ncan reinforce this tomorrow in a classified session. But the Russians \ndo have to reduce warheads under this requirement--not as much as us. \nOur defense community has made the judgment that because of our triad, \nwhich will remain robust, and for other reasons, we have a very \nsignificant advantage. Again, I will discuss that tomorrow in the \nclassified briefing.\n  What I want to say to my colleague is that, again, I am 100 percent \nprepared to try to embrace this concept even further in the resolution \nof ratification. But we cannot do it in a way that requires this treaty \nto go back and be renegotiated. This is not a complicated amendment. \nThere is a very simple reason why we should oppose this amendment as it \nis: because of the requirement that we go back. Because if we don't \npass the START treaty, if we can't reach a bilateral agreement on the \nreduction of strategic weapons, there will be no discussion about \ntactical weapons. That is as plain as day. Every negotiator, everybody \nwho has been part of this process, understands that. If we can't show \nour good faith to reduce and create a mutual verification system for \nstrategic weapons, how are we going to sit in front of them and say, \nOh, by the way, let's get you to reduce what is your advantage--it is \nan advantage, I acknowledge that--you go ahead and reduce it. They are \ngoing to laugh at us and we will have lost all of the verification we \nhave today.\n  It is not just me who says that. The fact is Secretary Gates has been \nvery clear about this, and Secretary Clinton likewise. Secretary Gates \nsaid this. I know my colleagues all respect him enormously.\n\n       We will never get to that step of reductions with the \n     Russians on tactical nukes if this treaty on strategic \n     nuclear weapons is not ratified.\n\n  It is a pretty simple equation, folks. This isn't a one-way street \nwhere we can stand here and say, You have to do this and you have to do \nthat and, by the way, we don't care what you think about what we are \ndoing, we are going to do what we want. That is not the way it works. \nThere has to be some reciprocity in the process of reduction and \nverification and inspection, and so forth. They have things they don't \nwant us to see and we have stuff we don't want them to see. There is \nplenty in this agreement where we protect our facilities from them \nbeing able to intrude on them excessively, because our folks don't want \nthem to. That is the nature of a contentious relationship which is the \nreason you have to argue out, negotiate out a treaty in the first \nplace.\n  If the Secretary of Defense is telling us--a Secretary of Defense, by \nthe way, whom we all mutually respect enormously, but who was appointed \nto the job by President Bush--if he is telling us you have to pass this \nin order to get to the tactical nukes, I think we have to listen to \nthat a little bit.\n  Let me point out--I want the Record to reflect I agree with the \nSenator from Idaho. They have many more tactical nukes. They have had \nfor a long time. The reason is they have different strategic needs. \nThey are in a different part of the world. For a long time, the Warsaw \nPact and NATO were head to head and squared off, and so they saw a \nworld in which they saw the potential of a land invasion. So for a long \ntime they had tanks and mines and other things that were nuclear \ncapable. What happened is we unilaterally, I might add, decided under \nPresident Bush, I think it was, President George Herbert Walker Bush, \nwe decided this is dangerous. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make \nsense for us. So we unilaterally announced--after the fall of the \nSoviet Union, President Bush announced we were going to ratchet down \nour tactical nuclear forces, and everybody agreed with that. It made \nsense.\n  So we did that and what happened is after that, President Boris \nYeltsin in 1992 pledged that the production of warheads for ground-\nlaunched tactical missiles, artillery shells, and mines had stopped. \nThey stopped it because we stopped it. And all of those warheads would \nbe eliminated. He pledged that Russia would dispose of one-half of its \ntactical airborne and surface-to-air warheads as well as one-third of \nits tactical naval warheads. The Russian Defense Ministry said in 2007, \nthe\n\n[[Page S10718]]\n\nground force tactical nuclear warheads had been eliminated. Air defense \ntactical warheads were reduced by 60 percent. Air Force tactical \nwarheads were reduced by 50 percent. Naval tactical warheads were \nreduced by 30 percent. Guess what. That didn't happen with the treaty. \nIt happened because we had what we call Presidential nuclear \ninitiatives. Our President made the decision, President Bush: We don't \nneed them, dangerous, reduce them, and the Russians followed.\n  I heard an estimate earlier of 2,000 or something--this is according \nto the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. We estimate they have a large \ninventory of operational nonstrategic warheads--5,390 is the number of \ntactical warheads, air defense tactical, et cetera. So they do still \nhave more, and it still is a very legitimate concern to us.\n  That is why, I say to my colleagues, in the resolution of advice and \nconsent we have the following declaration:\n\n       (A) The Senate calls upon the President to pursue, \n     following consultation with allies, an agreement with the \n     Russian Federation that would address the disparity between \n     the tactical nuclear weapons stockpiles of the Russian \n     Federation and of the United States and would secure and \n     reduce tactical nuclear weapons in a verifiable manner.\n\n  That is in the resolution. You can vote for that. In addition, we \nsay:\n\n       (B) Recognizing the difficulty the United States has faced \n     in ascertaining with confidence the number of tactical \n     nuclear weapons maintained by the Russian Federation and the \n     security of those weapons, the Senate urges the President to \n     engage the Russian Federation with the objectives of (1) \n     establishing cooperative measures to give each Party to the \n     New START Treaty improved confidence regarding the accurate \n     accounting and security of tactical nuclear weapons \n     maintained by the other Party; and (2) providing United \n     States or other international assistance to help the Russian \n     Federation ensure the accurate accounting and security of its \n     tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n  I am prepared--if that language doesn't satisfy folks, let's go look \nfurther. I am happy to do that. But we are not going to do it in a way \nthat precludes us from going to the very negotiations you want to have. \nIt doesn't make sense, not to mention the fact that it puts the entire \ntreaty back into negotiating play. Who knows how long it would be.\n  The estimates I have from the negotiating team is it could take 2, 3 \nyears. We have been a whole year now without inspections and knowing \nwhat they are doing. I will talk, tomorrow in the security briefing, \nabout the impact that has on our intelligence, and the dissatisfaction \nin the intelligence community with a prolonged and continued delay in \ngetting that.\n  So I simply say to my colleagues, let's do what is smart. Secretary \nClinton said:\n\n       The New START Treaty was always intended to replace START. \n     That was the decision made by the Bush administration.\n\n  I emphasize again that President Obama was not the person who made \nthe decision not to extend START I. The Russians didn't do it \nunilaterally. Neither of us wanted to do it, because under this START \nagreement, we actually put in a better system, and one, let me say, \nthat General Chilton emphasizes reduces the constraints on missile \ndefense.\n  So here is what Secretary Clinton said: ``I would underscore the \nimportance of ratifying the New START Treaty to have any chance of us \nbeginning to have a serious negotiation over tactical nuclear \nweapons.''\n  Some Senators are saying: Why didn't they address them at the same \ntime and say we have to get this and that done? Well, for a couple \nreasons. One, Russia's tactical weapons are primarily a threat to our \nallies in Europe. Knowing the differences of that equation, to have \nlinked our own strategic interests to that negotiation at that time \nwould have left us who knows how long without the capacity to get an \nagreement, No. 1. No. 2, last year when we began negotiations on New \nSTART, NATO was in the midst of working out its new strategic concept. \nOur allies were in the midst of assessing their security needs. It \nwould have been impossible to have that discussion without them having \nmade that assessment and resolved their own security needs and \ndefinitions.\n  But now NATO has completed that strategic concept. We have heard from \na lot of European governments about New START. What do they say and \nwhat do our allies say? We are not in this ball game alone. They are \nunited in support for this treaty, in part because they see it as the \nnecessary first step to be able to have the negotiations that bring the \nreductions in tactical nuclear weapons.\n  Let me quote Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland's Foreign Minister:\n\n       Without a New START Treaty in place, holes will soon appear \n     in the nuclear umbrella that the U.S. provides to Poland and \n     other allies under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, the \n     collective security guarantee for NATO members. Moreover, New \n     START is a necessary stepping stone to future negotiations \n     with Russia about its tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n  So they believe you have to pass START to get to this discussion.\n  This is the Lithuanian Foreign Minister:\n\n       We see this treaty as a prologue, as an entrance to start \n     talks about substrategic weaponry, which is much more \n     endangerous, and it is quite difficult to detect. And we who \n     are living in east Europe especially know this.\n\n  The Secretary General of NATO said:\n\n       We need transparency and reductions of short-range tactical \n     weapons in Europe. This is a key concern for allies. But we \n     cannot address this disparity until the New START Treaty is \n     ratified.\n\n  I don't know how many times you have to make this connection. General \nChilton, who is in charge of our nuclear forces, said this to the Armed \nServices Committee:\n\n       The most proximate threat to the United States, us, are the \n     ICBM and SLBM weapons because they can and are able to target \n     the U.S. homeland and deliver a devastating effect on this \n     country. So we appropriately focused in those areas in this \n     particular treaty for strategic reasons. Tactical nuclear \n     weapons don't provide the proximate threat that the ICBMs and \n     SLBMs do.\n\n  The disparity in U.S. and Russian tactical arsenals, I repeat, we \nwant to address. I am prepared to put something in here--if the Senator \nfrom Idaho thinks we can find the language, as we did with Senator \nDeMint, who has strong language in here about missile defense, let's \nput it in here. But it doesn't put us at a strategic disadvantage.\n  Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen stated, in response to our \nquestions, for the record:\n\n       Because of their limited range and the very different roles \n     played by strategic nuclear forces, the vast majority of \n     Russian tactical nuclear weapons cannot directly influence \n     the strategic nuclear balance between the United States and \n     Russia.\n\n  Donald Rumsfeld said this to the Foreign Relations Committee a few \nyears ago:\n\n     . . . I don't know that we would ever want to have symmetry \n     between the United States and Russia [in tactical nuclear \n     weapons]. Their circumstance is different and their geography \n     is different.\n\n  General Chilton said:\n\n       Under the assumptions of limited range and different roles, \n     Russian tactical nuclear weapons do not directly influence \n     the strategic balance between the U.S. and Russia. Though \n     numerical asymmetry exists in the numbers of tactical nuclear \n     weapons we estimate Russia possesses, when considered within \n     the context of our total capability, and given force levels \n     as structured in New START, this asymmetry is not assessed to \n     substantially affect the strategic stability between the \n     United States and Russia.\n\n  There is more here. I will reserve the balance of time because other \ncolleagues want to say something. First, let me say this about the \nprocess as we go forward. There is some talk that we are now reaching a \npoint--we are on day five--we had Wednesday afternoon, Thursday, \nFriday, Saturday, and now Sunday. That is 5 days. START I took 5 days. \nIf we filed a cloture motion at some point in the evening, for \ninstance, we would still have 2 days before we even vote on that. Then, \npresuming we were to achieve it, we have 30 hours after that, which can \namount to almost 2 days in the Senate. That would mean 9 days, if we go \nthat distance on this treaty, which is simpler than START I. We would \nhave more days on this treaty--simpler than START I--than we had on all \n3--the Moscow Treaty, START II, and START I treaties put together.\n  I hope my colleagues will recognize that the majority leader has \ngiven time to this effort. We are giving time to it. We want \namendments. No amendment, I think, would be struck. We would have time \nto vote on each amendment and deliberate each amendment. But I think it \nis important for us to consider the road ahead.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n\n[[Page S10719]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Risch \namendment. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts just helped \nmake the case as to why this amendment is so important. In every \nhearing we have had in Armed Services and Intelligence, every \nconversation I have had in person, by telephone, with every \nadministration official and everybody in support of this, I raised the \nissue of not what is in the treaty as being the most significant issue \nbut what is not in there--the issue of tactical nuclear weapons.\n  I hear what the Senator is saying. What he has reinforced to me is, \nwe have been talking to the Russians about tactical weapons for over \ntwo decades, and we have not yet been able to get them to sit down at \nthe table with us. If we don't get them now, when? I understand what \nthe President said, which is that he will make a real effort to get \nthem to the table. You should get them to the table when you have \nleverage. The Russians want this treaty bad. We had the opportunity, in \nmy opinion, to discuss tactical weapons with them, to get them to the \ntable for this treaty, but we didn't take the opportunity to do that.\n  So I rise to talk about the issue of tactical nuclear weapons with \nrespect to New START and the two amendments filed on this issue, the \nRisch amendment, as well as one filed by Senator LeMieux.\n  We all know tactical nuclear weapons is one of the issues the treaty \ndoesn't address and also an area where there is a huge disparity \nbetween the United States and the Russians relative to the numbers of \nweapons. Perhaps, most important, the intent of arms control treaties \nis to control and limit arms in order to create predictability and \nsecurity.\n  By not addressing tactical nuclear weapons in this treaty, we have \nleft the least predictable and the least secure weapons in our nuclear \ninventories out of the discussion. Russia has somewhere in the \nneighborhood of 5,000 weapons. There have been numbers bantered around \nhere. But the estimates of exactly how many vary widely. The point is, \nwe don't know. That is part of the real problem with tactical weapons. \nMany of these nuclear weapons are near Eastern Europe and in proximity \nto U.S. troops as well as to our allies.\n  These weapons are different, not primarily in terms of how powerful \nthey are, because the warheads are, in some cases, similar in size to \nstrategic nuclear weapons. Instead, they are different primarily in \nterms of the range of the delivery systems. The Russian advantage in \ntactical nuclear weapons is at least 5 to 1, but could be as high as 10 \nto 1. Again, we don't know because they will not tell us.\n  It is also the case that the United States and Russia both agreed in \nthe 1990s to reduce tactical nukes. The United States has, but we don't \nknow that the Russians have. They said they have. But do we truly trust \nthe Russians? We should not. In fact, they have cited the expansion of \nNATO as a change in the strategic landscape since the 1990's.\n  Tactical weapons are the least secure nuclear weapons in our nuclear \ninventories. They are deliverable by a variety of means, and for these \nreasons are more of a threat of being stolen, misplaced or mishandled \nthan strategic nukes. It is a mistake and unfortunate that this treaty \ndoesn't address tactical nuclear weapons because an agreement to reduce \nand control these weapons is exactly where we need to be focusing and, \nrelative to the overall security of the United States and the world, it \nis, frankly, more important than reducing and controlling strategic \nnuclear weapons.\n  On Senator Risch's amendment, it would add a statement to the \npreamble of the treaty which addresses the interrelationship between \nnonstrategic and strategic offensive arms; that is, the relationship \nbetween strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. Senator Risch's \namendment is correct in that ``as the number of strategic offensive \narms is reduced, this relationship becomes more pronounced and requires \nan even greater need for transparency and accountability, and that the \ndisparity between the Parties' arsenals could undermine predictability \nand stability.''\n  We are reducing strategic nuclear weapons under this treaty. By doing \nso, we are making tactical nuclear weapons much more important and much \nmore relevant and, therefore, we should seek to achieve greater \ntransparency and accountability on both our side as well as on the \nRussian side.\n  That brings me to the second amendment, which is not pending but is \nfiled and of which I am a cosponsor; that is, Senator LeMieux's \namendment. That amendment would require the United States and the \nRussians to enter into negotiations within 1 year of ratification to \naddress the disparity in tactical nuclear weapons. Both these \namendments address what I believe is one of the most crucial issues and \none of the issues the treaty should have addressed but didn't. I urge \nmy colleagues to support both these amendments but particularly today \nthe Risch amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Who yields time?\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, the proponents of the amendment have how \nmuch time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 25 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. RISCH. Does that include my 10 minutes of closing?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does.\n  Mr. RISCH. So we have 15 minutes left to yield time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, Senator Sessions was next, so I yield the \nfloor to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would ask to be advised after 4 \nminutes have lapsed.\n  Mr. President, I think Senator Risch is correct and Senator Chambliss \nis correct to make the point that tactical nuclear weapons are more \navailable for theft and to transship than strategic nuclear weapons, \nand it is a high priority of the United States to reduce the risk of \nterrorists obtaining weapons of this kind, and this treaty does nothing \nabout that. It does nothing about tactical nuclear weapons, which the \nRussians do care about.\n  It is a big part, apparently, of their defense strategy, and they \ngave not one whit on it; whereas our President, who says he wants to \nmove toward zero nuclear weapons in the world--a fantastical view, \nreally, and one that endangers our country and would create instability \naround the world and create more national security risks--did not \nnegotiate this in any effective way. I think that was a failure of the \ntreaty, a failure of negotiations, and another example of the fact that \nwe wanted the treaty too badly for what, I guess, are primarily public \nrelations matters rather than substantive matters. That is just the way \nI see it.\n  So the Russians have been steadily reducing their strategic weapons, \nwe are reducing ours, and this strategic relationship has been moving \nalong. There does not have to be a treaty. We would like to have a \ntreaty. I think the Russians would probably like to have a treaty. But \nit is not essential that we have one if they will not agree to some of \nthe things that are important, such as tactical nuclear weapons. I do \nthink this is a weakness in the treaty, and I am disappointed our \nnegotiators didn't insist on it.\n  As Mr. Feith said, who negotiated with the Russians, and they made a \nnumber of demands on a previous negotiation over the SORT treaty in \n2002: You just have to say no, and then you can move forward once the \nRussians know we are not going to give. But they will push, push, push \nuntil they are satisfied you are not going to give on it, and then they \nwill make a rational decision at that point whether to go forward with \nthe treaty or not go forward with the treaty.\n  He said no on curtailment of missile defense in 2002. The Russians \ninsisted, insisted, insisted, and he said, finally, no treaty.\n  We don't have a treaty with China, we don't have one with England, we \ndon't have one with India, and they have nuclear weapons. We don't have \nto have one. We would like to, but we don't have to. At that point the \nRussians conceded and agreed. So I don't think we negotiated this well \nat all. We do not need to continue with this large disparity of \ntactical weapons between the United States and Russia, and I appreciate \nSenator Risch's raising it.\n  I will perhaps talk a little later about the national missile defense \nquestion in President Obama's letter, but President Obama's letter----\n\n[[Page S10720]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the Senator be willing to yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. On my time or yours?\n  Mr. KERRY. We can share the time. It depends on how long you answer.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am not giving up any of mine. I want to finish this 1 \nminute on the subject of the President's letter.\n  What it fails to acknowledge is that we were on the cusp of \nimplanting a GBI in Europe by 2016, and that was completely given up in \nthe course of these negotiations. This is the same missile we have in \nthe ground in Alaska and California. That was given up, and we are now \nproceeding with a phase four theory that might be completed by 2020, if \nCongress appropriates the money for the next five Congresses and some \nPresident who is then in office--not President Obama 10 years from \nnow--is still supportive and pushes it through and Congress passes it.\n  So this is a big mistake. We made a major concession on national \nmissile defense and even put words in the treaty that compromise our \nability to do the new treaty. The statement from Putin that we will be \nobliged to take action in response did not say just GBI; it also \nreferred to the capabilities of an SM-3 Block IIB, which would be what \nthe President said is going to be deployed in 2020.\n  I thank the Chair, I thank Senator Risch, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, if you will let me know when I have used \n4 of the 5 minutes I am to have.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment by my friend and \ncolleague and next-door neighbor on the Foreign Relations Committee, as \nwell as my next-door neighbor of State, Senator Risch.\n  I want to discuss the issue of nonstrategic nuclear weapons, also \nknown as tactical nuclear weapons. While the United States and Russia \nhave a rough equivalence in their strategic nuclear weapons, there is a \nsignificant imbalance in tactical nuclear weapons, and it favors \nRussia.\n  Russia currently has a 10-to-1 advantage in tactical nuclear weapons, \nand it is expected that the number of tactical nuclear weapons in \nRussia will continue to grow. This imbalance directly impacts our \nsecurity commitments to NATO and to our other European allies.\n  Mr. President, I have been to the hearings in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. As a member of that committee, I have heard statements given \nby former Secretaries of State of both parties. Henry Kissinger \ntestified before the committee and said:\n\n       The large Russian stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons, \n     unmatched by a comparable American deployment, could threaten \n     the ability to undertake extended deterrence.\n\n  Former Secretary James Schlesinger called this imbalance of Russia's \ntactical nuclear weapons ``the dog that did not bark.'' He called it a \n``frustrating, vexatious, and increasingly worrisome issue.''\n  In the past, many current Members of the Senate have expressed their \nconcerns with Russia's tactical nuclear weapons. Even Vice President \nBiden, when he was a Member of this body and serving on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, spoke about it, and he said:\n\n       We were hoping in START III to control tactical nuclear \n     weapons. They are the weapons that are shorter range and are \n     used at shorter distances, referred to as tactical nuclear \n     weapons.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, as I look at this and work through it, it seems \nthat, clearly, this administration did not make tactical weapons a top \narms control and nonproliferation objective in the New START treaty. \nThe negotiators of this treaty did not make this issue a priority, and \nthey gave in to pressure from Russia to exclude the mention of tactical \nnuclear weapons.\n  I want to point out that while the administration failed to negotiate \nthe reduction of Russian tactical nuclear weapons in the New START \ntreaty, it did allow a legally binding limitation of U.S. missile \ndefense, and that is, I believe, a mistake.\n  So I disagree with those who argue that ratifying the New START \ntreaty is needed in order to deal with tactical nuclear weapons in the \nfuture. I believe the issue of tactical nuclear weapons should have \nbeen addressed--together with the reduction of strategic nuclear \nweapons--in the New START treaty. The administration lost a real \nopportunity by not negotiating a deal in this treaty. It is unclear \nwhat leverage will remain for us to negotiate a reduction in Russian \ntactical nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. President, the Risch amendment tries to resolve the complete \nfailure of the administration to address Russia's advantage in tactical \nnuclear weapons in the New START treaty. The Risch amendment \nacknowledges the interrelationship between tactical nuclear weapons and \nstrategic-range weapons, which grows as strategic warheads are reduced. \nThe Risch amendment seeks greater transparency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I thank the Chair.\n  The Risch amendment seeks greater transparency, greater \naccountability of tactical nuclear weapons, and the Risch amendment \nrecognizes that tactical nuclear weapons can undermine stability.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I support this amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I understand we have 4\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining, plus my 10 minutes at the very end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, Senator Corker has indicated he would like \nto take those 4\\1/2\\ minutes, so I yield the floor to Senator Corker.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator, and I appreciate the Chair's \ncourtesy.\n  I think Senator Kerry was down here earlier today talking a little \nabout procedures, and I want to follow up on that. I know we have a \nnumber of people back in the cloakroom wondering about how we go \nforward with the amendment process. So I just thought I could enter \ninto a conversation with him through the Chair.\n  Unlike most procedures, this is a situation where you have a 60-vote \ncloture and your ability or your strength on the issue itself rises \nbecause it actually takes 67 votes, or two-thirds, of those voting to \nactually ratify a treaty. So it is not like on a cloture vote on the \nfloor where you go from a 60-vote threshold to 51, where you are \nweakened. In this case, you are actually strengthened because it takes \nmore votes after cloture to actually pass this piece of legislation.\n  So I just wanted to, if I could, verify with Senator Kerry the \nprocess of actually offering amendments, not just on the treaty--\nbecause I know we are still on the treaty--but also on the resolution \nof ratification, where I think numbers of amendments might actually be \napproved and accepted.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely correct. The key \nquestion is, Is there sufficient support to ratify the treaty? Once we \nget to that sort of question postcloture, when and if that is invoked, \nthat is what the threshold would be for the passage of this treaty. It \nis not as if you have cloture and all of a sudden, boom, only 51 votes \nare necessary to pass it.\n  Secondly, I would say to my colleague--and I want to emphasize this--\nif the majority leader were to put the cloture motion in this evening, \nit doesn't ripen until Tuesday. So we would have the rest of today, all \nof tomorrow, and Tuesday to have amendments; to continue as we are now. \nThen, if it did pass, we would have another 30 hours, which, as we all \nknow, takes the better part of 2 days. So we are looking at Thursday \nunder that kind of schedule, and I know a lot of Senators are hoping \nnot to be here on Thursday.\n  So I think that is quite a lot of time within the context of this. \nBut the Senator is correct. The answer to his question is yes.\n  Mr. CORKER. If I could ask one other question. If a Senator comes to \nthe floor and wants to offer an amendment, not on the treaty itself--\nwhich we realize is more difficult to pass because of what that means \nas relates to negotiations with Russia--but to offer an amendment on \nthe resolution of ratification, which is something that might\n\n[[Page S10721]]\n\nlikely be successful and accepted, it is my understanding all they have \nto do is come down and offer that amendment, to ask unanimous consent \nto call it up; is that correct?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, without the help of the Parliamentarian, \nobviously we are entitled to do a lot by unanimous consent, and that is \none of those things. We will not object, obviously. We want to try to \nhelp our colleagues be able to put those amendments in, so it would be \nwithout objection on our side.\n  Mr. CORKER. So it is my understanding--to be able to talk with other \nSenators who have an interest on the treaty itself and would like to do \nsome things to strengthen it, it is my understanding that what I just \nheard was that the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee would be \nmore than willing to accommodate a unanimous consent request to \nactually offer amendments to the resolution itself, and he knows of no \none on their side, at present, who would object to that. So if people \nwanted to go back and forth between the actual treaty and the \nresolution itself, they now can do that on the floor?\n  Mr. KERRY. That is correct.\n  Mr. CORKER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee.\n  I will yield 5 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Levin, to be followed by 7 minutes to the \nSenator from Oregon.\n  I ask the Senator from Oregon, is that enough time? Is 7 minutes \nenough time?\n  Thank you.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Risch amendment states a concern which \nis a legitimate concern. I think probably everybody would agree to \nthat. This concern was there in the START I treaty and it was there in \nthe Moscow Treaty just a few years ago, that we need to address the \nimbalance or the--the imbalance, I guess, is a good word--between the \nnumber of strategic nuclear weapons that exist on both sides and the \nnonstrategic weapons. But that was true during START I in 1991 when \nPresident Bush negotiated it. There was no effort to, in effect, kill \nthe treaty with an amendment stating that concern, although it was a \nconcern then. During the Moscow Treaty debate here in 2002, I believe \nSenator Biden again raised the same concern about this imbalance. It is \na legitimate concern. But you don't kill a treaty because there are \nsome legitimate concerns about issues.\n  The Russians have a concern about our large number of warehoused \nwarheads. We have a big inventory of warheads compared to them. They \nhave a concern. We could state that as a fact, that the Russians have a \nconcern about the number of warheads we have. But putting that into the \ntreaty kills the treaty.\n  We could make any statement of legitimate concern. If it is in the \ntreaty text, it will kill the treaty.\n  Senator Biden, in 2002, I believe, or it may have even been in the \nfirst START treaty, raised this issue about the imbalance. It was a \nlegitimate issue. But there was no effort to kill that treaty which had \nbeen negotiated by President Bush by inserting a legitimate concern \ninto the treaty.\n  There are a number of legitimate concerns. The Russians have \nlegitimate concerns about our conventional capabilities, about \naccuracy, about our encryption capabilities. They were not addressed \nadequately for the Russians in this treaty. But they have a concern. \nShould we state in the treaty the fact of legitimate concern? Should we \nby amendment attempt to insert in the treaty that the factual statement \nof a legitimate concern just kills the treaty?\n  That is what concerns me as to why it is that there is such a \ndetermination to try to kill this treaty by means of an amendment which \nstates a legitimate concern, which was true during the last two \ntreaties negotiated by two President Bushes. That is what troubles me. \nThat was the difference Senator Corker pointed out between seeking to \namend a resolution and seeking to amend the treaty.\n  To Senator Risch, through the Chair, I happen to share the same \nconcern the Senator has about this imbalance. As chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, this imbalance existed in 2002, it existed in 1991, \nand we ought to address it, but we don't address it by killing this \ntreaty, and that is what this amendment does.\n  Despite the absence of this language expressing a legitimate concern, \nwe have support for this treaty by former President George H.W. Bush \nand Secretaries Brown, Carlucci, Cohen, Perry, and Schlesinger. They \nsupport this treaty without this language. It was true that former \nSecretary Schlesinger said, for instance, that he has a concern about \nthis imbalance. I think we all do. He stated that concern. He still \nsupports the treaty without this language, without this expression of \nconcern.\n  Former Secretaries of the State Albright, Baker, Christopher, \nEagleburger, Kissinger, Powell, Rice, and Shulz support the treaty \nwithout this language. They have the same concerns. As a matter of \nfact, I believe it was Senator Sessions--it may have been someone \nelse--who said that former Secretary Kissinger has expressed this \nconcern, in fact quoted, I believe, from former Secretary Kissinger's \nwriting on this issue. He has that same concern which Senator Risch and \nall of us have about this imbalance. But without the language, former \nSecretary Kissinger still supports this treaty.\n  All I can say is that I think there is a legitimate concern which is \nexpressed in this amendment. It is a concern which has existed and \nneeds to be addressed, as former Senator Biden said when he was \ndebating a treaty--but not to kill a treaty by an expression of a \nlegitimate concern.\n  That is what I think is the issue here--not whether the language in \nthe Risch amendment expresses something which is legitimate but whether \nthe absence of that concern being expressed in the treaty should be \nenough to vote for this amendment and to kill this treaty as a result \nand to force it back to an open-ended negotiation, which we have no \nidea where that would lead.\n  I hope we defeat the Risch amendment not because we disagree with \nwhat the concern is but because, understanding that concern, we do not \nwant to do damage to the treaty and kill a treaty which does so much \nfor the security of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor, and if I have any time, I yield the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I would like to add a few comments to \nthose of the Senator from Michigan.\n  First, I would like to observe that this treaty encompasses fairly \nmodest reductions in our strategic force. We are looking at ICBMs \nreduced from 450 to 420 and in some cases those ICBMs being reduced in \nterms of the number of warheads they are carrying--modest reductions.\n  When we look at some relaunch ballistic missiles, we are looking at a \nfleet of 14 Trident submarines, and we are looking at keeping all 14 of \nthose, reducing the number of silos on each submarine from about 24 to \n20--again, a modest reduction. Indeed, two of those subs will be in \ndrydock at any one point in time, and they do not count against the \nnumbers in this treaty.\n  In bombers, we are looking at 18 Stealth missiles currently--Stealth \nbombers, and keeping all 18--or B-2s, as they are known. We look at \nmodest reductions in our aging, ancient, antique fleet of B-52s, modest \nreductions there.\n  In its entirety, what this represents is modest changes to the \nexisting structure negotiated by a Republican administration and \nmaintenance of verification regimes incredibly important to our \nnational security. In that context, we have to look at various \namendments being raised that, if they were sincere about their purpose, \nwould be added to the resolution we are passing. But if their real \npurpose is to kill the treaty, then of course it comes in the form of \nan amendment to the treaty, which would effectively, in fact, do that.\n\n  So let's look at the structure of the issues that were put forward \nhere.\n  First, the goal of this START treaty is to address strategic, not \nshort-range tactical nuclear weapons which have never been covered by a \ntreaty, including those negotiated by a Republican administration.\n\n[[Page S10722]]\n\n  Second, tactical weapons are categorically different from strategic \narms because they do not pose an immediate catastrophic threat to the \nU.S. homeland that strategic weapons do. With shorter range and smaller \nyield, they are intended for battlefield use.\n  I would note the quotation of General Chilton, commander of the U.S. \nStrategic Command, who said:\n\n       The most proximate threat to the U.S. are the ICBM and SLBM \n     weapons because they can and are able to target the U.S. \n     homeland and deliver a devastating effect to this country.\n\n  So we are appropriately focused in those areas in the particular \ntreaty for strategic reasons. Tactical weapons do not have the \nproximate threat that ICBMs and SLBMs do.\n  I also note that if you look at this from the Russian perspective, we \nhave tactical weapons deployed in Europe. Numerous European nations \nhave tactical weapons which can reach the Soviet--reach the Russian \nFederation, formerly the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, because of our \nsuperiority at sea, the Russian tactical weapons do not represent the \nsame kind of threat to the United States.\n  I then note that we have already addressed this issue in the Senate \nratification resolution, which states that ``the President should \npursue, following consultation with allies, an agreement with the \nRussian Federation that would address the disparity between the \ntactical nuclear weapons stockpiles of the Russian Federation and the \nUnited States and would secure and reduce the tactical nuclear weapons \nin a verifiable manner.'' So it is already in the resolution of \nratification.\n  Then I would note that Secretary Gates and Secretary Clinton said in \na letter:\n\n       We agree with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's call \n     in the resolution of Advice and Consent to ratification of \n     the New START treaty to pursue an agreement with the Russians \n     to address them.\n\n  Tactical weapons represents a thorny issue because it involves the \nEuropean powers and it involves disparities of geography. That it is \nwhy it has been so hard to link them in the past to a strategic nuclear \ntreaty and why they have not done so in this case. But it is the \ncommitment by the Secretary of Defense, by the Secretary of State, by \nthe President, and by this Senate through this resolution of \nratification to pursue this issue that is important, and that is what \nis before us now.\n  In terms of addressing this issue, there are changes that need to be \nmade to the language, to the ratification resolution. That would be \nappropriate. But this treaty, which greatly enhances the security of \nthe United States of America while providing the appropriate \nverification protocols, is absolutely essential.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time do we still have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. Sixteen? And the Senator from Idaho has--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Ten. So somehow we are going past the hour of 3.\n  MR. RISCH. Unless, of course, you want to yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. Do you want to yield some time back?\n  Mr. RISCH. No.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me use a portion of it, and I will reserve a little \nbit at the end.\n  First of all, both Bill Perry, former Defense Secretary Bill Perry, \nand Jim Schlesinger have been mentioned, as well as the Commission on \nwhich they served. Let me make certain that the record is clear about \ntheir position with respect to this treaty.\n  Secretary Perry said the following:\n\n       The focus of this treaty is on deployed warheads and it \n     does not attempt to counter or control nondeployed warheads. \n     This continues in the tradition of prior arms control \n     treaties. I would hope to see nondeployed and tactical \n     systems included in future negotiations, but the absence of \n     these systems should not detract from the merits of this \n     treaty and the further advance in arms control which it \n     represents.\n\n  Jim Schlesinger, from the same Commission, said:\n\n       The ratification of this treaty is obligatory. I wish more \n     of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle were here to \n     hear Jim Schlesinger's comments, but he said ratification is \n     obligatory and the reason it is obligatory is that you really \n     can't get to the discussion you want to have with the \n     Russians about tactical unless you show the good faith to \n     have the strategic and verification reduction structure in \n     place.\n\n  Let me just say, supposing the language of the Senator from Idaho was \nadopted here, would it mean we are reducing tactical nuclear weapons? \nNo. Would it get you any further down the road to be able to reduce \nthem? The answer is, not only would it not do that, it would set back \nthe effort to try to get those reductions because the Russians will not \nengage in that discussion if you can't ratify the treaty, and if they \npass this amendment, this treaty, as Senator Levin said, is dead.\n  It goes back to the Russian Government with a provision that is now \nlinking those weapons in a way that they have not been willing to talk \nabout, even engage in the discussion at this point in time.\n  In fact, we would be setting ourselves backwards if that amendment \nwere to be put into effect. What is ironic about it is, he is amending \na component of the treaty that has no legal, binding impact whatsoever. \nSo not only would they refuse to negotiate, but there is nothing \nlegally binding in the language he would pass that would force them to \nnegotiate. So it is a double setback, if you will. I would simply say \nto my friend on the other side--I talked to him privately about this, \nand I think he is openminded on it--we have language in the resolution \nright now with respect to nuclear weapons. We are not ignoring the \nissue. The language says: The Senate calls on the President following \nconsultation with allies to get an agreement with the Russian \nFederation on tactical nuclear weapons.\n  I am prepared in the resolution of ratification to entertain language \nas a declaration that would also make the Senate's statement clear \nabout how we see those nuclear weapons in terms of their threat. I hope \nthat would address the concerns of many of our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  But the bottom line here is that Senator Risch's language not only \ndoes not make any progress on the topic he is concerned about, it \nactually sets back the capacity to be able to make the progress he \nwants to make.\n  If you want to limit Russia's tactical nuclear weapons, and I do, and \nhe does, and I think all 100 Senators do, then you have to pass the New \nSTART. You have got to approve the New START. If you reject it, you are \nforcing a renegotiation, which never gets you not only to the tactical \nnuclear weapons but which leaves you completely questionable as to \nwhere you are going to go on the strategic nuclear weapons, which means \nthe world is less safe; we have lost our leverage significantly with \nrespect to Iran, North Korea; we have certainly muddied the \nrelationship significantly with respect to Russia; we have ``unpushed'' \nthe restart button; and we have opened who knows what kind of can of \nworms with respect to a whole lot of cooperative efforts that are \nimportant to us now, not the least of which, I might add, is the war in \nAfghanistan, where Russia is currently cooperating with us in providing \na secondary supply route and assisting us in other ways with respect to \nIran.\n  So I say, let's not do something that we know unravels all of these \nparticular components. Anytime you change that resolution of \nratification, it is like pulling, you know, a piece of string on a \nsweater or on a yarn roll and everything starts to unravel as a \nconsequence. One piece undoes another piece undoes another piece. That \nis not where we want to go.\n  I hope, obviously, we will say no to this amendment and proceed. I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, under the UC, I believe I have the last 10 \nminutes. Am I correct on that? I think that was the UC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair believes that is correct.\n  Mr. RISCH. So when I finish, at the conclusion of the 10 minutes, we \nwill vote? Is that my understanding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair believes that is correct. \nCorrection. The Senator from Massachusetts still has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. RISCH. My understanding is he can use that at any time and I get \nthe last 10.\n\n[[Page S10723]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Unless the Senator says something completely outrageous, \nwhich he has managed not to do in the course of the last 3 hours, I \nhave no intention of using the time. But I reserve it to preserve my \nrights. I would be happy to yield it back after the Senator speaks, \ndepending on him.\n  Mr. RISCH. I thank the Senator. I will try not to disappoint in that \nregard.\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember, I think certainly we have had a civil and a good airing of an \nissue that is of considerable concern to, I think, every Member of this \nbody. I am a little disappointed in that we started out acknowledging \nit was a very deep and serious concern to every Member of this body, as \nit was to the commission, in their Report on America's Strategic \nPosture.\n  I felt that along the line a little bit the concern was denigrated. I \nwant to back up on that one more time and say that, in my judgment, and \nin the judgment of members of this commission, the issue of tactical \nweapons exceeds, in severity, in concern, the issue of strategic \nweapons.\n  I understand one might argue that you are arguing about how many \nangels can dance on the head of a pin as opposed to which is of the \nmost concern. But I come back to the reasons I gave as to why I think \nthe tactical issue is important more than the strategic issue. That is, \non the strategic issue, we are in about the same position we were 40 \nyears ago, with the exception, and admittedly an important exception, \nthat the raw numbers are down. When we started this 40 years ago, each \nparty had about 6,000 warheads. As I said, if either party pulled the \ntrigger and launched 6,000 or some significant part of that, obviously \nthat is the deterrence that each party was counting on that neither \nwould do that.\n  Today we are down to--and with all due respect to my good friend from \nMassachusetts, the numbers reported in the press are 1,100 and 2,100. I \nunderstand there is intelligence information that we cannot go into \nhere. But, in any event, I think most people would agree that we have \nthe advantage in numbers from a strategic standpoint.\n  Indeed, if the numbers are even close to that, the--whether it is \n6,000 warheads or 1,000 warheads, when someone pulls the trigger, the \nparty is over for this world. So focusing on the raw numbers, when we \nhave got a 40-year history that we are not going to do that and they \nare not going to do that, and most people agree that neither side is \ninclined to pull the trigger, what are the real concerns?\n  The real concerns are an accidental launch from them, although \nremote, possible, but, more importantly, an intentional launch by a \nrogue nation. Obviously one would look at North Korea or one would look \nat Iran in that regard.\n  In my judgment, the two issues that need to be focused on are the \ndefensive missile issue and the tactical nuclear weapons issue.\n  Let me say I agree with my good friend from Massachusetts and Senator \nLevin, that geography is such that the issue of tactical weapons is \nsubstantially more important on a direct basis to the Russians than it \nis to us. After all, we are insulated by oceans on each side of us to \nthe east and the west, which the Russians do not enjoy, and they have a \nseveral hundred-year history of seeing invasions come by land and \nintermediately, which we do not have.\n  So in that regard I will concede certainly that the tactical issue is \nimportant for them. And the good Senator from Massachusetts makes a \ngood point in that I think they would like to relocate, if they could, \ntheir tactical weapons to be focused more on the Chinese threat and \nperhaps more on the threat from the south, from other countries. We \nought to help them out in that regard by entering into negotiations in \nthat regard on the tactical weapons.\n  But I come back to the tactical weapons are an important issue. \nSenator Levin says they are a concern. Senator Levin says, we should \nnot kill this treaty simply because of a concern, and I agree with \nSenator Levin. I have not, from day one, said we ought to kill this \ntreaty. I have said from day one, everyone has convinced me, and I \nthink virtually everyone else, that we are much better off with a \ntreaty than we are without a treaty.\n\n  I think everyone has worked in good faith in that regard. But, on the \nother hand, having said that, I do not think we should then throw in \nthe towel and say: Well, okay, we will agree to any treaty. That brings \nme to the point of where we are. We are exercising our constitutional \nright that every one of us--not only our right but our duty as a \nSenator, to advise and consent on this treaty and any other treaty that \nis put in front of us, and that is where I have problems.\n  The position we have been put in is these negotiations have gone on, \nthe treaty has been negotiated, it has been signed by the President, \nand it has been put in front of us, and what we are told is, it is a \ntake it or leave it. If you do not vote for this, you are voting to \nkill the treaty.\n  I disagree with that. I think simply because we amend the preamble to \nthis treaty is not a killer. Indeed, my good friend from Massachusetts \nkeeps telling us, the preamble does not mean anything, it is a throw-\naway, the language is a throw-away, it does not mean anything.\n  Well, it does mean something, particularly when it comes to the \ncontext in which you interpret and you react to the treaty. So to \neveryone here, I say, you have the opportunity to set the restart \nbutton with Russia, and we can do it by focusing on what is an \nextremely important issue, which most everyone here agrees is an \nextremely important issue, but nobody ever does anything about it.\n  So let's tell the negotiators: Go back to the table and at least \nagree that the interrelationship between the strategic and tactical \nweapons is an important issue, and we are not going to go on as we have \nover the last 40 years. The times have changed. We trust you are not \ngoing to pull the trigger on us, and you trust that we are not going to \npull the trigger on you. But this issue of tactical weapons where we \nenjoy, if you would, a 10-to-1 disadvantage to the Russians, we have \ntactical weapons that are out there that can be much more easily gotten \nahold of by terrorists than strategic weapons. We have tactical weapons \nthat continue to be designed, continue to be manufactured, and continue \nto be deployed by the other side, in violation of their admittedly \nindividual Presidential initiatives, which needs to be addressed.\n  It is so important that people on this commission said that it should \nbe addressed before strategic weapons. You have the opportunity to put \nthat in here. There is no intent to kill this. It is an intent to make \nit better. We have the right. We have the duty. We must advise and \nconsent. I urge that my colleagues vote in favor of this very good \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Has the time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has slightly less than \na minute left.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say, as I yield back----\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, is the next vote going to be on this \namendment or are the judges going to be voted on first?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The next vote is on the Risch \namendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will yield back the time momentarily. I \nwant to say one thing. The commission report that the Senator refers to \nand has held up, the two principal authors are former Secretary of \nDefense, Bill Perry, who says: The absence of the tactical nuclear \nshould not detract from the merits of this treaty, and he is in favor \nof our ratifying this treaty, and Jim Schlesinger, who was his \ncoauthor, who worked with Republican Presidents as a Secretary of \nDefense, Secretary of Energy, said, ``The ratification of this treaty \nis obligatory.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I say to Senator Kerry, I respect that. I \nwould remind everyone that I filed a letter dated December 17 to \nSenator Kerry and Senator Lugar from six members of the commission, \nincluding James Schlesinger, which says that:\n\n       Dealing with this imbalance is urgent--\n\n  Referring to the tactical weapons--\n\n\n[[Page S10724]]\n\n\n       Dealing with this imbalance is urgent, and, indeed, some \n     Commissioners would give priority to this over taking further \n     steps to reduce the number of operationally deployed \n     strategic nuclear weapons.\n\n  I agree. I thank the good chairman and ranking member for a very good \ndialogue on this particular issue.\n  I yield back my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4839.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire (Mrs. \nShaheen), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter), and the Senator \nfrom Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson), the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Kirk), and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint) would have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are going to come in at 10 in the \nmorning. We will work from 10 until 2 on the START treaty, and then a \nnumber of Senators want to have a closed session. We will do that in \nthe Old Senate Chamber. The Chamber has already been cleared by the \nsecurity folks, so we will start that at 2 o'clock and go as long as \nnecessary. Then we will come back tomorrow evening and continue working \non the START treaty.\n  We have very few things left to do. The Republican leader and I and \nour staffs have worked throughout the morning trying to come up with \nsomething on the CR. We are very close to being able to get that done, \nbut it is not done. So we have the CR to do. The short-term runs out on \nTuesday, so we have to have things done by then. We have this START \ntreaty, and then, of course, we have the 9/11 health bill and the \nmotion to reconsider. Senator Levin has been working on some other \nthings, namely defense, on an agreement to get it done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/19/senate-section/article/S10724-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10724-S10725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF RAYMOND JOSEPH LOHIER, JR., TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT \n                      JUDGE FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the following nomination, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Raymond Joseph \nLohier, Jr., of New York, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nSecond Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield my time to the senior Senator from \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, over the last few days, the Senate has \nfinally begun to vote on judicial nominations that have been waiting on \nthe Executive Calendar for months. There are currently three judicial \nemergency vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \nand the Judiciary Committee has reported qualified nominees to fill \neach one.\n  With the consideration of Ray Lohier's nomination, the Senate will \nfinally fill one of those for the people of Vermont, Connecticut, and \nNew York. For the past 13 years, Mr. Lohier has served as a Federal \nprosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of \nNew York and is currently special counsel to the U.S. attorney. He \npreviously served as the chief and deputy chief of both the Securities \nand Commodities Task Force, which investigates and prosecutes offenses \non Wall Street, and the narcotics unit.\n  He has the strong support of Senator Gillibrand and myself. The \nJudiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination on May 13.\n  I urge confirmation of the nomination.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I am pleased to stand in support of \nRaymond J. Lohier, Jr., who is President Obama's nominee to serve on \nthe U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Ray is a \nhighly talented and accomplished New Yorker, and I applaud President \nObama for this excellent choice.\n  Ray Lohier has dedicated his career to public service and protecting \nthe rule of law. For nearly a decade, Ray has served with distinction \nas an assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, \nwhere he has been successfully involved in some of the Nation's most \nchallenging and complex cases. He has led that office's efforts to \nprosecute securities fraud, commodities fraud, insider trading and \nPonzi schemes. Notably, he served on the team that successfully \nprosecuted Bernard Madoff for a Ponzi scheme that defrauded billions of \ndollars from New Yorkers and individuals across the country. Prior to \nhis service as an assistant U.S. attorney, Ray worked as a senior trial \nattorney in the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of \nJustice.\n  In addition to his impressive professional career, Ray Lohier is \nactively involved in his community, serving on Brooklyn Community Board \n6, where he is currently the first vice chairman and chairman of the \nPublic Safety Committee. While he worked as an attorney in private \npractice in New York, Ray was a member of his firm's pro bono \ncommittee, while also serving the State of New York on the \nGubernatorial Task Force on Judicial Diversity on the Bench and the \nSecond Circuit Task Force on Gender, Racial and Ethnic Fairness in the \nCourt, Subcommittee on Court Appointments. He has also been a member of \nthe National Black Prosecutors Association.\n  Ray is a cum laude graduate of Harvard College and an alumnus of the \nNew York University School of law, where he earned his juris doctorate \nand was awarded the Vanderbilt Medal. He also has served as editor-in-\nchief of the Annual Survey of American law.\n  In addition to all of these outstanding professional and educational \naccomplishments, he has been married for the past 10 years to his wife \nDonna,\n\n[[Page S10725]]\n\na professor at CUNY Law School and former chair of the New York Asian \nWomen's Center. Together they are raising two children, William who is \n8 and John who is 6.\n  I am confident that given his extraordinary background of \nprofessional accomplishment, Ray Lohier will be an excellent addition \nto the U.S. Circuit Court for the Second Circuit. He was unanimously \nsupported by the Judiciary Committee on May 13 of this year, and I urge \nall of my colleagues to support his confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He received his \nundergraduate degree from Jackson State University and his law degree \nfrom the University of Virginia.\n  He has served as a clerk and staff attorney for the Mississippi \nSupreme Court, and as the chief of the Civil Division in the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the Southern District of Mississippi.\n  Mr. Reeves has been actively involved with Mississippi Legal Services \nand other public interest organizations in our State which will serve \nhim well as he takes on this important new responsibility.\n  Mr. President , I am pleased to recommend this nominee for \nconfirmation by the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate will finally vote on the \nnomination of Carlton W. Reeves to fill an emergency vacancy on the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. Currently \na partner in a Jackson, MI, law firm, Mr. Reeves is a former Federal \nprosecutor. Both of his Republican home State Senators, Senator Cochran \nand Senator Wicker, introduced Mr. Reeves at his confirmation hearing, \nand they emphasized his outstanding reputation in the Jackson legal \ncommunity, as well as the bipartisan nature of the Mississippi \ndelegation's support for this fine nominee. The Judiciary Committee \nreported his nomination on August 5 with the support of all but 1 of \nits 19 members. That was more than 4 months ago. Senate consideration \nand confirmation of his nomination has been delayed for months with for \nno good reason. When he is finally confirmed, Mr. Reeves will become \nonly the second African-American Federal district judge in Mississippi. \nHe will fulfill the pledge made by President Bush that went unfilled.\n  After the confirmations today, there remain more than two dozen \nFederal circuit and district court nominations favorably reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee, most of the unanimously, also ready for \nconsideration and a final vote. The practice used to be for the Senate \nto confirm and confirm consensus nominees within days of their being \nfavorably considered by the Judiciary Committee, certainly those \nreported without opposition. No longer. Courtrooms are being kept \nvacant for months and months while justice is, at best, delayed.\n  During the first 2 years of the administration of President George W. \nBush, a Democratic Senate majority proceeded to vote on 100 of his \njudicial nominations. That included controversial circuit court \nnominations reported during the lameduck session in 2002. In contrast, \nduring this first Congress of President Obama's administration, the \nSenate has been allowed to consider just over 50 of the 80 nominations \nfully considered and reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee.\n  I congratulate Mr. Reeves and his family on his confirmation today. \nThis day was a long time coming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  There being no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \nnomination.\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). A motion to reconsider the vote \nto the nomination is considered made and laid upon the table. The \nPresident will be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/19/senate-section/article/S10725-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to clarify this for my colleagues. \nThere are a couple of items, and they will be done quickly in \nlegislative session by unanimous consent. Then we will come right back \nto the procedure we had talked about previously. For the purpose of \nthat consent, in legislative session, I yield to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. In legislative session, I wish to make a \nunanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Banking Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 2919, the Small Business Lending \nEnhancement Act, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; \nthat a Udall of Colorado substitute amendment, which is at the desk, be \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time and passed, and \nthe motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate.\n\n[[Page S10726]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, if I might, for the record, I \nwill talk briefly about the legislation I referred to. This is a \nbipartisan bill. I filed it----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has already been heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Well, there are two motions. I am objecting to the \ndiscussion of the amendment at this time, until we find out how long it \nwill be.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Colorado have 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, the reason I have offered this \nconsent agreement today is that this would help literally hundreds of \nsmall businesses to create hundreds of thousands of jobs at no cost to \nthe American taxpayer.\n  I did want to, in the spirit of bipartisanship, mention the \ncosponsors of the bill: Majority Leader Reid from Nevada, and Senators \nSnowe, Collins, Schumer, Boxer, Brown, Gillibrand, Inouye, Lieberman, \nNelson of Florida, Bennet of Colorado, Sanders, and Wyden.\n  The bill addresses a problem that everybody in the Chamber agrees \nneeds to be addressed, and that is the trouble small businesses are \nhaving accessing capital so they can grow and create jobs.\n  We saw that our unemployment rate inched up to 9.8 percent in \nNovember. That is indicative of the fact that our economy is having \ntrouble gaining traction. We all know that if small businesses expand \nand grow, our economy will be getting back on track.\n  If I might, let me tell you how this bill would help small \nbusinesses. Under current law, credit unions are doing what they can to \nhelp business interests and meet the demands of particularly family \nbusinesses. But they are constrained by an arbitrary cap on the size \nand amount of the loans they can issue. In every State, there are \ncredit unions that would like to lend more, responsibly. But the \nFederal Government gets in the way.\n  This legislation would get the Federal Government out of the way and \nallow credit unions help jumpstart the economy. Under current statute, \ncredit unions are constrained to dedicating no more than 12.25 percent \nof their total assets to small business lending. Many credit unions \nhave run up against that cap. What this legislation would do is take \nthe most experienced and well-run credit unions and allow them to meet \nthe rising demand for small business loans.\n  The National Credit Union Administration, the Federal regulator, \nwould have the authority to allow the small business lending cap to \nslowly increase from the current 12.25 percent limit to a maximum of \n27.5 percent of total assets.\n  Lest you think this has been pulled out of thin air, the proposal has \nthe backing of the Banking Committee, the Treasury Department, and \nNational Credit Union Association. It also has the support of the \nNational Small Business Association, the National Association of \nRealtors, and even the Conservative Americans for Tax Reform thinks \nthis is a good idea.\n  The Credit Union National Association projects that these reforms are \nsensible reforms and would increase small business lending by $10 \nbillion within the first year, with an increase of nearly $200 million \nin my State, and I am sure it would be similar in all States. It is \nexpected to also increase 100,000 jobs nationwide.\n  This is disappointing. It is a shame we can't move this legislation \nforward. We should be helping our economy, but we are embroiled in \nother things here. I will continue to fight for this, and I hope other \nSenators here today will join me in helping unleash the power of credit \nunions and get Americans back to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will yield for a moment for an \nannouncement from the Senator from Montana.\n  (The remarks of Mr. TESTER are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/19/senate-section/article/S10726-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10726-S10730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nTREATY WITH RUSSIA ON MEASURES FOR FURTHER REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF \n                  STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE ARMS--Continued\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with, and that we resume consideration of the \nInhofe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To modify the deployed delivery vehicle limits of the Treaty)\n\n       In section 1(a) of Article II of the Treaty, strike ``700, \n     for deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs, and deployed heavy \n     bombers'' and insert ``720, for deployed ICBMs, deployed \n     SLBMs, and deployed heavy bombers''.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will yield at this moment to the Senator \nfrom Wyoming----\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am trying to get a procedure in place. I \nask my colleague from Oklahoma if it is possible, with my colleague \nfrom South Dakota, to enter into a time agreement. Obviously, we won't \nask colleagues to come and vote tonight. Can we get a time agreement \nand set it aside for a vote at such time that the leadership decides is \nappropriate?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I respond by saying that I will object to \na time agreement at this time. Several people, including the Senator \nfrom Arizona, want to speak on this amendment. That might create a \nproblem because of his activity on this amendment. Let's keep it \nmoving, and I can assure you that I want to get out of here quicker \nthan you do.\n  Mr. KERRY. If that is true, let's go.\n  Mr. INHOFE. At this time, I yield to the Senator from Wyoming on a \nsubject of far greater significance than anything we have been talking \nabout. I yield to the Senator from Wyoming to discuss something.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. It is a \ngreat pleasure for me to be able to make an announcement from the floor \nof the Senate. I ask unanimous consent to share my joy as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Enzi and Mr. Inhofe are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4833\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have another amendment that is up that \nI think is very significant. It is one having to do with verification.\n  I think if we look at all of the problems we are trying to address \nwith amendments--we have been talking about missile defense, which is \nthe one I have been most passionate about; we have been talking about \nother areas, too--in the case of verification, it is very significant \nto understand that this New START treaty has remarkably less \nverification than the START I treaty did. There are only 180 \ninspections over 10 years under New START versus 600 inspections over \n15 years in START I. That is a drop of 40 inspections per year to 18 \ninspections per year.\n  In a minute, I will tell you why I think it is more precipitous than \nthat because of the significance of the inspections as the arsenals are \ndropping\n\n[[Page S10727]]\n\ndown in terms of the percentage of inspections versus the arsenals.\n  The New START treaty inspections to verify the elimination of nuclear \nweapons delivery systems have been fundamentally changed from those in \nSTART I, replaced with a lesser provision of twice a year permitting \nthe other party to view the debris from half of the eliminated first \nstages.\n  In a minute I will break these down, but what I am talking about is \nthat we have a treaty now that addresses two things. Type one is the \nICBM bases, the submarine bases and the air bases. These are delivery \nsystems. I think this has to be talked about as well as the actual \nwarheads. The type two refers to the formerly declared facilities to \nconfirm that such facilities are not being used for purposes \ninconsistent with the treaty.\n  Now, when I say that, we were talking about trying to verify those \nthings that are in existence today but also those that have been \neliminated. In the first START I treaty, we were able to actually \nwitness the destruction of these various warheads and of the systems \nthat are under the consideration of this treaty. As it is now under the \nNew START treaty, we cannot witness it. All we can do is look at the \ndebris that remains after something is destroyed.\n  Now, my concern is this: If you keep the debris around from something \nyou have destroyed, you could use the same debris, as evidenced under \nthe New START treaty, to show you have destroyed something that was \ndestroyed in the past and not addressing those that are still there \ntoday. So in that area, I think this is very difficult.\n  Finally, under the New START treaty, 24 hours of advance notice is \nrequired before an inspection, dramatically increased from the 9 hours \nof advance notice required under old START. Why is this important? This \nis important because as we get down to fewer and fewer inspections that \nwould be made because we are limiting the arms under the treaty, then \nyou should actually have a longer period of time of advance notice of \nthe inspections.\n  So I have an amendment that will correct these inadequacies. The \namendment triples the number of inspections under New START for the two \ntypes of inspections referred to under START I as the type one and type \ntwo inspections. I mentioned the type one and type two, and this would \nactually triple the number of inspections. Type one would increase from \n10 to 30 inspections a year; type two inspections would increase from 8 \nto 24--the total being 54 inspections.\n  On July 20, 2010, the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nPolicy, that is James N. Miller, testified before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee--and I was there--that the Russian cheating or \nbreakout under the treaty would have little effect because of the \nUnited States second-strike strategy nuclear capabilities.\n  I wholeheartedly disagree. The whole idea that we would say the \ncurrent Under Secretary of Defense in the Obama administration--what he \nis doing is admitting the Russians cheat, but he is saying it does not \nmatter.\n  I would say this: The smaller the size of the nuclear arsenal--that \nis what we have today as in New START--the larger impact cheating has \non a strategic nuclear balance. In other words, if you are cheating \nwith a smaller nuclear arsenal, that is much more significant than if \nit were a large one. It is a percentage of a smaller figure. So if it \nis 50 percent of a smaller figure, it would have been 10 percent of the \nlarger figure, of the nuclear arsenals that were there under the \noriginal START treaty.\n  Increasing the number of type one and two inspections is critical to \nNew START verification because the total number of inspections has been \ndramatically reduced in New START from the old START. So as the weapons \ndecreased, inspections should actually increase or be enhanced.\n  Former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown explained this when he said \nwhy this is the case in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee or the original START treaty, and that was in October of \n1991. He said:\n\n       Verification will become even more important as the numbers \n     of strategic nuclear weapons on each side decreases because \n     uncertainties of a given size become a larger percentage of \n     the total force as this occurs.\n\n  That was way back in 1991. Since then you had former Under Secretary \nof State for Arms Control and International Security John Bolton who \nstated this year, on May 3:\n\n       While [verification is] important in any arms control \n     treaty, verification becomes even more important at lower \n     warhead levels.\n\n  They agree, and we are talking about going all the way back to 1997. \nIn 1997, Brent Scowcroft and Arnold Kantor said, in a joint statement:\n\n       Current force levels provide a kind of buffer because they \n     are high enough to be relatively insensitive to imperfect \n     intelligence and modest force changes. . . . As force levels \n     go down, the balance of nuclear power can become increasingly \n     delicate and vulnerable to cheating on arms control limits \n     concerns about ``hidden'' missiles and the actions of nuclear \n     third parties.\n\n  That was 1996. You have 1991, 1997, then present, and, of course, in \nMay of this year in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nformer Secretary of State James Baker summarized that the New START \nverification regime is weaker than its predecessor, testifying to \nCongress that the New START verification program ``does not appear as \nrigorous or extensive as the one that verified the numerous or diverse \ntreaty obligations under START I. This complex part of the treaty is \neven more crucial when fewer deployed nuclear warheads are allowed than \nwere allowed in the past.''\n\n       They all are consistent, agreeing No. 1: Russians cheat \n     and, No. 2, verification becomes more important as the \n     arsenals decreased in size.\n\n  I think we can say Russia has essentially violated every arms control \ntreaty we have had with them in the past. The State Department this \nyear submitted a report on foreign country compliance with their arms \ncontrol measures. This is a report that came out this year, in 2010. \nThey refer to the last report which was 2005. START:\n\n       There is a number of long-standing compliance issues--such \n     as an obstruction to U.S. right to inspect warheads--raised \n     in the START Treaty's Joint Compliance and Inspection \n     Commission that remained unresolved when the treaty expired \n     in December.\n\n  This commission endured the time all the way up to December 2009, in \ndifferent areas. In the biological weapons convention--there are a lot \nof different kinds of weapons of mass destruction. They are not all \nnuclear--biological, chemical, conventional. In the biological weapons \nconvention in 2005, the State Department concluded that ``Russia \nmaintains a mature offensive biological weapons program and its nature \nand status have not changed.''\n  Then, in 2010, the State Department report said: Russian confidence-\nbuilding measure declarations since 1992 have not satisfactorily \ndocumented whether its biological weapons program was terminated.\n  What they are saying is even back in 2005 they say it was inadequate \nbecause they are still continuing, they are violating the accord. This \nis back in 2005, on biological weapons. Then that was renewed in 2010, \nsaying they are still not doing it today. That was biological weapons.\n  On chemical weapons we find the same thing. In 2005 the State \nDepartment assessed that ``Russia was in violation of its Chemical \nWeapons Convention obligations because its declaration was incomplete \nwith respect to declaration of production and development facilities.''\n  In 2010 the State Department again stated that there was an ``absence \nof additional information from Russia, resulting in the United States \nbeing unable to ascertain whether Russia has declared all of its \nchemical weapons stockpile, all chemical weapons production facilities, \nand all of its chemical weapons development facilities.''\n  With biological weapons, they have not complied there; in the \nchemical weapons, they have not complied there; with conventional \nweapons in Europe, the United States notes in the 2010 report that \n``Russia's actions have resulted in noncompliance with its treaty \nobligations.''\n  The Wall Street Journal recently reported, according to U.S. \nofficials, the United States believes Russia has moved short-range \ntactical nuclear warheads to facilities near NATO allies as recently as \nthis spring.\n  I think the Senator from Idaho covered this to some degree. We are \nconcerned about those tactical problems. I guess what we can say is, we \nknow one\n\n[[Page S10728]]\n\nthing and nobody seems to disagree with this: Russia cheats. But there \nare five things to be considered. One is there are fewer inspections \nthan there were under the old one. Second, instead of actually seeing \nthe destruction of these warheads, we depend on the debris that remains \nafter the destruction has taken place.\n  I think everyone understands if we are depending on debris, we can be \nlooking at debris from one destruction effort and they can declare that \nthey have done it three or four times since then, using the same \ndebris.\n  Third is, advance notice is three times longer now. It should be \nshorter now because of more significance. As we get the smaller \nstockpile, we should have a greater compliance requirement.\n  The fourth is weapons decrease--we should be paying more attention to \nthem.\n  No. 5, Russia does cheat.\n  I believe of all the amendments, the amendments on the missile \ndefense are significant. It concerns me that we have something, as I \nsaid on the floor yesterday, and I quoted, several Russians from the \nvery beginning were saying: We don't want the United States--and it is \nthe intent of this treaty--to be able to enhance their missile defense \ntreaties.\n  Right now, I look at this and, as I said several times: This is fine, \nthe treaty, except it is with the wrong people. This treaty is with \nRussia, not with where the threat is--not with North Korea, not with \nIran. That is where the problem is.\n  I have had very strong feelings. I disagreed with taking down the \ntermination of the ground-based system that was to be in Poland because \nour intelligence tells us--it is not even classified--that Iran will \nhave the capability of sending a nuclear warhead and having a delivery \nsystem reaching as far as the eastern part of the United States by \n2015. We, with a ground-based interceptor site in Poland, would have \nhad that opportunity. But now that that site is down, we would be \ndependent, as I showed on a chart yesterday, on a 2-B system that we \ndon't even know--they say maybe it will be done by 2020. We have no \nassurance it will.\n  Look at that: We the United States will be naked in this effort for a \nperiod of time between 2015 and at least 2020. Maybe even longer than \nthat.\n  All these things are important. But this one is equally important \nbecause it does not do any good to have a verification system that is \nas flawed as this system.\n  We will have an opportunity to talk about this in more detail. For \nthat reason it is my understanding, and I assure the Senator from \nMassachusetts that my being unwilling to agree to a time agreement is \nnot--this is not going to shorten it at all. It is my intention to move \non with this as soon as we can get to it. I understand it is pretty \nwell locked in for tomorrow.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I know \nhe is not trying to prolong it. I was just trying to see if we can get \na time certain now, but I am confident we will.\n  I do not know if the Senator from South Dakota----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I apologize. I don't know if the Senator from South Dakota \nis planning to be here? I ask if anybody knows whether he is.\n  Let me speak to the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma for a few \nminutes. I thank him for this amendment on verification. It is an \namendment that will help us to flesh out this question of verification, \nwhich is important to anybody in the Senate. I guess three words that \nhave become famous beyond what people might have thought when they were \nfirst uttered is the pronouncement of President Reagan, ``trust, but \nverify,'' which at the time was accompanied by his articulation of the \nRussian words for that.\n  Obviously, any agreement we would enter into with the Russians, or \nwith anybody, can never rely completely on somebody's word--either \nword--because neither side is going to be satisfied with somebody's \nword with whom they have the necessity of actually having to reach this \nkind of an agreement to reduce weapons that are pointed at each other \nfor lots of different reasons over a long period of time.\n  I assure the Senator from Oklahoma that every Senator on our side--\nand most importantly the unbelievably experienced negotiators who put \nthis treaty together, who made a lifetime of trying to understand these \nkinds of relationships and the ways in which to adequately verify--they \nwould not be standing in front of the country and the world and the \nCongress saying to us this treaty provides better verification in many \nways than we had previously.\n  Tomorrow, in the classified session, we will have an opportunity to \ndig into a little bit of what exactly those ingredients are that fill \nthat out--better. I am not going to go into them all now.\n  But let me talk specifically about the amendment the Senator has \nproposed. He proposes an amendment to the treaty itself, which we all \nunderstand now after two votes, both of which have been to reject a \nchange to the treaty itself because of the implications of changing it. \nThose do not change here with this particular amendment. But let me go \nbeyond that so we, hopefully, could enlist the opposition to this \namendment of some people who will see why it is unnecessary and, in \nfact, conceivably even counterproductive.\n  The Senator wants to increase the number of type one inspections. I \nmight add this concept of a type one inspection and a type two \ninspection is new to the New START treaty. It is new to the process. \nWhat the Senator would like to do is triple the number of inspections \ncurrently set forth in the treaty.\n  The second reason, after the question of why you do not want, for \nthis reason particularly, to amend the treaty, there might be a \ncircumstance where a treaty were so egregious or it presented us with \nsuch a challenge that the Senate might decide to advise and consent, \nand we would all say we ought to send this back. But this does not rise \nto that level, in my judgment, and I think colleagues will share that \nopinion.\n  Let me say why.\n  We can achieve effective verification with the number of inspections \nthat are set forth in the treaty. Admiral Mullen has said we can, the \nStrategic Command says we can, the national intelligence community says \nwe can--the people responsible for verification. This treaty would \nnever have been sent to the Senate if this treaty did not have adequate \nverification measures in it that would allow the intelligence community \nto sign off and say to Senators: Please vote for this treaty.\n  But let's go underneath that and examine it a little bit. That is the \njudgment of our military, the State Department, our intelligence \ncommunity. James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, told \nus we should approve this treaty the earlier, the sooner, the better. I \nthink we need to heed his judgment and the judgment of our military.\n  The Senator expresses the concern that there are fewer inspections \nhere than the original START treaty had. In sort of on-its-face terms, \nthat is a truth. That is a true statement if you simply compared the \ntotal number that existed in START I and you compare the number that \nare set forth in the New START. But that is not what we are comparing.\n  The reason for that is, in 1992, when we approved START I, there were \nfour countries that we were approving inspections for--Belarus, \nKazakhstan, Ukraine, and Russia--because they all had nuclear \nfacilities. There were about 70 sites that we inspected back then in \n1992.\n  But as we all know, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of cold \nwarriors for years and years from the end of World War II until this \nhistoric moment of 1992, the fact is, we were inspecting those 70 sites \nwith a very different relationship and a very different world.\n  Today, the New START agreement only seeks 35 Russian sites to inspect \nbecause Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine no longer have any nuclear \nweapons. Those weapons were consolidated in Russia, and the sites in \nRussia were reduced. So you do not want an apples and oranges \ncomparison here. The comparison of how many fixed number of inspections \nthere were back in 1992 is simply not applicable to what you need in \n2010, given the change of locations, the change of relationship,\n\n[[Page S10729]]\n\nand the numbers of sites where there are nuclear weapons.\n  The comparison is also problematic beyond that because, in fact, \nunder the New START, the inspections we do have, because of the way \nthey have been set up in the type one, type two and the way they have \nbeen laid out, they are actually about two inspections equivalent to \none inspection under START I.\n  Let me explain that. Under the original START treaty, an inspection \nof a missile to see whether it had too many warheads, that inspection \nof a missile was counted as a separate inspection from so-called update \ninspections of the base. In other words, there was an inspection of the \nbase, which might take place because we had been told or learned that \nthere was some change in delivery vehicles or other aspects of the \nbase. So we could go to the base and have an update inspection, and \nthat was counted as a separate inspection from the inspection of a \nmissile that might have been located there.\n  But under the new START, we are allowed to conduct up to ten type one \ninspections a year, and each inspection includes both the counting of \nthe warheads mounted on one missile bomber and the conducting of the \nequivalent of the START I treaty separate update inspection. So you get \ntwo for one--two inspections for one.\n  So you cannot compare these inspections in the way the Senator from \nOklahoma has. Ten type one and eight type two inspections per year, \nunder the New START agreement, is at least comparable to the 15 data \nupdate inspections and 10 reentry vehicle inspections we had under the \nold START. The 10 reentry vehicle inspections per year under New START \nare the same as under the old START. So the truth is, the inspection \nnumbers under New START are comparable to those under the original \nSTART treaty.\n  That is precisely why our military and intelligence officials told us \nthis number would be sufficient to comply, to provide verification \ncompliance with this treaty. As I said, we can discuss more of this in \nthe closed session tomorrow. I wish to remind my colleagues, tripling \nthe number of inspections per year, as the Senator's amendment would \nrequire, is not a freebie. It is not something we can just say to the \nRussians: we are going to triple your inspections. Guess what. They are \ngoing to demand the same number of inspections of us.\n  Our military bases would have to be prepared to host three times as \nmany inspections per year as they are currently preparing for. Frankly, \nthat could certainly disrupt day-to-day operations of strategic forces. \nAnytime the Russians select one of our bases for inspections, we would \nhave to lock down the movements of any treaty items at that base for 24 \nhours before and throughout the inspection, which is at least another \nday. That means dropping everything, stopping any movements of our \ndelivery vehicles, halting any work on these systems, and you have to \nget ready to protect any unrelated classified information that you do \nnot want the Russians to see.\n  So I think it is one thing to ask our strategic nuclear forces to do \nthat 10 times a year or less than once a month. It is another thing for \nthem to be waiting for 30 inspections a year. We have two submarine \nbases, three bomber bases, and three ICBM bases that are going to be \nsubject to type one inspections. If we follow through with those \namendments, frankly, I think our base commanders, not to mention the \nPentagon, would be less than satisfied. Right now, they are comfortable \nwith what we have in this treaty. But far more important, they are \ncomfortable we can verify, which is the key to the ratification of any \ntreaty.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues that the verification provisions in \nthis treaty were developed with the concerns and the perspective of the \nU.S. Department of Defense totally in that mix. They helped guide what \ncame out here. ADM Mike Mullen agreed. Let me quote him: ``The \nverification regimes that exist in the New START treaty is in ways \nbetter than the one that has existed in the past.''\n  Why would we want to challenge that? Why would we want to open now a \nwhole new can of worms of renegotiation when we think what we have is \nbetter than what we had previously?\n  Admiral Mullen also stated he is convinced the verification regime is \nas stringent as it is transparent and borne of more than 15 years of \nlessons learned under the original START treaty.\n  General Chilton has said:\n\n       Without New START, we would rapidly lose some of our \n     insight into Russian strategic nuclear force developments and \n     activities, and our force modernization planning and hedging \n     strategy would be more complex and more costly.\n\n  Let me also quote a letter Secretary Gates sent me this summer about \nwhether Russia could cheat on this treaty in a manner that would be \nmilitarily significant. He said:\n\n       The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint Chiefs \n     Commander, the U.S. Strategic Command, and I, assess that \n     Russia will not be able to achieve militarily significant \n     cheating or breakout under New START due to both the New \n     START verification regime, and the inherent survivability and \n     flexibility of the planned U.S. strategic force structure. \n     Our analysis of the NIE and the potential for Russian \n     cheating or breakout confirms that the treaty's verification \n     regime is effective, and that our national security is \n     stronger with this treaty than without it.\n\n  I mentioned before that Ronald Reagan was one great advocate for this \nkind of verification. So I wish to quote what Condoleezza Rice wrote \nthe other week:\n\n       The New START treaty helpfully reinstates on-site \n     verification of Russian nuclear forces which lapsed with the \n     expiration of the original START treaty last year. Meaningful \n     verification was a significant achievement of Presidents \n     Reagan and George H. W. Bush, and its reinstatement is \n     crucial.\n\n  Finally, I would like to point out that we addressed the importance \nof this verification question in condition 2 of the resolution of \nratification. That condition requires that before New START can enter \ninto force, and every year thereafter, the President has to certify to \nthe Senate that our national technical means, in conjunction with the \nverification activities provided for in the New START treaty, are \nsufficient to ensure the effective monitoring of Russian compliance \nwith provisions of the New START treaty and timely warning of any \nRussian preparation to breakout of the limits. So we are going to \nremain seized of this issue for every year the treaty is in force.\n  So not only could we lose the treaty if this amendment were to pass, \nnot only could we impose unwanted and unneeded requirements on our \nmilitary bases and our military, not only would we not effectively \nincrease the verification because of the advantages that were built \ninto the New START treaty by our negotiators, which have been attested \nto by the very people who need to enforce it, not only that, but we \ncould be without any verification at all for maybe 1 year, 2 years, \nlonger, who knows whether we get any agreement or not.\n  Clearly, that exposes our country in ways I do not think we want to, \nand it certainly is no guarantee of an increase in the inspections \nthemselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me make a couple of comments and \nobservations. I know the Senator from Massachusetts started out by \nsaying we have to take someone's word for it. My concern is, and I \nagree with his statement in reference to quotes that were made by \nRonald Reagan, the ``trust, but verify.''\n  He also said, and when I look at this, I think this is--I think it is \nflawed in all the ways we talked about this before. But I remember the \nstatement actually, I was here, when Reagan came back from Iceland. He \nsaid what Mr. Gorbachev was demanding at Reykjavik was that the United \nStates agree to a new version of the 14-year-old ABM Treaty that the \nSoviet Union had already violated. I told him we don't make those kinds \nof deals in the United States. We prefer no agreement than to bring \nhome a bad agreement to the United States.\n  I think we are--most of us who have questions that were unanswered \nand we want amendments--are those who do not believe this is a good \ntreaty.\n  When the Senator talks about the number of inspections, let's keep in \nmind when we did the first treaty, we were only inspecting new \nfacilities, existing facilities, facilities that could be used, \nwarheads that could be used, looking at the MIRV situation.\n  But now, on this one, we also want to inspect to make sure those \nthings they had agreed to destroy they actually\n\n[[Page S10730]]\n\nhave destroyed. That is why I talked about the debris--rather than \nseeing something destroyed, they look at the debris that is left over.\n  On the argument, on the fact that you talked about the one time in \nKazakhstan and Ukraine. When you look at the vastness of Russia, I \nremember--and one thing the Senator from Massachusetts and I have in \ncommon is we both are aviators. I had occasion--I will share with my \nfriend from Massachusetts--a few years to fly an airplane around the \nworld, replicating the flight of Wiley Post, a very famous Oklahoman.\n  In doing this, I went all the way from Moscow to Provideniya, all the \nway across Siberia. I can remember going from time zone after time zone \nand not seeing anything except vast wilderness and perhaps a few bears \nnow and then.\n  When I think about the areas they have where things can be hidden, \ncompared to any of these other countries, including our own, it is kind \nof a scary thing.\n  I do believe we need to have the opportunity to increase the \ninspections because there is so much more area to inspect. The idea \nthat it is not a freebie--I know it is not. I know anything in this \ntreaty that I would change, such as the number of inspections, would \napply to us as well as them. I understand that. But in that respect, I \ndon't mind doing it because there is one big difference between the \nUnited States and Russia: They cheat and we don't. It is fine with me \nif we have to subject ourselves to a greater number of inspections so \nlong as we can do the same with them.\n  I will stand by the statements made and also the statements that were \ndiscovered in the 2010 Department report which I quoted from having to \ndo with biological weapons, chemical weapons, and conventional forces \nin Europe. I am glad to repeat the quotes, but I don't think I have to. \nIn 2010, the State Department said that Russia's confidence-building \nmeasure declarations since 1992 have not satisfactorily been \ndocumented, whether it is biological weapons or any other program, such \nas chemical weapons. So with the fact that they have not complied as \nthey stated they would in the past--and we are now dealing with that--I \nthink we have to take more precautions, more inspections, more \nverifications, because they have demonstrated clearly that they are not \ntelling the truth, and they have not complied with commitments in the \npast.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will not engage in a long discussion. I \ndon't know if the Senator from Indiana wants to say something.\n  First of all, I am envious of that flight. I would love to have made \nthat. Secondly, as the Senator knows--and I think I will reserve most \nof this for the classified session tomorrow--we have great ability to \nobserve construction in Siberia or any part of Russia and to notice \nchanges of various kinds, notwithstanding the vastness. Yes, there have \nbeen occasions when there have been some misunderstandings or \ndifferences of opinion about enforcement requirements. We have had some \ndifferences on those things. We can again discuss some of those in \nclosed session. But the treaties have worked. The process set up by \nwhich we get into dispute resolution and sort of raise these issues has \nworked. When we notice something they are doing that we think is, in \nfact, not in compliance or likewise when they have with us, we have \ngotten together, and, because of the treaty, we have come into a \ndiscussion, and we have worked those things through.\n  I think our intelligence community's conclusion is that they have \nnever exceeded the limits, though there have been some \nmisunderstandings about sort of the process of getting from one place \nto another with respect to one system or another.\n  Let's have that discussion in a place where we can do it without a \nsense of restraint, but I think it is a good one to have. I look \nforward to continuing that with my colleague.\n  I don't know if the Senator from Indiana has anything he wants to \nadd.\n  Mr. President, I understand the Senator from South Dakota will not be \nhere, so unless there is another Senator seeking recognition or looking \nfor an amendment to be acted on at this point, I yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me make one last comment. I think the Senator from \nMassachusetts is right that we have covered enough of this tonight. \nThere are some things that would be worth going into in a closed \nsession. One thing that doesn't have to be in a closed session is the \nfact that there is a long record of Russians not complying with the \nfirst treaty. I would rather use another word than ``cheating,'' but \nthat is one that everyone understands, and that has characterized \nRussia's behavior in previous treaties.\n  The statement we are making right now, everyone is in agreement that \nthe lower the arsenal becomes, the more significant it is for \ninspections for verification. I think everyone is in agreement with \nthat. That is something that is probably the strongest point of our \nargument.\n  The last thing I will say is just to repeat something I said for \nwhich I was a little bit overwhelmed when I said it. This is the first \nin 51 years that we have missed our wedding anniversary. And what I was \ntrying to say before I got choked up is to my wife at home: I love you \nmore today than I did 51 years ago.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/19/senate-section/article/S10730-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I got an early Christmas present on the day \nit was expected! On Wednesday, December 15, Allison Quinn McGrady was \nborn to my daughter Emily and husband Mike. I have been able to hold \neach grandchild on the day they were born. This baby, Allison, was a \nbit more difficult. I voted in committee and four times on the floor \nand made a mad dash for Dulles Airport. I flew to Denver. I rented a \ncar and drove to Cheyenne, WY. I got to the hospital. It was late \nenough all the desks were shut down. I found my way to the maternity \nward and got help to find the right room and once again got to hold \nanother grandchild on the day she was born. There is no greater feeling \nof wonder and awe and appreciation on this planet than to hold another \ngeneration in my hands. To welcome a new life to this Earth is always \nbreathtaking--but the thrill a grampa feels is indescribable--it is a \nfeeling--it is incredible love and is only known to those who are also \ngrandparents.\n  As I hold her and she tests this new world with eyes that recognize \nlittle, but absorb sights by the moment; as mouth and tongue explore a \nnew atmosphere; as a tiny hand with small fingers opens and closes in a \nnew freedom; I watch changing expressions as tiny ears hear sounds that \nhave been muted before. I now have some instant replay memories of that \nlittle face and a moving hand and all those blankets and the tiny \nstocking cap to hold body heat, locked in my mind. She was 6 pounds \n12.5 ounces and 19 inches long. Oh, to see such a miniature person and \nsuch a huge miracle! The wonder of life!!!\n  My own first child came into the world almost 3 months early. We \ndidn't get to hold her for over 2 months. We could only watch as she \nstruggled for life. and I am often doing little instant replays in my \nmind and thanking God for that and the other opportunities he's given \nme--from finding Diana who became my wife, to learning about prayer \nwith our first child--the daughter who was born premature, who showed \nus how worthwhile fighting for life is--then the birth of our son, then\n\n[[Page S10731]]\n\nthe birth of our youngest daughter, who just had this baby. And to the \nbirth of my grandson, Trey, and then his sister Lilly--both born to son \nBrad and his wife, Danielle--followed closely by Mike and Emily's \nMegan, who just became ``the big sister'' of Allison.\n  The call to let me know I was a grampa again came from 3-year-old \nMegan Riley McGrady, who enthusiastically said, ``I'm a big sister.'' \nGramma wanted the phone to give me some details, but big sister said, \n``No, I'm talking to grampa.''\n  About 6 weeks ago Megan started pointing to her mom's tummy and \nsaying, ``That's my sister Allison.'' They are not sure where Megan \ncame up with the name, but she stuck with the same name all the time--\nand the new baby looked like an Allison, so Mike and Emily named her \nAllison and gave her a good Irish middle name of Quinn.\n  Shortly after our first grandchild was born I found a message on my \nanswer-phone from our youngest daughter who simply said, ``Remember me? \nI used to be the baby of the family!'' So, now, Diana's and my youngest \nchild, the ``baby of the family'' has had another baby! Emily and her \nhusband, Mike McGrady met at the University of Wyoming. Mike \nfortunately broke his family's Florida University Gator tradition to \ncome to the University of Wyoming, but it was part of God's plan. Emily \nand Mike fell in love and got married. Emily worked for the university \nwhile Mike went to law school. He clerked for Federal Circuit Judge \nTerry O'brien and now works in a private practice. Three years ago they \ncalled to ask what we were planning for Memorial Day and suggested we \nmight want to be near them for the birth of a grandchild. The Senate \nwas on recess and we were nearby. We were in Wyoming when each of the \nother two grandchildren were born. This time I wasn't so lucky. I was a \nnation away, but got back to hold Allison that first day too.\n  I ask to be called Grampa! That is not Grandfather--that would be too \nstilted for me. The name is also not Grandpa. That's a great title, but \nstill too elevated. Grampa is spelled with an M and no D--Grampa. My \ngrampa was a most memorable person to me. My Grampa Bradley took me on \nsome wonderful adventures. He taught me a lot--fishing, hunting, and \nwork. He believed in work. When I was 4, he ``let'' me help him plant \nand water trees. He showed me how to chop sagebrush and make flagstone \nwalks. He covered up holes he encouraged me to dig--he covered them so \npeople wouldn't drive a car into them. That was when I was 7. Later he \ntaught me how to spade a garden and mow and trim a lawn ``properly.'' \nWhen I was a teenager, he even showed me the point in life when you are \nsupposed to start carrying ``the heavy end of the log.'' He liked to be \ncalled Grampa--and I am now delighted to have the opportunity to earn \nthat name. In my opinion, Grampa is the greatest title anyone can have! \nAnd I wish I could adequately share with you the joy in my heart!\n  Allison, I want to pass on to you your Great Gramma's admonition: \n``Do what is right. Do your best. Treat others as they want to be \ntreated.'' I use that guideline every day and expect everyone on my \nstaff to measure legislation and case work requests by it too. Now, \nbecause of you and Trey and Lilly and Megan, I have an additional \nmeasure for myself. I don't ever want my grandkids to say, ``My Grampa \ncould have fixed that, but he didn't.''\n  Allison, I hope I am around to see a lot more of you, to listen to \nyou, to watch as you discover, learn, play, and grow--to get to know \nyou--and especially to visit with you, to hear your dreams, your ideas, \nyour puzzlements, to comfort you through difficulties, and to encourage \nyou in whatever you try. But in case I am not around I have a few \nthings to pass on to you that I hope you will remember and, hopefully, \npass on to your children.\n  Be proud of your reputation. That is really all you have that is \nreally yours--although you borrow part of it from those who went \nbefore--and you have a debt to those who follow.\n  Learn from the mistakes you make, but, more importantly, learn from \nthe mistakes of others. You don't have time to make them all yourself, \nand it will save you a lot of grief. When you see something wrong say, \n``I hope I never do that!'' and file away a plan to avoid it. And don't \ndo anything you wouldn't want to read about on the front page of the \nnewspaper.\n  Learn everything you can. Read everything you can. See everything you \ncan. Listen for new ideas. Watch for things you can change. Everything \ncan be improved ideas and thoughts as well as things. So while you are \nat it, invent something that will improve the world or that will help \nthose around you.\n  The most important decision you will make in your life is marriage. \nMy hope is that you will find someone who can be your best friend--\nsomeone you miss when away and enjoy waking up with every morning, \nsomeone different enough to cover your weaknesses and strong enough to \nrely on you for your strengths, someone who shares your faith and \nsomeone mutually faithful.\n  Finally and most importantly, find faith in God. There will be times \nthat will try you. With faith you can pray for help through the \nsuffering, and with faith, God will always answer that prayer. No \nmatter what you may have done, or what may have happened to you or to \nsomeone you love, there is always a way through the crisis. Don't try \nto live life on your own strength. No one has ever been that strong.\n  I thank God for helping me through open heart surgery 15 years ago so \nI might have this chance to hold you in my hands. I think of the Prayer \nof Jabez in Chronicles where he says, ``Lord, please continue to bless \nme, indeed,'' and to that I add my thanks for all the blessings, \nnoticed and unnoticed, but especially for this new life.\n  Allison Quinn McGrady, Granddaughter, welcome to this world of \npromise and hope and faith and love! I am excited to have you in our \nlives!!\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for a \ngrounding moment in the Senate. We are enormously appreciative of his \nwords.\n  I especially know what he was saying because my wife and I had the \npleasure of welcoming a young grandchild about a month ago. As the \nSenator was standing there speaking, I couldn't help but think this is \nthe son of Christopher Heinz, who was Jack Heinz's youngest, and the \nchild is called Jack--Little Jack.\n  So I think you gave us a good reminder, and I thank you.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Before my friend from Wyoming leaves the floor, let me \njust say I can identify with the things he has said, and to prove it, \nlet me put this up here. These are my 20 kids and grandkids. While \nmaybe he has his name they have given him, my name is PopI. The I is \nfor Inhofe, so it is MomI and PopI. Is that OK? That is what all these \nkids call me.\n  As I was listening to the great words my colleague was sharing for \nhis grandchildren and their lives, I would like to ask unanimous \nconsent those same words go to each one of these little grandkids up \nhere. As you mentioned one after another of your experiences, I \nremember this little girl here, she was one of them for me. She was \nonly 4 pounds and you could hold her with one hand. The same thing was \ntrue with this one over here.\n  So when I look at this, I get very excited. It is what is important. \nWe talk about a lot of things around here, but this is what is \nimportant. One of the criticisms I have had in considering this thing \nis hearing: I want to get back during this Christmas season--and I \nthink most of the others do too--and want to be with them.\n  This little girl right here, she is my wife. Today is our 51st \nwedding anniversary. So I just want to say that some things are \nimportant, and I want to deliver my message to my wife who is back in \nOklahoma--where she should be with all the rest of these kids--but, \nKay, I love you as much today as I did 51 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/19/senate-section/article/S10731-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10731-S10732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CARROLL COLLEGE FIGHTING SAINTS\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the Carroll \nCollege Fighting Saints--a tough-as-nails football team from Helena, \nMT, that won the NAIA championship last night.\n\n[[Page S10732]]\n\n  It was one of those Saturday night games football fans live for. And \nbefore I say more about the Saints, I want to extend my congratulations \nto the University of Sioux Falls Cougars, which put up a heck of a \nfight, after a heck of a season.\n  But with last night's win, Carroll held a perfect season. They were \nundefeated every step of the way. And every step of the way, Montanans \nwatched with pride as they showed us what it takes to work as a team. \nAnd to win.\n  Carroll's Fighting Saints are no stranger to making football history. \nThis isn't the first year they have returned to Montana with a national \ntrophy.\n  What does it take?\n  It takes hard work. Strong leadership--especially under Coach Mike \nVan Diest--and old-fashioned Montana grit.\n  Most importantly, it takes teamwork and trust. Place kicker Tom \nYarekmo missed two field goals. But Coach Van Diest trusted Yarekmo to \ntry again--and he made the winning field goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the \nteam, the coaches and a whole lot of dedicated fans.\n  Their hard work and their victory is a warm reminder that hard work \npays off.\n  We're already looking forward to next year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/19/senate-section/article/S10732-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTE EXPLANATIONS\n\n\n                              Vote No. 278\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN, Mr. President, had I been present on Saturday, December \n18, I would have voted nay on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nDevelopment, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors DREAM Act:\n  ``While sympathetic to those who passionately support it, I cannot \nsupport the DREAM Act; as is, at this time.\n  ``I strongly believe the DREAM Act should require the completion of a \ndegree.

Mr. President, earlier this week, Republican Members who \nhad pledged to support the fiscal year 2011 Omnibus appropriations bill \nchanged their minds and chose instead to walk in lockstep with the \nHouse and Senate Republican leaders who believe that freezing spending \nat the fiscal year 2010 level is good politics.\n  On the face of it that approach has an appeal to it--no new spending. \nWhat a nice sound bite. It makes everything seem so simple.\n  But while one Senator of the minority party gleefully remarked on the \nSenate floor ``we won,'' it is worth taking a minute to consider what a \ncontinuing resolution means--not for the Republican Party but for the \nAmerican people.\n  That it is a short-sighted abdication of Congress's responsibility \nover Federal funding almost goes without saying. But in fact it is \nworse than that.\n  The Senators who profess to care about the security of this country \nbut refuse to put their money where their mouth is, bear responsibility \nfor the consequences.\n  Every American family--yours and mine--knows that in a year's time \nour budget priorities and the necessities of our families change from \nthe year before. So do the budget priorities of a diverse country of \nmore than 300 million people in a rapidly changing and dangerous world.\n  Those who celebrated after defeating the Omnibus--a bill that is \nsupported by a majority of Senators--are implicitly promoting the myth \nthat priorities and circumstances do not change from one year to the \nnext.\n  They would substitute the mindlessness of a copy machine for the \njudgment that the American people pay their representatives to use in \nmaking these decisions.\n  A robo budget is a disservice to the American people, to our national \nsecurity, and to this Nation's needs and interests here at home. Yet \nthat is the option we are left with.\n  What is our job here? Is it to rubberstamp what we did last year, \ndespite different circumstances and the passage of a year's time? I \nwon't speak for the chairs of the other Appropriations subcommittees.\n  They know the consequences of a continuing resolution for the \nprograms in their jurisdictions better than I.\n  But as chairman of the Department of State and Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, I can say unequivocally that freezing spending for global \nsecurity programs--as we are about to do--will shortchange the American \npeople--this generation and future generations, compromise the security \nof this country, and cost the lives of countless people in the world's \npoorest countries.\n  Contrary to what some of our friends in the minority seem not to \nfully appreciate, the United States is a global power. We have vital \ninterests around the world, from the Korean Peninsula to Mexico, that \nare important to the lives and livelihoods of every American.\n  We are involved in two wars, with over 150,000 troops deployed in \nharm's way--wars that will not be won by military force alone.\n  Our economy is tied to the economies of countries far and wide. Our \nsecurity depends on what happens thousands of miles from our shores, as \nmuch as it does at our borders.\n  Americans are traveling, working, studying and living in every \ncountry on Earth. We have diplomats and military personnel stationed on \nevery continent.\n  Our environment, the health of our citizens, the security of our \nborders, and relations with our allies as well as our adversaries, are \nnot static. Time does not stand still. It marches on, either with us or \nwithout us.\n  What the other party is saying is that while China and our other \ncompetitors aggressively expand their influence, the United States will \npull back. While other countries become global markets, we will freeze \nour export promotion programs.\n  While international terrorism, trans-national crime and corruption \nthreaten American businesses and fragile democracies, including in our \nown hemisphere, we will retrench.\n  That is the vision of the minority. It is myopic. It is self-\ndefeating. It pretends to help solve the deficit, when in fact it will \nhave virtually no impact on the deficit. But it will weaken our \ninfluence around the world.\n\n[[Page S10733]]\n\n  In contrast, the Omnibus appropriations bill that was abandoned 3 \nnights ago would have cut spending below the President's budget request \nby some $29 billion, as our Republican friends insisted just a few \nshort months ago. Then they moved the goal posts.\n  And 3 nights ago they walked off the playing field altogether, when \nthose who said they would support it changed their minds--or had their \nminds changed for them.\n  The Omnibus would have cut the budget for the Department of State and \nForeign Operations by $3.2 billion below the President's request.\n  The funding for the Department of State and Foreign Operations, which \nrepresents 1 percent of the Federal budget--1 percent--is a far cry \nfrom what we should be allocating to protect America's interests.\n  Fifty years from now I suspect our grandchildren or great-\ngrandchildren will look back and wonder why we were so penny wise and \npound foolish, when so much was at stake.\n  But if one asks which would be better for our national security, a \ncontinuing resolution or the Omnibus; or which would be better for \nprotecting America's interests in the global economy; or which would be \nbetter for strengthening our alliances and improving our image around \nthe world? There is no comparison.\n  Let me cite a few examples.\n  The Omnibus would have funded global health programs, including \nvaccines and nutrition for children, maternal health, and programs to \nprevent or treat infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, West Nile, the \nAsian Flu, and drug-resistant tuberculosis.\n  These and as yet unknown viruses can become raging pandemics \novernight. They can spread across the globe to our shores with the ease \nof an airplane flight.\n  The other party may not want to talk about cutting these programs. \nBut when there is an outbreak of a deadly disease like the Asian flu \nthat could endanger the lives of millions of Americans, we can predict \nthey will demand to know what the State Department is doing about it.\n  It won't matter that they just cut the budget for disease \nsurveillance and prevention.\n  At a time when there are more than 7,000 new HIV infections each day, \na continuing resolution will reduce the U.S. contribution to the Global \nHIV/AIDS fund by $75 million. That will almost certainly cause other \ndonors to reduce their contributions too. Millions of people who need \ndrugs to stay alive, won't get them.\n  The Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund, which is a \ncornerstone of our partnership with the Pakistani Armed Forces in \nfighting al-Qaida, will be cut by $300 million in a continuing \nresolution. It makes no sense.\n  A continuing resolution will cut funding by more than $700 million \nfor agriculture and food security programs, small business development, \nclean water, energy, basic education, trade capacity, and other \npriorities of both Democrats and Republicans, as well as of American \nbusinesses, universities, and other organizations that implement these \nprograms.\n  There are thousands of American diplomats stationed in almost every \ncountry of the world, assisting American citizens and businesses, \ndefending our interests and our security. They risk their lives in \ncountries where Americans are targeted, and many have lost their lives \nin the line of duty.\n  A continuing resolution will provide half a billion dollars less than \nthe Omnibus would have for the State Department's overseas operations, \nincluding for Afghanistan and Pakistan, requiring cuts to personnel, \ninformation technology, and public diplomacy programs that counter \nextremist propaganda and other misinformation about the United States.\n  How, in the world, does that make sense? Will anyone advocating this \nrecklessness come forward to explain it to the American people? \nApparently not. Better to declare ``we won,'' and hope the public never \nfinds out that they lost.\n  A continuing resolution will cut funding for U.S. Embassy security, \nconstruction, and maintenance programs, delaying the completion of new \nfacilities to replace the most vulnerable embassies in some of the most \ndangerous locations.\n  Security costs money, but the minority will cut these programs. Any \ndelay in the completion of these facilities will extend the risks to \nAmerican diplomats, consular officers, and other personnel overseas.\n  A continuing resolution will cut funding for educational and cultural \nexchange programs--programs that Republicans have claimed to strongly \nsupport. That means thousands fewer participants in exchange programs, \nincluding those from Muslim-majority countries and Muslim communities \nworldwide, and a corresponding retreat for our national security \ninterests.\n  A continuing resolution will cut hundreds of millions of dollars for \nclean technology and other programs to reduce global warming. Whatever \none may think about climate change, 95 percent of new births are \noccurring in the world's poorest countries, where the demand for energy \nis exploding. The environmental consequences of this exponential growth \nin energy consumption are staggering, and we ignore it at our peril.\n  There are dozens of other examples, but the point is simple. The \nother party may think this is good politics at home, but it represents \na dereliction of duty.\n  It will have no appreciable impact on the deficit. In fact, over \ntime, it is just as likely to cost the taxpayers more. But most \nimportant, the Omnibus, while billions of dollars below the President's \nbudget request, would have at least enabled us to not lose ground.\n  We would have at least been able to respond to new threats as they \ndevelop.\n  We would have at least been able to continue the effort started by \nformer Secretary of State Colin Powell, and strongly supported by \nSecretary of Defense Gates, to build the diplomatic corps we need.\n  We would have at least been able to compete in new and emerging \nexport markets. We would have at least been able to maintain programs \nwith Mexico and Pakistan, transfer responsibility in Iraq from the \nDepartment of Defense to the Department of State, support public \ndiplomacy and exchange programs with countries where large majorities \nhave hostile and distorted opinions of the United States, and continue \ninitiatives that are strongly supported by both Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  That is the choice. It is not theoretical; it has very real \nconsequences. It should not be a political or partisan choice.\n  Senator Gregg and I worked hand in hand to write our portion of the \nOmnibus within the allocation we were given, an allocation that was \n$3.2 billion below the President's budget request.\n  I am not among those who believe the Congress should hand over our \nresponsibility for the budget to an unelected, unaccountable \nbureaucracy, but there were no earmarks in our portion of the Omnibus. \nThat has been the practice of our subcommittee for many years.\n  The minority has elevated hypocrisy to a new level over the issue of \nearmarks. There are earmarks I have felt were a waste of money. Many of \nthem were Republican earmarks. Other earmarks, by both parties, have \nbeen enormously beneficial to the people of our States.\n  Less than 1 percent of the Omnibus appropriations bill consisted of \nearmarks--many of them requested by Republicans. Many of them would \nhave improved the lives of their constituents.\n  But to score cheap political points those same Republicans who took \ncredit for earmarks, now want the American people to believe that \neliminating a few billion dollars in earmarks will fix the deficit.\n  And so they would hand to the administration total discretion to \nearmark every dollar of the budget. There will come a time, I predict, \nwhen they will regret having done so.\n  I want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nInouye, for the herculean efforts he made this year--first to get 12 \nindividual appropriations bills reported by the Committee, and then to \ntry to get the Omnibus passed.\n  He did everything humanly possible, right up to the bitter end. But \nwhen those who had pledged their support walked away, there was nothing \nmore he could have done. As he has said, this is no way to run a \ngovernment.\n  I also want to thank Senator Gregg, who is retiring this year, for \nthe many\n\n[[Page S10734]]\n\nyears he has served on the Appropriations Committee, and as ranking \nmember of the Department of State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee.\n  It has been a pleasure working with him. He cares about these \nprograms, he supports the people who serve in our embassies, he \nunderstands what is at stake for our country, he asks important \nquestions, and he insists on accountability for the use of funds.\n  Contrary to what some might think or guess, there were not many times \nwhen Senator Gregg, a conservative Republican Senator, and I, a liberal \nDemocratic Senator, disagreed over the need to find the funds to \nsupport these programs. We will miss him greatly.\n  One year ago, 37 Senators--Democrats and Republicans--wrote to the \nchairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee urging full \nfunding of the President's budget request for the Department of State \nand Foreign Operations. The funding in the Omnibus was $3.2 billion \nbelow that amount.\n  Rather than voting for a sound bite, Senators should consider the \nconsequences. The consequences are unmistakable.\n  A continuing resolution says whatever was OK last year is OK this \nyear. I understand that is where we are. Even though a majority of the \nSenate would support the Omnibus, the minority party has made it \nimpossible to pass anything without 60 votes.\n  It is no way to govern, and when it involves issues of national \nsecurity, it is foolhardy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/19/senate-section/article/S10734-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10734-S10736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                             Arlen Specter\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak today to recognize the \ndeparture of my good friend, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania. \nSenator Arlen Specter has been present here in the Senate through some \nof its most contentious times. He and I have worked side-by-side--\nsometimes in agreement, other times in opposition--for many years. His \npresence will be sorely missed.\n  Arlen is the son of immigrant parents. He was born in Wichita, KS, in \n1930 to Lillie Shannin and Harry Specter. Harry served in World War I \nin the U.S. infantry, just a few years after migrating to the U.S. from \nRussia. While in combat in France, Arlen's father was seriously \nwounded. Yet a few years later, the Federal Government, strapped for \nfunds, broke its promise to pay World War I veterans a bonus. This, of \ncourse, led to a veterans march on Washington and a tragic encounter \nbetween the U.S. Army and the protesting veterans. It also led, \nindirectly, to Senator Specter's career in public service as he has \nbeen fond of saying that he came to Washington to get his father's \nbonus and that he would run for reelection until he got it.\n  Arlen attended college at both the University of Oklahoma and the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, graduating from the latter in 1951. He \nserved in the Air Force during the Korean war as an officer in the \nOffice of Special Investigations. In 1953, he married Joan Levy, with \nwhom he has raised two sons and four grandchildren. In 1956, he \ngraduated from Yale law school and entered into private practice.\n  Senator Specter's career in public service began in 1959 when he \nbecame an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia. In 1963, he was \nappointed to serve as assistant counsel on the Warren Commission, \ninvestigating the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Two years \nlater, he was elected to serve as the district attorney for the city of \nPhiladelphia, a position he held for 8 years. After another brief stint \nin the private sector, Arlen was elected to the Senate in 1980 and has \nbeen the longest serving Senator in Pennsylvania's history.\n  Arlen has had his hand in a number of high-profile efforts here in \nthe Senate. However, I will always remember him for his role in some of \nthe most contentious Supreme Court confirmation fights in our Nation's \nhistory. He and I both served on the Judiciary Committee during the \nconfirmation hearings for Judge Robert Bork, which were, at the time, \nthe most contentious in our Nation's history. In the end, Arlen and I \nreached different conclusions as to whether Judge Bork should have been \nconfirmed. I still think Arlen was wrong to oppose Judge Bork, but, I \nhave never doubted that his decision to do so was sincere.\n  Arlen and I once again found ourselves at the center of a Supreme \nCourt fight during the nomination hearings for Justice Clarence Thomas. \nDuring those hearings, Senator Specter had the daunting task of \nquestioning Ms. Anita Hill for the Republican side. I was and continue \nto be impressed with the manner in which he handled that \nresponsibility. Those were difficult, sensitive issues. None of us \nwanted to disrespect Ms. Hill, but we believed it was important to \nensure that the truth be examined and brought to light, and I've always \nthought that Arlen handled the matter with the necessary \nprofessionalism and respect.\n  In the years that followed the Thomas hearings, a number of people \nexpressed their displeasure for the way I treated Ms. Hill during those \nhearings. I was always quick to remind them that it was Arlen who \nquestioned her, not me. I was the one who questioned Justice Thomas. \nBut, in the end, I think the historical memory of that time has tied \nthe two of us together.\n  Senator Specter has a reputation for being a fighter. And, having \nbeen on both sides of the debate with Arlen, I have to concur with that \nassessment. His was among the sharpest minds we have known here in the \nSenate and I am grateful for the privilege I've had to serve alongside \nhim.\n  I want to wish Arlen and his family the best of luck.\n\n\n                             Sam Brownback\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak in honor of my good friend, the \nsenior Senator from Kansas. Senator Sam Brownback has been a devoted \npublic servant and a friend to all of us here in the Senate. And, at \nthe end of this session, he will be moving on to bigger and better \nthings. I will miss him dearly.\n  Senator Brownback was born in Parker, KS, in 1956. He was raised on a \nfarm--a farm on which his parents still live to this day. Sam was \nleader in all aspects of his life before coming to the Senate. In high \nschool, he was the State president of the Future Farmers of America. \nWhile attending college at Kansas State University, he was student body \npresident. And, he was president of his class when he attended law \nschool at the University of Kansas.\n  After law school, Sam went to work as an attorney in Manhattan, KS. \nIn 1986, he was the youngest person ever appointed to serve as the \nKansas Secretary of Agriculture. In 1990, he went to work in the White \nHouse of President George H.W. Bush as a White House fellow. After \nanother stint as Kansas's Secretary of Agriculture, Sam was elected to \nthe House of Representatives as part of the 1994 Republican revolution. \nAnd, in 1996, he was elected to replace the former Senate majority \nleader, and my good friend, Senator Bob Dole. The people of Kansas have \nkept him here ever since.\n  Looking over his career in public service, it is clear that Sam \nBrownback is Kansas man in every sense. The voters of Kansas have \nrecognized this more than anyone else. That is why they have elected \nhim three times to serve in the Senate. And, of course, that is why he \nis currently the State's Governor-elect.\n  Throughout his time in the Senate, Sam has been a tireless advocate \nfor the rights of those who have no voice, whether it is the rights of \nthe unborn, the rights of refugees, or the rights of the victims of \nhuman trafficking. I believe this is due, in no small part, to Sam's \nreligious faith. For as long as I have known him, Sam has never been \nafraid to speak publicly about his religious convictions and his belief \nthat those convictions required action on his part. As a religious man \nmyself, I have always admired that part of Senator Brownback's \npersonality and found his openness refreshing.\n  Over the years, Sam and I have typically found ourselves in agreement \non most issues. We have worked together on numerous occasions. While I \nregret that we won't be working together any more after this session, I \nwant to congratulate him once again on his recent victory in the Kansas \ngubernatorial election. I am confident that he will be an effective and \npopular governor for the people of the State he loves so much.\n\n\n                                Kit Bond\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak in honor of my good friend \nSenator Kit\n\n[[Page S10735]]\n\nBond. Senator Bond has represented the people of Missouri in the U.S. \nSenate for the last 24 years, and, at the end of this session, he will \ndepart for greener pastures. I think I speak for all of my colleagues \nwhen I say that his presence will be missed.\n  Kit was born in St. Louis, MO, in 1939. He is a sixth generation \nMissourian and, after knowing Senator Bond for many years, I know that \nthe people of Missouri have never been far from his thoughts. As a \nyoung man, he left Missouri for a short time to attend college at \nPrinceton University and law school at the University of Virginia, \nwhere he graduated first in his class. After law school, he served as a \nlaw clerk for the Fifth Circuit Court of appeals before going to \nWashington, DC, to practice law with the renowned law firm Covington & \nBurling.\n  Senator Bond returned home to Missouri in 1967 to begin a long career \nin public service. After losing a brutally close congressional election \nin 1968, Kit went to work for the Missouri attorney general's office, \nserving under the great former Senator John Danforth. In 1970, Kit was \nelected Missouri State Auditor at the age of 31. Then, 2 years later, \nwhen he was only 33 years old, he was elected Governor of Missouri. Kit \nwas the first Republican Governor that State had seen in nearly three \ndecades.\n  For me--and this may be a little selfish--the most important \naccomplishment of Kit's first term was rescinding Executive Order No. \n44, which had been issued by Missouri Governor Liburn Boggs in 1838 and \nordered the expulsion or extermination of all Mormons from the State of \nMissouri. On June 25, 1976, then-Governor Bond rescinded that order and \nissued an apology to the Mormons on behalf of all Missourians. I \nremember that day clearly. And, while I was not yet acquainted with \nKit, he earned my gratitude and respect.\n  As Governor, Senator Bond's star rose dramatically. He was even \nconsidered as a potential running mate for President Gerald Ford in \n1976. Yet, in a surprising upset, Kit lost his reelection bid for \ngovernor that year. But, Missourians soon came to regret this mistake \nand reelected him to the Governor's office in 1980.\n  After finishing his second term as Governor--a successful term by \nalmost all accounts--Kit was elected to the Senate in 1986. And, thanks \nto his good judgment, his commitment to his home State, and to his \ncharacter, he was relected in 1992, 1998, and 2004.\n  For several years, I have had the pleasure of serving with Kit on the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, where he currently serves as vice \nchairman. From that position, I have been able to see his wisdom and \ngood judgment firsthand. It can be difficult serving on that committee, \nworking on important issues that, if everything goes right, will never \nsee the light of day. But, I can say this--Senator Bond's commitment to \nour Nation's security is second to none.\n  Mr. President, it has been an honor and privilege to serve next to \nSenator Bond for these many years. I want to wish him, his wife Linda, \nand their family the best of luck in any future endeavors.\n\n\n                              Jim Bunning\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak in honor of my good friend, \nSenator Jim Bunning. Senator Bunning will be departing from the Senate \nat the end of this session. I wanted to take a few moments to offer \nsome remarks.\n  Now, Jim is a distinguished two-term Senator whose career in public \nservice has spanned more than three decades. Yet when the history books \nare written, it is likely that he will be more well known for his first \nlove, the game of baseball.\n  Jim was born in Southgate, KY, in 1931. He graduated from Xavier \nUniversity in Cincinnati, OH, with a degree in economics.\n  Most know that Senator Bunning was a Major League pitcher for 17 \nyears, mostly with the Detroit Tigers and the Philadelphia Phillies. He \nwas, not to put too fine a point on it, one of the greatest pitchers to \never put on a glove. Jim retired with the second-highest strikeout \ntotal in baseball history. He was only the second pitcher in history to \nrecord 1,000 strikeouts and 100 victories in both the American and \nNational Leagues. Before Jim, only the legendary Cy Young had \naccomplished that feat. And, of course, on June 21, 1964, Jim pitched a \nperfect game against the New York Mets, achieving one of the rarest and \nmost sought-after feats in all of sports. Senator Bunning was inducted \ninto the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996, 2 years before he came to the \nSenate.\n  After retiring from baseball, Jim chose a life of public service. In \n1977, he was elected to the city council of Fort Thomas, KY. Two years \nlater, he was elected to the Kentucky State Senate, where he became the \nRepublican Leader. And, in 1986, he was elected to the first of his six \nterms in the U.S. House of Representatives. And, in 1998, Senator \nBunning was elected to the Senate and has served here ever since.\n  Throughout his time in Washington, Senator Bunning has been an \nadvocate for a number of causes, including the preservation of Social \nSecurity for seniors, fiscal and financial reform, and ending America's \ndependence on foreign energy sources. He's played a key role on some of \nthis chamber's most influential committees, including the Banking, \nEnergy, Budget, and Finance Committees.\n  For the last several years, I have had the opportunity to work with \nSenator Bunning on the Finance Committee. I have always admired his \ncommitment to his principles and his willingness to speak plainly when \nit became necessary to do so. His presence on the committee and in this \nChamber will certainly be missed.\n  I want to wish Jim and his family the best of luck going forward.\n\n\n                               Judd Gregg\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak today to recognize the departure of my \ngood friend Senator Judd Gregg. Senator Gregg has been a tireless \nadvocate for the people of his State and devoted public servant. He \nwill most certainly be missed.\n  Senator Gregg is a New Hampshire man through and through. He was born \nin Nashua, NH, in 1947. His father, Hugh Gregg, served as Governor of \nNew Hampshire when Judd was just 6 years old. Judd graduated from \nPhillips Exeter in 1965 before going on to earn his baccalaureate from \nColumbia University and his law degree from Boston University School of \nLaw.\n  After finishing law school 1972, Judd returned to Nashua to commence \nhis law practice, though it wouldn't be long before he would answer the \ncall into public service. From 1978 to 1980, Judd served on the New \nHampshire Governor's Executive Council. Then, in 1980, he was elected \nto serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for four \nterms. In 1988, he followed in his father's footsteps and was elected \nGovernor of New Hampshire and was reelected in 1990.\n  In 1992, after two successful terms as Governor, in which he was able \nto balance the budget and leave the State with a surplus, Judd was \nelected to represent New Hampshire here in the U.S. Senate. And, after \nserving for three terms, he is stepping down at the end of this \nsession.\n  If one were to describe Judd's political philosophy, I think they \nwould have to say that he was for fiscal discipline even when fiscal \ndiscipline wasn't cool. As chairman and ranking member of the Senate \nBudget Committee and senior member of the Banking Committee, his has \nalways been a voice of warning and restraint, even when restraint \nwasn't the status quo around Washington. His knowledge and expertise on \nthese issues made him one of the most respected voices in our debates \nover health care, economic and fiscal policy, and financial regulatory \nreform.\n  While Judd has always been a conservative, he's never let go of his \nindependence, refusing to put party before his principles. Everyone in \nWashington claims that they are that way, but Senator Gregg is one of \nthe few that has walked the walk. That, more than anything, is why he \nhas won the respect and admiration of his colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  The State of New Hampshire has been well-represented here in the \nSenate and I know the people of his State are grateful for Judd's \nservice. It has been both an honor and a privilege to have served \nalongside Senator Gregg. While I am certain that Judd will be \nsuccessful in whatever endeavor he chooses next, I am even more certain \nthat the Senate will be a lesser place without him here.\n  I want to wish Judd and his wife Kathleen and their family the very \nbest.\n\n[[Page S10736]]\n\n                             George LeMieux\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the junior Senator from \nFlorida. Though Senator George LeMieux has only been here a short time, \nhe has been an effective advocate for the good people of Florida. I \nwant to wish him the best of luck.\n  Senator LeMieux was born in Homestead, FL. He is the son of a \nbuilding contractor. He grew up in Coral Springs, FL, and attended \ncollege at Emory University, earning a degree in political science. \nGeorge then went on to obtain his law degree from Georgetown \nUniversity.\n  Senator LeMieux's career in public service began in 2003 when he went \nto work in the Florida attorney general's office. He would eventually \nbe named deputy attorney general, a position he held for 2 years. He \nwould later serve as the Florida Governor's chief of staff, overseeing \nnumerous state agencies.\n  After his time in the Governor's office, George returned to the \nprivate sector and was headed down what had to be a lucrative career \npath in the private sector at one of Florida's most prestigious law \nfirms. But, he answered the call to public service once again in 2009 \nwhen Senator Mel Martinez announced his retirement and Florida was in \nneed of a Senator.\n  Since being appointed to the Senate, George has served on the Armed \nServices Committee, the Commerce Committee, and the Special Committee \non Aging. He has had a reputation for being pro-growth, pro-business, \nand a deficit hawk. In fact, he has been one of the few people in the \nSenate who put their money where their mouth is and actually proposed a \nplan to address our fiscal problems. Frankly, I think we could use more \npeople like that here in the Senate.\n  It is just a difficult fact that, here in the Senate, some are here \nonly for short periods of time. But, every State deserves to be \nrepresented in this Chamber. Senator LeMieux answered the call to serve \nduring what has been an extremely difficult time in the Senate. He has \ndone so with dignity and an unwavering commitment to the people of \nFlorida.\n  Once again, I want to offer my best wishes for George and his family \nin all their future endeavors.\n\n\n                              Byron Dorgan\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the departure of junior \nSenator from North Dakota. Senator Byron Dorgan, a devoted public \nservant who has spent most of his life serving of the good people of \nNorth Dakota, will be leaving the Senate at the close of this session. \nHe will certainly be missed.\n  Senator Dorgan was born in Dickinson, ND, in 1942 and was raised in \nRegent, ND. His family worked in the petroleum and farm equipment \nbusiness and they also raised horses and cattle. Byron attended college \nat the University of North Dakota and graduate school at the University \nof Denver. He began his career in public service at the young age of \n26, when he was appointed to be the North Dakota State Tax \nCommissioner. He was youngest constitutional officer in the history of \nNorth Dakota.\n  Senator Dorgan came to Washington, DC, in 1980 when he was elected to \nserve in the House of Representatives. He served six terms in the House \nbefore coming to the Senate in 1992. And, for three full terms, he has \nably and energetically represented his native State. During his time \nhere, he has been a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, \nchairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, and, of course, chairman of \nthe Democratic Policy Committee. The people of North Dakota have \nbenefitted from his efforts on those committees and, I think he would \nbe the first to tell you, that his home State has never been far from \nhis thoughts here in the Senate.\n  While Senator Dorgan and I have, more often than not, disagreed on \nthe issues, he has always been sincere in his belief that what he was \ndoing was in the best interest of our country. Such commitment to \nprinciple has to be admired, even if, in the end, you disagree with the \nconclusion that is reached. And, I should note that there have been \ntimes, actually in some high-profile moments, in which Byron has voted \ndifferently than the majority of his party. In the Senate, which, of \nlate, has been highly polarized and extremely partisan, going against \nthe grain takes courage and independence, qualities I have admired in \nSenator Dorgan.\n  Senator Dorgan is a good man. I want to wish him, his wife Kim, and \ntheir family the very best of luck.\n\n\n                            Blanche Lincoln\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak in honor of my good friend, the \nsenior Senator from Arkansas. Senator Blanche Lincoln will depart from \nSenate at the end of this session. She will certainly be missed.\n  Senator Lincoln is seventh-generation Arkansan. She was born in \nHelena, AR, in 1960 to family of wheat, soybean, and cotton farmers. \nHer first elected office was president of the student council at Helena \nCentral High School. She got a bachelor's degree from Randolph Macon \nWomen's College in Lynchburg, VA, and then went to work on the \ncongressional staff for Representative Bill Alexander.\n  She left the Congressman's office after 2 years to pursue private \nsector work in Washington, DC, but would return home to Arkansas to run \nagainst her former boss in 1992. Her campaign for Congress was \nsuccessful and Blanche became the first woman ever to represent the \nArkansas First District in the House of Representatives.\n  All told, Senator Lincoln served two terms in the House before \nrunning for Senate in 1998. That year, at the age of 38, Senator \nLincoln became the youngest woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate and \nonly the second female Senator in the history of Arkansas.\n  Blanche's career in the Congress has been defined by her willingness \nto reach across the aisle and work with Senators from both parties. She \nis a proud Democrat but has never been an ideologue. Her devotion has \nnever been to a party line or platform, but to her own convictions and \nto the people of Arkansas.\n  I have had the privilege of working close with Senator Lincoln on a \nnumber of occasions. Much of the time, we found ourselves on different \nsides of the issues. But, there were also a number of times where we \nwere in agreement. In fact, I can think of several occasions where she \ndefied her own party's leadership and was, at the end of the day, a \ndifference-maker on a number of important efforts.\n  Here in the Senate, things have a tendency to get contentious in a \nhurry. Far too often, partisanship gets in the way of good \npolicymaking. We should commend those who are willing to see past the \npolitics of the day and focus on the long-term impact of the things we \ndo here in the Senate. Senator Blanche Lincoln is one of those people.\n  I want to wish Senator Lincoln and her family the very best of luck \ngoing forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/19/senate-section/article/S10736-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10736-S10737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask the Record reflect that if I would \nhave been present for yesterday's vote on the Development, Relief, and \nEducation for Alien Minors--DREAM--Act of 2010, H.R. 5281, that I would \nhave voted against cloture. My wife and I had a long standing family \ncommitment to attend my grandson's graduation.\n  The American people sent us a clear message on November 2, 2010, to \nfocus on getting our economy moving again. It bears repeating: our \ncountry's unemployment rate is nearly 10 percent. Yet instead of \nlistening to the true needs of this Nation, the majority in the Senate \nis moving full speed ahead with legislation in order to curry favor \nwith political constituencies.\n  Pushing this bill through during a lameduck session of Congress is \nnot how Utahns or Americans want Congress to operate. The bill before \nus is one of many versions of the DREAM Act introduced in the last 2 \nmonths. Though H.R. 5281 would result in a significant change to U.S. \nimmigration law, the bill never received 1 day of a committee markup. \nAn issue as important as this one needs to follow the regular order of \nthe legislative process.\n  Now more than ever, our Nation's porous border is flowing over with \nincreasingly violent crimes--fueled by drugs, gangs and even human \ntrafficking. Unfortunately, this chaos is spilling into our \ncommunities. That is why, when it comes to immigration, my primary \nfocus is on how we can finally secure our borders and how best to fix \nour broken immigration system.\n  The fight to control the border is no longer isolated to just the \nphysical\n\n[[Page S10737]]\n\nboundary between the United States and Mexico. Indeed, it now includes \naddressing Mexican cartels; prohibiting mass deferral or parole; \nstreamlining the visa process; requiring participation in key law \nenforcement programs; clamping down on identity theft; tracking the \namount of welfare benefits being diverted by illegal immigrant \nhouseholds; ensuring that dollars are being used to cover newly \neligible American children in CHIP and Medicaid; and keeping our great \nnational parks and federal lands safe and free from drug traffickers, \ndrug cultivation, and environmental damage. All of these important \nissues are addressed in my recently introduced bill, the Strengthening \nOur Commitment to Legal Immigration and America's Security Act, S. \n3901.\n  Mr. President, I remain understanding about individuals who, through \nno fault of their own, were brought to this country for a better life. \nHowever, the urgent challenges facing our country must take priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/19/senate-section/article/S10737-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL REPEAL ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I was regrettably absent for the vote on \nthe cloture motion to H.R. 2965, The Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act \nas my wife and I had a long standing family commitment to attend my \ngrandson's graduation. If I had been present, I would have voted \nagainst cloture.\n  I have long stated that our troops should not be held hostage to \ncontroversial social policy changes at a time when our Nation is at \nwar. Several top military leaders have concluded that changing military \npolicy could jeopardize our soldiers fighting for our Nation. That is \nsomething I cannot support.\n  These concerns were only reaffirmed a few days ago when the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps, GEN James Amos was quoted as saying, \n``I take that very, very seriously . . . I don't want to lose any \nmarines to the distraction [of implementing the repeal of Don't Ask, \nDon't Tell] . . . I don't want any marines that I'm visiting at \nBethesda [National Naval Medical Center military hospital in Maryland] \nwith no legs be the result of any type of distraction.''\n  This opinion was echoed by Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz, \nwho stated in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee that \nhe opposed implementing any reform until 2012 because he did ``not \nagree with the study assessment that the short-term risk to military \neffectiveness is low.''\n  Moreover, the recent report also showed that the percentage of those \nservicemembers in combat arms units which predicted a negative or very \nnegative effects on their unit's ability to ``work together to get the \njob done'' stood at an alarming 48 percent within Army combat arms \nunits, and 58 percent within Marine combat arms units.\n  Our military leaders and front-line forces have spoken. They do not \nbelieve repealing don't ask, don't tell is appropriate at this crucial \ntime in our Nation's history and neither do I.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/19/senate-section/article/S10737-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REMEMBERING JOY RUSHMORE HILLIARD\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I would like to take the \ntime to honor the memory of Ms. Joy Rushmore Hilliard, a supporter of \nthe environment, outdoor enthusiast, and a friend of Colorado. Joy \npassed away peacefully this past August at the age of 86.\n  As an avid outdoorswoman, Joy was well known as a great angler and \nlover of nature. She climbed all 54 of the 14-ers in Colorado well \nbefore it became a popular pursuit. Barbara Mandrell might even say Joy \nwas a climber, outdoorswoman, and environmentalist before it became \n``cool.'' In fact, when I look back and think of her heart and passion \nfor life, she reminds me of what being an authentic Coloradan is all \nabout.\n  Joy even reminds me a lot of my own mother. Of the same generation \nand cut from the same cloth, Joy not only enjoyed hiking, climbing, \nskiing and fly-fishing, but managed to balance that love with raising a \nfamily. She also was a world traveler and was part of the 1963 \nexpedition that trekked from Katmandu to the base camp on Mount \nEverest. In addition to her love of the outdoors and traveling, Joy was \nalso a passionate philanthropist who donated her entire life to \nbettering her community and the world around her.\n  Not only was she actively involved with many environmental \norganizations, Joy also was the chairwoman of Colorado Outward Bound, a \nnonprofit organization that teaches hands-on life lessons using the \nenvironment. As you may know, I was a former educator and mountain \nguide for Outward Bound. Its programs have greatly helped struggling \nteens and groups with health, educational, or social needs to not only \nexperience the outdoors, but to also learn about the potential embodied \nin themselves. As the chairwoman, Joy led Outward Bound to new heights \nand was the inspiration for many participants as well as staff.\n  In addition to her chairwomanship of Outward Bound, Joy was also \npresident of the Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood, and an avid \nparticipant in other organizations such as Trout Unlimited, Silver \nTrout Foundation, and Colorado Open Lands. Her involvement in all of \nthese civic groups reflects not only her respect and love for the \nenvironment and Colorado, but also her passion for life.\n  For her many sacrifices and hard work, Joy received several \nrecognitions, including the Lifetime Achievement Award from the \nColorado Environmental Coalition, the George E. Cranmer Award from \nColorado Open Lands, and the Margaret Sanger Award from Planned \nParenthood. Joy's other philanthropic actions include helping to \nestablish the conservation wing of the Denver Public Library and a 10th \nMountain Division Hut in memory of her late husband Ed, who was a \npartner of the Redfield Gun Sight Company.\n  Joy's service to her community, to Colorado and to the environment \nwill always live on in our hearts; she was truly an inspiration for all \nof us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/19/senate-section/article/S10737-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the first and second times by unanimous \nconsent, and placed on the calendar:\n\n       H.R. 6523.

Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators, we just \nsent to the House, again, the food safety legislation--extremely \nimportant legislation. I just got something on my desk today about a \nwoman who is going to be--well, she was in the hospital a year and a \nhalf and is expected to be there for 2 more years as a result of eating \nsome contaminated food. So it is so important.\n  I am deeply appreciative of the cooperation from everyone, including \nmy friend, the Republican leader, to help us get this done. It is very \nimportant for our country. Perfect legislation? No. But it is a broad \nstep in the right direction. We haven't done anything in this regard \nfor more than 100 years for our country, with all the change there has \nbeen in the processing of food. It is so important. I spoke to the \nSpeaker tonight, and this will now pass the House when they come back \nMonday night or Tuesday. So that is extremely important.\n  We had to file cloture on the continuing resolution to fund the \ngovernment for the next couple of months. We hope to complete that on \nTuesday. I hope that it won't be necessary to use any of the \npostcloture time. I rather doubt we will, but I certainly hope not.\n  We are going to proceed, once cloture is invoked, to the cloture on \nthe START treaty. We have made--from my observation as sort of an \noutsider watching all the good work of Senators Kerry and Lugar--some \ngood progress on this, and I do hope this matter will pass. We will \nwork on that as long as it takes. As I explained to a number of \nDemocratic and Republican Senators today, we will work on it tomorrow. \nWe will have a secret session tomorrow in the Old Senate Chamber at 2 \np.m., and then we will come in tomorrow night and continue to work on \nit. We can work on it, of course, all day Tuesday and for however long \nit takes. It is extremely important.\n  As everyone knows, Senator Wyden is sick. He is going to surgery at \n10 o'clock in the morning because of a situation that has been in the \npress. He has prostate cancer. We wish him and\n\n[[Page S10772]]\n\nhis wonderful wife and his twins the very best. He is very confident he \nis getting the best care in the world, and I am also certain he is \ngoing to be just fine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "19", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/19/senate-section/article/S10772-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, DECEMBER 20, 2010\n\n  Mr. REID.
