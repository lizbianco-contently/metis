Madam President, as Democratic leaders in Congress \ncontinue to insist that we are at some make-or-break moment in the \nhealth care debate, and that for some reason we need to pass a bill \nthat raises taxes, raises premiums, and cuts Medicare, I would like to \ncall attention to a notice we received just yesterday from the \nCongressional Budget Office informing us that they plan to issue a cost \nestimate today for the Senate-passed health care bill.\n  In other words, sometime today the CBO will release its final cost \nestimate on the health spending bill the majority passed on Christmas \nEve. This is March 11. We passed that bill on Christmas Eve. We are now \ngetting a cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.\n  So our friends on the other side--every single one of them--voted for \nthis enormous bill, a bill affecting the cost and quality of health \ncare for every single man, woman, and child in America without knowing \nthe full cost to the taxpayers.\n  Well, excuse me for noting the obvious, but this is no way to \nlegislate on an issue of this importance. Month after month, we were \ntold it was urgent to pass that bill--so urgent, apparently, that \nDemocrats in Congress could not even wait to find out the effect the \nbill would have on the cost to the American people.\n  Now we are being told the same thing. Democratic leaders are telling \ntheir members they have to vote on this latest version of the same bill \nby Easter--the latest version of the same bill by Easter. When are we \ngoing to find out how much that one costs, Columbus Day?\n  Americans are not in any rush to pass this or any other 2,700-page \nbill that poses as reform but actually raises the cost of health care. \nMembers of Congress should not be deceived by these theatrical attempts \nto create a sense of urgency about this legislation. The least that \nlawmakers can do is find out how much these bills will cost the \ntaxpayers before they schedule a vote. They cannot have it both ways. \nThey cannot say they are concerned about how much these bills cost and \nnot even ask to see the pricetag.\n  The fact is, anybody who even considers voting for these health \nspending bills does not have lower costs as a priority because we know \nthese bills are going to drive costs up, not down.\n\n[[Page S1416]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1416-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Lance Corporal Jonathan B. Thornsberry\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nyoung man from McDowell, KY, who bravely served his country. LCpl \nJonathan B. Thornsberry was tragically killed during combat operations \nin Iraq back on October 25, 2006. He was 22 years old. He left behind a \nfamily and friends who love him and remember that today, March 11, is \nhis birthday.\n  For his heroic service with the U.S. Marines, Lance Corporal \nThornsberry received several medals, awards, and decorations, including \nthe National Defense Service Medal and the Purple Heart.\n  The man called ``Jon-Jon'' by family and friends was following a \nfamily tradition when he elected to wear America's uniform. His \nbrother, father, and grandfather all served in the military.\n  ``It was just something he wanted to do,'' Jonathan's brother Jeff \nrecalls of why Jonathan signed up. ``It was a decision he made.'' \nJonathan's parents, Jackie and Judy, remember their son saying, ``We \nhave to go over there. If we don't go over there, they will be here.''\n  Jonathan grew up in Floyd County where he attended McDowell \nElementary School and South Floyd High School. He played catcher on his \nhigh school baseball team. Everybody remembers how good he was, and \nSouth Floyd High has retired his old No. 13 in his memory.\n  The name of the McDowell Elementary School's sports team is the \nDaredevils. Jonathan certainly fit that description growing up, as he \nliked to play in the mountains, go four-wheeling, and go hunting. This \nis not to say he did not have any sense of responsibility.\n\n  Once when he was just 4 or 5 years old, Jonathan and his father were \nhunting when they climbed too high on a mountain. ``We need to go down. \nMommy will be worried about us,'' Jonathan said.\n  Jonathan was very close to his father, and the two of them worked \ntogether in the coal mines before Jonathan joined the Marines. Jonathan \nwas also a father himself. He and his wife Toni Renee have a daughter, \nHaylee Jo. Haylee Jo recently turned 5 years old, and she likes to tell \npeople she has her daddy's green eyes.\n  Jonathan was also close to his aunt, Edia Hamilton, better known in \nthe family as Aunt Edia Girl. She would always buy candy for her \nfavorite nephew even though she was on a fixed income.\n  Jonathan graduated from South Floyd High School in 2002, and after \nworking alongside his father in the coal mines enlisted in the Marines \nin January 2004. He was assigned to the Marine Forces Reserve's 3rd \nBattalion, 24th Regiment, 4th Marine Division, based out of Johnson \nCity, TN.\n  After training in California, Jonathan was deployed in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom in 2006. His family recalls he left California \non September 26, and just 1 month later his life was tragically lost.\n  A few days before his death, Jonathan called his mother Judy to wish \nher a happy birthday, but she was at the grocery store and missed his \ncall. Jonathan did get to talk to his wife Toni. Toni and Judy talked \nlater, and Judy remembers they shared an uneasy feeling.\n  ``I could feel God all around me that morning and I should have known \nsomething,'' Judy says. ``I [could] feel God protecting me from the \nharshness of this.'' Later that day they received the horrible news.\n  Funeral services were held at the Little Rosa Church in McDowell, \nwhere Jonathan's two favorite songs, ``The Old Ship of Zion'' and \n``Amazing Grace,'' were played. Tributes to him were held in Frankfort \nand back at South Floyd High School.\n  Today, on Jonathan's birthday, Madam President, our thoughts are with \nthe many loved ones he has left behind. We are thinking of his wife \nToni Renee; his daughter Haylee Jo; his parents Jackie and Judy; his \nbrother and sister-in-law, Jeff and Angela; his grandmother, Alice \nMoore Lawson; his nephews, Thomas and Jack; his nieces, Evelyn Grace \nand Julia Ann; his aunt, Edia Hamilton; and many more family members \nand friends.\n  One year after Jonathan's death, his family, friends, and fellow \nmarines gathered to remember him at a service in Pikeville City Park. \nFriends recalled him as the ``type of guy who would give you the shirt \noff his back.'' Another remembered the last time he saw Jonathan and \nwhat they talked about.\n  His wife Toni talked about how much she had lost. ``We loved each \nother from the moment we laid eyes on each other,'' she said. Then she \nread a poem that got across how her husband was a man who did not ask \nfor much.\n  ``If you have a place for me, Lord, it needn't be so grand,'' she \nread.\n  A place of honor will be kept in the Senate for LCpl Jonathan B. \nThornsberry, who sacrificed everything for his country. Today, on his \nbirthday, I know my colleagues will join me in paying tribute to his \nservice.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1416-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, financial regulatory reform is perhaps \nthe most important legislation the Congress will address for many years \nto come. If we do not get it right, the consequences of another \nfinancial meltdown could be devastating.\n  In the Senate, as we continue to move closer to consideration of a \nlandmark bill, however, we are still far short of addressing some of \nthe fundamental problems--particularly that of too big to fail--that \ncaused the last crisis and already have planted the seeds for the next \none. This is happening after months of careful deliberation and \nnegotiations and just a year and a half after the virtual meltdown of \nour entire financial system.\n  Following the Great Depression, the Congress built a legal and \nregulatory edifice that endured for decades. One of its cornerstones \nwas the Glass-Steagall Act, which established a firewall between \ncommercial and investment banking activities. Another was the federally \nguaranteed insurance fund to back up bank deposits. There were other \nrules imposed on investors and designed to tamp down on rampant \nspeculation--Federal rules such as margin requirements and the uptick \nrule for short selling.\n  That edifice worked well to ensure financial stability for \ndecades. But in the past thirty years, the financial industry, like so \nmany others, went through a process of deregulation. Bit by bit, many \nof the protections and standards put in place by the New Deal were \nmethodically removed. And while the seminal moment came in 1999 with \nthe repeal of Glass-Steagall, that formal rollback was primarily the \nconfirmation of a lengthy process already underway.\n\n  Indeed, after 1999, the process only accelerated. Financial \nconglomerates that combined commercial and investment banking \nconsolidated, becoming more leveraged and interconnected through ever \nmore complex transactions and structures, all of which made our \nfinancial system more vulnerable to collapse. A shadow banking industry \ngrew to larger proportions than even the banking industry itself, \nvirtually unshackled by any regulation. By lifting basic restraints on \nfinancial markets and institutions, and more importantly, failing to \nput in place new rules as complex innovations arose and became \nwidespread, this deregulatory philosophy unleashed the forces that \nwould cause our financial crisis.\n\n[[Page S1417]]\n\n  I start by asking a simple question: Given that deregulation caused \nthe crisis, why don't we go back to the statutory and regulatory \nframeworks of the past that were proven successes in ensuring financial \nstability? This is basically a conservative question and I am a \nconservative on this issue. Why don't we go back to what has worked in \nthe past?\n  And what response do I hear when I raise this rather obvious \nquestion? That we have moved beyond the old frameworks, that the eggs \nare too scrambled, that the financial industry has become too \nsophisticated and modernized and that it was not this or that piece of \nderegulation that caused the crisis in the first place.\n  Mind you, this is a financial crisis that necessitated a $2.5 \ntrillion bailout. And that amount includes neither the many trillions \nof dollars more that were committed as guarantees for toxic debt nor \nthe de facto bailout that banks received through the Federal Reserve's \neasing of monetary policy. The crisis triggered a Great Recession that \nhas thrown millions out of work, caused millions to lose their homes, \nand caused everyone to suffer in an American economy that has been \nknocked off its stride for more than 2 years.\n  Given the high costs of our policy and regulatory failures, as well \nas the reckless behavior on Wall Street, why should those of us who \npropose going back to the proven statutory and regulatory ideas of the \npast bear the burden of proof? The burden of proof should be upon those \nwho would only tinker at the edges of our current system of financial \nregulation. After a crisis of this magnitude, it amazes me that some of \nour reform proposals effectively maintain the status quo in so many \ncritical areas, whether it is allowing multitrillion-dollar financial \nconglomerates that house traditional banking and speculative activities \nto continue to exist and pose threats to our financial system, \npermitting banks to continue to determine their own capital standards, \nor allowing a significant portion of the derivatives market to remain \nopaque and lightly regulated.\n  To address these problems, Congress needs to draw hard lines that \nprovide fundamental systemic reforms, the very kind of protections we \nhad under Glass-Steagall. We need to rebuild the wall between the \ngovernment-guaranteed part of the financial system and those financial \nentities that remain free to take on greater risk. We need limits on \nthe size of systemically significant nonbank players. And we need to \neffectively regulate the derivatives market that caused so much \nwidespread financial ruin. It is my sincere hope that we don't enact \ncompromise measures that give only the illusion of change and a false \nsense of accomplishment. If we do, then we will only have set in place \nthe prelude to the next financial crisis.\n  First, however, let us examine the origins--both obscure and well-\nknown--of the Great Recession of 2008. As I have already noted, the \nregulators began tearing down the walls between commercial banking and \ninvestment banking long before the repeal of Glass-Steagall. Through a \nseries of decisions in the 1980s and 1990s, the Federal Reserve \nliberalized prudential limitations placed upon commercial banks, \nallowing them to engage in securities underwriting and trading \nactivities, which had traditionally been the particular province of \ninvestment banks. One fateful decision in 1987 to relax Glass-Steagall \nrestrictions passed over the objections of then Federal Reserve \nChairman Paul Volcker, the man who is today leading the charge to \nrestrict government-backed banks from engaging in proprietary trading \nand other speculative activities.\n  With the steady erosion of these protections by the Federal Reserve, \nthe repeal of Glass-Steagall had become a fait accompli even before the \npassage of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act in 1999. In effect, by passing \nGLBA, Congress was acknowledging the reality in the marketplace that \ncommercial banks were already engaging in investment banking. As the \nbusiness of finance moved from bank loans to bonds and other forms of \ncapital provided by investors, commercial banks pushed the Federal \nReserve to relax Glass-Steagall standards to allow them to underwrite \nbonds and make markets in new products like derivatives. Even before \nGLBA was passed, J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and their \npredecessor organizations had all become leaders in those businesses.\n  If the changes in the financial marketplace that led to the repeal of \nGlass-Steagall took place over many years, the market's transformation \nafter 1999 was swift and profound.\n  First, there was frenzied merger activity in the banking sector, as \nfinancial supermarkets that had bank and nonbank franchises under the \numbrella of a single holding company bought out smaller rivals to gain \nan ever-increasing national and international footprint. While the \nRiegle-Neal Banking Act of 1994, which established a 10 percent cap \nnationally on any particular bank's share of federally insured \ndeposits, should have been a barrier for at least some of these \nmergers, regulatory forbearance permitted them to go through anyway. In \nfact, then Citicorp's proposed merger Travelers Insurance was actually \na major rationale behind the Glass-Steagall Act. Most of the largest \nbanks are products of serial mergers. For example, J.P. Morgan Chase is \na product of J.P. Morgan, Chase Bank, Chemical Bank, Manufacturers \nHanover, Banc One, Bear Stearns, and Washington Mutual. Meanwhile, Bank \nof America is an amalgam of that predecessor bank, Nation's Bank, \nBarnett Banks, Continental Illinois, MBNA, Fleet Bank, and finally \nMerrill Lynch.\n  Second, the business of finance was changing. Disintermediation, the \nprocess by which investors directly fund businesses and individuals \nthrough securities markets, was already in full bloom by the time of \nthe repeal of Glass-Steagall. This was demonstrated by the dramatic \ngrowth in money market fund and mutual fund assets and by the fact that \ncorporate bonds actually exceeded nonmortgage bank loans by the middle \nof the 1990s.\n  The subsequent boom in structured finance took this process to ever \ngreater heights. Securitization, whereby pools of illiquid loans and \nother assets are structured, converted and marketed into asset-backed \nsecurities, ABS, is in principle a valuable process that facilitates \nthe flow of credit and the dispersion of risk beyond the banking \nsystem. Regulatory neglect, however, permitted a good model to mutate \nand grow into a sad farce.\n  On one end of the securitization supply chain, regulators allowed \nunderwriting standards to erode precipitously without strengthening \nmortgage origination regulations or sounding the alarm bells on harmful \nnonbank actors--not even those within bank holding companies over which \nthe regulators had jurisdiction. On the other, securities backed by \nrisky loans were transformed into securities deemed ``hi-grade'' by \ncredit rating agencies, only after a dizzying array of steps where \nsecurities were packaged and repackaged into many layers of senior \ntranches, which had high claims to interest and principal payments, and \nsubordinate tranches.\n  The nonbanking actors--investment banks, hedge funds, money market \nfunds, off-balance-sheet investment funds--that powered structured \nfinance came to be known as the shadow banking market. Of course, the \nshadow banking market could only have grown to surpass by trillions of \ndollars the actual banking market with the consent of regulators.\n  In fact, one of the primary purposes behind the securitization market \nwas to arbitrage bank capital standards. Banks that could show \nregulators that they could offload risks through asset securitizations \nor through guarantees on their assets in the form of derivatives called \ncredit default swaps received more favorable regulatory capital \ntreatment, allowing them to build their balance sheets to more and more \nstratospheric levels.\n  With the completion of the Basel II Capital Accord, determinations on \ncapital adequacy became dependent on the judgments of rating agencies \nand, increasingly, the banks' own internal models. While this was a \nrecipe for disaster, it reflected in part the extent to which the size \nand complexity of this new era of quantitative finance exceeded the \nregulators' own comprehension.\n  When Basel II was effectively applied to investment banks like Lehman \nBrothers and Goldman Sachs, which had far more precarious and \npotentially explosive business models that\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\nutilized overnight funding to finance illiquid inventories of assets, \nthe results were even worse. The SEC, which had no track record to \nspeak of with respect to ensuring the safety and soundness of financial \ninstitutions, allowed these investment banks to leverage a small base \nof capital over 40 times into asset holdings that, in some cases, \nexceeded $1 trillion.\n  Third, little more than a year after repealing Glass-Steagall, \nCongress passed legislation--the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of \n2000--to allow over-the-counter derivatives to essentially remain \nunregulated. Following the collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital \nManagement in 1998, then Commodities Futures Trading Commission \nChairwoman Brooksley Born began to warn of problems in this market. \nUnfortunately, her calls for stronger regulation of the derivatives \nmarket clashed with the uncompromising free-market philosophies of \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, then Treasury Secretary Robert \nRubin and later Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. To head off any \nattempt by the CFTC or another agency from regulating this market, they \nsuccessfully convinced Congress to pass the CFMA.\n  The explosive growth of the OTC derivatives market following the \npassage of the CFMA was stunning--the size of the OTC derivatives \nmarket grew from just over $95 trillion at the end of 2000 to over $600 \ntrillion in 2009. This growth had profound implications for the overall \nrisk profile of the financial system. While derivatives can be used as \na valuable tool to mitigate or hedge risk, they can also be used as an \ninexpensive way to take on leverage and risk. As I noted before, \ncertain OTC derivatives called credit default swaps were crucial in \nallowing banks to evade their regulatory capital requirements. In other \ncontexts, CDS contracts have been used to speculate on the credit \nworthiness of a particular company or asset.\n  But they pose other problems as well. Since derivatives represent \ncontingent liabilities or assets, the risks associated with them are \nimperfectly accounted for on company balance sheets. And they have \nconcentrated risk in the banking sector, since even before the repeal \nof Glass-Steagall, large commercial banks like J.P. Morgan were major \nderivatives dealers. Finally, the proliferation of derivatives has \nsignificantly increased the interdependence of financial actors while \nalso overwhelming their back-office infrastructure. Hence, while the \ngrowth of derivatives greatly increased counterparty credit risks \nbetween financial institutions--the risk, that is, that the other party \nwill default at some point during the life of the derivative contract--\nthose entities had little ability to quantify those risks, let alone \nmanage them.\n  Therefore, on the eve of what was arguably the biggest economic \ncrisis since the Great Depression, which was caused in large part by \nthe confluence of all the forces and trends that I have just described, \nthe financial industry was larger, more concentrated, more complex, \nmore leveraged and more interconnected than ever before. Once the \nsubprime crisis hit, it spread like a contagion, causing a collapse in \nconfidence throughout virtually the entire financial industry. And \nwithout clear walls between those institutions the government insures \nand those that are free to take on excessive leverage and risk, the \nAmerican taxpayer was called upon to step forward into the breach.\n  Unfortunately, the government's response to the financial meltdown \nhas only made the industry bigger, more concentrated and more complex. \nAs the entire financial system was imploding following the bankruptcy \nfiling by Lehman Brothers, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve hastily \narranged mergers between commercial banks, which had a stable source of \nfunding in insured deposits, and investment banks, whose business model \ndepended on market confidence to roll over short-term debt.\n  Before the Lehman bankruptcy, Bear Stearns had been merged into J.P. \nMorgan. After the Lehman collapse, one of the biggest mergers to occur \nwas between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch. And Ken Lewis, the CEO \nof Bank of America at the time, alleges that it was consummated only \nfollowing pressure he received from Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and \nFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.\n  As merger plans for the remaining two investment banks, Goldman Sachs \nand Morgan Stanley, faltered, another plan was hatched. Both Goldman \nSachs and Morgan Stanley--neither of which had anything even close to \ntraditional banking franchises--were both given special dispensations \nfrom the Federal Reserve to become bank holding companies. This \nprovided them with permanent borrowing privileges at the Federal \nReserve's discount window--without having to dispose of risky assets. \nIn a sense, it was an official confirmation that they were covered by \nthe government safety net because they were literally ``too big to \nfail.''\n  Following the crisis, the U.S. mega banks left standing have even \nmore dominant positions. Take the multitrillion-dollar market for OTC \nderivatives. The five largest banks control 95 percent of that market. \nLet me repeat that. The five largest banks control 95 percent of the \nover-the-counter derivatives market. With such strong pricing power, \nthese firms could afford to expand dramatically their margins. The \nFederal Reserve estimated that those five banks made $35 billion from \ntrading in the first half of 2009 alone. Of course, they used these \noutsized profits from trading activities in derivatives and other \nsecurities not only to replenish their capital, but also to pay \nbillions of dollars in bonuses.\n  Large and complex institutions like Citigroup dominate our financial \nindustry and our economy. MIT professor Simon Johnson and James Kwak, a \nresearcher at Yale Law School, estimate that the six largest U.S. banks \nnow have total assets in excess of 63 percent of our overall GDP. Only \n15 years ago, the six largest US banks had assets equal to 17 percent \nof GDP. This is an extraordinary increase. We haven't seen such \nconcentration of financial power since the days of Morgan, Rockefeller \nand Carnegie.\n  As I stated at the outset, I am extremely concerned that our reform \nefforts to date do little, if anything, to address this most serious of \nproblems. By expanding the safety net--as we did in response to the \nlast crisis--to cover ever larger and more complex institutions heavily \nengaged in speculative activities, I fear that we may be sowing the \nseeds for an even bigger crisis in only a few years or a decade.\n  Unfortunately, the current reform proposals focus more on \nreorganizing and consolidating our regulatory infrastructure, which \ndoes nothing to address the most basic issue in the banking industry: \nthat we still have gigantic banks capable of causing the very financial \nshocks that they themselves cannot withstand.\n  Rather than pass the buck to a reshuffled regulatory deck, which will \nstill be forced to oversee banks that former FDIC Chairman Bill Isaac \ndescribes as ``too big to manage, and too big to regulate,'' we must \ndraw hard statutory lines between banks and investment houses.\n  We must eliminate the problem of ``too big to fail'' by reinstituting \nthe spirit of Glass-Steagall, a modern version that separates \ncommercial from investment banking activities and imposes strict size \nand leverage limits on financial institutions.\n  We must also establish clear and enforceable rules of the road for \nour securities market in the interest of making them less fragmented, \nopaque and prone to collapse. The over-the-counter derivatives market \nmust be tightly regulated, as originally proposed by Brooksley Born--\nand rejected by Congress--in the late 1990s.\n  Finally, I believe the myriad conflicts of interest on Wall Street \nmust be addressed through greater protection and empowerment of \nindividual investors. Our antifraud provisions, as represented for \nexample by rule 10(b)5, under the 1934 Securities Act, need to be \nstrengthened.\n  One key reform that has been proposed to address the ``too big to \nfail'' problem is resolution authority. The existing mechanism whereby \nthe FDIC resolves failing depository institutions has, by and large, \nworked well. After the experiences of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers \nin 2008, it is clear that a similar process should be applied to entire \nbank holding companies and large nonbank institutions.\n  While no doubt necessary, this is no panacea. No matter how well \nCongress\n\n[[Page S1419]]\n\ncrafts a resolution mechanism, there can never be an orderly wind-down, \nparticularly during periods of serious stress, of a $2-trillion \ninstitution like Citigroup that had hundreds of billions of off-\nbalance-sheet assets, relies heavily on wholesale funding, and has more \nthan a toehold in over 100 countries.\n  There is no cross-border resolution authority now, nor will there be \nfor the foreseeable future. In the days and weeks following the \ncollapse of Lehman Brothers, there was an intense and disruptive \ndispute between regulators in the U.S. and U.K. regarding how to handle \ncustomer claims and liabilities more generally. Yet experts in the \nprivate sector and governments agree--national interests make any \nviable international agreement on how financial failures are resolved \ndifficult to achieve. A resolution authority based on U.S. law will do \nprecisely nothing to address this issue.\n  While some believe market discipline would be reimposed by refining \nthe bankruptcy process, Lehman Brothers demonstrates that the very \nconcept of market discipline is illusory with institutions like \ninvestment banks, which used funds that they borrowed in the repo \nmarket to finance their own inventories of securities, as well as their \nown book of repurchase agreements, which they provided to hedge funds \nthrough their prime brokerage business.\n  Investment banks, the fulcrum of these institutional arrangements, \nfound themselves in a classic squeeze. On one side, their hedge fund \nclients and counterparties withdrew funds and securities in their prime \nbrokerage accounts, drew down credit lines and closed out derivative \npositions, all of which caused a massive cash drain on the bank. On the \nother side, the repo lenders, concerned about the value of their \ncollateral as well as the effect of the cash drain on the banks' credit \nworthiness, refused to roll over their loans without the posting of \nsubstantial additional collateral. These circumstances quickly prompted \na vicious cycle of deleveraging that brought our financial system to \nthe brink. With such large, complex and combustible institutions like \nthese, there can be no orderly process of winding them down. The rush \nto the exits happens much too quickly.\n  That is why we need to directly address the size, the structure and \nthe concentration of our financial system.\n  The Volcker rule, which would prohibit commercial banks from owning \nor sponsoring ``hedge funds, private equity funds, and purely \nproprietary trading in securities, derivatives or commodity markets,'' \nis a great start, and I applaud Chairman Volcker for proposing that \npurely speculative activities should be moved out of banks. That is why \nI joined yesterday with Senators Jeff Merkeley and Carl Levin to \nintroduce a strong version of the Volcker rule. But I think we must go \nfurther still. Massive institutions that combine traditional commercial \nbanking and investment banking are rife with conflicts and are too \nlarge and complex to be effectively managed.\n  We can address these problems by reimposing the kind of protections \nwe had under Glass-Steagall. To those who say ``repealing Glass-\nSteagall did not cause the crisis, that it began at Bear Stearns, \nLehman Brothers and AIG,'' I say that the large commercial banks were \nengaged in exactly the same behavior as Bear Stearns, Lehman and AIG--\nand would have collapsed had the federal government not stepped in and \ntaken extraordinary measures. That is the reason why commerical banks \ndid not go under, because we were protecting them because they were too \nbig to fail. We let Bear, Lehman and AIG--go under because they were \nnot. This seems like a circular argument on why we should not do more \nabout commercial banks in this country that are so incredibly large and \nwe would be stuck with the same situation we were in during the \nmeltdown. Moreover, in response to the last crisis, we increased the \nsafety net that covers these behemoth institutions. The result: they \nwill continue to grow unchecked, using insured deposits for speculative \nactivities without running any real risk of failure on account of their \nsize.\n  We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall in an updated form to prevent or \nat least severely moderate the next crisis.\n  By statutorily splitting apart massive financial institutions that \nhouse both banking and securities operations, we will both cut these \nfirms down to more reasonable and manageable sizes and rightfully limit \nthe safety net only to traditional banks. President of the Federal \nReserve Bank of Dallas Richard Fisher recently stated:\n\n       I think the disagreeable but sound thing to do regarding \n     institutions that are [``too big to fail''] is to dismantle \n     them over time into institutions that can be prudently \n     managed and regulated across borders. And this should be done \n     before the next financial crisis, because it surely cannot be \n     done in the middle of a crisis.\n\n  A growing number of people are calling for this change. They include \nformer FDIC Chairman Bill Isaac, former Citigroup chairman John Reed, \nfamed investor George Soros, Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph \nStiglitz, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Thomas \nHoenig, and Bank of England Governor, Mervyn King, among others. A \nchastened Alan Greenspan also adds to that chorus, noting:\n\n       If they're too big to fail, they're too big. In 1911 we \n     broke up Standard Oil--so what happened? The individual parts \n     became more valuable than the whole. Maybe that's what we \n     need to do.\n\n  Alan Greenspan, in my opinion, has never been more right.\n  But even this extraordinary step of splitting these institutions \napart is not sufficient. Cleaving investment banking from traditional \ncommercial banking will still leave us with massive investment banks, \nsome with balance sheets that exceed $1 trillion in assets.\n  For that reason, Glass-Steagall would need to be supplemented with \nstrict size and leverage constraints. The size limit should focus on \nconstraining the amount of nondeposit liabilities at large investment \nbanks, which rely heavily on short-term financing, such as repos and \ncommercial paper.\n  The growth of those funding markets in the run-up to the crisis was \nstaggering. One report by researchers at the Bank of International \nSettlements estimated that the size of the overall repo market in the \nUnited States, Euro region and the United Kingdom totaled approximately \n$11 trillion at the end of 2007. Incredibly, the size was more than $5 \ntrillion more than the total value of domestic bank deposits at that \ntime, which was less than $7 trillion.\n  The overreliance on such wholesale financing made the entire \nfinancial system vulnerable to a classic bank run, the type that we had \nbefore we instituted a system of deposit insurance and strong bank \nsupervision. Remarkably, while there is a prudential cap on the amount \nof deposits a bank can have--even though deposits are already federally \ninsured--there is no limit of any kind on liabilities like repos that \nneed to be rolled over every day. With a sensible limit on these \nliabilities at each financial institution--for example, as a percentage \nof GDP--we can ensure that never again will the so-called shadow \nbanking system eclipse the real banking system.\n  In addition, institutions that rely upon market confidence every day \nto finance their balance sheet and market prices to determine the worth \nof their assets should not be leveraged to stratospheric levels. To \nensure that regulatory forbearance does not permit another Lehman \nBrothers, we should institute a simple statutory leverage requirement, \nthat is, a limit on how much firms can borrow relative to how much \ntheir shareholders have on the line. As I have said in a previous \nspeech, a statutory leverage requirement that is based upon banks' core \ncapital--i.e., their common stock plus retained earnings--could \nsupplement regulators' more highly calibrated risk-based assessments, \nproviding a sorely needed gut check that ensures that regulators don't \nmiss the forest for the trees when assessing the capital adequacy of a \nfinancial institution.\n  This would push firms back towards the levels of effective capital \nthey had in the pre-bailout days--like in the post World War II period \nwhen our financial system generally functioned well. To be sure, this \nwould move our core banks from being predominantly debt financed to \nsubstantially based on equity. But other parts of our financial system \nalready operate well on this basis--with venture capital being the most \nnotable example. The return on equity relative to debt would need to \nrise to accommodate this change, but--as long as we preserve a credible \nmonetary policy--this is consistent with low interest rates in real \nterms.\n\n[[Page S1420]]\n\n  I would also stress that a leverage limit without breaking up the \nbiggest banks will have little effect. Because of their implicit \nguarantee, ``too big to fail'' banks enjoy a major funding advantage--\nand leverage caps by themselves do not address that. Our biggest banks \nand financial institutions have to become significantly smaller if we \nare to make any progress at all.\n  Turning now to derivatives reform, I have already noted how large \ndealer banks completely dominate the OTC marketplace for derivatives, \nan opaque market where these banks exert enormous pricing power. For \nover two decades, this market has existed with virtually no regulation \nwhatsoever.\n  Amazingly, it is a market where the dealers themselves actually set \nthe rules for the amount of collateral and margin that needs to be \nposted by different counterparties on trades. Dealers never post \ncollateral, while the rules they set for their counterparties are both \nlax and procyclical, meaning that margin requirements tend to increase \nduring periods of market turmoil when liquidity is at a premium. The \ncomplete lack of oversight of these markets has almost brought our \nfinancial system to its knees twice in 10 years, first with the failure \nof LTCM in 1998, and then with the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008. \nWe have known about these problems for over a decade--yet we have so \nfar done nothing to make this market better regulated.\n  That is why I applaud CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler's efforts in pushing \nfor centralized clearing and regulated electronic execution of \nstandardized OTC derivatives contracts as well as more robust \ncollateral and margin requirements. Clearinghouses have strong policies \nand procedures in place for managing both counterparty credit and \noperational risks. Chairman Gensler underscores that this would get \ndirectly at the problem of ``too big to fail'' by stating: ``Central \nclearing would greatly reduce both the size of dealers as well as the \ninterconnectedness between Wall Street banks, their customers and the \neconomy.'' Moreover, increased clearing and regulated electronic \ntrading will make the market more transparent, which will ultimately \ngive investors better pricing.\n  A strong clearing requirement, however, should not be swallowed by \nlarge exemptions that circumvent the rules. While I am sympathetic to \nconcerns about increased costs raised by nonfinancial corporations that \nuse interest rate and currency swaps for hedging purposes, any \nexemption of this sort should be narrowly crafted. For example, it \nmight be limited to transactions where non-financial corporations use \nOTC derivatives in a way that qualifies for GAAP hedge accounting \ntreatment. In any case, we should recognize more explicitly that when \nsuch derivatives contracts are provided by too big to fail banks, the \nend users are in effect splitting the hidden taxpayer subsidy with the \nbig banks. And remember that this subsidy is not only hidden--it is \nalso dangerous, because it is central to the incentives to become \nbigger and to take more risk once any financial firm is large.\n  Given that one of the key objectives behind increased clearing is to \nreduce counterparty credit risk, it also seems reasonable that \nderivatives legislation place meaningful constraints on the ownership \nof clearinghouses by large dealer banks.\n  Finally, we need to address the fundamental conflicts of interest on \nWall Street. While separating commercial banking from investment \nbanking is a critical step, there are still inherent conflicts within \nthe modern investment banking model.\n  Let's take the example of auction rate securities. Brokers at UBS and \nother firms marketed these products, which were issued by \nmunicipalities and not-for-profit entities, as ``safe, liquid cash \nalternatives'' to retail investors even though they were really long-\nterm debt instruments whose interest rates would reset periodically \nbased upon the results of Dutch auctions. In other words, these \nunsuspecting investors would be unable to sell their securities if new \nbuyers didn't enter the market, which is exactly what happened. As \ncredit concerns by insurers who guaranteed these securities drained \nliquidity from the market, bankers continued to sell these securities \nto retail clients as safe, liquid investments. There was a blatant \nconflict of interest where the banks served as broker to their retail \ncustomers while also underwriting the securities and conducting the \nauctions.\n  There is an open issue of why such transactions did not constitute \nsecurities fraud, for example under rule 10(b)5--which prohibits the \nnondisclosure of material information. Civil actions are still in \nprogress and perhaps we will learn more from the outcomes of particular \ncases. But no matter how these specific cases are resolved, we should \nmove to strengthen the legal framework that enables both private \nparties and the SEC--both civil and criminal sides--to bring successful \nenforcement actions.\n  Individuals at Enron, Merrill Lynch, and Arthur Anderson were called \nto account for their participation in fraudulent activities--and at \nleast one executive from Merrill went to prison for signing off on a \ndeal that would help manipulate Enron's earnings. But it is quite \npossible that no one will be held to account, either in terms of \ncriminal or civil penalties, due to the deception and misrepresentation \nmanifest in our most recent credit cycle. We must work hard to remove \nall the loopholes that helped create this unfair and unreasonable set \nof outcomes.\n  We can begin by strengthening investor protection. Currently, brokers \nare not subject to a fiduciary standard as financial advisors are, but \nonly subject to a ``suitability'' requirement when selling securities \nproducts to investors. Hence, brokers don't have to be guided by their \ncustomers' best interest when recommending investment product \nofferings--they might instead be focused on increasing their \ncompensation by pushing proprietary financial products. I am not saying \nthey are doing that, but we have to be aware and deal with clear \nconflicts of interest. By harmonizing the standards that brokers and \nfinancial advisors face and by better disclosing broker compensation, \nretail investors will be able to make better, more informed investment \ndecisions. Even Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, has stated \nthat he ``support[s] the extension of a fiduciary standard to broker/\ndealer registered representatives who provide advice to retail \ninvestors. The fiduciary standard puts the interests of the client \nfirst. The advice-giving functions of brokers who work with investors \nhave become similar to that of investment advisers.''\n  It has also become known that some firms underwrite securities--\npromoting them to investors--and then short these same securities \nwithin a week and without disclosing this fact, which any reasonable \ninvestor would regard as adverse material information. In the \nstructured finance arena, investment banks sold pieces of \ncollateralized debt obligations--which were packages of different \nasset-backed securities divided into different risk classes--to their \nclients and then took--proceeded to take short positions in those \nsecurities by purchasing credit default swaps. Some banks went further \nby shorting mortgage indexes tied to securities they were selling to \nclients and by shorting their counterparties in the CDS market. This is \nhow a firm such as Goldman Sachs could claim that they were effectively \nhedged to an AIG collapse.\n  Unfortunately, the use of products like CDS in this way allows the \nbanks to become empty creditors who stand to make more money if people \nand companies default on their debts than if they actually paid them. \nThese and other problematic practices that place financial firms' \ninterests against those of their clients need to be restricted. They \nalso completely violate the spirit of our seminal legislation from the \n1930s, which insisted--for the first time--that the sellers and \nunderwriters of securities disclose all material information. This is \nnothing less than a return to the unregulated days of the 1920s; to be \nsure, those days were heady and exciting, but only for a while--such \npractices always end in a major crash, with the losses \ndisproportionately incurred by small and unsuspecting investors.\n  Investors should also have greater recourse through our judicial \nsystem. For example, auditors, accountants, bankers and other \nprofessionals that are complicit in corporate fraud should be held \naccountable. That is why I worked on a bill with Senators Specter and \nReed to allow for private civil\n\n[[Page S1421]]\n\nactions against individuals who knowingly or recklessly aid or abet a \nviolation of securities laws.\n\n  Admittedly, this is not an exhaustive list of financial reforms. I \nalso believe we need to reconstitute our system of consumer financial \nprotection, which was a major failure before our last crisis. We must \nhave an independent Consumer Financial Protection Agency, CFPA, that \nhas strong and autonomous rulemaking authority and the ability to \nenforce those rules at nonbanking entities like payday lenders and \nmortgage finance companies. Most importantly, the head of this agency \nmust not be subject to the authority of any regulator responsible for \nthe ``safety and soundness'' of the financial institutions.\n  This is basic. If you are involved, like most of our banking \nregulatory agencies, in the Treasury, their primary responsibility is \nthe safety and soundness of those financial institutions. We need an \norganization such as the CFPA, which looks out totally for the interest \nof consumers and consumers alone.\n  Unfortunately, like the public option in healthcare, the CFPA issue \nhas become something of a ``shiny object''--though certainly an \nimportant one--that has distracted the focus of debate away from the \ncore issues of ``too big to fail.''\n  Beginning with the solutions for ``too big to fail,'' each of these \nchallenges represents a crucial step along the way towards fixing a \nregulatory system that has permitted both large and small failures. \nEach is an important piece to the puzzle.\n  I know there are those who will disagree with some, and perhaps all \nof these proposals. They sincerely advocate a path of incrementalism, \nof achieving small reforms over time. They say that problems as complex \nas these need to be solved by the regulators, not by Congress. After \nall, they are the ones with the expertise.\n  I respectfully disagree.\n  Giving more authority to the regulators is not a complete solution. \nWhile I support having a systemic risk council and a consolidated bank \nregulator, these are necessary but not sufficient reforms--the \nPresident's Working Group on Financial Markets has actually played a \nrole in the past similar to that of the proposed council, but to no \ndiscernible effect. I do not see how these proposals alone will address \nthe key issue of ``too big to fail.''\n  In the brief history I outlined earlier, the regulators sat idly by \nas our financial institutions bulked up on short-term debt to finance \nlarge inventories of collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime \nloans and leveraged loans that financed speculative buyouts in the \ncorporate sector.\n  They could have sounded the alarm bells and restricted this behavior, \nbut they did not. They could have raised capital requirements, but \ninstead farmed out this function to credit rating agencies and the \nbanks themselves. They could have imposed consumer-related protections \nsooner and to a greater degree, but they did not. The sad reality is \nthat regulators had substantial powers, but chose to abdicate their \nresponsibilities.\n  What is more, regulators are almost completely dependent on the \ninformation, analysis and evidence as presented to them by those with \nwhom they are charged with regulating. Last year, former Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, once the paragon of laissez-faire \ncapitalism, stated that ``it is clear that the levels of complexity to \nwhich market practitioners, at the height of their euphoria, carried \nrisk management techniques and risk-product design were too much for \neven the most sophisticated market players to handle properly and \nprudently.'' I submit that if these institutions that employ such \ntechniques are too complex to manage, then they are surely too complex \nto regulate.\n  That is why I believe that reorganizing the regulators and giving \nthem additional powers and responsibilities isn't the answer. We cannot \nsimply hope that chastened regulators or newly appointed ones will do a \nbetter job in the future, even if they try their hardest. Putting our \nhopes in a resolution authority is an illusion. It is like the \nharbormaster in Southampton adding more lifeboats to the Titanic, \nrather than urging the ship to steer clear of the icebergs. We need to \nbreak up these institutions before they fail, not stand by with a plan \nwaiting to catch them when they do fail.\n  Without drawing hard lines that reduce size and complexity, large \nfinancial institutions will continue to speculate confidently, knowing \nthat they will eventually be funded by the taxpayer if necessary. As \nlong as we have ``too big to fail'' institutions, we will continue to \ngo through what Professor Johnson and Peter Boone of the London School \nof Economics has termed ``doomsday'' cycles of booms, busts and \nbailouts, a so-called ``doom loop'' as Andrew Haldane, who is \nresponsible for financial stability at the Bank of England, describes \nit.\n  The notion that the most recent crisis was a ``once in a century'' \nevent is a fiction. Former Treasury Secretary Paulson, National \nEconomic Council Chairman Larry Summers, and J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie \nDimon all concede that financial crises occur every 5 years or so.\n  Without clear and enforceable rules that address the unintended \nconsequences of unchecked financial innovation and which adequately \nprotect investors, our markets will remain subverted.\n  These solutions are among the cornerstones of fundamental and \nstructural financial reform. With them we can build a regulatory system \nthat will endure for generations instead of one that will be laid bare \nby an even bigger crisis in perhaps just a few years or a decade's \ntime. We built a lasting regulatory edifice in the midst of the Great \nDepression, and it lasted for nearly half a century. I only hope we \nhave both the fortitude and the foresight to do so again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1421-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IRAN REFINED PETROLEUM SANCTIONS ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.

In fact, my friend, the majority leader, said: Lamar, you \nare not entitled to your own facts. I think he is right about that. We \nwant to use the real facts. But the American people, once again, seem \nto have understood the real facts.\n  In the Wall Street Journal yesterday, March 10, there was an article \nby Scott Rasmussen and Doug Schoen. Mr. Rasmussen is an independent \npollster, and Mr. Schoen was President Clinton's pollster. Here is one \nof the things they said. We were saying, with respect to the President: \nMr. President, your plan will increase the deficit. This is a time when \nmany people in America believe the deficit is growing at an alarming \nrate and will bring the country to its knees in a few years if we do \nnot do something about it. The President and his Democratic colleagues \nsaid: No, the Congressional Budget Office says we do not increase the \ndeficit.\n  The American people do not believe that, according to Mr. Rasmussen \nand Mr. Schoen.

Because not included in \nthe comprehensive health care plan that the President has yet to send \nup--we do not have a bill yet. We have an 11-page memo which is \nsuggested recommendations in a 2,700-page Senate bill. We do not have a \nbill. But the plan does not include what it costs to prevent the \nplanned 22 percent pay cuts for doctors that serve Medicare patients \nover the next 10 years. According to the President's own budget--and \nPaul Ryan, the Congressman from Wisconsin, brought this up at the \nsummit--that costs $371 billion over 10 years.\n  Let me say that once more. What we are being asked to believe is, \nhere is a comprehensive health care plan that does not add to the debt, \nbut it does not include what it costs to prevent the planned 22 percent \npay cuts for doctors that serve Medicare patients. That is akin to \nasking you to come to a horse race without a horse. Does anybody \nbelieve a comprehensive health care plan is complete and comprehensive \nif it does not include what you actually are going to pay doctors to \nsee Medicare patients? Of course not. You have to include that in \nthere. That adds $371 billion to the President's proposal, and that, by \nitself, makes it clear the proposal adds to the deficit.\n  The Senator from Arizona is here, and I say this to the Senator. Also \nin the article in the Wall Street Journal it said:\n\n       Fifty-nine percent of the voters say that the biggest \n     problem with the health care system is the cost. . . .\n\n  That is what we have been saying over and over again. Let's don't \nexpand a program that costs too much. Let's fix the program by reducing \ncosts.\n  According to the survey--remember this is an independent pollster and \na Democratic pollster:\n\n       Fifty-nine percent of voters say that the biggest problem \n     with the health care system is the cost: They want reform \n     that will bring down the cost of care. For these voters, the \n     notion that you need to spend an additional trillion dollars \n     doesn't make sense. If the program is supposed to save money, \n     why does it cost anything at all?\n\nAsked the pollsters.\n  I ask the Senator from Arizona that question. If this program is \nsupposed to save money, reduce costs, why does it cost anything at all?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I say to my friend, obviously, the \nanswer to that question is, they continue to go back to the \nCongressional Budget Office with different assumptions in order to get \nthe answers they want when the American people have figured it out.\n  Again, I know my friend from Tennessee saw yesterday's news, which \nhas to be considered in the context of the cost of this bill, which \nCongressman Ryan estimates at around $2.5 trillion with true budgeting \nover 10 years. But we cannot ignore the fundamental fact that ``the \ngovernment ran up''--this is an AP article yesterday:\n\n       The government ran up the largest monthly deficit in \n     history in February, keeping the flood of red ink on track to \n     top last year's record for the full year.\n\n  The Treasury Department said Wednesday that the February deficit \ntotaled $220.9 billion, 14 percent higher than the previous record set \nin February of last year.\n\n       The deficit through the first 5 months of this budget year \n     totals $651.6 billion, 10.5 percent higher than a year ago.\n       The Obama administration is projecting that the deficit for \n     the 2010 budget year will hit an all-time high of $1.56 \n     trillion, surpassing last year's of $1.4 trillion total.\n\n  I say to my friend from Tennessee, these are numbers that in our \nyounger years we would not believe. We would not believe we could be \nrunning up these kinds of deficits. Yet we hear from the President and \nfrom the administration that things are getting better--certainly not \nfrom the debt we are laying onto future generations of Americans.\n  May I mention also in this context--I wonder if my friend from \nTennessee will agree with me that there is so much anger out there over \nporkbarrel spending and earmark spending that the Speaker of the House \nsaid they are going to ban earmarks in the other body for for-profit \ncompanies. I think that is a step forward. Why not ban them all? \nImmediately they would set up shadow outfits.\n  Chairman Obey says that would be 1,000 earmarks. In one bill last \nyear, there were 9,000 earmarks. So why don't we take the final step \nand put a moratorium on earmarks until we have a balanced budget, until \nthere is no more deficit? I think that is what the American people \nwanted to get rid of--this corruption that continues there.\n  But I would also mention to my friend from Tennessee very briefly \nthat the President, when he and I sat next to each other at Blair \nHouse, and I talked about the special deals for the special interests \nand the unsavory deal that was cut with PhRMA and how the American \npeople are as angry about the process as the product, the President's \nresponse to me was--and there is a certain accuracy associated with \nit--the campaign is over.\n  Well, I would remind my friend that before the campaign--even before \nthe campaign--when the President was still a Senator, he said this \nabout reconciliation:\n\n       You know, the Founders designed this system, as frustrating \n     [as] it is, to make sure that there's a broad consensus \n     before the country moves forward. . . . And what we have now \n     is a president who--\n\n  And there he was referring to President Bush--\n\n     hasn't gotten his way. And that is now prompting, you know, a \n     change in the Senate rules that really I think would change \n     the character of the Senate forever. . . . And what I worry \n     about would be you essentially have still two chambers--the \n     House and the Senate--but you have simply majoritarian \n     absolute power on either side, and that's just not what the \n     founders intended.\n\n  That was a statement by then-Senator Barack Obama. Then he went on to \nsay:\n\n       I would try to get a unified effort saying this is a \n     national emergency to do something about this. We need the \n     Republicans, we need the Democrats.\n\n  Just yesterday, of course, at rallies around the country, he said: It \nis time to vote.\n  It is time to vote, is his message, which certainly is attractive. We \nwill be glad to vote. But we want to vote preserving the institution of \nthe Senate and the 60-vote rule.\n  In the interest of full disclosure, Republicans, when they were in \nthe majority, tried to change it, as the Senator from Tennessee \nremembers. But the fact is, if we take away the 60-vote majority that \nhas characterized the way this body has proceeded, we would then have \njust what then-Senator Obama said:\n\n       You essentially have still two Chambers--the House and the \n     Senate--but you have simply majoritarian absolute power on \n     either side, and that's just not what the founders intended.\n\n  I wonder if my colleague from Tennessee would like to comment on \nwhether the President still believes that is not what the Founders \nintended.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from Arizona \nbringing this up, and I think it is important for the American people \nto be reminded that the Senator from Arizona has a certain amount of \ncredibility on this matter because about 4 years ago--when we were in \nthe majority and we became frustrated because\n\n[[Page S1423]]\n\nDemocrats were blocking President Bush's judicial appointments--it was \nthe Republicans who said--I didn't, but some Republicans said--well, \nlet's just jam it through. We won the election, let's get it with 51 \nvotes. Let's change the rules.\n  But Senator McCain and a group of others said: Wait just a minute. He \nsaid then what he has said just today. He said the U.S. Founders set up \nthe Senate to be a protector of minority rights. As Senator Byrd, the \nsenior Democratic Senator, has said: Sometimes the minority is right. \nAnd it was Alexis de Tocqueville who said, when he wrote his \nobservations about our country in the 1830s, that potentially the \ngreatest threat to American democracy is the tyranny of the majority.\n  This is supposed to be a place where decisions are made based upon \nconsensus, not just a majority. As Senator Byrd has said: Running the \nhealth care bill through the Senate like a freight train is an outrage. \nIt would be an outrage.\n  I would ask the Senator from Arizona whether he believes it is not \njust the higher premiums and the higher taxes and the extra costs to \nStates; that, in the end, the reason this health care bill is so deeply \nunpopular is because of the process because, first, there were 25 days \nof secret meetings, and now they are jamming it through by a partisan \nvote. Something this big, this important ought to be decided by \nconsensus in the Senate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would also remind my friend from Tennessee of Senator \nByrd's comments regarding reconciliation and health care reform.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord Senator Robert Byrd's statement on the floor of the Senate from \nApril of 2001.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Senator Byrd on the Use of Reconciliation for the Clinton Health Plan\n\n       U.S. Senator Robert Byrd on the Floor of the Senate in \n     April of 2001 explaining his objection to using \n     reconciliation to pass controversial health care legislation \n     (Clinton plan):\n       ``The democratic leadership pleaded with me at length to \n     agree to support the idea that the Clinton health care bill \n     should be included in that year's reconciliation package. \n     President Clinton got on the phone and called me also and \n     pressed me to allow his massive health care bill to be \n     insulated by reconciliation's protection. I felt that changes \n     as dramatic as the Clinton health care package, which would \n     affect every man, woman and child in the United States should \n     be subject to scrutiny.\n       ``I said Mr. President, I cannot in good conscience turn my \n     face the other way. That's why we have a Senate. To amend and \n     debate freely. And that health bill, as important as it is, \n     is so complex, so far-reaching that the people of this \n     country need to know what's in it. And, moreover, Mr. \n     President, we Senators need to know what's in it before we \n     vote. And he accepted that. He accepted that. Thanked me and \n     said good bye.''\n       ``I could not, I would not, and I did not allow that \n     package to be handled in such a cavalier manner. It was the \n     threat of the use of the Byrd rule.''\n       ``Reconciliation was never, never, never intended to be a \n     shield, to be used as a shield for controversial \n     legislation.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me explain his objection to using reconciliation to \npass controversial health care legislation by quoting from Senator \nRobert Byrd:\n\n       The Democratic leadership pleaded with me at length to \n     agree to support the idea that the Clinton health care bill \n     should be included in that year's reconciliation package. \n     President Clinton got on the phone and called me also and \n     pressed me to allow his massive health care bill to be \n     insulated by reconciliation's protection. I felt that changes \n     as dramatic as the Clinton health care package, which would \n     affect every man, woman child in the United States would be \n     subject to scrutiny.\n       I said, Mr. President, I cannot in good conscience turn my \n     face the other way. That's why we have a Senate. To amend and \n     debate freely. And that health bill, as important as it is, \n     is so complex, so far-reaching that the people of this \n     country need to know what's in it.\n\n  Let me note here what the Speaker of the House said on March 9:\n\n       We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is \n     in it.\n\n  Now, continuing to quote from Senator Robert Byrd:\n\n       And, moreover, Mr. President, we Senators need to know \n     what's in it before we vote. And he accepted that. He \n     accepted that. Thanked me and said good bye.\n       I could not, I would not, and I did not allow that package \n     to be handled in such a cavalier manner. It was the threat of \n     the use of the Byrd rule. Reconciliation was never, never, \n     never intended to be a shield, to be used as a shield for \n     controversial legislation.\n\n  I might also point out that the Senator from Tennessee mentioned the \nprocess. I don't think the American people understand that if the House \npasses the Senate bill, every one of these sweetheart deals that were \nincluded behind closed-door negotiations in the majority leader's \noffice and in the White House will remain in that bill. We Republicans \nhave all signed a letter, 41 votes, that we will not accept any change \nor amendment, whether it is good or bad, because we oppose the use of \nreconciliation, as Robert Byrd did so eloquently back in 2001.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if the Senator from Arizona would agree with \nme that what is happening is the President is inviting the House \nDemocrats to join hands and jump off a cliff and hope Senator Reid \ncatches them.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the C-SPAN cameras be in those meetings, I would ask \nmy friend?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Well, when they jump, they may be. But Senator Reid \nand his Democratic colleagues, I would say to my friend from Arizona, \nare not going to have any incentive to catch these House Members who \nvote for the bill because the President will have already signed it \ninto law, and he will be well on his way to Indonesia, as the Senator \nfrom Arizona has just said. We have 41 Republican Senators who have \nsigned a letter saying that you are not going to make new deals and \nsend them over here and change them by reconciliation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record an article entitled ``Health-Care Reform's Sickeningly \nSweet Deals'' by Kathleen Parker, which appeared in the Washington Post \non Wednesday, March 10.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 10, 2010]\n\n              Health-Care Reform's Sickeningly Sweet Deals\n\n                          (By Kathleen Parker)\n\n       ``Skipping through the Candy Land of the health-care bill, \n     one is tempted to hum a few bars of ``Let Me Call You \n     Sweetheart.''\n       ``What a deal. For dealmakers, that is. Not so much for \n     American taxpayers, who have been misled into thinking that \n     the sweetheart deals have been excised.''\n       ``Not only are the deals still there, but they're bigger \n     and worser, as the Bard gave us permission to say. And the \n     health-care ``reform'' bill is, consequently, more expensive \n     by billions.''\n       ``Yes, gone (sort of) is the so-called Cornhusker kickback, \n     extended to Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson when his 60th vote \n     needed a bit of coaxing. Meaning, Nelson is no longer \n     special. Instead, everyone is. All states now will get their \n     own Cornhusker kickbacks. And everything is beautiful in its \n     own way.''\n       ``Originally, Nelson had secured 100 percent federal \n     funding for Nebraska's Medicaid expansion--in perpetuity--\n     among other hidden prizes to benefit locally based insurance \n     companies. When other states complained about the unfair \n     treatment, President Obama and Congress ``fixed'' it by \n     increasing the federal share of Medicaid to all states \n     through 2017, after which all amounts are supposed to \n     decrease.''\n       ``Nelson's deal might have escaped largely unnoticed, if \n     not for his pivotal role on the Senate vote last December. \n     The value of what he originally negotiated for Nebraska--\n     about $100 million--wasn't that much in the trillion-dollar \n     scheme of things, but the cost of the ``fix'' runs in the \n     tens of billions, according to a health lobbyist who crunched \n     the numbers for me.''\n       Other sweetheart provisions that remain in the bill include \n     special perks for Florida (``Gatorade''), Louisiana (``The \n     Louisiana Purchase''), Nevada, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota \n     and Utah (``The Frontier States''). There may well be others, \n     and staffers on the Hill, who come to work each day equipped \n     with espresso shooters, magnifying glasses and hair-\n     splitters, are sifting through the stacks of verbiage.\n       Wearily, one might concede that this is, well, politics as \n     usual. But weren't we supposed to be finished with backroom \n     deals? Whither the transparency of the Promised Land?\n       To his credit, Obama conceded McCain's point in a post-\n     summit letter to Congress, noting that some provisions had \n     been added to the legislation that shouldn't have been. His \n     own proposal does not include the Medicare Advantage \n     provision mentioned by McCain that allowed extra benefits for \n     Florida, as well as other states. The president also \n     mentioned that his plan eliminates the Nebraska yum-yum (not \n     his term), ``replacing it with additional federal financing \n     to all states for the expansion of Medicaid.''\n       More fair? Sure, but at mind-boggling cost to taxpayers. To \n     correct a $100 million mistake, we'll spend tens of billions \n     instead.\n\n[[Page S1424]]\n\n       Throughout the health-care process, the Democrats' modus \n     operandi has been to offer a smarmy deal and then, when \n     caught, to double down rather than correct course. The \n     proposed tax on high-end ``Cadillac'' insurance policies to \n     help defray costs is another case in point. Pushed by the \n     President, and initially passed by the Senate, the tax was \n     broadly viewed as an effective way to bend the cost curve \n     down. But then labor unions came knocking and everyone caved. \n     The tax will be postponed until 2018.\n       And the cost of the union compromise? According to the \n     Congressional Budget Office, the original Cadillac tax would \n     have saved the Treasury $149 billion from 2013 to 2019. Under \n     the postponed tax, the savings will probably plunge to just \n     $65 billion, or a net loss to the Treasury of $84 billion.\n       Regardless of what the CBO reports in the coming days, no \n     one can claim the bill is as lean as it could be. A spoonful \n     of sugar may indeed help the medicine go down, but even King \n     Kandy and the Gingerbread People can choke on too many \n     sweets.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think Kathleen Parker says it best, and let me quote \nfrom her article:\n\n       Skipping through the Candy Land of the health-care bill, \n     one is tempted to hum a few bars of ``Let Me Call You \n     Sweetheart.'' What a deal. For dealmakers, that is. Not so \n     much for American taxpayers, who have been misled into \n     thinking the sweetheart deals have been excised.\n\n  That is why I say to my friend from Tennessee, it is important the \nAmerican people understand that the Senate bill cannot be changed \nwithout coming back to the Senate. Therefore, all these deals they have \npledged to remove will be in the bill that will be voted on by the \nother body--the ``Cornhusker kickback,'' which, by the way, had to \nsecure 100 percent Federal funding for Nebraska's Medicaid expansion in \nperpetuity, among other hidden prizes to benefit locally based \ninsurance companies. When other States complained about the unfair \ntreatment, President Obama and Congress fixed it by increasing the \nFederal share of Medicaid to all States through 2017, after which all \namounts are supposed to decrease. But they didn't fix it.\n  Anyway, I think it is important for us to understand that these \nsweetheart deals have not been removed and that we are in opposition to \nthis entire reconciliation which would lead to the erosion and eventual \ndestruction of the 60-vote procedure that has characterized the way the \nSenate has operated.\n  I have been in the majority, and I have been in the minority, and \nwhen I have been in the majority, we have been frustrated by the 60-\nvote rule and vice versa. Some of the people who are doing the greatest \ncomplaining and arguing about the fact that we have a 60-vote rule are \nthe same ones who were the most steadfast defenders of it in past years \nwhen they were in the minority. That alone is enough argument for us to \nleave the process alone.\n  I believe historians will show that there are times where the 60-vote \nrule, because of the exigency of the moment, averted us from taking \nactions; and later on, in perhaps calmer times, we were glad that we \ndid not act at that time.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from \nArizona for his consistency, for 5 years ago saying to members of his \nown party that the Senate is a place where minority rights are \nprotected. As Senator Byrd has said, sometimes the minority is right. \nIt slows things down, yes; but it forces us to get it right.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the editorial \nfrom the Wall Street Journal to which I referred a little earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n              Why Obama Can't Move the Health-Care Numbers\n\n                  (By Scott Rasmussen and Doug Schoen)\n\n       One of the more amazing aspects of the health-care debate \n     is how steady public opinion has remained. Despite repeated \n     and intense sales efforts by the president and his allies in \n     Congress, most Americans consistently oppose the plan that \n     has become the centerpiece of this legislative season.\n       In 15 consecutive Rasmussen Reports polls conducted over \n     the past four months, the percentage of Americans that oppose \n     the plan has stayed between 52% and 58%. The number in favor \n     has held steady between 38% and 44%.\n       The dynamics of the numbers have remained constant as well. \n     Democratic voters strongly support the plan while Republicans \n     and unaffiliated voters oppose it. Senior citizens--the \n     people who use the health-care system more than anybody else \n     and who vote more than anybody else in mid-term elections--\n     are more opposed to the plan than younger voters. For every \n     person who strongly favors it, two are strongly opposed.\n       Why can't the president move the numbers? One reason may be \n     that he keeps talking about details of the proposal while \n     voters are looking at the issue in a broader context. Polling \n     conducted earlier this week shows that 57% of voters believe \n     that passage of the legislation would hurt the economy, while \n     only 25% believe it would help. That makes sense in a nation \n     where most voters believe that increases in government \n     spending are bad for the economy.\n       When the president responds that the plan is deficit \n     neutral, he runs into a pair of basic problems. The first is \n     that voters think reducing spending is more important than \n     reducing the deficit. So a plan that is deficit neutral with \n     a big spending hike is not going to be well received.\n       But the bigger problem is that people simply don't trust \n     the official projections. People in Washington may live and \n     die by the pronouncements of the Congressional Budget Office, \n     but 81% of voters say it's likely the plan will end up \n     costing more than projected. Only 10% say the official \n     numbers are likely to be on target.\n       As a result, 66% of voters believe passage of the \n     president's plan will lead to higher deficits and 78% say \n     it's at least somewhat likely to mean higher middle-class \n     taxes. Even within the president's own political party there \n     are concerns on these fronts.\n       A plurality of Democrats believe the health-care plan will \n     increase the deficit and a majority say it will likely mean \n     higher middle-class taxes. At a time when voters say that \n     reducing the deficit is a higher priority than health-care \n     reform, these numbers are hard to ignore.\n       The proposed increase in government spending creates \n     problems for advocates of reform beyond the perceived impact \n     on deficits and the economy.\n       Fifty-nine percent of voters say that the biggest problem \n     with the healthcare system is the cost: They want reform that \n     will bring down the cost of care. For these voters, the \n     notion that you need to spend an additional trillion dollars \n     doesn't make sense. If the program is supposed to save money, \n     why does it cost anything at all?\n       On top of that, most voters expect that passage of the \n     congressional plan will increase the cost of care at the same \n     time it drives up government spending. Only 17% now believe \n     it will reduce the cost of care.\n       The final piece of the puzzle is that the overwhelming \n     majority of voters have insurance coverage, and 76% rate \n     their own coverage as good or excellent. Half of these voters \n     say it's likely that if the congressional health bill becomes \n     law, they would be forced to switch insurance coverage--a \n     prospect hardly anyone ever relishes. These numbers have \n     barely moved for months: Nothing the president has said has \n     reassured people on this point.\n       The reason President Obama can't move the numbers and build \n     public support is because the fundamentals are stacked \n     against him. Most voters believe the current plan will harm \n     the economy, cost more than projected, raise the cost of \n     care, and lead to higher middle-class taxes.\n       That's a tough sell when the economy is hurting and people \n     want reform to lower the cost of care. It's also a tough sell \n     for a president who won an election by promising tax cuts for \n     95% of all Americans.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Wyoming be allowed to lead the colloquy in our remaining \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, may I ask the Senator from Wyoming if is \nhe aware of a letter written to House leadership, representing, I \nbelieve, 85,000 physicians who oppose this legislation?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I am not aware of that article, but I look forward to \nhearing about it from my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me quote a little for my colleague, Dr. Barrasso:\n\n       The undersigned state and national specialty medical \n     societies--representing more than 85,000 physicians and the \n     millions of patients they serve--are writing to oppose \n     passage of the ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act.'' The changes that were recently proposed by President \n     Obama do not address our many concerns with this legislation, \n     and we therefore urge you to draft a more patient-centered \n     bill that will reform the country's flawed system for \n     financing healthcare, while preserving the best healthcare in \n     the world.\n\n  At this point, I want to ask my friend, the doctor, isn't it true \nthat included in this legislation remains the so-called doc fix, and \nthat there will be a 21-percent cut in doctors payments for treatment \nof Medicare enrollees? There is no one in America who believes that cut \nwill actually be enacted, which then makes the comments by supporters \nof this bill false on their face--just that alone. I believe that is \n$371 billion; is that correct?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. My colleague is absolutely correct. That is exactly \nwhat is happening. They call this a health\n\n[[Page S1425]]\n\ncare bill. It doesn't seem to address the major issues that patients \nacross the country are concerned about. My colleague is absolutely \nright, we need a patient-centered approach. It doesn't address the \nissue that doctors are concerned about, which is the issue of making \nsure a doctor and a patient can work together toward the best health \nfor that patient.\n  Doctors and patients alike are very much opposed to this bill. When \nSenator McCain talks about the doctor fix to make this bill work, they \nsay they are going to cut doctors across the country 21 percent in what \nthey get paid for taking care of patients who depend upon Medicare for \ntheir health care, and then keep that price frozen for the next 10 \nyears. That is the only way the Democrats can say, well, this actually \nsaves money. In reality, in terms of health care in the country, it \ndoes not.\n  This bill, if it passes, is going to end up costing patients more. It \nis going to interfere with the doctor-patient relationship. It is going \nto result in an America where people truly believe their personal \ncare--and that is what people care about: What is in it for me? How \nwill this bill affect me and my life and my children? If they are \nproviding for adult care, how is it going to affect their parents? They \nbelieve the care they receive, in terms of the quality of care and the \navailable care they receive, it is going to be worse. They believe it \nis going to end up costing more. That is why, in a recent poll this \nweek, 57 percent of Americans say this plan, if it passes, will hurt \nthe economy. We are at a time where we are at 9.7 percent unemployment \nin this country. People are looking for work, and the place people find \njobs in this economy right now seems to be working for the government.\n\n  For decades and decades, the engine that drives the economy of our \nNation has been small businesses. That is who we rely upon to stimulate \nthe economy and get job growth. That is who we should be relying on, \nnot Washington, not the Federal Government. That is why 57 percent of \nAmericans who are focused on the economy say we believe this economy \nwill be hurt if this bill passes.\n  People are focused on the debt and the cost, and 81 percent of \nAmericans say it is going to cost more than estimated because of the \nfact, as Senator McCain has said, that doctors are going to be cut 21 \npercent across the board and continue for the next 10 years with their \nMedicare fees. The people of America realize that is not going to work \nfor health care. People are going to say how am I going to get to see a \ndoctor? I am on Medicare. I want to see a doctor. That is why people \nbelieve Medicare in their own personal care is going to get worse if \nthis bill passes.\n  Then the President promised we are not going to raise taxes on \nanyone. Seventy-eight percent of Americans believe there will be \nmiddle-class tax hikes if this passes. That is why people are opposed \nto a bill that cuts $500 billion from Medicare for our seniors who \ndepend on Medicare for their health care. It is not just cutting \npayments to doctors; it is to hospitals, to nursing homes where we have \nso many seniors across the country. It affects home health agencies, \nwhich is a lifeline for people who are at home, and keeps them out of \nthe hospitals. They are even going to cut payments for people who are \nin hospice care, who are at the terminal point, who are in the final \ndays of their life. They are cutting that out.\n  All of these are reasons the American people say I am not for this \nbill and it is time to stop. Half of America says stop and start over. \nOne in four says stop completely. Only one in four actually believes \nthis is going to help. That is not a way to pass legislation in this \ncountry. That is not a way to find something the American people agree \nwith. That is not the way to get successful implementation of a \nprogram. I spent 5 years in the Wyoming State Senate. On major pieces \nof legislation, we always sought broad bipartisan support because if \nyou have broad bipartisan support, then people all around the community \nand the country would say this must be the right solution to a \nsignificant problem we are facing.\n  We are facing a problem with health care in this country and we need \nhealth care reform. We just do not need this bill that cuts Medicare, \nraises taxes, and for the most part most Americans will tell you they \nbelieve their own personal care will suffer as a result of this bill \nbecoming law. For whatever means or mechanism or parliamentary tricks \nare used to try to cram this bill through and cram it down the throats \nof the American people, the American people want to say no, thank you. \nThey are saying it in a less polite way than just saying no, thank you. \nThey are calling, they are showing up, they are turning out to tell \ntheir elected representatives that we do not want this bill under any \ncircumstances. Let's get to the things we can agree upon and isolate \nthose and pass those immediately, not an over-2,000-page bill that is \nloaded with new government rules and new government regulations and new \ngovernment agencies and new government employees at a time when 10 \npercent of Americans are unemployed and people are looking for work in \ncommunities around the country.\n  One of the things I found so interesting and also distressing when \nthe President says everyone will have coverage is he wants to do it by \nputting 15 million Americans on Medicaid. Having practiced medicine for \n25 years and seen all patients, regardless of ability to pay, I can \ntell you there are many doctors across the country who do not see \nMedicaid patients because what they receive in payment from the \nGovernment for seeing those patients is so little. Even the people at \nthe Congressional Budget Office--who look at this health care bill with \nthe cuts in Medicare and with so many people put on Medicaid--say one \nin five hospitals is going to be unable to stay open 10 years from now \nif this gets passed because they are not going to be able to even cover \nthe expenses of staying open. The same applies to doctors' offices and \nto nursing homes.\n  We need a program approach that is sustainable, not something like \nthis, that we know is irresponsible and unsustainable. That is what we \nare going to do if we put 15 million more people on Medicaid by sending \nthem a Medicaid card. But, as Senator Alexander has said, that is like \ngiving somebody a bus ticket when a bus is not coming--because coverage \ndoes not always equal care.\n  As a surgeon in Wyoming, I took care of people who came from Canada. \nThey came to Wyoming from Canada for health care. They had coverage in \nCanada because Canada covers all the people, but they do not get care \nin Canada. That is why 33,000 Canadians last year came to the United \nStates for surgery. Why? Because the waiting lines were so long in \nCanada. Even a Member of Parliament had cancer--and my wife is a breast \ncancer survivor--a Member of Parliament in Canada came to the United \nStates for her cancer care because the survival rates for people \ntreated in the United States are so much better. Why are they better? \nIt is more timely care.\n  People come for artificial hip replacements because they do not want \nto wait in Canada. In Canada, come Halloween--it is called trick-or-\ntreat medicine--they have spent the amount of money they are going to \nspend on a procedure, whether it is cataract surgery or total joint \nreplacement, and they say: OK, we are done. Wait until next year. Go \nget in line again.\n  I hear it time and time again in patients who come from Canada to the \nUnited States because they have coverage but they do not have care.\n  Then we look at Medicaid and Medicare and we look at the model the \nPresident has lifted up as the one that is a good model for health care \nin America, and he pointed to the Mayo Clinic, which is a wonderful \nplace with wonderful care. Yet the Mayo Clinic in Arizona said we can't \ntake more Medicare patients. They said we have to limit the number of \nMedicaid patients we take. Why? Because, by taking care are of those \npatients in the past, the Mayo Clinic has said they have lost hundreds \nand hundreds of millions of dollars because Washington is the biggest \ndeadbeat payer of all for health care.\n  When it comes to actually rejecting patients' claims, the No. 1 \nrejecter of claims in this country is Medicare. The highest percentage \nof claims rejected is Medicare, over other insurance companies. Having \npracticed medicine for 25 years, I have fought with Medicare and I \nfought with insurance companies, all on behalf of patients. When you \nare\n\n[[Page S1426]]\n\nfighting with an insurance company you can always actually appeal that \nif they reject it. It is very hard to fight with Washington.\n  This health care bill we have been debating in the Senate and is now \nbefore the House is the one where the American people say don't make me \nlive under this. Don't cut my Medicare. Don't raise my taxes. Don't \ninterfere with my relationship with my doctor. Don't make it tougher \nfor me to get care. Don't lessen the quality of that care.\n  I ask how much time I have remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the letter that Senator McCain referenced from \nthe 85,000 doctors across the country opposing the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 10, 2010.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Boehner: The \n     undersigned state and national specialty medical societies--\n     representing more than 85,000 physicians and the millions of \n     patients they serve--are writing to oppose passage of the \n     ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act'' (H.R. 3590) by \n     the House of Representatives. The changes that were recently \n     proposed by President Obama do not address our many concerns \n     with this legislation, and we therefore urge you to draft a \n     more patient-centered bill that will reform the country's \n     flawed system for financing healthcare, while preserving the \n     best healthcare in the world. While we agree that the status \n     quo is unacceptable, shifting so much control over medical \n     decisions to the federal government is not justified and is \n     not in our patients' best interest. We are therefore united \n     in our resolve to achieve health system reform that empowers \n     patients and preserves the practice of medicine--without \n     creating a huge government bureaucracy.\n       There are a number of problems associated with H.R. 3590 as \n     passed by the Senate in December, including:\n       The bill undermines the patient-physician relationship and \n     empowers the federal government with even greater authority. \n     Under the bill: 1) employers would be required to provide \n     health insurance or face financial penalties; 2) health \n     insurance packages with government-prescribed benefits will \n     be mandatory; 3) doctors would be forced to participate in \n     the flawed Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) or \n     face penalties for nonparticipation; and 4) physicians would \n     have to comply with extensive new reporting requirements \n     related to quality improvement, case management, care \n     coordination, chronic disease management, and use of health \n     information technology.\n       The bill is unsustainable from a financial standpoint. It \n     significantly expands Medicaid eligibility--shifting \n     healthcare costs to physicians who are already paid below the \n     cost of delivering care and to the states that are already \n     operating under severe budget constraints.\n       Largely unchecked by Congress or the courts, the federal \n     government would have unprecedented authority to change the \n     Medicare program through the new Independent Payment Advisory \n     Board and the new Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation. \n     Specifically, these entities could arbitrarily reduce \n     payments to physicians for valuable, life-saving care for \n     elderly patients--reducing treatment options in a dramatic \n     way. Medicare payment policy requires a broad and thorough \n     analysis, and leaving these payment policy decisions in the \n     hands of an unelected, unaccountable government body with \n     minimal Congressional oversight will negatively impact the \n     availability of quality healthcare for Americans.\n       The bill is devoid of proven medical liability reform \n     measures that have been shown to reduce costs in demonstrable \n     ways. Instead, it merely includes a grant program to \n     encourage states to test alternatives to the current civil \n     litigation system. We have ample evidence--as was recently \n     confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)--that \n     reforms such as those adopted by California, Georgia and \n     Texas decrease costs and improve patient access to care. \n     Given the fact that costs remain a significant concern, \n     Congress should enact a comprehensive set of tort reforms, \n     which will save the federal government at least $54 billion \n     over 10 years. These savings could help offset increased \n     health insurance premiums which, according to the CBO, are \n     expected to increase under the bill or other costs of the \n     bill.\n       Our concerns about this legislation also extend to what is \n     not in the bill. Two important issues include:\n       The right to privately contract is a touchstone of American \n     freedom and liberty. Patients should have the right to choose \n     their doctor and negotiate fee arrangements for those \n     services without penalty. Current Medicare patients are \n     denied that right. By guaranteeing all patients the right to \n     privately contract with their physicians--without penalty--\n     patients will have greater access to physicians and the \n     government will have budget certainty. Nothing in the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act addresses these \n     fundamental tenets, which we believe are essential components \n     of real health system reform.\n       For healthcare reform to be successful, Medicare's \n     Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) must be permanently repealed--\n     something the Senate bill fails to do. The SGR needs to be \n     replaced by a new system that also establishes realistic \n     baseline for physician services. The CBO has confirmed that a \n     significant reduction in physicians' Medicare payments will \n     reduce beneficiaries' access to services.\n       We are at a critical moment in history. America's \n     physicians deliver the best medical care in the world, yet \n     the systems that have been developed to finance the delivery \n     of that care to patients have failed. With congressional \n     action upon us, we are at a crossroads. One path accepts as \n     ``necessary'' a substantial increase in federal government \n     control over how medical care is delivered and financed. We \n     believe the better path is one that allows patients and \n     physicians to take a more direct role in their healthcare \n     decisions. By encouraging patients to own their health \n     insurance policies and by allowing them to freely exercise \n     their right to privately contract with the physician of their \n     choice, healthcare decisions will be made by patients and \n     physicians and not by the government or other third party \n     payers.\n       We urge you to change the direction of the current reform \n     efforts for the sake of our patients and our profession. We \n     have a prescription for reform that will work for all \n     Americans, and we are happy to share these solutions with you \n     to improve our nation's healthcare system.\n       Thank you for considering our views.\n           Sincerely,\n         Medical Association of the State of Alabama; Medical \n           Society of Delaware; Medical Society of the District of \n           Columbia; Florida Medical Association; Medical \n           Association of Georgia; Kansas Medical Society; \n           Louisiana State Medical Society; Missouri State Medical \n           Association; Medical Society of New Jersey; South \n           Carolina Medical Association; American Academy of \n           Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery; American \n           Association of Neurological Surgeons; American Society \n           of Breast Surgeons; American Society of General \n           Surgeons; Congress of Neurological Surgeons;Daniel H. \n           Johnson, Jr., MD, AMA President 1996-1997; Donald J. \n           Palmisano, MD, JD, FACS, AMA President 2003-2004; \n           William G.

Madam President, I rise today to honor my colleague and \nmy good friend, Oregon's State treasurer, Ben Westlund, who passed away \nthis last Sunday after a protracted battle with lung cancer. A true \nindependent voice in Oregon politics, Ben entered the legislature to \nimprove the lives of all Oregonians and he remained committed to that \ncause.\n  I first met him in 1997 when I was working for the World Affairs \nCouncil and went down to talk to the legislature about education in \nOregon. I was fortunate to start serving with him 2 years later, in \n1999. Ben was an unwavering advocate for affordable and available \nhealth care. He helped stabilize Oregon's college savings plan. He \nincreased the State's credit rating. Over the years, I worked with Ben \non many issues, including setting up Oregon's Rainy Day Fund, a savings \naccount to protect Oregon's solvency and critical programs when the \neconomy turned down. I also worked with my friend Ben Westlund to \ncreate Individual Development Accounts to help empower\n\n[[Page S1427]]\n\nlow-income families. It is a savings program matched by grants that \nhelp families buy homes, start small businesses, return to college--\npathways from poverty into middle class.\n  It speaks to Ben's belief in helping families succeed that he took a \nlead role in that program.\n  Ben's political affiliations ranged at times from Republican to \nIndependent to Democrat. But no matter what party he belonged to, his \nfocus first and foremost was always on creating a better Oregon.\n  In 2003, Ben gave one of the most passionate and moving speeches I \nhave ever witnessed in my life. He gave his speech shortly after being \ndiagnosed with cancer. He was not sure he would return to the \nlegislature, and he wanted us to know we could not retreat in the face \nof the challenge of passing reforms for affordable and quality health \ncare. He knew it was an enormous challenge, but he took his personal \nstory and turned it to the cause. His work ethic was unmatched. Ben was \nworking as recently as just last week. It was an honor to serve with \nBen in the Oregon Legislature and to consult with him as he took on new \nchallenges as Oregon's treasurer.\n  If you knew Ben, you knew he was gregarious. He lit up the room. \nEvery moment, his enthusiasm for improving our State and our world was \ninspiring. I will miss him. I am sure his passion and his presence will \nbe missed throughout our State, and I know all Oregonians join me today \nin honoring the legacy of Ben Westlund.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, my colleague and friend, Senator Merkley, \nhas spoken very eloquently about Ben Westlund, and I wanted to echo \nthose thoughts and reflect on Ben's special and unique style and \nwarmth.\n  All of us who have been around government and politics know the \nchallenge of the early-morning meeting. Folks are a little bit sleep-\ndeprived, they are looking for coffee, and maybe they are just trying \nto keep their eyes open at 7:30 or 8 a.m. Senator Merkley and I want to \ntell you a little bit about how Ben Westlund handled those meetings. \nBen Westlund was able to master, like everything else, the challenge of \nthe early-morning meeting in government. I am sure Senator Merkley \nremembers that even at that early hour, Ben Westlund would bound to the \npodium--would not walk, he would bound to the podium--and at the top of \nhis lungs, Ben Westlund would shout: Good morning, Oregon. Good \nmorning, folks. How are you doing? And within a matter of seconds, as \nSenator Merkley remembers, the entire room would be smiling and \neverybody would feel like attacking the challenge of the day. That was \nBen Westlund.\n  As Senator Merkley noted, he was always on the offensive against \ninjustice, always speaking out, for example, on health care.\n  Ben Westlund lived his life in full view. He shared his battle with \ncancer with his colleagues in the State legislature because he wanted \neverybody to know what it was like to try to wrestle with an illness.\n  He always made the point that he had all of these friends. One of our \ncolleagues, Alan Bates, for example, was there for Ben, and Ben would \nalways say: What would it have been like without Alan Bates? I have so \nmany advantages other people did not have. And that was Ben, always \nsticking up for others.\n  He and I were trading calls before he passed--I think Senator Merkley \nwill identify with this--because I think Ben was prepared to give me \nheck, and maybe a little stronger, on a couple of the provisions in the \ntax legislation that I just introduced with Senator Gregg. Ben was our \ntreasurer. He had mastered the Tax Code in and out. I was trying to \nreach him because I knew that, invariably, Ben Westlund would be right, \nhe would give us good input, and his thoughts would come directly from \nthe people of Oregon. That was Ben Westlund.\n  Both of Oregon's U.S. Senators are going to deeply miss this \nwonderful man, his good counsel, and his companionship. We wanted to \ntake a couple of minutes this morning to note that Oregon has lost a \nspecial person, a special person who did so much for our State and did \na lot for our country as well.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1427-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1427-S1428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FAA REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I assume we will report the FAA reauthorization bill \nshortly, and I believe Senator Rockefeller will be on his way. He is \nchairing the Commerce Committee hearing right now. I will go over and \nchair the hearing in his stead when he comes to the floor.\n  Prior to bringing the bill to the floor today or prior to making it \nthe order of the day, let me just speak in morning business before we \nget to the bill.\n  I wanted to talk just for a minute. Yesterday, I talked about what is \nin the FAA reauthorization bill. Much of what we will discuss today is \nabout commercial aviation--getting on an airliner someplace and flying \nacross the country or across the world. But I wanted to mention that \nthere is another component to this, and that is what is called general \naviation.\n  General aviation is a very large and increasingly important component \nof air travel in this country. In a State such as my home State of \nNorth Dakota, which is a very large State and one that does not have a \ngreat deal of interstate commercial airline service, the use of private \nplanes is very prevalent, and general aviation plays a very significant \nrole in our economy.\n  I learned to fly many years ago. I am not a current pilot at all. I \nwas not even very good at it, I don't think. But I learned to fly and \ngot out of the airplane one day, when the instructor said: You are \nready. And I took off and wore this metal suit with an engine attached \nand got up about 5,000 or 6,000 feet and practiced stalls, steep turns, \nand the things that you do. So I understand a little about flying an \nairplane. It is an extraordinary thing.\n  The private pilots who have an airplane in their hangar out on the \nfarm or in a town and the small business man or woman who has a Cessna \n210 or perhaps a Cirrus or a Piper or any number of other small \nairplanes, single-engine, twin-engine, use those planes every day in \nevery way for very important purposes--to travel around the State and \nthe country to do commerce, to haul parts, to haul people. It is a very \nsignificant contribution to our economy. It is estimated that $150 \nbillion annually is added to our economy by general aviation. It is \nalso estimated that there are about 1.2 million jobs in America from \ngeneral aviation.\n  I know the thoughts people have about general aviation are \nimmediately to go to: OK, here is a big corporation flying a G-5 and \nsipping Cristal and eating strawberries dipped in chocolate, flying \nacross the country. The fact is, big corporations do have airplanes \nthat move their executives around. In most cases, they do that because \nthey want to be at a meeting in Los Angeles in the morning and in \nDallas in the afternoon and an evening meeting in New York. The only \nway they do that is through the use of private planes. It makes them \nmuch more effective and much more efficient. I understand that.\n  But much more than the large corporate jet that is flying people \naround this country, it is the smaller planes of general aviation that \nare used in all of our States in many ways across this country. You \nknow, it is true that, yes, the corporate planes and the smaller \nprivate planes in general aviation every day are flying organ \ntransplants around, flying hearts and so on around to be transplanted \nat a hospital; to reunite combat troops with their families; to take \nsomeone for cancer treatment, to an urgent appointment with a cancer \nspecialist. All of that is the case. I understand that.\n  So what I wanted to say is that the use of general aviation and the \nextensive impact it has on our economy is\n\n[[Page S1428]]\n\nsomething we also should discuss and describe in this bill. The \nlegislation we have created has things that are so important to all of \naviation--yes, commercial aviation, but to general aviation and to \nprivate pilots as well.\n  The investment, for example, in airport infrastructure, the building \nof and maintaining of runways in communities that don't have scheduled \nairline service but do have a lot of activity with private pilots \nflying in and out is very important. The general aviation portion is \nimportant. Six hundred general aviation airplanes have now brought \nfresh doctors, relief services, workers, equipment, and supplies to the \ncountry of Haiti. Six hundred private airplanes have flown in and \nlanded at airports--in most cases, airstrips--other than the airstrip \nat Port-au-Prince. That is a story that needs to be told. I have great \nadmiration for the pilots, particularly the older pilots who have been \naround and used to fly those airplanes when there weren't many rules. \nThey kind of chafe at the rules. When you meet with pilots, the older \nthey are, the more they chafe at the fact that there are now rules \nbecause in the old days you would jump in an airplane and run off, and \nyou could do almost anything.\n  We do have rules and regulations and general aviation subscribes to \nthem willingly and ably. It is an important part of our aviation \nsystem.\n  I wish to mention as well Senator Rockefeller, chairman of the \ncommittee, is now in the Chamber, and I will chair the Commerce \nCommittee hearing that is underway. I would like to take a couple \nminutes to retrace what I described yesterday. This legislation, the \nFAA Reauthorization Act, has been extended 11 times. Rather than \npassing the bill, we have extended it 11 times. Finally, at long last, \nwith the leadership of Senator Rockefeller and Senator Hutchison and \nthe work that I and Senator DeMint did on the Aviation Subcommittee, we \nhave a bill on the floor, and we want to get it done. We want to get to \nconference and finally reauthorize FAA programs. We are talking about \ninvestment in infrastructure, jobs, aviation safety. All that is \ncritically important. I have held a number of hearings now on the issue \nof aviation safety.\n  The skies, particularly with respect to the record of commercial \nairlines, are very safe. We have a great record with respect to \naviation safety. There is no question about that. But we are learning \nas well along the way from the last accident that occurred in this \ncountry that tragically killed 50 people, landing on a winter evening \nin icy conditions going into Buffalo, NY. I have held hearings on that. \nI have studied it. I have read the transcript of the cockpit voice \nrecorder. I know a fair amount about the crash. What I know is pretty \ndisconcerting. Let me describe a few things.\n  That was a Dash 8 propeller airplane, flying in ice at night. The \npilot had not slept in a bed for the two previous evenings. The copilot \nhad not slept in a bed the previous evening. The copilot was a person \nearning somewhere between $20,000 and $23,000 a year, living in \nSeattle, and the work station was flying out of Newark.\n  That copilot flew all the way from Seattle, deadheaded on a FedEx jet \nthat landed in Memphis, flew all night to go to work at Newark. The \npilot flew up from Florida in order to fly on that Colgan route. But \nyou had two people in the cockpit, according to testimony, the captain \nof which had not slept in a bed. There was no record of his sleeping in \na bed. He was in the crew lounge, where there is no bed. The captain \nhadn't slept in a bed for 2 days and the copilot for 1 day. They had \ninadequate training, with respect to stick shakers and other related \nissues. The fact is, there are a series of things that have now led us \nto understand that fatigue is an issue. There is a rulemaking on \nfatigue going on right now.\n  Administrator Babbitt has now sent that to the Office of Management \nand Budget. That is important. Training is an issue, critically \nimportant.\n  Commuting is an issue. I wish to put up this chart. This shows where \nColgan pilots commute in order to go to work. They commute from all \nover the country to Newark. There clearly is a fatigue factor. There \nhas to be some action taken on a range of these issues--training, \nfatigue, sterile cockpits, which were violated on this flight, training \nin icing, a whole series of things such as those. There is a most \nwanted list at the NTSB that has said: Here is what you must do. That \nmost wanted list, for 15 or 18 years, has had icing and fatigue on that \nlist, and the FAA has not taken appropriate action. I will speak more \nabout this, but I do have to go spell Senator Kerry, who is now \nchairing the Commerce Committee.\n  Senator Rockefeller, chairman of the committee is here, as is the \nSenator from Texas.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1428-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1428-S1429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CIAP FUNDS\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to speak about Vitter amendment \nNo. 3458. I hope, by the time I wrap up, the Members leading the \ndiscussion on this bill will be prepared to make the bill pending so I \nmay also make my amendment pending.\n  This amendment is real simple. It is about the Coastal Impact \nAssistance Program, CIAP, which was established in the Energy Policy \nAct of 2005. This program is very important for energy-producing \nStates. It takes some revenue from that energy production and leaves it \nin those States to deal with the impacts of energy production. The \nproblem is, that funding was supposed to be distributed to these States \nfrom 2007 to 2010. The entirety of it was supposed to be distributed by \nand through this year. But that has not been happening at all because \nMMS has added an additional bureaucratic layer to getting funding out \nbeyond that which was talked about and established in the statute.\n  My amendment is simple. It would get rid of that bureaucratic layer. \nIt would still retain oversight. It would still retain all the \nprotections of the statute, but it would streamline the process so this \nfunding actually gets out to the States as intended. It is way behind. \nRather than 100 percent being distributed to the States by this year, \nthey have only distributed 15 percent. Obviously, we are way behind the \n8 ball. We would accelerate that. Because this funding has already been \nallocated, this amendment does not cost anything, does not score. This \nis the same money that was allocated through the CIAP in the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005.\n  This streamlines the process. This helps us get back on track in \nterms of distributing that vital money to coastal States. It doesn't \ncost anything because all that money was supposed to be distributed by \nthis year anyway. This is important.\n\n  One of the crucial areas the Coastal Impact Assistance Program can \nhelp with in my State is related to hurricanes, all sorts of uses--\nmitigation, emergency preparedness, hurricane evacuation routes related \nto hurricanes.\n  Yesterday, hurricane forecasters predicted, unfortunately, that 2010 \nis going to be a very severe hurricane season. We are preparing for \nthat in any way we can. The fact that this CIAP funding has been \nblocked, has not gone to the coastal States, is a real problem in that \nregard. We need to do better. This amendment streamlines the process so \nwe can do better.\n  This amendment also retains the oversight mechanism in the underlying \nbill. As the plain language of CIAP in the bill says, if the Secretary \ndetermines that any expenditure made by a producing State is not \nconsistent with the underlying plan, then the State may not be \ndisbursed any further funds until repayment of the unauthorized use of \nalready obligated funds. Clearly, there is that mechanism for complete \naccountability.\n  In addition, a State CIAP plan has to be approved to begin with by \nMMS, and that has already occurred. This gets back to the intent of the \nstatute. It gets back to the timeline of the statute. It streamlines \nthat process so we can get on with it. One hundred percent of these \nfunds were supposed to be\n\n[[Page S1429]]\n\ndistributed by 2010 and, instead, we are at the 15 percent mark. That \nis simply not good enough when important use of this money is planned \non by vulnerable States such as Louisiana.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1429-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, my amendment is cosponsored by Senators \nMcCain, Graham, Coburn, Grassley, LeMieux, and Feingold. An identical \nbill has 16 cosponsors, including Senators Burr, Chambliss, Cornyn, \nCrapo, Ensign, Isakson, Johanns, Kyl, McCaskill, Risch, Sessions, and a \nnumber of others.\n  This is an amendment for a 1-year moratorium on earmarks. The fact \nthat we are even having this debate shows how out of touch Congress is \nwith the American people. I have had a chance over the last week to \nspeak to thousands of Americans in several States, and all you have to \ndo to get them on their feet cheering is say: The time for excuses and \nexplanations is over. It is time to end the practice of earmarking. And \npeople will stand up, people of both parties. They understand earmarks \nare the most offensive form of government spending. They are wasteful \nporkbarrel projects delivered by lawmakers to curry favor with small \nconstituencies back home and special interest groups. We have heard the \nexcuses for years. But it is time to end this practice.\n  I have introduced this bill before. At the time President Obama was \nrunning for President of the United States, he flew back to Washington \nto vote on it. He cosponsored the bill with me. He essentially said: \nThe era of earmarks is\n\n[[Page S1430]]\n\nover. I think we will see, as I talk a little bit more, that is the \nopposite of what is true.\n  We have all heard of the crazy earmarks that have been brought up--\nthe infamous ``bridge to nowhere.'' We have things that sound so \nridiculous that people do not even believe it is true--the tattoo \nremoval earmark, the Totally Teen Zone earmark, and the midnight \nbasketball earmark. You go through the list and you say, how does this \nmake sense in light of the fact that the same people who are asking for \nthese earmarks come onto this floor, onto the House floor, and in the \nWhite House and say: Our debt is unsustainable. It is a crisis. We \ncannot continue to spend and borrow and create debt. Yet I need $1 \nmillion for tattoo removal or a bridge to nowhere or a local museum.\n  The American people are onto us. They know it makes absolutely no \nsense for us to focus so much time and energy on parochial earmarks for \nour press releases rather than working on the issues of our country, \nthe general welfare of our Nation.\n  All of these projects add up. Last year alone, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, President Obama--who said he would not \nsign bills with earmarks--signed bills with 11,320 earmarks, totaling \n$32 billion for the last fiscal year. That is an increase from the \n$28.8 billion in earmarks in fiscal year 2008 and the $30 billion in \nearmarks in fiscal year 2009. Big and small, these earmarks are adding \nup and are causing our budget to balloon out of control, and they are \nsaddling our children with an overwhelming debt.\n  Beyond just the inherit wastefulness of earmarks themselves is the \neffect they have on spending. Quite simply, they grease the skids for \nthe wasteful spending that is bankrupting our country--the ``Cornhusker \nkickback'' being a case study at the top of the list right now.\n  Fortunately, it seems we are making some progress, some headway in \nputting an end to the favor factory we call earmarks here in \nWashington. Just this week, Roll Call reported that Speaker Pelosi is \nconsidering an earmark moratorium. Additionally, just this morning, the \nHouse Republican Conference unilaterally declared a moratorium on \nearmarks. This is an exciting first step, and I commend the Republican \nleadership in the House and all of their Members for taking a stand on \nbehalf of the American people on this issue that is so clear and \nobvious to everyone except many here in Washington.\n  It is time for the Senate to lead and demand that we stop this \nwasteful earmark spending. Keep in mind, I am not asking that we end \nthe practice forever but to take a 1-year timeout while we try to \nfigure out how to create a system that is within the scope of the \nConstitution, within the general welfare of our country, and does not \nturn this Federal Government into some kind of sponsorship of many \nlocal projects.\n  My amendment will do just that. It is very simple. It puts an end to \nearmarking by prohibiting the consideration of any bill, joint \nresolution, conference report, or message between the Houses that \ncontains earmarks. And we use the same definition currently in the \nSenate rules of what an earmark is. We require a two-thirds \nsupermajority to waive the rules. So if there is some kind of emergency \nwhere we have to designate spending, we can do it if there is a \nconsensus here.\n  President Obama, as I said, highlighted the need for this amendment \nwhen he cosponsored the identical language in 2008. He rightly stated:\n\n       We can no longer accept a process that doles out earmarks \n     based on a member of Congress' seniority, rather than the \n     merit of the project.\n\n  Despite his support and election, the problem has not gotten any \nbetter. Citizens Against Government Waste, in their 2009 Pig Book, \npointed out:\n\n       While the number of specific projects declined by 12.5 \n     percent, from 11,610 in fiscal year 2008 to 10,160 in fiscal \n     year 2009, the total tax dollars spent to fund them increased \n     by 14 percent, from $17.2 billion to $19.6 billion.\n\n  A lot of my colleagues will say: Jim, you are making a big deal out \nof nothing. Really $20 billion or $30 billion is such a small part of \nour budget that you shouldn't make an issue of it. But this is like \nsaying an engine is a small part of a train. If you want to look at \nwhat is pulling through the bad policy and the overspending, all you \nhave to do is look at earmarks.\n  So we continue the same type of wasteful projects since President \nObama spoke these words, and we need to stop it. And we can stop it. My \namendment will put these kinds of things to an end--at least for a year \nwhile we look at it. What will immediately happen if we do this? We \nhear the argument here: If we do not designate spending here in \nCongress, the executive branch will. But the first thing we would do, \nif we turned off our own earmark spigot, is every appropriations bill \nwould require that the administration only spend money according to \nnonpreferential formulas or to merit-based competitive grants. We could \nbring an end to earmarking in the executive branch as well as in \nCongress and focus the attention on the Federal Government on true \nnational interests rather than what we have now, which is nearly 535 \nCongressmen and Senators who think it is their job to come to \nWashington to get money for their States and congressional districts. \nIf you want to know what happens if we allow that to happen, you can \nlook at what is going to be at the end of this year: $14 trillion in \ndebt--when people see the Federal Government as a cow to milk rather \nthan having a constitutional oath we need to keep.\n  The time for excuses is over. Enough is enough. We are not here to \nget money for our States; we are here to fulfill our oath of office to \nprotect and defend the Constitution that would not allow money for \nlocal bridges and local roads and local museums. All of these are good \nprojects, and many of them are very necessary, but that is not the \npurpose of the Federal Government.\n  Again, I commend the Republican leadership in the House for taking a \nbold stand against the practice of earmarks. I challenge my colleagues, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to vote for this bill President Obama \ncosponsored and many here voted for so we can show America we are \nlistening, we understand that perception is reality, and the corruption \nthat takes place, the vote-buying with earmarks--the ``Cornhusker \nkickback'' and ``Louisiana purchase'' and all this we have heard \nabout--that we are going to end at least for 1 year while we prove to \nthe American people we can break this addiction to spending.\n  So, again, the amendment number is 3454. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, yesterday we made good progress on \nthe bill that is the underlying bill, which is FAA reauthorization. It \nis in the interest of the traveling public that we start on the \nglidepath to passing this bill. We need to make progress on amendments. \nBut I have to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle if they \nwould be very careful about offering amendments that are not germane to \nthis bill. The FAA reauthorization is not a legislative vehicle that \ncan carry a lot of highly controversial provisions.\n  The previous FAA reauthorization expired in 2007. Since then, we have \npassed 11 short-term extensions and we will be drafting the 12th in the \nnext 2 weeks because the current extension expires at the end of this \nmonth. While another extension is likely inevitable, we have to go to \nthe final bill and see if we have the opportunity to pass a final bill \nin the next 2 weeks.\n  The repeated use of short-term FAA extensions does not provide the \nlong-term stability and funding predictability we should be giving to \nour airports, the traveling public, and the airlines that are looking \nat what we are going to be doing with airports. We have to have a \npredictable roadmap if we are going to have a sound fiscal investment \nin our aviation infrastructure and, in turn, aviation safety.\n  Senator Dorgan mentioned earlier today the many safety provisions \nthat are in this bill in response to the Colgan Buffalo, NY, accident \nthat happened last year, and they are very good provisions.\n  There are some common themes we can all support throughout our \ncountry in this bill. It would improve safety--\n\n[[Page S1431]]\n\nsafety of airlines, safety of pilots, safety of our traveling public, \nand especially in the area of human factors that have long been a \nchallenge for this industry. The bill would modernize our antiquated \nair traffic control system and move us one step closer to an efficient \nand effective use of our national airspace. We are not up with many of \nthe other countries around the world in the modernization of our air \ntraffic control system. We are back in the 1960s in our technology. \nThis bill would move us toward the satellite-based system that is much \nmore reliable, much more efficient, and we need to move forward on it. \nBut, again, since 2007 we have not been able to have a stabilized \napproach because we have been doing these short-term extensions. The \nbill would provide infrastructure funds for our vast national airport \nsystem, along with streamlining the approval process for airport \nprojects. The bill would improve rural access to aviation and the \neconomic opportunities that go along with air service. The bill would \nprovide the foundation for robust consumer protections and the \ndisclosure of industry practices.\n  I support most of the amendments I have heard being offered; I just \ndo not support them on this bill. I hope we will take those up and have \nthe ability to truly argue about those amendments and pass them, if \npossible. I just hope we will not jeopardize, once again, a permanent \nFAA reauthorization that is in the interest of every American who \ntravels on airlines and who thinks it is important that we have \nairports for not only people moving but product moving. Our commerce \ndepends on a good aviation system.\n  I am going to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to let us \ngo to cloture on this bill, let us assure that the traveling public is \ngoing to be able to at least have a bill that will move us one step \ntoward this.\n  This bill is not an easy bill. My colleague, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, knows we have hammered out a lot of \ndifferences already. But we have differences with the House on this \nbill as well. The Senate is in pretty much agreement on the \nfundamentals of what is in this bill on both sides of the aisle. And my \ncolleague, Senator DeMint, who just offered an amendment, is actually \nthe ranking member of the Subcommittee on Aviation, so he knows this \nbill is a good bill that has been hammered out, and it will be the \nSenate position.\n  But extraneous amendments, regardless of our view on the amendment's \nsubstance, will kill this bill. I think it is in our best interests, \nand certainly our responsibility, to put this bill forward for the \ninterests of the traveling public.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to work with us to have the ability for their \namendments to come up and be debated and voted on. I am going to \nsupport everything I have heard so far. But I hope we will keep this \nbill on aviation--on aviation security, on airport infrastructure, on \nmodernization of our air traffic control system--because that is what \nour job is and that is what this bill is about.\n  I hope our colleagues will come forward with their aviation-related \namendments, of which there are several that are certainly worthy of our \ndiscussion, and let's move through those. But I hope we will limit the \nextraneous amendments and try to move this bill in an expeditious and \ncommonsense way.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, just one word on what my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Hutchison said.\n  I completely and totally agree. This is kind of a feast, I guess, for \nsome who want to bring all their frustrations about government and put \nthem into the aviation authorization bill, but it is so frustrating \nbecause we have been working on this for so long. There have been 11 \ndelays on this when we were not able to go forward with anything. If \nthey keep doing what they are doing with extraneous amendments, we have \nno hope for this bill.\n  What they need to consider is that as they take down our bill, which \nis important for the Nation, they will take down their amendments, \nshould they prevail, as well. So that doesn't make any sense.\n  I am so proud, as always, of the Senator from Texas and her work to \ntry to get rid of extraneous amendments, discourage those, and to work \non Federal aviation. This is very important work.\n  I know the Senator from Kansas wishes to speak, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsupport of this bipartisan agreement. Yes, there is a bipartisan \nagreement in regard to this bill. It can be done. It has been reached \nby the Senate Finance and Commerce Committees on the reauthorization of \nthe Federal Aviation Administration and Airport and Airway Trust Fund; \ni.e., the Rockefeller substitute amendment No. 3452.\n  I thank Chairman Rockefeller for his leadership. He is right; we need \nto move this bill. He referred to the 11 times it has been delayed. I \nhave been working on this bill for 4 years. I know he has been working \nvery hard, very diligently, and we do have a workable compromise. I \nthink it represents the true meaning of that word. It shows what is \npossible when we roll up our sleeves and go to work together. So \nspecial thanks to Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley and to \nSenator Rockefeller and all of his staff and all of Senator Baucus's \nstaff, everybody's people who have been working on this.\n  In 2006, at my invitation, then-Secretary of Transportation Mary \nPeters joined me and Congressman Tiahrt from the fourth district of \nKansas, local officials, all sorts of representatives from the aviation \nbusinesses in Wichita, for a roundtable discussion about the importance \nof aviation to Kansas and to the country. We then toured Cessna's \nmanufacturing lines to see firsthand an example of the great work of \nKansans who build 50 percent of the world's general aviation aircraft. \nReauthorizing the FAA and the Airport Airway Trust Fund is not only a \ntop national priority to, obviously me, Senator Brownback, and the \nKansas delegation, but a top Kansas priority.\n  We tried to pass this bill 2 years ago, and at that time 40,000 \nemployees were in Wichita and the surrounding counties and they made \ntheir living building planes, manufacturing parts, and servicing \naviation. Now, unfortunately, after delay and delay and delay due to \nthe rough economic climate and conditions, that number has dropped to \njust over 25,000. That is a tremendous decrease with an awful lot of \nhurt for a lot of families in Kansas.\n  Kansas is home to nearly 3,200 aviation and manufacturing businesses, \nincluding Cessna, Hawker-Beechcraft, Bombardier-Learjet, Boeing, \nSpirit, AeroSystems, Garmin, and Honeywell, to name a few. However, \naviation isn't simply an economic engine in Kansas; it is part of our \nhistory, our way of life and, most importantly, part of our future. It \nis an example of our entrepreneurial spirit.\n  Throughout this debate, I wish to point out that general aviation has \nbeen called to increase its contribution to the Airport and Airway \nTrust Fund to help pay for what everybody knows needs to happen: the \nmodernization of our air traffic control system. All along the way, \ngeneral aviation has stepped to the plate and agreed to help pay for \nthe necessary increases to move our aviation infrastructure into next-\ngeneration technology.\n  I cannot recall a time when any industry has come to me and said, We \nwant to help and we are willing to support an increase--65 percent, by \nthe way--in our taxes to do so, but that is exactly what the general \naviation community did. Their only request has been that they be able \nto pay through the current efficient and effective tax structure, the \nfuel tax. So the agreement reached between the Finance and the Commerce \nCommittees respects this request and allows the general aviation \ncommunity to be part of the modernization solution without creating a \nnew bureaucracy or any additional redtape. This raises an additional \n$113 million dedicated to updating the air traffic control technology \nthat will increase safety and decrease congestion. At the same time, \nour commercial airlines and passengers are held harmless from tax \nincreases.\n  So, again, I am pleased this agreement recognizes the value of both \ncommercial aviation and general aviation to our Nation's transportation \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S1432]]\n\nI realize there have been strong feelings on both sides of this debate \nfor a considerable number of years.\n  My goals as we drafted the bill were very clear: First, ensure that \nour air traffic control system is upgraded and remains safe for all \npassengers and aircraft. Secondly, protect the general aviation \ncommunity and Kansas jobs which would have been threatened by a new \nuser fee.\n  This legislation represents the best of a bipartisan compromise and a \nreal effort to make our skies safer. I am very proud to be a part of \nthis compromise, as are tens of thousands of workers employed in Kansas \nin aviation manufacturing.\n  Our State has always been and remains the air capital of the world, \nand under this agreement it will continue. I thank my colleagues for \nhelping us to reach a compromise that will maintain our world standing.\n  I am very hopeful the Senate will continue to work in this spirit of \nbipartisanship on this bill. Yesterday Senator Brownback in his \nremarks, Senator Rockefeller in his remarks just a while ago, and \nSenator Hutchison made these same comments. We need to move quickly to \na conference committee and eventually have this bill signed into law \nbefore the current program expires. I know when a train moves, \neverybody wants to put their car on the train. However, let's try to \nkeep extraneous amendments--I don't mind Senators at all talking about \ntheir concerns, whether it be education, gay marriage, or earmarks; and \nI would expect we would hear a lot of speeches on earmarks--but we need \nto keep this bill the way it is and move this bill. Then there will be \nanother train or I will have Kansas general aviation provide an \naircraft for a more speedy amendment to go over to the House if that is \nthe case.\n  So let's try to keep our extraneous amendments if we can, despite our \nstrong feelings, off this bill, and let's get something done. It has \nbeen languishing here for over 4 years and probably longer than that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for \nhis very cogent remarks. Kansas probably is the airplane center of the \ncountry, if not the world. The point he makes is that it is bipartisan \nand that we have been working on it a long time.\n  Anybody can come down and offer extraneous amendments. We don't \npreclude that in our system. It is possible under the Senate rules. It \nis also possible under the Senate rules to make extraneous amendments \nunacceptable and unactionable. I think what we want to do is try to \navoid some of those processes. I know the leaders on both sides are \ntrying to figure out a way to deal with this problem of extraneous \namendments. If it has to do with aviation, we are all for it. If people \nsimply want to talk about subjects they care about but not offer \namendments, that is fine. If people want to offer aviation amendments, \nplease come forward. Those are important.\n  This is a 3- to 4-year effort we have been on, trying to do an \naviation bill. The Presiding Officer certainly understands the \nconsequences of aviation delays and all the rest of it. It is something \nwe have to do as a country and we cannot dally. This is not the Senate \nacting in its finest tradition. We have a chance to change that, and I \nhope the Members will cooperate in that effort.\n  I thank the Chair and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Without my losing the floor, does the Senator wish to \nspeak after I speak?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nremarks of Senator Gregg, I be recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Fiscal Policies\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to discuss the issue of fiscal \npolicies, which we talk a little bit about around here but on which we \nare not focusing, in my opinion, with the intensity we should, and the \nfact we are now seeing in Europe the meltdown of a major nation-state's \nfinancial situation, Greece. Greece has become a precursor for many \nother industrialized nations in this world which are finding themselves \ngrossly overextended in the amount of debt they put on their books. As \na result, in the situation of Greece, they are incapable of repaying \ntheir national debt, or what is known as their sovereign debt.\n  Fortunately, the European Community has rallied around and has tried \nto stabilize the situation. But the fact that the situation may be \nbeing stabilized should not allow us to take much solace because this \nis not a unique problem to Greece.\n  As we look at the debt levels of a large number of nations in the \nindustrialized West, especially, many of them are in serious trouble. \nMany are grossly overextended. We have seen, obviously, pressures on \nIreland, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Italy, and, of course, \nGreece is so overextended that it was about to default potentially.\n  What does this mean for us as a nation? Unfortunately, we are on the \nsame track. People talk in terms of default and overextension and too \nmuch debt and their eyes sort of glaze over.\n  What does that mean? Essentially, it means we as a nation see a \nfundamental drop in our standard of living. If our debt gets to a \ncertain point, we basically as a nation, in order to pay for that debt, \nhave to reduce the standard of living of our people.\n  What is that point? There is general consensus that a public debt; \nthat is, debt owned by other countries and by the people of the nation \nwho is running it up, a public debt that amounts to about 35 percent or \n40 percent of your gross domestic product--what you are producing as a \nnation--is a very good status. But as that moves up by running \ndeficits--and, remember, we are running a $1.6 trillion deficit this \nyear, and under the President's budget we will be running over $1 \ntrillion in deficits over the next 10 years--as that debt goes up--\nwhich means you are basically borrowing money and borrowing it from \nAmericans, but mostly now from other countries, especially the Chinese \nand Saudi Arabia--it starts to cross certain thresholds. The next most \nsignificant threshold is to have a debt-to-public-production ratio of \nabout 60 percent. That gets serious.\n\n  In fact, that is such a high debt-to-public-production ratio that in \nEurope you can't even join the European Union if you have a debt \nsituation that big. Well, unfortunately, later this year, because of \nall the debt we have put on the books in the last 3 years, we are going \nto pass the 60-percent threshold as a nation. Then you start moving \ninto waters which are more than uncharted and choppy, they are \ndangerous. You start to move into the waters that Greece finds itself \nin. Because when your public debt gets up around 70, 80, 90 percent of \nyour gross domestic product, you have trouble paying it back without \ndoing some very horrible things to your people--things such as massive \ninflation or massive tax increases, both of which cost Americans jobs \nand reduces their savings and their ability to live a better lifestyle.\n  Under the President's budget, as proposed, and under the scenario \nwhich is clearly in front of us--it is like a railroad track that is \nalmost impossible to get off unless we do something very significant--\nwe hit 80 percent within 6 years, or approximately 80 percent. So we \nare basically where Greece is 6, 7, 8 years from now, and the \nimplications for us as a society are catastrophic.\n  What are we doing about this? Not a lot. In fact, we are aggravating \nit every day. Just yesterday, we passed another bill, or the day \nbefore, that spent $100 billion--$100 billion that wasn't paid for. It \nwent to the debt. Last week, we passed another bill that alleged to \nspend $10 billion, but buried in it were some parliamentary games which \nactually meant it spent another $100 billion that wasn't paid for in \nhighway funds.\n\n[[Page S1433]]\n\nSo $200 billion in 2 weeks. And the week before that, we did another \nbill that spent $15 billion unpaid for. Not only are we not addressing \nthis problem, but we are fundamentally aggravating the problem. Now the \nHouse has this Senate health care bill over there. What are the fiscal \nimplications of that? It grows the Federal Government by $2.5 \ntrillion--$2.5 trillion.\n  It is claimed the bill is paid for. But how is it paid for? It \nalleges it is going to reduce Medicare spending by $500 billion. But \nrather than using that money to make Medicare more solvent, it takes \nthat money and creates two new entitlements--or expands one and creates \nanother one. We know from our history that entitlements are never fully \npaid for. Then it takes money from a fund, which is supposed to be an \ninsurance fund, and it spends that money--long-term care insurance. So \nthat when those insurance IOUs come up to be paid, there isn't going to \nbe any money to pay them. It is called the CLASS Act. It is a classic \ngame of pyramid accounting. In fact, if you did it in the private \nsector you would go to jail.\n  So that is the course we are on--a massive expansion in our debt, \nleading us to a situation where our capacity to pay that debt will be \nvirtually impossible to accomplish without huge negative implications \nfor the standard of living of our children and our grandchildren, and \neven our generation, quite honestly. It is going to arrive pretty soon. \nIn fact, today, there was a CNBC question put out: Should you continue \nto invest in American debt in light of what we are headed toward? How \ndo you avoid the impending meltdown?\n  As people start to sense this coming at us, the cost of selling our \ndebt is going to become extraordinarily expensive, because people will \nhave to price in either massive inflation or an economic cost through \nreduction in productivity due to massive taxes, which will reduce our \ncapacity to repay this debt in any sort of reasonable way. This is a \nserious problem, and yet we do not seem to be willing to face up to it.\n  There is something else we need to focus on. Not only is it the \nsovereign nations of the world that have this debt problem, it is our \nStates. Think about this for a moment. California's debt problem is so \nsevere they are represented as being close to potential default. What \nis the implication of that for us as a country if one of our States \nwere to default on their debt? The domino effect would be \nextraordinary. Do we have enough gas in our tanks, so to say, to come \nin and resolve this from the Federal level? I doubt it. We have used up \nmost of our running room. If we go into a fiscal cardiac arrest, which \nis approximately what we are going to do--it is exactly what we are \ngoing to do, a fiscal cardiac arrest--4 or 5 years from now, and we \nreach for the defibrillators, there isn't going to be any power. There \nwon't be any power to activate them because we have used up all our \nresources already. We have spent it. We can't borrow any more, and we \ncertainly don't want to inflate our way out of it. It will be severe, \nand the arrest may become terminal for certain parts of our economy and \ncertain people's lifestyles--basically, regular Americans living on \nMain Street. So the issue is out there and it is pretty clear.\n  Greece is a precursor, California is an example, and our own \nprofligate attitude here in the Congress about it is not helping the \nproblem at all. You don't have to listen to me on this. Mohamed El-\nErian, who is a senior member of a group known as PIMCO, the largest \nbond dealer in the world and one of the leading authorities on debt and \nthe purchase and selling of debt in the world, wrote a very thoughtful \narticle, and this article hits the nail on the head about the threat we \nconfront as a nation for our failure to face up to this debt situation \nnow and allowing it to erode and continue to grow.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the article I just referred to.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               How To Handle the Sovereign Debt Explosion\n\n                         (By Mohamed El-Erian)\n\n       Every once in a while, the world is faced with a major \n     economic development that is ill-understood at first and \n     dismissed as of limited relevance, and which then catches \n     governments, companies and households unawares.\n       We have seen a few examples of this over the past 10 years. \n     They include the emergence of China as a main influence on \n     growth, prices, employment and wealth dynamics around the \n     world. I would also include the dramatic over-extension, and \n     subsequent spectacular collapse, of housing and shadow banks \n     in the finance-driven economies of the US and UK.\n       Today, we should all be paying attention to a new theme: \n     the simultaneous and significant deterioration in the public \n     finances of many advanced economies. At present this is being \n     viewed primarily--and excessively--through the narrow prism \n     of Greece. Down the road, it will be recognised for what it \n     is: a significant regime shift in advanced economies with \n     consequential and long-lasting effects. To stay ahead of the \n     process, we should keep the following six points in mind.\n       First, at the most basic level, what we are experiencing is \n     best characterised as the latest in a series of disruptions \n     to balance sheets. In 2008-09, governments had to step in to \n     counter the simultaneous implosion in housing, finance and \n     consumption. The world now has to deal with the consequences \n     of how this was done.\n       US sovereign indebtedness has surged by a previously \n     unthinkable 20 percentage points of gross domestic product in \n     less than two years. Even under a favourable growth scenario, \n     the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to continue to increase \n     over the next 10 years from its much higher base.\n       Many metrics speak to the generalised nature of the \n     disruption to public finances. My favourite comes from Willem \n     Buiter, Citi's chief economist. More than 40 per cent of \n     global GDP now resides in jurisdictions (overwhelmingly in \n     the advanced economies) running fiscal deficits of 10 per \n     cent of GDP or more. For much of the past 30 years, this \n     fluctuated in the 0-5 per cent range and was dominated by \n     emerging economies.\n       Second, the shock to public finances is undermining the \n     analytical relevance of conventional classifications. \n     Consider the old notion of a big divide between advanced and \n     emerging economies. A growing number of the former now have \n     significantly poorer economic and financial prospects, and \n     greater vulnerabilities, than a growing number of the latter.\n       Third, the issue is not whether governments in advanced \n     economies will adjust; they will. The operational questions \n     relate to the nature of the adjustment (orderly versus \n     disorderly), timing and collateral impact.\n       Governments naturally aspire to overcome bad debt dynamics \n     through the orderly (and relatively painless) combination of \n     growth and a willingness on the part of the private sector to \n     maintain and extend holdings of government debt. Such an \n     outcome, however, faces considerable headwinds in a world of \n     unusually high unemployment, muted growth dynamics, \n     persistently large deficits and regulatory uncertainty.\n       Countries will thus be forced to make difficult decisions \n     relating to higher taxation and lower spending. If these do \n     not materialise on a timely basis, the universe of likely \n     outcomes will expand to include inflating out of excessive \n     debt and, in the extreme, default and confiscation.\n       Fourth, governments can impose solutions on other sectors \n     in the domestic economy. They do so by preempting and \n     diverting resources. This is particularly relevant when there \n     is limited scope for the cross-border migration of \n     activities, which is the case today given the generalised \n     nature of the public finance shock.\n       Fifth, the international dimension will complicate the \n     internal fiscal adjustment facing advanced economies. The \n     effectiveness of any fiscal consolidation is not only a \n     function of a government's willingness and ability to \n     implement measures over the medium term. It is also \n     influenced by what other countries decide to do.\n       These five points all support the view that the shock to \n     balance sheets is highly relevant to a wide range of sectors \n     and markets. Yet for now, the inclination is to dismiss the \n     shock as isolated, temporary and reversible.\n       This leads to the sixth and final point. We should expect \n     (rather than be surprised by) damaging recognition lags in \n     both the public and private sectors. Playbooks are not \n     readily available when it comes to new systemic themes. This \n     leads many to revert to backward-looking analytical models, \n     the thrust of which is essentially to assume away the \n     relevance of the new systemic phenomena.\n       There is a further complication. Timely recognition is \n     necessary but not sufficient. It must be followed by the \n     correct response. Here, history suggests that it is not easy \n     for companies and governments to overcome the tyranny of \n     backward-looking internal commitments.\n       Where does all this leave us? Our sense is that the \n     importance of the shock to public finances in advanced \n     economies is not yet sufficiently appreciated and understood. \n     Yet, with time, it will prove to be highly consequential. The \n     sooner this is recognised, the greater the probability of \n     being able to stay ahead of the disruptions rather than be \n     hurt by them.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. It is time for us to act. It is time to, first, stop \nspending. That\n\n[[Page S1434]]\n\nis the bottom line. It is like a diet. The only way you can lose some \nweight is to actually stop eating the wrong way. We have to stop \nspending, and then we have to come up with some pretty aggressive ideas \naddressing the very systemic problems we have as a country relative to \nthe growth of our debt, so that if we do them now it will have less \nnegative impact on people than if we have to do them in a crisis \nsituation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3470 to Amendment No. 3452\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside so I may call up amendment No. 3470.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Coburn, and Mr. Brown of Ohio, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3470 to amendment No. 3452.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for the rescission of unused transportation \n   earmarks and to establish a general reporting requirement for any \n                            unused earmarks)\n\n       At the end, insert the following:\n\n  TITLE ___--RESCISSION OF UNUSED TRANSPORTATION EARMARKS AND GENERAL \n                         REPORTING REQUIREMENT\n\n     SEC. _01. DEFINITION.\n\n       In this title, the term ``earmark'' means the following:\n       (1) A congressionally directed spending item, as defined in \n     Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n       (2) A congressional earmark, as defined for purposes of \n     Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. _02. RESCISSION.\n\n       Any earmark of funds provided for the Department of \n     Transportation with more than 90 percent of the appropriated \n     amount remaining available for obligation at the end of the \n     9th fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the \n     earmark was made available is rescinded effective at the end \n     of that 9th fiscal year, except that the Secretary of \n     Transportation may delay any such rescission if the Secretary \n     determines that an additional obligation of the earmark is \n     likely to occur during the following 12-month period.\n\n     SEC. _03. AGENCY WIDE IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTS.\n\n       (a) Agency Identification.--Each Federal agency shall \n     identify and report every project that is an earmark with an \n     unobligated balance at the end of each fiscal year to the \n     Director of OMB.\n       (b) Annual Report.--The Director of OMB shall submit to \n     Congress and publically post on the website of OMB an annual \n     report that includes--\n       (1) a listing and accounting for earmarks with unobligated \n     balances summarized by agency including the amount of the \n     original earmark, amount of the unobligated balance, the year \n     when the funding expires, if applicable, and recommendations \n     and justifications for whether each earmark should be \n     rescinded or retained in the next fiscal year;\n       (2) the number of rescissions resulting from this title and \n     the annual savings resulting from this title for the previous \n     fiscal year; and\n       (3) a listing and accounting for earmarks provided for the \n     Department of Transportation scheduled to be rescinded at the \n     end of the current fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment, \nalong with Senators Coburn and Sherrod Brown, to make a small but \nnecessary step toward addressing the growing problem of Federal \ndeficits. This is the second time in as many weeks that we are offering \nthis amendment, and I hope we will be able to have a vote and get it \naccepted on the FAA reauthorization bill. The underlying bill we are \nconsidering reauthorizes many vitally important programs, including \ninvestments in our aviation infrastructure and the long overdue \nmodernization of air traffic control. While I support many of these \ninvestments, I think it is also critically important that we take a \nclose look at where our spending can be cut as we try to address the \nlooming deficit.\n  Of course, my amendment won't come close to solving this whole \nlooming problem, but it will make a dent as we try to get our financial \nhouse in order and make the tough choices to avoid burdening future \ngenerations with debt. There is no single or easy solution to the \nmassive deficits we face, but one thing we should be doing is taking a \nhard look at the Federal budget for wasteful or unnecessary spending. \nHard-working American families have to make these kinds of decisions \nevery week to make ends meet, whether skipping dinners out, making do \nwith old clothes instead of buying new ones, or finding new ways to \ntrim their grocery bill. People are looking at everything in their \nhousehold budget to cut back in tough times, and the Congress should be \ndoing the same things, looking to save the taxpayers' money everywhere \nwe can.\n  What I am trying to do here is a proposal to get rid of old, unwanted \ntransportation earmarks that would save about $600 million right away \nand perhaps a few billion dollars over time. It won't eliminate the \nFederal deficit on its own, but it is real money, in places such as \nRacine or Fond du Lac, WI, where I recently held townhall meetings. It \nis one step on a path that is going to have to involve many additional \ncuts.\n  I have put together a number of proposals for where we should begin \ntightening our belt, including the one for this amendment, in a piece \nof legislation I introduced last fall called the Control Spending Now \nAct. The combined bill would cut the Federal deficit by about $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion over 10 years.\n  This amendment, my bipartisan amendment here with Senators Coburn and \nBrown of Ohio, would build off of a proposal put forward in President \nGeorge W. Bush's fiscal year 2009 budget proposal to rescind $626 \nmillion in highway earmarks that were over a decade old and still had \nless than 10 percent of the funding utilized. When Transportation \nWeekly did an analysis of these earmarks at the time, they found that \nover 60 percent of the funding--$389 million--was in 152 earmarks that \nhad no funding spent or obligated from them. These clearly are either \nunwanted or a low priority for the designated recipients.\n  This is nothing against transportation funding either, of course. I \nfully realize the need for reinvestment in our crumbling infrastructure \nand its potential for job creation in hard-hit segments such as \nconstruction. But hundreds of millions of dollars sitting in an account \nuntouched at the Department of Transportation does nothing to address \nour infrastructure needs or put people back to work.\n  I have tried to build on President Bush's concept a little and my \namendment expands this rescission to all transportation earmarks that \nare over 10 years old with unobligated balances of more than 90 \npercent. At a hearing before the Budget Committee 2 weeks ago, I asked \nTransportation Secretary Ray LaHood about these unwanted and unspent \nearmarks, and whether he supported my proposal to rescind them. \nSecretary LaHood responded:\n\n       The answer is yes, we are supportive of your proposal, and \n     we have identified significant millions of dollars worth of \n     earmarks.\n\n  So at the suggestion of the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, we have also included a provision to allow the \nSecretary of Transportation to delay a rescission if the project is \nexpected to be obligated within the next 12 months. I know there are \nsometimes extenuating circumstances and delays that pop up, and this \nseemed like a good way to deal with these situations while still \nensuring that the intention to eliminate unwanted and low-priority \nprojects was retained. I also hope this will help alleviate concerns \nand ensure that the potential for extenuating circumstances is not used \nas a reason to somehow oppose our amendment.\n  It is unclear exactly how many hundreds of millions or even billions \nof dollars would be saved by this proposal being expanded to other \ntransportation earmarks in addition to the previous estimate of $626 \nmillion that would be rescinded from unwanted highway earmarks in the \nfirst year. This proposal would also be permanent, so there would \nlikely be additional savings as the unwanted earmarks in the most \nrecent highway bill reach their 10-year anniversary.\n  I think this is a very modest proposal, going after the lowest of the \nlow-hanging fruit and would support going even further and make it \ncover all Federal agencies. But with the uncertainty about how many of \nthese unwanted and unspent earmarks there might be across the whole \nFederal Government,\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\nour amendment instead requires an annual report by the OMB to collect \ninformation from each agency and include recommendations on whether \nthese other unobligated earmarks should be rescinded.\n  As you can see, this is a proposal with bipartisan support both in \nthe Senate and from the past administration and this current \nadministration. This shouldn't be a hard decision and I hope we have \nstrong support here in the Senate. This is simply about instituting a \ngood government principle of returning unused funds to the Treasury, \nand it shouldn't be controversial. If we can't agree to take old \nearmarks that no one wants and use the money to pay down the deficit, \nthen how are we ever going to get our fiscal house in order?\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of Senators Ensign and Brown of Ohio, the \nSenate then stand in recess until 2 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Unemployment And Foreclosures\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, first, let me start by complimenting the \nSenator from Wisconsin for addressing the spending going on in \nWashington, DC. I applaud his efforts. He understands this is a modest \neffort, but we have to start someplace. For my whole 10 years in the \nSenate, I have been talking about spending and getting our debt under \ncontrol, not passing debt on to our children across America. This is a \nhuge debt burden we are passing on to them. I applaud the efforts, even \nthough they are small. Anything we can do around here to address the \ndeficits and the debt I think is very important.\n  I want to talk about unemployment and foreclosures, especially how \nthey are affecting Nevada and the overall economy. I think everybody \nadmits the our economy is hurting. There are people all over the \ncountry in need of employment. Many are hurting because of foreclosures \nor potential foreclosures on their houses.\n  In new unemployment numbers just released, Nevada has a 13-percent \nunemployment rate, with Clark County, where Las Vegas is located, now \nat almost a record high of 13.8 percent; Washoe County, which is where \nReno is, a 13.5-percent unemployment rate. The Review Journal, the \nlargest paper in Nevada, pointed out this week that the salary and job \noutlook for Nevadans is going from bad to worse. Wages are declining \nacross industries in our State, and experts recently told the paper if \nwe were to count discouraged workers who have given up looking for \nemployment and part-time employees who wish to work full time, the real \nunemployment rate in Nevada would actually hover somewhere around 25 \npercent.\n  In fact, if we were to count those who are self-employed--for \ninstance, if you are a realtor and you are not selling homes, you may \nstill be classified as employed but you are effectively unemployed. If \nwe counted all the self-employed people who are not counted in the \nnormal unemployment rates, these numbers would even be higher.\n  Housing in Nevada is still hurting severely. We are leading the \nNation in home foreclosures and there does not seem to be a solution to \nthis problem coming out of Congress. Instead, Congress has gone off on \na wayward path in trying to muscle through health care reform when the \nimmediate focus of this institution should be on the millions of \nAmericans who have lost their jobs, are at risk of losing their homes, \nor even worse--both.\n  In fact, nearly 5 million Americans have lost their jobs during the \ntime Congress has shifted its focus away from the economy onto health \ncare. I will point out, however, if you live in the Washington, DC, \narea you are actually OK. There have been 100,000 new jobs created in \nthis city in the last year. These are government jobs; not private \nsector jobs, government jobs. This is a direct result of a massive \nexpansion of the Federal Government.\n  I do not believe that growing the Federal Government and creating \njobs in Washington does anything to help the unemployment in Nevada or \naround the rest of the country. Health care reform proposals that the \nmajority is trying to push through both Houses are not designed to \nincentivize job creation at a time when we need a lifeline. Instead, \ntheir bills will be job killers.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business, which is the largest \norganization that represents small businesses in America, believes \ntheir health care reform proposals will actually cost millions of jobs \nin small businesses over the next 4 years. It also will greatly add to \nthe Nation's debt when we are already borrowing from future \ngenerations, as the Senator from Wisconsin just talked about.\n  It is time for Congress to shift our focus back to creating jobs, and \ndo it in a responsible way by reducing wasteful government spending and \nthinking about the future of our country. One spending bill after \nanother that comes before this Senate is not going to solve the \neconomic problems our country is facing. It is actually just going to \nmake the situation worse over the next several years because as we \nborrow more money, inflation and interest rates will increase.\n  There are concerns about the strength of the dollar in the world. \nAdding to our debt intensifies those worries. We all, as Republicans \nand as Democrats--really, as Americans--ought to be concerned about \nwhat this debt is going to do to the future of our country.\n  We need real solutions to our economic problems. We need to get the \ncountry back on track. To do that, we need to get control of out-of-\ncontrol spending, especially wasteful spending.\n  Job creation needs to be our number one focus, and we cannot \nincentivize job creation when our Nation is buried in debt. This means \nwe are all going to have to start taking some difficult votes to \nreverse the wild spending spree we are on. Here in Washington it is \nmuch easier to get reelected if you are giving money away to people. It \nis much more difficult politically to take votes that actually cut \nspending because for every government program that is out, there is a \nconstituency that lobbies to keep that gravy train coming from the \nFederal Government.\n  Last week we had two options in the Senate. We had the option to pay \nfor the extension of unemployment insurance benefits with unspent \nstimulus funds, money we have already taken out of the pockets of \ntaxpayers, or we had the option of adding more debt to the credit card \nof this Nation. I voted to extend unemployment insurance without having \nAmerican families foot yet another government bill. Unfortunately, the \nmajority party did not pass this bill. Instead, they voted to continue \nadding to our Nation's debt. Over $100 billion was added to our \nNation's debt just yesterday by this Senate.\n  By the way, $100 billion used to be a lot of money around this place. \nIt is tossed around like it is almost nothing now. $100 billion is a \nhuge amount of money. It passed and hardly got any notice around the \ncountry. That is what we added to our deficit and our debt yesterday.\n  I stress again that job creation needs to be our number one focus, \nbut we cannot begin to incentivize job creation just by adding more \ndebt. I have been focused on introducing legislation that will help \ncreate jobs in Nevada while not increasing the debt--for example, the \nrecent passage of my legislation with Senator Dorgan, called the Travel \nPromotion Act. This will incentivize tourists from across the world to \ncome to the United States and visit our world-class destinations. This \nwill spur job growth across Nevada and our entire Nation. These will \nnot be government jobs; these will be private sector jobs. These jobs \nwill not be paid for by the American taxpayer; these will be jobs that \nwill be a lifeline for our economy.\n  Legislation like the Travel Promotion Act illustrates that we need to \nget past the idea that government spending creates jobs and showcases \nthat we need to institute policies that incentivize the private sector \nto create jobs. We can do this by lowering taxes on small businesses. \nThey are the engine of our economy. We can start creating employment \nopportunities throughout the United States. These private sector jobs \nwill help get our country back on the road to recovery and will not add \nto the financial burden of the United States.\n  The majority party seems to believe the only way to spur job creation \nis to\n\n[[Page S1436]]\n\npass spending bill after spending bill. As we have witnessed over the \npast year, this does not seem to be working. But this has not lessened \nthe resolve of those across the aisle. This week, House Education and \nLabor Committee Chairman George Miller announced that he will unveil a \njobs bill--that is what he called it, a jobs bill--aimed to save or \ncreate a lot of jobs in local governments. It is a $100 billion bill--\nanother $100 billion.\n  The problem with this is these jobs are going to be paid for by the \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program, which, in simple English, \nmeans we are adding to the debt. This is money the taxpayers are going \nto have to pay for in the future--borrowing once again from our \nchildren and adding to our Nation's credit card debt. This is not a \nsolution to create jobs in the long run.\n  The Federal Government spending money on legislation whose only \nconnection to job creation is putting the phrase in the title of the \nbill is not working. In the short term, will it save some local \ngovernment jobs? No question, in Nevada it probably would. But Nevada \nis making tough choices right now. They are actually looking where \nthere is waste. They are looking how they can make government more \nefficient. We are not doing that at the Federal level. We are actually \ndiscouraging it by sending more and more money to the States. But at \nthe Federal Government level we are certainly not looking for any \nefficiencies because all we continue to do is spend more and more \nmoney, add more and more government agencies, more and more government \nprograms.\n  We should be tightening our belts like every family, every business, \nlocal government, and State government are doing across the country. \nThat is one of the reasons many of us have cosponsored legislation for \na balanced budget amendment. If we were required to balance the budget \nwe would be required to take those tough votes. That is why we get \nelected, to do something, to make a positive difference for our \ncountry. Adding to our debt is not that positive difference. We need to \nthink about the future of our country instead of just getting reelected \nby being able to give money away to some of our constituents.\n  I will conclude with this: Job number one needs to be about creating \njobs in a responsible way--not government jobs, private sector jobs. We \nneed to stop adding to the deficit, get government spending under \ncontrol, and cut taxes for small businesses so that entrepreneurs \nacross this country can create jobs. These are what the priorities of \nthis body should be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \naddress the Senate for about 10 minutes under morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Deficit\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I came to the floor to talk about \na young woman in Cincinnati, OH, but I guess I am just amazed at the \namnesia in this body. I hear colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nsay Democrats vote for spending to keep that gravy train going; that \nDemocrats believe that job creation is always the government; that \nRepublicans believe we have to get spending under control and how \npolitically unpopular it is to vote to cut spending. I hear these \nthings over and over, and I hate cliches but, you know the Yogi Berra \nline: ``It's deja vu all over again.''\n  I was in the House of Representatives for the first 6 years of this \ndecade, and I saw what happened. What happened was my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle--when one bird flies off the telephone wire, \nthey all fly off the telephone wire--voting on issue after issue to \nbankrupt this country and to drive our economy into the ditch. In 2001, \ntax cuts for the rich, George Bush's tax cuts which went overwhelmingly \nto the richest taxpayers and, as the Presiding Officer from North \nCarolina knows, using reconciliation to drive these tax cuts through in \n2001, 2003, 2005, bringing Vice President Cheney in so they not only \nused reconciliation, they had to bring the Vice President in, who is \nalmost never here, as the Presiding Officer knows, to vote in passing \nthat with 51 votes.\n  We had a surplus in those days. We had a surplus, and they took that \nsurplus and they enacted tax cuts for the wealthy. Then they started \nthe war with Iraq but did not pay for it. I disagreed with going to \nwar. I voted against it. But at least we should have paid for it. They \ndidn't pay for the war in Iraq and still have not.\n  Then they did this huge, tens of billions of dollars in giveaways to \nthe drug companies and insurance companies, all in the way of \nprivatization of Medicare.\n  So when I hear them preaching to me about Democrats want to spend \nmoney on unemployment compensation, or Democrats want to spend money on \nhealth care--such as COBRA, for those people who have lost their health \ninsurance--or Democrats want to spend money on reimbursing doctors at a \nfairer rate for Medicare, they attack us for doing that yet they took a \nbudget surplus and ran this economy into the ground by deregulating \nWall Street, by cutting taxes on the richest people in this country, by \nturning the surplus into deficits to the tune of hundreds and hundreds \nof billions of dollars.\n  We had projected in 2000 a budget surplus--projected--of $1 trillion. \nOne trillion dollars is 1,000 billion dollars. We now have a projection \nof $1 trillion in budget deficit. They come here and they preach that \nDemocrats should quit spending money on unemployment compensation \nbecause all these workers, they do not want to work, they want to \nreceive their unemployment benefits.\n  Well, what somebody needs to explain to them, and perhaps my friends \non the other side of the aisle do not know anybody who is exactly \ngetting unemployment compensation because they spend too much time with \npeople similar to us, wearing suits and hanging around places such as \nthis and not enough time in places in Charlotte and Dayton and Winston-\nSalem and Cleveland, with people who have lost their jobs and talking \nabout it.\n  But it is not unemployment welfare, as they would like to say it is, \nit is unemployment insurance. That means when you are employed, you pay \ninto a fund, and when you lose your job you get money out of that fund. \nIt is called insurance, unemployment insurance. They should remember \nthat.\n\n\n                        remembering esme kenney\n\n  Madam President, I would like to commemorate the life of Esme Louise \nKenney of Cincinnati, OH, whose life was tragically cut short 1 year \nago this past Sunday.\n  Esme was a bright, inquisitive, and spirited young girl with many \ntalents and a limitless imagination and a boundless love for life.\n  She was an artist, a musician, an avid reader, an expressive writer, \nand a budding water-skier.\n  The beloved daughter of Tom Kenney and Lisa Siders-Kenney, the caring \nsister of Brian, Meghan and Frances, and a loyal and loving friend to \nso many, Esme touched many hearts in her short time with us.\n  From all accounts, Esme's compassion and enthusiasm always warmed the \nroom and lifted the spirits of everyone she met. Her loving brother \ndescribed her as a real ``people person,'' one who loved meeting \npeople, talking with them, learning about them, and sharing her life \nwith them.\n  For all of those whose days were brightened by Esme's radiant joy and \nlove of life, this week marks an anniversary filled with sorrow and \nheartache.\n  One year ago, Esme's life was taken from her under tragic and \nhorrifying circumstances.\n  The 13-year-old left the house one day to go for a jog, and would \nnever return.\n  One man's rage and delusion resulted in the brutal and senseless \nmurder of an innocent, virtuous, and loving child.\n  Perhaps most disturbing is the fact that Anthony Kirkland, the \nconfessed murderer, was already a convicted killer and registered sex \noffender when he committed this atrocity. He had served 16 years in \nprison for the sadistic assault and murder of another young woman.\n  My wife Connie and I extend our deepest sympathy to Esme's family, \nfriends, and community during this unthinkably difficult time. We lost \nEsme a year ago, but I know she will be part of our lives always.\n  The recurrence of these horrible acts underscores the urgent need to \nreview our criminal justice system, and that is why I join the Kenney \nfamily in support of legislation introduced by my\n\n[[Page S1437]]\n\ncolleague, Senator Webb: S. 174, the National Criminal Justice \nCommission Act of 2009.\n  This bill would establish the National Criminal Justice Commission to \nundertake a comprehensive review of the current system and submit a \nreport to Congress and the President that outlines findings and \nrecommendations for changes in criminal justice policies.\n  Such action is vital to keeping our children safe. We must not be \ncomplacent in the face of such inconceivably violent and destructive \nacts as the crime that took Esme from us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1437-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise, joined by my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota and chairman of the Senate \nRepublican Policy Committee, to discuss the health care legislation \nbeing considered in Congress. The current debate is primarily about \nprocess. But before addressing that, I wish to remind everyone that in \nthe end, this is about the substance of the legislation that Washington \nliberals want to impose upon the country by any means necessary.\n  This legislation is bad, both for what it represents and for what it \nwould do. It represents a massive Federal Government takeover of the \nhealth care system. The health care and health insurance systems could \nbe significantly improved with policies that respect individual choice, \nthat embrace our system of federalism, in which the States can tailor \nsolutions to their own needs and demographics. It could. But Washington \nliberals have rejected that path.\n  What would this legislation do? As I have argued in the past, this \nlegislation would bust the limits the Constitution places on Federal \nGovernment power. Liberty itself depends on those limits, it always has \nand it always will. Those limits mean Congress may exercise only the \npowers listed in the Constitution. None of those powers authorizes \nCongress to take such unprecedented steps as requiring that individuals \nspend their own money to purchase a particular good or service, such as \nhealth insurance, or face a financial penalty. This legislation would \nunnecessarily take this country into unchartered political and legal \nterritory.\n  We just heard from the Congressional Budget Office that President \nObama's policies will add a staggering $8.5 trillion--that is trillion \nwith a ``t''--to our already sky-high national debt.\n  This is before passage of the health care tax-and-spend bill that \nwould cost another $2.5 trillion. Claims that this boondoggle will \nlower the deficit result from some pretty impressive accounting tricks. \nThis legislation, for example, would start taking money from Americans \nimmediately but would not provide any benefits to them for years. How \nabout that as a neat way to lower a bill's supposed cost?\n  What do Americans get for all these trillions of dollars? They would \nbe required to buy health insurance, but only 7 percent of Americans \nwould receive any government subsidy to do so. Washington liberals say \nthis bill cuts taxes, but 93 percent of all Americans would not be \neligible for any tax benefit. Contrary to President Obama's explicit \npledge, one-quarter of Americans making under $200,000 per year would \nsee their taxes go up. Middle-class American families paying higher \ntaxes will outnumber those receiving any government subsidy by more \nthan 3 to 1.\n  And after the higher taxes, increased government control, greater \nregulation, and paltry help in buying health insurance, this \nlegislation would not control health care costs, which is the main \nreason for the concern about health insurance in the first place.\n  It does nothing to rein in the junk lawsuits that drive up costs and \ndrive doctors out of medicine. Instead, this legislation would cut $500 \nbillion from Medicare to pay for a massive new government entitlement \nsystem that would include 159 new boards and other bureaucratic \nentities.\n  Last month, the White House released an 11-page document titled ``The \nPresident's Proposal.'' Calling it that, I suppose, was to make it \nappear to be a meaningful step in a genuine negotiation. It is nothing \nof the kind. One of the most obvious changes suggested in this document \nwas elimination of the Medicaid subsidy that the Senate bill gave to \nonly one State. That was for political rather than policy reasons. And \nI cannot forget to mention that this 11-page document's suggested \nchanges would add at least $75 billion more to the cost of the Senate \nbill. That is around $7 billion a page. But it offered nothing to \nchange the real defects in this legislation.\n  For these and so many other reasons, this legislation is the wrong \nway to address the challenges we face in health care and health \ninsurance.\n  Let me turn to my friend from South Dakota, Senator Thune. Now that \nwe have been debating these issues for the better part of a year, what \ndo the American people think of these liberal Washingtonian proposals \nand how did we get where we are today?\n  Mr. THUNE. I say to the Senator from Utah that he has made, over the \ncourse of the last year, many compelling arguments about the substance \nof this legislation and just now summarized what some of those are. The \nreason the American people have rejected this legislation is because \nthey understand the substance of it. As the Senator pointed out, it has \ntax increases, Medicare cuts, and premium increases for most Americans. \nThey figured that out a long time ago. That is why, if you look at the \npublic opinion surveys that have been done with regard to the bill \nitself and to the process by which it got where it is, the American \npeople reject it.\n  The reconciliation process, which has been talked about as a way in \nwhich to ultimately pass this through the House and then through the \nSenate, there have been polls that have asked the American public what \nthey think of using reconciliation to enact health care reform.\n  The Gallup poll from February 25: 52 percent of Americans oppose the \nuse of reconciliation. Last week's Rasmussen Report poll shows that 53 \npercent of Americans are opposed to the health care plan. Perhaps the \nmost telling poll is a CNN poll from February 24--if you can believe \nthis--that says 48 percent of Americans want Congress to start working \non a new bill, and 25 percent of Americans want Congress to stop \nworking on health care. Added together, that is 73 percent of the \nAmerican public that wants Congress to either stop working on health \ncare altogether or start over.\n  I am not among those who think we ought to stop working on this. This \nis a big, important issue to the American people. They want us to do \nit. But they want us to get it right. What is being proposed by our \ncolleagues on the other side and what so far has been rammed through on \na very partisan basis is a $2.5 trillion expansion of the Federal \nGovernment that expands the health care entitlement but does very \nlittle to reform health care in this county or to address the \nunderlying drivers of health care costs in this country.\n  So the Senator from Utah is absolutely right in describing why the \nAmerican people are so opposed to this legislation; that is, because \nthey understand it. They know what it does. They are concerned about \nthe cost of their health care insurance in this country. They are \nconcerned as well about those who do not have health care, and we have \ncome up with solutions we think make sense to cover those who do not \nhave coverage. But I think it is pretty clear where the American people \ncome down on this issue.\n  Incidentally, I think that is also what many of these elections we \nhave had recently are about. If you look at\n\n[[Page S1438]]\n\nwhat happened in Virginia, New Jersey, and most recently in \nMassachusetts, many of those elections were referendums, if you go \ninside the numbers, on the health care issue. I think it is a clear \nmessage to Washington that these health care proposals are not \nacceptable to the American people. Yet it does not seem that those of \nus in Washington, DC--or at least some of us--are listening to that \nmessage. Frankly, I believe, I say to my colleague from Utah, this is a \nbad bill. It has been rejected by the American people, part of it \nbecause of the substance of it; part of it because the normal process \nhas not been followed. We all know what was done to get that extra vote \nto try and pass this bill through the Senate, to get that 60th vote--\nall these backroom deals that were put together at the last minute. We \nhave heard the ``Cornhusker kickback'' chronicled, we have heard the \n``Louisiana purchase'' chronicled many times over the last several \nmonths.\n  But I think the point, very simply, I say to my friend from Utah, is \nthat, one, the American people understand this will lead to higher \ncosts for most Americans, it is going to increase their cost of health \ninsurance in this country; two, they want to see a bill that is put \ntogether in a way that elicits bipartisan support.\n  The Senator from Utah has been here since 1977. He has been involved \nin a whole series of important bipartisan debates, where important \nlegislation was acted on in the Senate, but it was done in a way that \nhad support from both Republicans and Democrats. I think that is what \nthe American people expect of this process. They also expect us to \nconduct ourselves in a way that is transparent.\n  Doing legislation, 2,700-page bills behind closed doors, adding last-\nminute backroom deals to try and get that illusive 60th vote to pass \nit, and now using reconciliation--something that clearly was not \ndesigned for this process--is another issue that is even worsening the \nAmerican public's opinion not only of the substance of this legislation \nbut also the process.\n  I wish to ask my colleague about reconciliation. But before I do \nthat, I wish to mention one thing because many of us--you and I both \nand others on our side--have talked a lot during the course of this \ndebate about the cost and what we ought to be doing to address health \ncare. If we wish to address health care in this country for most \nAmericans--or reform health care--it means getting costs under control.\n  We have been arguing for some time that most Americans--and I think \nthe Congressional Budget Office has validated this, the Actuary for the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services has validated this--that if \nyou are buying in the individual market, you are going to see your \ninsurance premiums go up above what they would normally go up, 10 \npercent to 13 percent, and if you are someone who buys in the large \nemployer or small employer market, you are still going to see your \nhealth insurance premiums go up; they are going to be going up at the \nrate they are today or maybe slightly higher, but the rate they are \ngoing up today is twice the rate of inflation.\n  Yesterday, the Senator from Illinois, the distinguished whip in the \nmajority, the Democratic whip, said on the floor of the Senate:\n\n       Anyone who would stand before you and say, well, if you \n     pass health care reform, next year's health care premiums are \n     going down, I don't think is telling the truth. I think it is \n     likely they would go up, but what we're trying to do is slow \n     the rate of increase.\n\n  So there you have it. We have been saying this all along--an \nacknowledgment by folks on the other side who are finally saying or \nreiterating what we have been saying all along; that is, health \npremiums are going to go up.\n  I think if you are someone who, as I said, buys in the individual \nmarketplace or who is in the large or small employer market, you are \ngoing to see your premiums go up. The question is How much? I think for \nmost Americans, they would go up significantly.\n  But I say to my colleague--and I would ask him because he has been \nhere since reconciliation almost was put in place; you have to go back \nto 1974 and the Budget Act--but I am told it has been used 18 or 19 \ntimes since then. Since the Senator came here in 1977, I think every \ntime reconciliation has been used, the Senator has been part of that \nprocess, has had to vote on that. There probably is not anybody in this \nChamber who is more experienced on the issue of reconciliation--what it \nwas designed to do, what it can do--than the Senator from Utah.\n  So I would ask the Senator if he could explain to those of us who \nhave not been here as long exactly what reconciliation was designed to \nbe used for, how it is designed to function, and why it is not \napplicable to the case of trying to restructure or reorder literally \none-sixth of the American economy, which is what health care represents \nin this country.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for his cogent remarks because my \nfriend from North Dakota is absolutely right. The American people are \nnot buying this, nor are they going to buy this misuse of \nreconciliation.\n  Even with large majorities in the Senate and the House, the White \nHouse, and most of the mainstream media, Washington liberals have not \nbeen able to convince the American people this is the right way to go. \nThe American people oppose this bill. They want us to start over, and \nthey want us to adopt step-by-step, commonsense reforms.\n  We could do that, but Washington liberals instead are determined to \nfind some way to get their way. The latest procedural gambit, which has \nbeen raised by my colleague, is called reconciliation. Before talking \nabout what reconciliation is, I have to emphasize what it is not. \nReconciliation is not simply an alternative to the Senate's regular \nprocess for handling legislation. Instead, reconciliation is an \nexception to that process.\n  While the House is about action, the Senate is about deliberation, \nand the rules in each body reflect its role. For more than 200 years, \nSenate rules have allowed smaller groups of Senators to slow down or \nstop legislation. The House is a simple majority vote body, but the \nSenate is not. This creates checks and speed bumps to legislation, but \npassing legislation is not supposed to be easy, especially something \nthat affects one-sixth of the American economy.\n  Reconciliation is the exception to that because it limits debate and \namendments and requires only a simple majority. It allows for only 20 \nhours of debate. It actually weakens the role the Senate plays in the \nlegislative branch and, therefore, this exception to our regular order \nwas created to handle a small category of legislation related to the \nbudget. While thousands of public laws have been enacted since the \nreconciliation process was created, that process, as the distinguished \nSenator from South Dakota said, has been used only 19 times to enact \nlegislation of any kind into law.\n  Not only is reconciliation a rare exception to our regular \nlegislative process, but using reconciliation to pass sweeping social \nlegislation, as opposed to budget or tax legislation, is even more \nrare. Reconciliation has been used only three times to pass such major \nsocial legislation. Welfare reform passed in 1996 with 78 votes, child \nhealth insurance passed in 1997 with 85 votes, and a college tuition \nbill passed in 2007 with 79 votes. In each case, dozens of Senators in \nthe minority party supported the legislation.\n  The health care legislation before us is not the kind of budget or \ntax legislation that has been the primary focus of the reconciliation \nprocess in the past. It is much more like the welfare reform or child \nhealth insurance bills, except for one very important thing: The health \ncare legislation is a completely, 100-percent, partisan bill--100 \npercent. The reconciliation process, which from the start is a rare \nexception to our regular process, has never been used for such \nsweeping, major social legislation that did not have wide bipartisan \nsupport--never. It was never supposed to be used for that. You can \ncriticize the three times social legislation was passed, and your \ncriticism might be considered valid by some, but the fact is, those \nbills were bipartisan.\n  Washington liberals obviously know this because their latest talking \npoint is, reconciliation will not be used to pass the large health care \nbill only to change the big health care bill. My friends, that is a \ndistinction without a difference. The bill Washington liberals want is \nthe combination of the big Senate bill and the smaller fixer bill. In\n\n[[Page S1439]]\n\nfact, they cannot stomach the one without the other. The bill they \nwant, whether passed in one piece or two, cannot pass Congress through \nthe regular legislative process. The health care bill that Washington \nliberals want, if it can be passed at all, can only be passed through \nan illegitimate use of this extraordinary process called \nreconciliation.\n  By the way, I would like to remind my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle that the reconciliation process has been used only twice to \npass a purely partisan bill on any subject, even those that \nreconciliation may have been designed for. In both cases--1993, when \nDemocrats were in charge, and 2005, when Republicans were in charge--\nthe American people in the next election threw the majority party out \nand gave the other party a chance to run the Senate.\n  Just as Washington liberals cannot convince the American people to \nsupport the substance of this legislation, they cannot make the case \nthat reconciliation is a legitimate way to pass it.\n  Let me also say, there are those in the House who want to distort \nthis reconciliation process even further by devising a way so that \nHouse Members do not have to actually vote directly on the Senate-\npassed bill. They want to create a rule that would deem the Senate bill \nas passed. Talk about distorting the process. Talk about the lack of \nguts to stand and vote for what they claim is so good. Talk about \ndeceiving the American people. They have already distorted the \nreconciliation rules, but that would be a bridge too far.\n  I ask my friend from South Dakota, Senator Thune, whether he has \nseen, as I have, the spin and misdirection that have been employed to \ngive the impression that this is a legitimate process to pass this \nunpopular legislation.\n  Mr. THUNE. Well, I would say to my friend from Utah, it is \ninteresting how the semantics and terminology changes in Washington \ndepending upon what point you are trying to make. But many of our \ncolleagues who have weighed in heavily against the use of \nreconciliation on a range of subjects--more specifically now health \ncare reform--are now referring to it as simply a simple majority: All \nwe are asking for is a simple majority vote, which does represent a \nspin and misdirection.\n  Because, as the Senator from Utah has noted, reconciliation, as a \nprocedure, has a fairly special place in the history of the Senate, \ngoing back to 1974, when it was created. It is to be used for specific \npurposes: to reconcile spending, revenues, tax increases, tax cuts--\nprimarily to accomplish deficit reduction.\n  As the Senator from Utah has pointed out, when it is used to enact \nsignificant legislation, generally it has broad bipartisan support. The \nSenator mentioned welfare reform. It had 78 votes for it. That is the \nmost frequently cited example of the use of reconciliation for \nsomething that was policy oriented. But, remember, that had 78 votes in \nthe Senate. A huge and decisive majority of Senators decided to vote \nfor its use in that case.\n  You also have, as I said, other examples where it was done to \naccomplish reducing taxes, increasing taxes. Those are all arguably \nlegitimate uses under the procedure of reconciliation.\n  But now what you are finding is legislation that literally would \nrestructure and reorder one-sixth of the American economy that would \nhave profound consequences and a profound impact on the American people \nfor not only the near term but the long term. We are talking about \nusing this ``go your own way,'' ``go it alone'' process of \nreconciliation simply because using regular order cannot accomplish the \nobjective that is desired by the Democratic majority. So they have \nfallen back on the use of reconciliation for something that is \nunprecedented.\n  It is interesting to me, if you look historically at what some of our \ncolleagues have said, there are not many people who have more \nexperience with this issue or more experience in the Senate than the \nSenator from Utah, but the Senator from West Virginia, a member of the \nDemocratic majority, has been here even longer and is cited most often \nas being the author of the current budget process that we have, which \nincludes this reconciliation procedure. He wrote a letter a year ago \nwhich I wish to submit for the Record, and I wish to quote the first \nparagraph from that letter of a year ago in April. He said:\n\n       Dear colleague:\n       I oppose using the budget reconciliation process to pass \n     health care reform and climate change legislation. Such a \n     proposal would violate the intent and spirit of the budget \n     process and do serious injury to the constitutional role of \n     the Senate.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, April 2, 2009\n       Dear Colleague: I oppose using the budget reconciliation \n     process to pass health care reform and climate change \n     legislation. Such a proposal would violate the intent and \n     spirit of the budget process, and do serious injury to the \n     Constitutional role of the Senate.\n       As one of the authors of the reconciliation process, I can \n     tell you that the ironclad parliamentary procedures it \n     authorizes were never intended for this purpose. \n     Reconciliation was intended to adjust revenue and spending \n     levels in order to reduce deficits. It was not designed to \n     cut taxes.It was not designed to create a new climate and \n     energy regime, and certainly not to restructure the entire \n     health care system. Woodrow Wilson once said that the \n     informing function is the most important function of \n     Congress. How do we inform? We publicly debate and amend \n     legislation. We receive public feedback, which allows us to \n     change and improve proposals. Matters that affect the lives \n     and livelihoods of our people must not be rushed through the \n     Senate using a procedural fast track that the people never \n     get a chance to comment upon or fully understand.\n       Reconciliation bills are insulated from debate and \n     amendments. Debate is limited to twenty hours, and a majority \n     vote can further limit debate. The rules are stacked against \n     a partisan Minority, and also against dissenting views within \n     the Majority caucus. It is such a dangerous process that in \n     the 1980s, the then-Republican Majority and then-Democratic \n     Minority adopted language, now codified as the Byrd Rule, to \n     discourage extraneous matter from being attached to these \n     fast-track measures.\n       The Senate cannot perform its Constitutional role if \n     Senators forgo debate and amendments. I urge Senators to \n     jealously guard their individual rights to represent their \n     constituents on such critical matters as the budget process \n     moves forward.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Robert C. Byrd.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. That is what the author of reconciliation said a year ago \nabout trying to do health care reform through this process that the \nmajority has decided to use.\n  There are lots of other examples of our colleagues in the Senate on \nthe other side of the aisle--and I could go on and on. The majority \nleader, Senator Reid, in November of 2009 said: ``I am not using \nreconciliation.''\n  Senator Conrad, the chairman of the Budget Committee, said in March \n2009 on the Senate floor:\n\n       I don't believe reconciliation was ever intended for the \n     purpose of writing this kind of substantive reform \n     legislation such as health care reform.\n\n  Even the President, when he was a Senator at that time, and now \nPresident said reconciliation is a bad idea.\n  So we could go on and on and we can find these statements of our \ncolleagues on the other side who, in the past, have expressed \nopposition, and not just timid, tepid opposition but, I would argue, \nvery aggressive opposition to the use of reconciliation for something \nthis consequential and are now sort of falling back.\n  I have 18 Democrats on the record who have said they oppose \nreconciliation and are now saying they think this could be used for \nthis purpose and now is being referred to as a simple majority.\n  So, again, I would say to my colleague from Utah that I think the \nspin that is going on now to try to confuse the American people about \nwhat is happening is something we need to end. We need to be \ntransparent and clear with the American people about what is being done \nhere.\n  I would simply ask my colleague from Utah whether he thinks the \nprocess of using reconciliation, the process that has led us to this \npoint, or, for that matter, the underlying substance of this bill, is \nsomething the American people would be proud of and would want to see \nus pass in the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. My friend from South Dakota hit the nail on the head. I \nappreciate his remarks. If this legislation were sound policy, if it \nincorporated consensus ideas, if it had any level of real support among \nthe American people, Washington liberals would not\n\n[[Page S1440]]\n\nneed to use the gimmicks they are using. They wouldn't have to use the \ntricks that are being used. They wouldn't have to use the spin that the \nSenator from South Dakota so accurately described.\n  I mentioned earlier that the reconciliation process has never been \nused to enact sweeping social legislation that did not have wide \nbipartisan support.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield for a question because I do want to \nfinish my remarks.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. As I understand it--and I am presiding over the \nFederal Aviation Administration legislation, so this is a little \nofftrack, but it is very hard for me to listen to this kind of dialogue \nweek after week without having these thoughts and questions.\n  Mr. HATCH. OK.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senate passed with 60 votes the health care bill \nwhich is now----\n  Mr. HATCH. Sixty partisan votes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Right--which is now on the way over to the House. \nThe House has it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The question is, is the House going to pass it. If \nthere is going to be any health care reform at all, the House has to \npass it. Now, if the House does pass it, it will then constitute about \n85 to 90 percent of the entire health care bill.\n  I listened to my good friend and the Senator from South Dakota talk \nabout 16 percent of the gross national product. But the bill that will \ncome out of the House--hopefully passed--and, therefore, will not have \nto come back to the Senate will, No. 1, be nowhere--will be the vast \nmajority of the 16 percent, if that is an accurate figure. But one \nthing that is even more clear to me is it will have absolutely nothing \nto do with reconciliation, just the regular legislative process.\n  The only question about reconciliation and the only place where it \napplies from this Senator's point of view is on that particular add-on \nthat would be done to include some Republican ideas and include a few \nmore things that the House wants to do.\n  I ask the Senator from Utah, why does he say this is reconciliation \naffecting 16 percent of GDP when, in fact, it affects 14 percent or 15 \npercent of GDP, which is simply in the regular order of Senate process \nand has nothing to do with reconciliation?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I have already said that it is the combination of \nthese bills that Washington liberals want and that combination cannot \npass without reconciliation. First of all, we know the House doesn't \nlike the bill that passed in the Senate. If they had the votes to pass \nit over in the House, it would already be passed. So what they have \ndone is come up with some cockamamie misuse of reconciliation to do a \nsmaller bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I have stipulated that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me finish--doing a smaller bill that, assuming they \ncan pass the large bill, would then come over here.\n  I submit to you--and I know it is absolutely true--they can't pass \nthe larger bill. I have also indicated that they may abuse the rules \nfurther by getting a special rule over there that would would have to \ndeem the Senate bill as having been passed by the House even though \nthere never was a vote on it.\n  So the key vote would be the vote on the rule to deem the Senate bill \nas passed. That is a really, really mixed up and messed up version of \nthe reconciliation process. There is only one reason they are doing \nthat, and that is because it is the only way they can possibly get the \nhealth care reform they want.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Then I would further inquire: I don't see any \npossibility of the House changing a bill, which would have to come back \nover to the Senate, because it would be highly unlikely the Senate \nwould be able to pass that bill. So I don't think that will be the \nprocess. I think what the House will do--and they said they haven't \ndone it; therefore they can't do it--well, they said that about the \nSenate bill in the Senate, too, and we did, and it was very close for \nreasons that it got no votes from your side. But that is not the point.\n  The point is, reconciliation on 16 percent of the GDP, if they pass \nit--and this is all in the full time of working out the process on the \nHouse side the Senate bill, which is what they want to try to do, and \nthen the reconciliation is not done on their side, it is done on our \nside, in which we put in a few things to--whatever will be attractive \nto Republicans as well as some things which will help with liberals on \nthe Democratic side in the House because they are more liberal than we \nare.\n  That, I would say to my good friend from Utah, is not reconciliation, \nbut it is put that way for months now. I am on the floor and I have \nthis microphone and you are being kind enough to be patient with me, \nbut it isn't reconciliation. The Senator from South Dakota said it is \n16 percent of the gross domestic product. It isn't. It is probably \nabout 5 percent, 6 percent.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I wish to finish my remarks.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to do it. I wish to finish my remarks, but the \nreal problem is that the House is having difficulty passing the Senate \nbill because an awful lot of liberals don't like it, and an awful lot \nof conservative Democrats don't like it--if there are any conservative \nDemocrats in that body; there may be a few, although there aren't any \nover here in this body. The only way they can get the bill back over \nhere with their small reconciliation package that they talked about--\nthe only way they can do that is by abusing the rules.\n  Frankly, if they had the votes to pass it, it would have been passed \nby now. The Senator from West Virginia and I both know they don't have \nthe votes.\n  Let me just continue on with my remarks. I mentioned earlier that the \nreconciliation process has never been used to enact sweeping social \nlegislation that did not have wide bipartisan support, but I also wish \nto emphasize that such major legislation has had wide bipartisan \nsupport even when passed through the regular legislative process. That \nis the best way to achieve such significant change that can impact so \nmuch of our economy and virtually every American family.\n  The Senate, for example, passed the Social Security Act in August \n1935 by a voice vote. The legislation creating the Medicare Program in \nJuly 1965 received 70 votes, a bipartisan vote. Legislation such as the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, in which I played a significant role, \npassed in 1990 by a vote of 94 to 6, and a revision in 2008 passed the \nSenate and the House unanimously. That is the best way to enact \nsweeping social legislation with wide bipartisan support and the deep \nconsensus of the American people.\n  If you look at the meeting down at the White House of Republicans and \nDemocrats and the President, I think it was shocking to many who had \nbeen blaming Republicans for not coming up with a bill, knowing that \nthere was no chance it would even be considered, to see that \nRepublicans had a lot of ideas and were willing to work with Democrats, \nwould have worked together. We could have started by doing the things \nwe can agree on and then go from there and see what we can do to bring \nabout a bipartisan consensus. But, no, that wasn't good enough.\n  So whether our regular legislative process is used or the exception \nto that process called reconciliation is used, major social legislation \nhas had wide bipartisan support. This one does not. Legislation with \nmuch less impact on the health care bills before us had to have wide \nbipartisan support. But rather than compromise or deviate in any way \nfrom their big government, federally controlled, one-size-fits-all \napproach, Washington liberals have insisted that they know better than \nthe American people, and the American people have caught on to them. \nThese liberals are determined to have their way by any means necessary, \neven by the illegitimate use of an extraordinary process such as \nreconciliation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a column by this body's former majority \nleader, Dr. Bill Frist, appearing in the February 25 edition of the \nWall Street Journal be placed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\n[[Page S1441]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Senator Frist cogently argues that using \nreconciliation for this health care legislation would be a historic and \ndangerous mistake.\n  There is still time to turn back from this path. There is still time \nto do what nearly three-quarters of Americans want us to do and that is \nstart over and work together. I hope we do. I told the President 3 days \nafter the inauguration, when I was down there at their request, that I \nwould be happy to work with him, and I know a lot of other Republicans \nwould be happy to. We were never even called on it.\n  I wish to thank my distinguished colleague from South Dakota, Senator \nThune, for his leadership in this body and his articulate arguments \nhere today. I have appreciated them. He does a great job leading our \npolicy committee and is a real advocate for sound ideas and \nconservative principles. I hope he feels as I do, as we have outlined \ntoday, that on both substance and process the Senate is heading in the \nwrong direction on health care reform. We need to pull back and do it \nright.\n  Mr. THUNE. If the Senator will yield for just one final point.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. THUNE. I think it is an important one point. I hear articulated \nby our colleagues on the other side the whole process by which the \nHouse is acting on this legislation. I served for three terms in the \nHouse of Representatives. I still have colleagues and friends over \nthere, and I know they have a way, through the rules process, of doing \na lot of things that aren't allowed in the Senate.\n  The Senate was designed by our Founders to be more free flowing, to \nslow things down, and to be more deliberative. The Rules Committee \nallows them to put together what is called a self-enacting, self-\nexecuting rule and, as you said, to ``deem as passed'' the Senate bill \nwithout a rollcall vote or without a recorded vote on it, which tells \nus right there that there are a lot of House Members who don't want to \nvote on the Senate-passed bill. They don't want to go on the record.\n  The only way that bill can pass in the House of Representatives is \nwith an accompanying reconciliation vehicle that makes the fixes that \nmost of those House Members want to make.\n  My point simply is this: Health care reform cannot pass absent this \nreconciliation process that is being promised on the House side, and \nalso being promised to House Members is that if they vote for it over \nthere, the Senate will follow suit. With all the points of order that \nwill lie against this legislation when it comes to the Senate, in all \nlikelihood the House Members are being asked to take an incredible leap \nof faith that the Senate is going to be able to maintain many of the \nprovisions they added to the reconciliation bill in the House.\n  The point--and I come back to the dialog the Senator from Utah had \nwith the Senator from West Virginia because I think it is an \ninteresting point of discussion and one criticism I heard from our \ncolleagues on the other side--but, frankly, the House of \nRepresentatives could not pass health care reform absent this \nreconciliation vehicle. It is about one-sixth of our economy. It is \nabout reordering, restructuring, literally, something that is personal \nand important to every American. When you are talking about doing \nissues of that consequence and that impact, it ought to be done, as the \nSenator from Utah has mentioned, as has been done in the past, in a \nbipartisan way that elicits the best suggestions and ideas of both \nsides and gets a broad bipartisan vote in the Senate.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah for his leadership.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate the Senator's remarks. Make no bones about \nit, they know they cannot pass the bill that has been sent over there, \nso they are going to attempt this extraordinary rules gimmick.\n  Frankly, it really disturbs me that on something this important, \nsomething that affects one-sixth of the American economy, they are \nwilling to play games with this in order to get their will when a vast \nmajority of the American people are against what they are doing. Only \nabout 24 percent are for it. Frankly, they want their way no matter \nwhat. If they pull this off, and I question whether they can, but if \nthey do, I believe they are going to pay a tremendous price.\n  It is not the way we should be legislating, especially since a number \nof us have been willing to work with them on issues we agree on first--\nand there is a lot we could agree on first--and then go from there and \nbattle it out on the issues on which we cannot agree. That is a pretty \ngood offer, and it has been on the table from the inauguration on.\n  There is something more to this. It is a question of power. If they \nget control of the health care system of this country and they move it \nmore and more into the Federal Government and more and more people \nbecome dependent on the Federal Government, then it is a question of \npower.\n  I want to make fewer and fewer people dependent on the Federal \nGovernment. I would like to have people have freedoms. This is going to \ntake away freedoms. Not only that, in order to arrive at this $2.5 \ntrillion bill, they have had to use accounting gimmicks like imposing \ntaxes first and then 4 years later implementing other parts of the \nbill. Some of it will not be implemented until 2018, long after \nPresident Obama, assuming he is elected to two terms, is gone. That is \nto accommodate their union friends, knowing that otherwise they will \nnever have the guts to enact that part of the bill.\n  This bill is going to cost a lot more. We are already spending $2.4 \ntrillion on our health care system in this country. They want to add \nanother $2.5 trillion to it. They say it is $1 trillion, but they use \ngimmicks for the first several years. Can you imagine $5 trillion for \nhealth care? And they still do not cover everybody in our society. \nThere is a real issue of whether they are covering a lot of people the \nAmerican taxpayers are going to have to pay for who should not be \ncovered.\n  To use this process to slip such a bill through, it is abysmal. They \nshould be ashamed of themselves. They act as if the American people are \nso doggone stupid, they cannot figure it out. They have already figured \nit out. They know it is not a good thing.\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. THUNE. I think they have figured it out, which is why the last \nsurvey I quoted was the CNN survey which said 48 percent of the people \nwant us to start over and 25 percent want Congress to quit working on \nthe issue altogether. That is literally three-quarters of Americans who \nhave rejected the substance of this legislation--higher taxes, expanded \ngovernment, Medicare cuts, higher premiums for most Americans--and some \nwho flatout do not want anything done, which, as I said, is not the \nview to which I subscribe. Three-quarters of Americans understand what \nthis bill is about. They know how it was put together, and they reject \nboth.\n  Mr. HATCH. I know the distinguished Senator knows as well as I know \nthat there are 1,700 provisions in this bill that turn the power over \nto make decisions on our health care matters to the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services. I don't care whether the Secretary is a Democrat or \na Republican. Naturally, I prefer a Republican, but I don't care \nwhether they are either. That kind of power should not be turned over \nto the bureaucracy.\n  I think Republicans are willing to stand up and have the guts to do \nit. My gosh, there has not been a hand extended to us at all during \nthis process. They just said: Take it or leave it.\n  I was in the Gang of 7 on the Finance Committee. I thought that the \nchairman was trying his best but was not given enough power to really \ncome up with a health care bill, except within the parameters they had \nalready decided. He was so restricted. I decided that I could no longer \ncontinue in those talks.\n  The bill turned out as I thought it would. They took the HELP \nCommittee bill and then they took aspects of the Finance bill and in \none office, with even very few Democrats--no Republicans--they came up \nwith this monstrosity of a bill on which the House now does not want to \nvote. They are going to do anything they can to avoid that vote, even \ngimmicking up the whole process. That is disgraceful, in my eyes.\n  I do not need to go on any further. I think we ought to start over. \nWe ought to do it right. We ought to work together and start with the \nissues on\n\n[[Page S1442]]\n\nwhich we can agree. I think there would be a number of considerable \nissues we can agree on, starting with people who have preexisting \nconditions. They ought to be able to get health insurance. We all agree \non that. There are a number of other things on which we can agree.\n  I thank my dear colleague from South Dakota. I thank him for the \nexcellent remarks he made on the floor. I appreciate him answering some \nof the questions I had.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 25, 2010]\n\nA Historic and Dangerous Senate Mistake: Using `Reconciliation' To Ram \n       Through Health Reform Would Only Deepen Partisan Passions\n\n                            (By Bill Frist)\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has announced that while \n     Democrats have a number of options to complete health-care \n     legislation, he may use the budget reconciliation process to \n     do so. This would be an unprecedented, dangerous and historic \n     mistake.\n       Budget reconciliation is an arcane Senate procedure whereby \n     legislation can be passed using a lowered threshold of \n     requisite votes (a simple majority) under fast-track rules \n     that limit debate. This process was intended for incremental \n     changes to the budget--not sweeping social legislation.\n       Using the budget reconciliation procedure to pass health-\n     care reform would be unprecedented because Congress has never \n     used it to adopt major, substantive policy change. The \n     Senate's health bill is without question such a change: It \n     would fundamentally alter one-fifth of our economy.\n       The first use of this special procedure was in the fall of \n     1980, as the Democratic majority in Congress moved to reduce \n     entitlement programs in response to candidate Ronald Reagan's \n     focus on the growing deficit. Throughout the 1980s and '90s, \n     reconciliation was used to reduce deficit projections and to \n     enact budget enforcement mechanisms. In early 2001, with \n     projected surpluses well into the future, it was used to \n     return a portion of that surplus to the public by changing \n     tax rates.\n       Senators of both parties have assiduously avoided using \n     budget reconciliation as a mechanism to pass expansive social \n     legislation that lacks bipartisan support. In 1993, \n     Democratic leaders--including the dean of Senate procedure \n     and an author of the original Budget Act, Robert C. Byrd--\n     appropriately prevailed on the Clinton administration not to \n     use reconciliation to adopt its health-care agenda. It was \n     used to pass welfare reform in 1996, an entitlement program, \n     but the changes had substantial bipartisan support.\n       In 2003, while I was serving as majority leader, \n     Republicans used the reconciliation process to enact tax \n     cuts. I was approached by members of my own caucus to use \n     reconciliation to extend prescription drug coverage to \n     millions of Medicare recipients. I resisted. The Congress \n     considered the legislation under regular order, and the \n     Medicare Modernization Act passed through the normal \n     legislative procedure in 2003.\n       The same concerns I expressed about using this procedure to \n     fast-track prescription drug expansions with a simple \n     majority vote were similarly expressed by Majority Leader \n     Reid, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, Finance \n     Committee Chairman Max Baucus, and others last year when they \n     chose not to use the procedure to enact their health-care \n     legislation. Over the past several months, an additional 15 \n     Democratic senators have expressed opposition to using this \n     tool.\n       The concerns about using reconciliation to bypass Senate \n     rules which do not limit debate reflect the late New York \n     Democratic Sen. Pat Moynihan's admonishment--that significant \n     policy changes impacting almost all Americans should be \n     adopted with bipartisan support if the legislation is to \n     survive and be supported in the public arena.\n       Applying the reconciliation process is dangerous because it \n     would likely destroy its true purpose, which is to help enact \n     fiscal policy consistent with an agreed-upon congressional \n     budget blueprint. Worse, using reconciliation to amend a bill \n     before it has become law in order to avoid the normal House \n     and Senate conference procedure is a total affront to the \n     legislative process.\n       Finally, enacting sweeping health-care reform through \n     reconciliation is a mistake because of rapidly diminishing \n     public support for the strictly partisan Senate and House \n     health bills. The American people disdain the backroom deals \n     that have been cut with the hospital and pharmaceutical \n     industries, the unions, the public display of the \n     ``cornhusker kickback,'' etc. The public will likely--and in \n     my opinion, rightly--rebel against the use of a procedural \n     tactic to lower the standard threshold for passage because of \n     a lack of sufficient support in the Senate.\n       Americans want bipartisan solutions for major social and \n     economic issues; they don't want legislative gimmicks that \n     force unpopular legislation through the Senate. Thomas \n     Jefferson once referred to the Senate as ``the cooling \n     saucer'' of the legislative process. Using budget \n     reconciliation in this way would dramatically alter the \n     founders' intent for the Senate, and transform it from \n     cooling saucer to a boiling teapot of partisanship.\n       Mr. Reid was right to rule out this option when this saga \n     began last year. He would be wise to abandon it today.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I just heard an interesting colloquy \nbetween two distinguished friends from across the aisle in reference to \nhealth care. Although I found that back-and-forth dialogue very \ninteresting, one problem with the dialogue was it was misinformation \nthat my distinguished colleagues are putting out on this floor and to \nthe people of America. They keep saying we should start over on health \ncare. They are saying we didn't incorporate any of their proposals. And \nthat is the farthest thing from the truth.\n  The work on this bill took over a year, and they had all the input. \nEven the President of the United States incorporated their ideas into \nthe bill we passed from this distinguished body, in the bill that is \nnow lying between the House and the Senate. So while I found their \ncolloquy very interesting, I hope the American people will begin to \nlook at what is being put out here, what is being said here, and \nrealize that our distinguished colleagues across the aisle don't want \nto see health care reform enacted. Evidently, they want to continue \nwith the same old ways, with the insurance companies controlling this \nhealth sick system, not health care system. It is a profit-making \nsystem for them. I hope the American people will see right through \ntheir comments.\n  I want to talk today about whether there are real winners and losers \nin this health care debate. Since the beginning of the debate over \nhealth care reform, we have heard an awful lot about the political \nproblems associated with taking on this issue. It is difficult, it is \ndivisive, and there are no easy answers, and for those reasons, it is \nno wonder our elected leaders have been unable to solve this problem \nfor almost 100 years. This is nothing new. We have been working on this \nin this body for over 97 years.\n  There will never be a shortage of reasons to put off the tough \nquestions, to avoid the tough issues and kick the can down the road. \nThere will never be a shortage of roadblocks and excuses. Over the last \ncentury, we have heard an awful lot of them. But we must not settle for \nthat any longer. We must reject the tired politics of the past and the \ntired politics of right now--and the politics we just heard from my \ndistinguished colleagues from across the aisle. It is now time to lead. \nIt is time to say: Enough is enough--to stop shrugging off the \ndifficult problems and to meet them head on. It is time to \nfundamentally change the conversation.\n  We have heard far too much about the political winners and losers in \nthe health care debate and not enough about the real winners and losers \nin America's health care system. So let us refocus the terms of this \ndiscussion and keep the perspective where it should be: on the ordinary \nAmericans who need our help, the ordinary Americans who need health \ncare coverage now.\n  Because this isn't about electoral math. It is not about poll numbers \nor partisan talking points or cold statistics. It is about hard-working \nfolks who are suffering and dying every single day under a system that \nis badly in need of repair. It is about the people whose lives and \nlivelihoods are on the line. Our success or failure at passing reform \nwill have political consequences for some of the people in this \nChamber, but I believe those concerns are insignificant compared to the \nreal consequences it will have for ordinary Americans all across this \ncountry.\n  So I call upon my colleagues in the Senate and my friends in the \nmedia to focus our attention on what matters. Let's talk about what \nreform means for regular folks, not politicians or special\n\n[[Page S1443]]\n\ninterests or even insurance lobbyists. This is bigger than politics. \nThis is about addressing a national problem that has touched untold \nmillions of lives over the past 100 years.\n  As we debate this legislation today, there are 47 million people in \nthis country without any insurance coverage at all, and there are \nanother 41 million people who lack stable coverage. For every year we \nfail to pass reform, another 45,000 Americans will die because they do \nnot have health insurance and can't get access to the care they need. \nThese are the people who are depending on us--folks in Illinois and \nevery other State in this Union. These are the people who stand to \nbenefit from our reform proposals and who continue to suffer every \nsingle day that we fail to take action; for example, people such as \nLinda and her husband, back in my home State of Illinois. In 2008, they \nwere paying $577 per month for health insurance under the COBRA \nprogram. They each had a clean bill of health and had no reason to fear \nillness or injury. But when their COBRA coverage ran out on the first \nday of 2009, their premiums jumped up to over $1,000 per month. They \nhad no idea why the change was so drastic. They were perfectly healthy. \nYet their monthly bills had almost doubled. So to try to save money, \nLinda and her husband switched to the individual insurance market and \ngot a plan with a $5,000 deductible and a large copay. The switch was \neasy. They didn't even have to get a physical exam. Like many \nAmericans, they had every reason to believe their coverage was secure.\n  When Linda's husband got sick in October of 2009, he had a successful \nbypass surgery. The insurance provider approved the procedure ahead of \ntime. But once the surgery was complete, the company simply changed its \nmind. Even though Linda and her husband had never been treated for \nprevious heart problems, and even though he had not even been diagnosed \nwith anything, Blue Cross/Blue Shield suddenly decided he had a \npreexisting condition and they rescinded his policy. His coverage ended \non the spot, and he and his wife were left out in the cold. Today, they \nowe medical bills that add up to $208,000, with $89,000 about to go \ninto collection.\n  Linda and her husband are just like millions of us in this country; \nthey were perfectly healthy; they thought they had stable insurance; \nthey paid for quality coverage. And then, when they needed it most, \ntheir insurance company walked away from them. That is absurd. That \nshould not happen to anybody in the United States of America.\n  I think Linda said it best when she said:\n\n       They did nothing but take our money, and now they're \n     sticking us with the bill.\n\n  This is outrageous and it is totally unacceptable. Yet this is the \nreality faced by millions of Americans every single day. Insurance \ncompanies should no longer be allowed to pull this kind of bait-and-\nswitch action on anybody. That is why we need to pass reform that will \ngive people like Linda the ability to hold insurance companies \naccountable so they can stop abusing their customers. That is why we \nneed to restore robust competition to the market, so people can shop \naround if they don't think they are getting a fair deal with their \ninsurance provider. That is why we need reform that will provide real \ncost savings, so coverage is affordable for Linda and her husband, \nalong with millions of others like them. These are the people our \nlegislation is designed to help.\n  I think we have heard enough talk about the political winners and \nlosers in the health care debate. We have heard enough about \nWashington. Because across America, the only real winners are the big \ninsurance corporations that continue to rake in the cash, making record \nprofits. We saw the reports given on their income for 2009--record \nprofits for the insurance companies, with less coverage, and millions \nof Americans being denied coverage. The only real losers are the hard-\nworking Americans who can't afford coverage and can't get treatment.\n  It is our duty to fight for these folks, and I would urge my \ncolleagues to honor this sacred trust. The other day President Obama \ngave a stern speech that captured the spirit of this fight. He called \nfor bipartisan cooperation and urged regular Americans to get angry and \nto get fired up and to say: We aren't going to take it anymore. He \nasked them to get involved in this process so we can pass this bill and \nmake reform a reality for Linda and millions of others.\n  My colleagues, let us take President Obama's speech as a wake-up \ncall. Let us listen to the will of the American people. We have moved \nthis legislation further than any other Congress. At this time, we \ncannot let this legislation not become effective. It should become \neffective, it will become effective, and we must finish the job.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3485 to Amendment No. 3452\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to discuss an \namendment I intend to offer.\n  The U.S. shipyards play an important role in supporting our Nation's \nmaritime presence by building and repairing our domestic fleet. The \nindustry has a significant impact on our national economy by adding \nbillions of dollars to our annual output. The commercial shipbuilding \nand ship repair industry is a pillar of the American steelworker labor \nforce, employing nearly 40,000 skilled workers.\n  In the year 2000, the Philadelphia shipyard was rebuilt on the site \nof the U.S. Navy shipyard. The Philadelphia Naval Shipyard was a \nhistorical institution in Philadelphia, employed upwards of 40,000 \nduring the height of the war. At the time of its closing, it employed \nabout 7,000. We fought the case to retain the Philadelphia Naval \nShipyard all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States because \nthe government on the BRAC had concealed information from admirals that \nthe yard ought to be kept open. But the case was too difficult, argued \non the grounds that there was an unconstitutional delegation of \nauthority to the base-closing commission. But the Supreme Court would \nhave had to have overturned some 300 decisions to leave the \nPhiladelphia Naval Shipyard intact.\n  The Aker Philadelphia Shipyard employs some 1,200 highly skilled \nprofessional workers. Since 2003, it has built more than 50 percent of \nthe large commercial vessels produced in the United States. \nAdditionally, the shipyard contributes over $230 million annually to \nthe Philadelphia region--$5 to $7 million per month in local purchases, \n$8.5 million in annual revenues to the city of Philadelphia--and \nsupports over 8,000 jobs throughout the region. Today, the Aker \nPhiladelphia Shipyard is one of only two companies producing large \ncommercial vessels in the United States and is a critical asset to the \neconomic vitality of the mid-Atlantic region of the domestic \nshipbuilding industry.\n  Since the economic downturn, shipyards such as the Aker Philadelphia \nShipyard do not qualify for loan guarantees under existing programs at \nthe Department of Transportation. Without assistance, shipyards will be \nforced to begin reducing their highly skilled workforce.\n  As the economy recovers, so will the need for ships and our domestic \nshipbuilding capacity. There will also be an additional need for ships, \nas almost $5 billion worth of double-hull construction and conversion \nwork will need to take place by the year 2015 to meet the double-hull \nrequirement under the Oil Pollution Control Act of 1990.\n  To address this dire situation facing our domestic shipbuilding \nindustry, I am seeking the establishment of a loan guarantee program \nwhere the Secretary of Transportation can issue a loan guarantee for \n$165 million to qualifying shipyards. Because loan guarantees leverage \nfunding, the program would require only $15 million to leverage the \n$165 million. The $15 million is offset by reprogramming previously \nappropriated funds, so there is no additional spending associated with \nthis program. The Federal assistance would be short-term financing, \nbridge financing, to enable shipyards to remain in operation and meet \nthe future anticipated demand for domestically produced ships.\n\n[[Page S1444]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the full text of my statement printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak on \n     an amendment I am offering to H.R. 1586, which is the \n     legislative vehicle for the FAA Air Transportation \n     Modernization and Safety Improvement Act.'' This amendment \n     would create a loan guarantee program to maintain the \n     domestic manufacturing capacity for shipbuilding.\n       With the U.S. economy still struggling to recover, \n     manufacturing investments can have an immediate impact. \n     Manufacturers have lost more than two million jobs since the \n     recession began in December of 2007, so there is an \n     opportunity to create a large number of jobs in the industry \n     and to simultaneously revitalize our economy and overall \n     global competitiveness. One area where benefits can \n     immediately be seen is the shipbuilding industry. U.S. \n     shipyards play an important role in supporting our Nation's \n     maritime presence by building and repairing our domestic \n     fleet; and the industry has a significant impact on our \n     national economy by adding billions of dollars to U.S. \n     economic output annually.\n       These shipbuilding investments are vital to the United \n     States, creating thousands of good-paying jobs across the \n     country. The commercial shipbuilding and ship repair industry \n     is a pillar of the American skilled labor workforce employing \n     nearly 40,000 skilled workers; and the ships produced \n     domestically are an integral part of commerce, international \n     trade, the Navy, Coast Guard, and other military and \n     emergency support. With more than 80 percent of the world's \n     trade carried in whole or part by seaborne transportation, \n     the shipbuilding industry has always had and will continue to \n     have a large industrial base that can support significant job \n     creation and economic growth.\n       Since the mid 1990s, the industry has been experiencing a \n     period of expansion and renewal. The last expansion was \n     largely market-driven, backed by long-term customer \n     commitments. Those new assets created much more productive \n     and advanced ships than those they replaced. For example, \n     articulated double-hull tank barge units replaced single-hull \n     product tankers in U.S. coastal trades, and new dual \n     propulsion double-hull crude carriers replaced 30+ year-old, \n     steam propulsion single-hull crude carriers. The new crude \n     carriers are larger, faster, more fuel-efficient and have a \n     four-fold increase in efficiency over the vessels they \n     replaced.\n       During the last expansion, the Department of \n     Transportation's Maritime Administration touted the success \n     of Aker Philadelphia Shipyard as a great achievement for the \n     American shipbuilding industry. In 2000, Aker Philadelphia \n     Shipyard was rebuilt on the site of a closed U.S. Navy \n     shipyard. In a few short years, the shipyard became the \n     country's most modern shipbuilding facility employing 1,200 \n     highly skilled professional workers. Since 2003, it has built \n     more than 50 percent of the large commercial vessels produced \n     in the United States. Additionally, the shipyard contributes \n     over $230 million annually to the Philadelphia region, $5 \n     million to $7 million per month in local purchases, $8.6 \n     million in annual tax revenues to the City of Philadelphia, \n     and supports over 8,000 jobs throughout the region. Today, \n     Aker Philadelphia Shipyard is one of only two companies \n     producing large commercial vessels in the United States and \n     is a critical asset to the economic viability of the mid-\n     Atlantic region and the domestic shipbuilding industry.\n       Despite these successes, the economic collapse has stalled \n     the shipbuilding industry by delaying planned ship \n     acquisitions, constraining the credit markets, and making \n     large vessel acquisitions impossible to finance. The long-\n     term customer driven commitments that drove the last \n     expansion are not a possibility in this economic climate. As \n     a result, this industry, which is a part of the national \n     security industrial base, supports thousands of highly \n     skilled jobs, and is critical to the industrial fabric of our \n     nation, is struggling to survive.\n       Since the economic downturn, shipyards such as the Aker \n     Philadelphia Shipyard do not qualify for loan guarantees \n     under existing programs at the Department of Transportation. \n     Without assistance, shipyards will be forced to begin \n     reducing their highly skilled workforce, apprentice programs, \n     and vendor and supplier contracts, at a time when we can \n     least afford additional job losses. If this situation \n     persists and companies like Aker were to cease operations, \n     our nation's ability to construct commercial vessels would be \n     severely limited and the investments we made to build this \n     state-of-the-art facility would be lost.\n       At the same time, there is a strong and direct correlation \n     between the performance of shipbuilding and the global \n     economy and trade. Shipbuilding activities rise when global \n     trade and the economy grow. Likewise, shipbuilding will be \n     among the first activities to suffer when trade slumps and \n     the economy stutters. This puts shipbuilding at the forefront \n     of one of the world's key and most important economic \n     activities, and a reliable barometer of economic performance.\n       As the economy recovers, so will the need for ships and our \n     domestic shipbuilding capacity. The Maritime Administration \n     has recognized that construction of vessels for the Nation's \n     marine highway system could result in significant new \n     opportunities for U.S. shipyards. The shipbuilding industry \n     is also developing vessel portfolios that can be leveraged by \n     the government including military vessels to meet the \n     nation's needs in time of national emergency. For example, \n     the Navy's Littoral Combat Ship and Joint High Speed Vessel \n     programs are based on commercially designed and available \n     vessels. There will also be a need for additional ships as \n     almost $5 billion worth of double hull construction and \n     conversion work will need to take place by 2015 to meet the \n     double hull requirement under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.\n       To address the dire situation facing the domestic \n     shipbuilding industry, I am seeking the establishment of a \n     loan guarantee program, where the Secretary of Transportation \n     can issue a loan guarantee for $165 million to qualifying \n     shipyards. Because loan guarantees leverage funding, the \n     program would require only $15 million to leverage $165 \n     million. This $15 million is offset by reprogramming \n     previously appropriated funds, so there is no additional \n     spending associated with this program.\n       The federal assistance would be a short-term financing \n     ``bridge'' to enable shipyards to remain in operation and \n     meet the future anticipated demand for domestically produced \n     ships. I encourage my colleagues to help maintain the \n     commercial shipbuilding capacity of the United States through \n     the inclusion of a loan guarantee program.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is my intent to offer this amendment when the time is \nright. I know the distinguished majority leader is now arranging a \nschedule of pending amendments for votes. So I will not offer it at \nthis time but will seek to have all of the relevant record and all of \nthe relevant information included in the Record as I have stated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the legislation on the floor of the \nSenate is the FAA reauthorization bill. Senator Rockefeller is here, \nSenator Hutchison has been here, and we are working now, trying to find \na way to move the legislation. It has attracted a lot of amendments \nthat have nothing at all to do with the subject. It is as if some \nbelieve this is not urgent or important. Of course, nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. There is an urgency to this legislation.\n  I know it is not, perhaps, the highest profile legislation in the \nCongress these days, but we have a requirement to reauthorize the \nactivities of the FAA. We have now failed to do that and instead had to \nextend their authorization 11 successive times. But because we extend \nit, we then do not improve the authorization and do the things that are \nnecessary for improving airline safety, the things that are necessary \nto include the passenger bill of rights which is in this bill, airport \nimprovement funds, and particularly modernization of the air traffic \ncontrol system.\n  I mentioned yesterday the urgency of moving on what is called \nNextGen; that is, next-generation air traffic control.\n  In this country, we now fly to ground-based radar. We have all of \nthese airplanes in the sky. Most of them have a transponder or \nsomething that puts a mark on a controller's screen somewhere in an air \ntraffic control sector, and it says, this is where the airplane is. \nWell, that is technically right at that nanosecond, that is where the \nairplane is, but instantly thereafter the airplane is somewhere else, \nand for the next 7 seconds or so, as the sweep of the radar occurs, \nthat airplane, particularly if it is a jet, is long gone from that \nlittle spot. So because we do not know exactly where the airplane is--\nwe know about where the airplane is--we have routes that are flown that \nare much less direct than they should be. We use more fuel than we \nshould. Rather than have direct flights, we cost the passengers time \nand we pollute the air by keeping that airplane in the sky longer \nbecause we cannot fly direct routes because we do not fly by GPS. Our \nchildren can operate by GPS with their cell phones, but we cannot fly \nor we do not fly a system of GPS. We fly a system of ground-based radar \nfor our navigation, and that has been around forever.\n  I mentioned yesterday the circumstances of being able to control air \ntraffic in this country. When people began to learn how to fly and they \nstarted flying airplanes and figured out they could make money by \ncarrying the mail, they could only do that when the Sun was up because \nthey could not figure out how to fly at night. So they started building \nbonfires, and then they would fly to a bonfire, put a big-\n\n[[Page S1445]]\n\nold bonfire out there 50 miles away and fly to a bonfire and then land. \nThen they put up light stanchions with the lights into the air so they \ncould fly toward the lights. Then they invented radar. Then they fly \nbased on and guided by ground-based radar.\n  But we are way beyond ground-based radar right now. That is what we \nstill use. But you do not drive a car out here with ground-based radar; \nyou drive a car with GPS. Talk about all of the people who are driving \ntheir vehicles using this little monitor--that is GPS. Your kids have \nGPS on their cell phones, but if you are on a 757 with 250 people \nbehind the cockpit flying from Washington, DC, to Seattle, you are not \nflying by GPS because they do not have the technology, they do not have \nthe equipage in the planes, in most cases, and they do not have the \ncapability on the ground through the FAA to convert from ground-based \nradar to GPS and something called Next Generation, modernization of the \nair traffic control system.\n  If we pass this legislation, finally, at long last, we will move in \nthat direction aggressively. I have met with the Europeans and others \nwho are moving aggressively on Next Generation, and we just keep \nextending--11 times--the FAA reauthorization bill.\n  So we bring it to the floor. It includes safety, which I will talk \nabout in a moment, it includes investment in the airport infrastructure \nin this country, which means jobs, putting people back to work. But we \nbring the bill to the floor at long last, I think 3 years after it \nshould have been done but we could not do it because it got extended.\n  Now we have amendments that have nothing at all to do with this--\nearmark moratoriums, discretionary spending limits, school vouchers for \nWashington, DC, coastal impact programs for drilling. They do not have \nthe foggiest thing to do with the bill that is on the floor of the \nSenate, which is why it is so hard to get things done.\n  I have often said, you know, the difference between a glacier and the \nSenate is at least you can see a glacier move from time to time. It is \nso hard to get things done. And this is a demonstration of it right \nnow. People come trotting to the floor of the Senate and say: Oh, we \nare working on aviation safety. You know what. Why don't I offer an \namendment on something that has nothing to do with it at all and then \ngo back to my office. It is unbelievable to me.\n  Let me talk for a moment about safety because that also represents \nthe urgency in this bill.\n  I chaired the hearing--several of them now--on the tragic crash that \noccurred in Buffalo, NY, 1 year ago. It took 50 lives--the captain, the \ncopilot, flight attendants, passengers, and 1 person died on the \nground. This is a case where, when we investigate it, as we have, a lot \nof things went wrong. We have a very safe system, very few accidents, \nbut if you investigate what happened that night flying into Buffalo, \nNY, you understand we are not far away from another accident unless we \nfix some of these things.\n  Here is a Dash 8 airplane, propeller airplane, flying at night in icy \nconditions in the winter, about to land in Buffalo, NY.\n  Here is what we have learned. I don't know whether it is just this \ncase, just this cockpit, just this airplane, but I doubt it. What we \nlearned is the captain of the plane had not slept in a bed 2 nights \nprevious. The copilot had not slept in a bed the night before. Two \npeople in the cockpit had not slept in a bed the night before the \nflight. Why? The copilot flew from Seattle all the way to Newark to be \nat the duty station because that is where she went to work. She flew \nall night long on a plane that stopped in Memphis to get to the duty \nstation. This is a young woman making between $20,000 and $23,000 a \nyear in salary. Do we think a young pilot making $20,000 or $23,000--\nwhich raises another question about compensation, low compensation--do \nwe think that person, if that person travels all night, is going to \nhave the money to pay for a hotel? I don't think so. Two people in that \ncockpit flying at night in the winter with icing conditions.\n  We now know that what are supposed to be sterile conditions in the \ncockpit, speaking only below 10,000 feet and only about what is \nhappening with that airplane, that sterile condition was violated \nrepeatedly, talking about other things, careers and so on. We know now \nthere was a training deficiency with respect to the issue of the stick \npush and the stick shaker which engaged when the icing became \nsignificant. We now know that the most wanted list of airline safety \nrequirements from the NTSB, they have had on their most wanted list \nseveral things that deal with fatigue, with icing that have been there \nfor 10, 15 years. All of these things come together and raise questions \nabout how do you fix this, how do you make sure this doesn't happen \nagain.\n  I am not suggesting that regional airlines are unsafe, although I \nthink evidence suggests that the most recent crashes have been regional \ncarriers. There are questions about the number of hours required to be \nable to sit in the right seat on a regional carrier. There are \nquestions about whether the majors that hire a regional carrier to \ncarry passengers have some responsibility for that. I believe they \nshould. But when someone gets on a regional carrier, which carries 50 \npercent of the passengers in the country, all they see is the fuselage \nand the marking that says United, Continental, Delta, USAIR. That is \nall they see. But that may not be the company that is transporting \nthem. It may be a very different company, a regional airline company.\n  The question is, that trunk carrier whose brand exists on the \nfuselage, have they required the same set of standards? Is there one \nlevel of safety? That is a requirement dating back at the time in the \nmid-1990s, one level of safety. When you step on an airplane, you \nshould have the opportunity to believe that in that cockpit, on that \nplane, with the training and so on, there is one level expected. I \nthink this crash in Buffalo raises serious questions about whether that \nexists.\n  I had a chart that describes a combination of a couple of issues. One \nis duty time. The other is fatigue. The third is commuting. In this \ncase, with this tragedy, I want to show what has occurred. It requires \nus to address this issue. I want to show a chart that shows Colgan Air \npilots. This could be a chart of virtually any airline, the major \ncarriers or the regional carriers. What it shows is where the Colgan \npilots were commuting from in order to get to the work station at \nNewark, living in Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and \ncommuting to work all the way across the country. It is not unusual. \nCommuting has been going on for a long time. But the issue of commuting \nis a reasonable issue for us to try to understand and do something \nabout.\n  It also relates to the issue of fatigue. Do you think in that cockpit \non that airplane, with a pilot who hadn't slept in a bed for 2 nights \nand a copilot that hadn't slept in a bed the night previous, there was \nnot fatigue? It seems pretty unlikely that that group was not fatigued. \nWe don't in this bill address the issue of commuting. Randy Babbitt, \nthe FAA Administrator, now has sent to OMB a rulemaking on fatigue \nwhich is important.\n  My point is, this crash, this tragedy a year ago raised so many \nquestions. You can make the point that this is a very safe system. All \nof us fly all the time. Most every weekend we get on airplanes \nbelieving that we are being transported safely. I am not trying to \nscare anybody to say that is not the case. I am saying you can decide \nto ignore some of the things we have discovered about the Colgan crash, \nbut we do that at our risk, at the risk of reducing that margin of \nsafety.\n  Here is what a pilot said in a Wall Street Journal article on the \nsubject. This is an 18-year veteran pilot describing the routine of \ncommuter flights with short layovers in the middle of night: Take a \nshower, brush your teeth, then pretend you slept.\n  An important issue for those who fly airplanes, an important issue in \nterms of the question, are pilots fatigued? This shows a pilot watching \na movie on his computer at a crash house in Sterling Park, VA. It \nhouses up to 20 to 24 occupants and is designed to give flight crews \nfrom regional airlines a quiet place to sleep near their base. Many \ncan't afford hotels.\n  The copilot made between $20,000 and $23,000 a year. That was her \nsalary. She had a part-time job working at a coffee shop. She got on \nthe airplane in Seattle to fly to Newark to begin her\n\n[[Page S1446]]\n\nworkday because that is where her duty station was. She flew all night \nlong to do it. The fact is, crews who are making that amount of money, \nparticularly those who are flying right seat in an airplane, did not \nhave the funding to get a motel room.\n  My point is, Senator Rockefeller and I and others have worked on this \nFAA reauthorization bill to try to address a wide range of issues. This \nis one, the issue of safety.\n  In addition, the captain of this plane had failed a number of \ndifferent exams along the way to getting accredited. But the airline \nthat hired the pilot was not able to have the information to understand \nthat. This legislation changes that. This airline has said: Had we \nknown about the failure of those exams, this pilot would not have been \nhired. But he was because the company didn't know. This legislation \nfixes that. If you want to hire a pilot, you know everything there is \nto know about the record of that pilot.\n  My point is, Senator Rockefeller and I, Senator Hutchison and others, \nhave brought this bill to the floor of the Senate at long last hoping \nthat perhaps we can get a bill passed. There is an urgency here with \nrespect to safety and other things. I hope Senator Rockefeller and \nothers can expect some cooperation. It is very hard to get cooperation \nhere on the floor of the Senate, but if ever there is something we \nmight decide to cooperate on, how about making certain there is an \nextra margin of safety in the skies by passing legislation that \naddresses, among other issues, aviation safety. If we do that, we will \ngive the American people some measure of confidence on this important \nsubject.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 3475.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand that is the process right now. However, I \nwill discuss the amendment. It is very simple. It would place a \nmoratorium on all earmarks in years in which there is a deficit. I am \npleased to be joined in this effort by my good friend from Indiana \nSenator Bayh. I thank him for his leadership and courage.\n  I am sure I don't need to remind my colleagues about our Nation's \nfiscal situation. But let's review the facts anyway. This morning the \nTreasury Department announced that the government racked up a record \nhigh monthly budget deficit of $220.9 billion last month. We now have a \ndeficit of over $1.4 trillion and a debt of over $12.5 trillion. I \nrecently have seen a bumper sticker in Arizona that says: Please don't \ntell the President what comes after a trillion.\n  Unemployment remains close to 10 percent. According to Forbes.com, a \nrecord 2.8 million American households were threatened with foreclosure \nlast year. That number is expected to rise to well over 3 million homes \nthis year. Even with all of this, we continue to spend and spend and \nspend. Every time we pass an appropriations bill with increased \nspending loaded up with earmarks, we are robbing future generations of \ntheir ability to obtain the American dream. I believe that is immoral. \nThat is why I have been pleased and somewhat surprised over the last \nseveral days to hear about the renewed bipartisan interest in banning \nearmarks. I am thankful for the attention. I welcome the Democratic \nHouse leadership to the fight against earmarks.\n  According to today's Washington Post:\n\n       Facing an election year backlash over runaway spending and \n     ethics scandals, House Democrats moved Wednesday to ban \n     earmarks for private companies, sparking a war between the \n     parties over which would embrace the most dramatic steps to \n     change the way business is done in Washington.\n\n  I applaud the Democrats in the other body for this step. It is a \nsmall step, but it is a step in the right direction. As House \nAppropriations Committee Chairman Obey pointed out, the fiscal year \n2010 budget included more than 1,000 earmarks for private companies. So \nthe effect of the moratorium proposed by the other body would be a \nreduction of about 1,000 earmarks. The problem with this is that there \nwere over 9,000 earmarks loaded onto just one of the bills we passed \nlast year.\n  According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, last year's earmarks funded \nby Congress but not requested by the administration totaled $15.9 \nbillion. So we spent $15.9 billion on earmarks while we are facing the \nhighest national debt in history. Additionally, according to today's \nCongressional Quarterly, ``there are several significant catches'' to \nthe House Democrats' earmark moratorium. They note:\n\n       If a program is not formally considered an earmark, \n     according to congressional rules, for instance, it could \n     escape any ban. Billions of dollars in spending for the \n     defense industry could end up slipping through that caveat \n     alone, analysts say.\n\n  So why am I not surprised. Thankfully, the House Republican caucus \nrecognized the fact that the Speaker's proposal did little to seriously \naddress the problem so they upped the ante and voted unanimously to \nimpose an across-the-board earmark ban on their conference. I \ncongratulate Mr. Boehner and especially Congressman Flake of Arizona \nfor taking this bold step. It was the right thing to do.\n  Unfortunately, this newfound zeal for attacking earmarks is not \nshared by their Senate counterparts. According to today's Congressional \nQuarterly:\n\n       Senate Democrats signal that they would not follow suit, \n     even as senior House Republicans responded that all earmarks \n     should be banned.\n\n  Congressional Quarterly also noted:\n\n       It is not clear where Majority Leader Harry Reid stands. \n     His office declined to comment on the House appropriations \n     move. But the Senate appropriators' opposition does not bode \n     well for a ban's prospects in that body.\n\n  Again, I am not surprised. The Washington Post article I cited \nearlier also noted that:\n\n       The latest earmark reform efforts follow a wave of \n     investigations focusing on House appropriators' actions. The \n     Justice Department has looked into the earmarking activities \n     of several lawmakers and, relying on public documents, the \n     House Ethics Committee investigated five Democrats and two \n     Republicans on the Appropriations defense subcommittee, \n     finding that the lawmakers steered more than $245 million to \n     clients of a lobbying firm under federal criminal \n     investigation.\n       The lawmakers collected more than $840,000 in political \n     contributions from the firm's lobbyists and clients in a \n     little more than two years.\n\n  The battle over earmarks has been waged over many years--I have been \nengaged in it for 20 years--and I am under no illusions that it will \nend anytime soon. I was encouraged in January 2007 when the Senate \npassed, by a vote of 96 to 2, an ethics and lobbying reform package \nwhich contained, meaningful earmark reforms. I believed that at last we \nwould finally enact some effective reforms. Unfortunately, that victory \nwas short lived.\n  In August 2007--some 8 months later--we were presented with a bill \ncontaining very watered-down earmark provisions and doing far too \nlittle to rein in wasteful earmarks and porkbarrel spending. I find \nmyself encouraged by what I have heard over the last several days, but \nI have been around here long enough to know not to get my hopes up. I \ndo not look at this as being cynical, just practical.\n  Let's take a look at some of the things we have spent hundreds of \nbillions of taxpayers' dollars on over the last several years: $165,000 \nfor maple syrup research in Vermont; $150,000 for the Polynesian \nVoyaging Society in Honolulu; $250,000 for turtle observer funding; \n$500,000 for the Bellevue Arts Museum in Washington; $2 million for the \nalgae research in Washington; $500,000--one of my all-time favorites; \nit comes back all the time--to the National Wild Turkey Federation in \nNebraska; $799,000 for soybean research; $349,000 for pig waste \nmanagement in North Carolina; $819,000 for catfish genome research in \nAlabama; $250,000 for gypsy moth research in New Jersey; $1 million for \npotato research at Oregon State University--and the list goes on--a \n$250,000 earmark for the Iowa Vitality Center at Iowa State University. \nThe list goes on and on.\n  For over 20 years, I have fought vigorously against the wasteful \npractice of earmarking. The fight has been a lonely one and has not won \nme friends in this town over the years. But it is an important fight, \nand I am confident that, in the end, the opponents of this practice \nwill be victorious. The corruption which stems from earmarking has \nresulted in current and former Members of both the House and the Senate\n\n[[Page S1447]]\n\neither under investigation, under indictment, or in prison.\n  Again, I was pleased to see that the Speaker of the House and the \nchairman of the House Appropriations Committee have recognized earmarks \nfor what they are: a corrupting influence that should not be tolerated \nin these times of fiscal crisis--or ever. I applaud my Republican \ncolleagues in the House and Senate, especially Senators Coburn and \nDeMint, who have called for a yearlong moratorium on all earmarks. I \nfully support and join them in those efforts.\n  But I also think we need to do more. We need a complete ban on \nearmarks until our budget is balanced and we have eliminated our \nmassive deficit. This amendment, if considered--and I will make it \nconsidered at one point or another--will have a proposal to do just \nthat, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort. It is \nwhat the American people want, and we have an obligation to give it to \nthem.\n  We, as Members of Congress, owe it to the American people to conduct \nourselves in a way that reinforces, rather than diminishes, the \npublic's faith and confidence in Congress. An informed citizenry is \nessential to a thriving democracy, and a democratic government operates \nbest in the disinfecting light of the public eye. By seriously \naddressing the corrupting influence of earmarks, we will allow Members \nto legislate with the imperative that our government must be free from \ncorrupting influences, both real and perceived. We must act now to \nensure that the erosion we see today in the public's confidence in \nCongress does not become a complete collapse of faith in our \ninstitutions. We can and we must end the practice of earmarking.\n  I have traveled around the country and all around my home State of \nArizona. I have seen the Tea Party participants. I have met citizens in \nmy State who have never ever been involved in the political process \nbefore. They are angry, they are frustrated, and they want change. They \nwant the change that was promised them last November, which they have \nnot gotten. They want us to act as careful stewards of their tax \ndollars.\n  Just the other night, my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, and I \nwere on a teleconference call to the citizens of our State, and many \nthousands of them were on the call, and we responded to their \nquestions. A guy on the phone--he was from Thatcher, AZ--said: I've \nnever been involved nor cared much about politics before. But you have \ngotten me off the couch.\n  ``You have gotten me off the couch.'' We have lots of people ``off \nthe couch'' because they are saying: Enough. They are saying: Enough of \na $1.4 trillion debt this year and an increase in that debt for next \nyear of some $1.5 trillion and an accumulated debt of $12.5 trillion. \nThey believe we have spent too much and we have taxed too much.\n  So I hope we can send a message by completely banning earmarks and go \nthrough the appropriate process for the funding of sometimes much \nneeded projects; that is, the authorization and then appropriation \nroute. Many people believe I am saying--I and those of us who oppose \nearmarks--that we are against any projects for anyone's State or much \nneeded help.\n  It is not the case. What we are saying is that we want any project \nand expenditure of taxpayers' dollars authorized and then appropriated. \nThat way, by authorizing, the authorizing committees can compare all \nthe virtues or the necessities of every project and match them up \nagainst one another rather than an appropriation being added in the \nmiddle of the night that is directly related to a position on the \nAppropriations Committee or a position of influence rather than merit. \nWe cannot afford to continue that practice which has led to the anger \nand cynicism of the American people, and also has led over time to the \ninvestigation, sometimes indictment, and even incarceration of Members \nof Congress in Federal prison.\n  So I urge my colleagues to now stand up and do the right thing; that \nis, to ban the earmarks, at least until we can tell the American people \nwe have eliminated this debt we have laid on our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  I say to the distinguished chairman of the committee, I did have an \namendment on bicycle storage facilities, and one other. Perhaps at the \nappropriate time--I will be glad to brief the chairman and his staff--\nit would be appropriately in order.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, a primary emphasis I have put into \nthis Federal aviation bill over the last number of years is modernizing \nour air traffic control system. I have heard myself talk about it so \nmuch that I am tired of listening to myself. But, on the other hand, I \nam not sure other people have heard it enough, it is so important.\n  One way of explaining it is that most cars use a more sophisticated \nglobal positioning system than do our air carriers, our legacy \nairlines. That is kind of pathetic and it has to end. The only way we \ncan do that is by modernizing the air traffic control system. It is \ndoable. There is money in the bill to do it on an annual basis. It \nshould be completed by the year 2025. In fact, it has already begun. In \none of the Gulf States, it is completed and they are using it. Mongolia \nis using it, and we just would think it is not too much to ask to catch \nup to Mongolia on air traffic control.\n  We have a very safe air system, but it is not safe enough. By that I \nmean we move 30,000 flights a day in America. More than half of all the \nair traffic in the world is American. Nearly 700 million people per \nyear use our airplanes. So how you position airplanes and how you guide \nthem and how they know where they are and where they are going and how \nthey can most quickly and safely get there is very important.\n  The FAA's recent forecasts say there will be probably a 50-percent \nincrease in the foreseeable future. That will be well over 1 billion \npassengers per year. But we are already stretched too thin in the air \ntraffic control system that we have, which is antiquated and which is \nowned by no other industrialized country in the world, obviously, \nincluding Mongolia, which probably is not fully industrialized.\n  So the Next Generation Air Transportation System--and the word for it \nis NextGen; we just use that word--will create the capacity, will save \nus millions of dollars, it will help clean up our air because airplanes \nwill be able to go from one place to the other because they will be \nable to see in real time what the weather patterns are, where other \nplanes are. It will help the air traffic controllers on the ground \nposition them. Airplanes will be able to fly more closely to each \nother's tail, so to speak. In all ways, it will be much more efficient, \nmuch more manageable--all in real time. We do it with our automobiles, \nand we ought to be able to do it with planes.\n  It is very good environmentally, which to the Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from New Hampshire, may sound like a reasonable prospect. Jet \nfuel is not inexpensive, and it is not carbon free. This will produce a \nlot less carbon emissions. It will also lower another kind of emission, \nwhich is noise, which affects people, and not just in this city but \neverywhere.\n  Most importantly, NextGen will dramatically improve safety, and that \nis the whole point. It will provide pilots and air traffic controllers \nwith better situational awareness. It is what we do for our troops, it \nis what we do for ourselves, and we need to do it for our airplanes.\n  If you can see weather maps in real time--and you just know airplanes \nare going this way and that way to avoid what they visually see in the \nway of clouds or rain or whatever--if they can get it in real-time GPS, \nthen they can cut right through and go from point to point much \nquicker.\n  So our bill, S. 1451, takes a lot of steps right away to do that. We \nwill be spending $500 million a year--that is in the bill--on this. We \nexpect it to be finished by 2025. It seems like a long time. We are not \ngoing to pay for all of it. We are going to ask the airlines to pay for \nequipage, which is their electronic response to what is on the ground, \nwhich is what we will pay for. Obviously,\n\n[[Page S1448]]\n\nevery airplane will have to have that. They will want to do that. They \nwill not like paying for it, but they will not like not having it when \neverybody else does.\n  The bill takes further steps to make certain about NextGen. This is \none of those items that does not sound very good, but if it is done \nproperly, it will be very good. We create an air traffic control \nmodernization oversight board within the FAA, and they will be active. \nWe establish a chief NextGen officer at the FAA. That is a person and a \ngroup to be responsible simply for seeing that progress is on schedule, \npushing people who have to be pushed, and we will include \nrepresentatives of Federal employees in the planning of the NextGen \nprojects. It is appropriate that we include people who fly airplanes in \nthis.\n\n  So we need to begin implementing this technology now, and we need to \nget to the day when we can know we are as safe as we are in our car. \nActually, I am not sure that is the right encouraging statement, but it \nis dangerous up there and we take a lot of chances. I have been in an \nairplane that was struck by lightning, a single-engine plane with one \npilot. I did a lot of praying, and here I am.\n  Senator Dorgan was speaking about safety. The grieving families from \nflight 3407, that accident in Buffalo, NY, are never to be forgotten, \nand we can never allow a tragedy such as that to happen again. That is \nthe problem when you have commuter airlines. Fifty percent of all our \nair traffic is now commuter airlines. As I am sure the Presiding \nOfficer understands, in West Virginia and New Hampshire, we don't get--\nyou get a lot more than we do of major jet flights. We don't get those \nvery much. So we make do with the propellers, and I squeeze my 6-foot-7 \nframe as best I can usually next to the exit door because there is more \nroom there.\n  But that accident in Buffalo, NY, was avoidable. It didn't have to \nhappen, and it shouldn't ever happen again. We have an important \nopportunity to make serious changes, and we need to make sure these \nchanges put safety first. Safety is always the No. 1 consideration.\n  So a few ideas. Our bill includes measures to strengthen the Nation's \naviation safety system and takes great strides to promote something \ncalled one level of safety. As I stand here speaking to the Presiding \nOfficer, I can't believe that one level of safety is going to be \nachieved within 6 months, but that is the objective of the bill--that \nnobody gets to be more safe than somebody else.\n  When the Senator from North Dakota was talking about--and this is \nairline pilot folks. They pay their senior people a great deal. But if \nyou pay somebody who did not land in Buffalo, NY, in that tragic \nflight, he was being paid between $20,000 and $25,000. Neither the \nPresiding Officer's State nor mine pay teachers that little. It is \nshocking. It is absolutely shocking that an airline pilot would be \nsubject to those wages and, therefore, can't stay in a motel overnight \nand, therefore, may go one or two nights without sleep and then fly a \nplane. We can't do that. We can't allow that. That is why we want to \nget to this bill, and we ought to pass this bill instead of waiting \nyear after year and postponing it 11 times, as we have, by extending \nthe authorization.\n  So in recent years we actually have seen the safest period in \naviation history, even with the busiest system in the world. The air \ntraffic controllers oversee over 30,000 flights a day--I think it is \ncloser to 36,000 flights a day--and, again, 800 million people each \nyear. But there are ways we can do better. Our passengers and the \ndedicated airline workforce deserve better.\n  As chairman of the Commerce Committee and as former chairman of the \nAviation Subcommittee for more than 10 years--I have been into this a \nlot--I appreciate the work Senator Dorgan, who is now chairman of the \nAviation Subcommittee, has done to continue to focus on safety, using \nflight 3407 that crashed in Buffalo as his sort of emotional touch \npoint but simply driving and driving and driving--we have had actually \neight safety hearings in the committee since that time, since that \naccident.\n  One could say, well, so what. But that is what galvanizes us. That is \nwhat allows us to put together a better safety section in this bill \nwhich, in fact, we have done.\n  So in the bill, we strengthen greatly the training and certification \nof commercial aviation pilots, two vague words with two very sharp \nmeanings.\n  Our bill requires the FAA to reevaluate pilot training and \nqualifications and issue a new rule to make certain flight crew members \nhave the proper skills and experience. They either do or they don't. \nThey have to be evaluated, and if they don't make it, they are out. I \ndon't know what the union will say about that, but that is what we have \nto do. If the FAA fails to do this and do so by the end of 2011, then \nall air carrier pilots must have at least 1,500 flight hours, and now \nit would be more at the 800 level. In other words, that is a jolt. That \nis a real stick which we are holding out there in this bill to make \nthem better in their certification and the rest of it.\n  We focus a lot on pilot fatigue. That is a human phenomenon, but it \nis a dangerous one if you are flying an airplane. It requires the FAA \nto revise the flight and duty time regulations for commercial airline \npilots and issue the final rule within 1 year. No, that is not tomorrow \nbut within 1 year, they will have a schedule that will hopefully stop \nthis kind of thing, where pilots fly in from San Francisco, don't get \nany sleep, have to sleep in a little bunk house.\n  We also require some other key changes. We require an electronic \ndatabase that the FAA must develop and that carriers must consult to \nobtain a full picture of a pilot's experience and skills before giving \nthem such enormous responsibility. They have to pass that database \nexamination.\n  The FAA will also require air carriers to implement a formal remedial \ntraining program for underperforming pilots. The underperforming is a \nhard thing to evaluate, but it is doable, and the remedial training is \nnot hard to do. That is just time in simulated cockpits or in real \ncockpit situations.\n  In conclusion, we all must understand the reality we are living with; \nthat our utmost priority is always safety, but that is easier said than \naccomplished. The National Transportation Safety Board recently \ndetermined pilot error was the primary cause of that accident in \nBuffalo, flight 3407. To put it even more clearly, this tragedy simply \ndid not have to happen and could have been avoided, and by passing this \nbill, we can do more to make sure we don't repeat that kind of history.\n  Safety is always important. I don't know of anyplace where it is more \nimportant than in the skies.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor and note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       International Women's Day\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment, and \nfrankly bewilderment, over the blocking of a resolution to recognize \nInternational Women's Day. This week, on Monday, March 8, the world \ncommemorated International Women's Day, a day for people around the \nworld to celebrate the economic, political, and social achievements of \nwomen--past, present, and future.\n  We have made significant progress over the years in advancing women's \nrights and these should be celebrated. However, International Women's \nDay is also a day to recognize how much work there is yet to do in the \nstruggle for equal rights and opportunities.\n  But last week, I, along with three of our colleagues--Senator Cardin, \nSenator Gillibrand, and Senator Boxer--submitted a resolution to do \nthat, to recognize and honor those women in the United States and \naround the world who have worked throughout history to ensure that \nwomen are guaranteed equality and basic human rights and to recognize \nthe significant obstacles women continue to face. Our resolution \ngarnered 15 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, so both our \nRepublican colleagues and Democrats cosponsored this resolution.\n  I think it is important to note that over the last several years, \nCongress has unanimously passed similar statements supporting the goals \nof International Women's Day and encouraging people across the country \nto observe this important day with appropriate programs and activities.\n  But this year, while this day was celebrated and recognized around \nthe world, it was not recognized by the Senate. This noncontroversial, \nbipartisan resolution was blocked and the blocking of this resolution, \nis inexplicable and indefensible. But, sadly, it is not surprising \nbecause obstruction seems to have become a way of doing business around \nhere no matter how innocuous the issue.\n  Because we were not able to get agreement from the other side in \npassing this resolution, I would like to read into the Record some of \nthe statements that are in the resolution so we can honor, at least in \nour Record, the contributions of women around the world.\n\n       Whereas women around the world participate in the \n     political, social, and economic life of their communities and \n     play the predominant role in providing and caring for their \n     families;\n       . . . Whereas although strides have been made in recent \n     decades, women around the world continue to face significant \n     obstacles in all aspects of their lives including \n     discrimination, gender-based violence, and denial of basic \n     human rights;\n       Whereas women are responsible for 66 percent of the work \n     done in the world, yet earn only 10 percent of the income \n     earned in the world;\n       Whereas women account for approximately 70 percent of \n     individuals living in poverty world-wide;\n       . . . Whereas women in developing countries are \n     disproportionately affected by global climate change;\n       . . . Whereas according to the Department of State, 56 \n     percent of all forced labor victims are women and girls;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations, 1 in 3 women in \n     the world will be beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise \n     abused in her lifetime;\n       . . . Whereas, the United Nations theme for International \n     Women's Day 2010 is ``Equal rights, equal opportunities: \n     Progress for all'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate . . .\n       recognizes and honors the women in the United States and \n     around the world who have worked throughout history to strive \n     to ensure that women are guaranteed equality and basic human \n     rights;\n       reaffirms the commitment to end gender-based discrimination \n     in all forms, to end violence against women and girls \n     worldwide; and\n       encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     International Women's Day with appropriate programs and \n     activities.\n\n  That is a brief version of the full resolution, but I think you can \ntell by what I read, this is a resolution that recognizes the \nchallenges that still face too many women, not only in this country but \nespecially in developing countries around the world. I hope next year \nwhen International Women's Day comes around, this body, the Senate, \nwill be willing to recognize that day and recognize what is happening \nwith women across the country and around the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Shaheen for her leadership \non S. Res. 433. I thank her for coming to the floor this evening to \nexplain what this resolution does, that it would have the Senate go on \nrecord in support of recognizing March 8 as International Women's Day. \nI appreciate Senator Shaheen reading into the Record what is included \nin this resolution. The resolution supports the goals of International \nWomen's Day. It recognizes that the economic growth and empowerment of \nwomen is inextricably linked with the potential of nations to generate \neconomic growth in sustainable democracies. It recognizes the women in \nthe United States and around the world who have worked throughout \nhistory to strive to ensure that women are guaranteed equality and \nbasic human rights. It reaffirms the commitment to end gender-based \ndiscrimination in all forms, to end violence against women and girls \nworldwide, and encourages the people of the United States to observe \nInternational Women's Day with appropriate programs and activities.\n  I think it is important, as Senator Shaheen has done, to point out we \nhave not been able to adopt this resolution because of the objection of \na Senator. This should have been done. There is nothing controversial \nin this resolution. It has 15 cosponsors. It is bipartisan.\n  But most important, it points out a very important fact about women \naround the world; that is, that they are being discriminated against; \nthey are being abused; they are being treated unjustly, and we should \ngo on record as to what we need to do in order to recognize that fact. \nIt is beyond dispute. These are the facts. These are facts stated by \nrespected international organizations about how women and girls are \nabused.\n  We know about the trafficking of young women and girls. We know about \nthe lack of maternal health care. We know about the lack of health care \nfor children. We know about the discrimination in education. In Sub-\nSaharan\n\n[[Page S1451]]\n\nAfrica, only 17 percent of girls are enrolled in secondary schools. We \nknow about that. We know about the abuses in the workforce, the fact \nthat Senator Shaheen mentioned--66 percent of the work done by women \nand only 10 percent of the income. These are facts, and we know we need \nto go on record to say we will not allow this to continue.\n  I am disappointed we are not going to be able to approve this \nresolution because of the objections. I think it is an inappropriate \nuse of a Senator's right to object. I think it is important the \nAmerican people understand that. I thank my colleague from New \nHampshire for bringing to the attention of our colleagues in the \nSenate, bringing to the attention of the American people, that we stand \nfor gender equality. Unfortunately, one Senator is preventing us from \npassing a resolution that should have been passed unanimously by this \nbody.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Kate Puzey\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise on a very sad moment for me, but a \nvery poignant moment as well. This morning at 6:30, when I got up in my \ncondominium in Washington, I lit a candle. When I return there this \nevening, I will relight that candle. If you go on YouTube and look to \n``Light A Candle for Kate Puzey,'' you will understand why I lit it, \nbecause 12 months ago today, March 11 of last year, Katherine ``Kate'' \nPuzey was murdered in Benin, Africa. Two years of volunteer teaching in \na school in Benin and she was brutally murdered, her life was taken.\n  I didn't know Kate Puzey in life, but I have come to know her well in \ndeath. When I read the article in the Atlanta newspaper about her \ndeath, I was compelled to go to the funeral that day, to a family I did \nnot know in a neighborhood I had not visited. I sat at the back of the \nchurch, and I listened for 2 hours to the tributes of young person \nafter young person, minister after minister, teacher after teacher, \nPeace Corps volunteer after Peach Corps volunteer, talking about this \nwonderful woman of the world, this wonderful light to the world. Kate \nPuzey graduated at the top of her class in Cumming, GA, Forsyth County, \nin high school. She went on to William and Mary College, graduated with \ndistinction and honors, was president of student government in high \nschool, was everything you would like to see in a young person.\n  But she was not just a citizen of America, she was a citizen of the \nworld.\n  She cared about the less fortunate. She cared deeply about troubled \nchildren. She committed her life to the Peace Corps immediately upon \nher graduation from college.\n  She was assigned to Benin, in west Africa. I am on the Africa \nsubcommittee and travel to Africa every year. Last year I was in \nRwanda, Tanzania, Sudan and Darfur, Kenya. I understand the wonderful \nwork of the Peace Corps volunteers in Africa. They are bringing hope \nout of despair, love out of tragedy. That was Kate's mission in life.\n  To listen to those Peace Corps volunteers who served with her--and \nthey came to visit me and tell me about her--she was a shining star for \nAmerica, she was a shining star for the children of Benin, Africa, she \nwas everything John Kennedy intended the Peace Corps to be around the \nworld when he created it 49 years ago this month.\n  Tragically, though, Kate was murdered. She was brutally murdered at \nthe hands of an alleged person who is pending trial in Benin now, a \nperson who is alleged to have murdered her because Kate Puzey did what \nis right. You see, Kate, as a teacher in this school, learned there was \nan individual who was sexually abusing young African children in Benin.\n  Benin is not like Washington. You do not pick up the phone and call \nthe main desk and order something; you don't pick up a newspaper and \nread it; you do not send an e-mail, because it does not exist. To \ncommunicate is very difficult.\n  But Kate, at risk to herself, communicated back to the central office \nwhat she had learned was taking place in the abuse of these children. \nThe next day she was murdered at night in her hut.\n  The trial has not taken place yet. I am never going to convict \nanybody until they have had their day of justice. But from all the \nevidence that has been seen, Kate Puzey died because she did what is \nright. It caused me to think, when I met with her folks a few weeks \nago, and listened to their concerns about other young people around the \nworld volunteering in the Peace Corps, that maybe there is something we \nought to do as a tribute for the sacrifice of Kate Puzey's life; that \nis, find a way to provide for these volunteers a protection, such as \nwhistleblowers receive every day in government.\n  You see, whistleblower protection for those who would report \nsomething that is being done wrong keeps them from being abused. But \nPeace Corps people are not employees, they are volunteers. I met with \nAaron Williams not too long ago, the new Director, who is doing a \nwonderful job at the Peace Corps. He agreed to meet with Kate's \nparents, Lois and Harry Puzey, who suggested to him some of the things \nthat could be done as a tribute to Kate, and hopefully preventing \nsomething like this from ever happening again. I know Aaron Williams is \nlooking at that. I commend him for the investigation he is doing.\n  Christopher Dodd from Connecticut, in this body, a Peace Corps \nvolunteer himself many years ago, and I have met. He has some \nlegislation coming soon on the Peace Corps. I spoke to him about \nincorporating a protection similar to whistleblower protection that \ngovernment employees have for these volunteers who are in the Peace \nCorps, and immediately he seized on the idea, because he recognized \nwhat I know: Peace Corps volunteers are not in the luxury spots around \nthe world. They live in danger and with very little support. They live \nway out, but they live there because they want to help. They want to \nprotect. They want to right the wrongs.\n  When I travel to Africa every year, in every country I go, I invite \nPeace Corps volunteers for breakfast or lunch or dinner. I am always \nstruck, first, that it usually takes them a couple of days to get to \nme, because they have to hitch rides or literally walk, because there \nis no transportation. I realize how remote their service is. But I also \nrealize how wonderfully received their service is in the countries \nwhere they serve. We are blessed as a nation to have had a President \nwho created the Peace Corps. We are blessed as a nation to have 7,600 \nAmericans right now volunteering around the world, 155 of them from my \nhome State of Georgia.\n  But periodically we face great tragedy. A year ago, Kate Puzey's life \nwas taken away from her and her family, tragically. As sad as that \ntragedy is, we need to bring hope from that tragedy. From the despair \nthat her family feels, we need to have a sense of love, and the best \nway to do it is to see to it that we pass legislation to protect or add \nprotection to Peace Corps volunteers for providing information that is \ncritical to be known and protect them from retribution.\n  I will work with Chris Dodd on that as a tribute to Kate Puzey, and \nwhen I go home tonight, I am going to relight that candle, a candle \nthat pays tribute to the life and the love and the many successes of \nKate Puzey.\n  While taken from us at the age of 24, she has left us with a legacy \nof everything that is right with America, everything that is right with \nour youth, everything that is right with the Peace Corps; that is, to \ndeliver the message of hope to people around the world who have no \nhope, promise to those who have despair and hope for the future of \nmankind.\n  I pay tribute to the life of Catherine ``Kate'' Puzey, of Cumming, \nGA.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, more than a year ago I came to the \nSenate floor to share stories I had heard from Rhode Islanders who are \nstruggling in our broken health care system. Since then I have been \nhere on many occasions continuing to share\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\nthose stories and continuing to urge Congress to get to work on \nlegislation to transform our health care system so all Americans can \nreceive the health care they deserve.\n  Over the past year, with my colleagues in the Senate on the HELP \nCommittee, our colleagues on the Finance Committee--the many colleagues \nwho were active in preparing this legislation and working on the Senate \nfloor--we have worked through differences, ironed out details, and \nslowly but surely moved toward creating a reformed health care system \nthat will lower costs, cover millions of the uninsured, and deliver the \ncare we need when we need it.\n  Today, we stand on the brink, on the doorstep, just a few short steps \naway, from achieving this landmark reform. As we move forward to take \nthose welcome final steps, let's not forget that the deliberate failure \nto act--as our Republican colleagues recommend--would leave millions of \nAmericans mired in a status quo that consistently--consistently--fails \nthem.\n  I recently heard from Valerie, a working mother in Warwick, who \ncarried the health insurance coverage for her entire family until she \nlost her job. The double blow of losing her job and her insurance left \nValerie and her husband with very few choices. The choice they faced \nwas a difficult one. Here is what they decided: After paying for costly \nindividual plans for their teenagers, they could not afford coverage \nfor themselves. So they went ahead, covered their kids, and have left \nthemselves exposed to the devastating financial consequences of getting \nsick while uninsured.\n  Here is what Valerie wrote to me:\n\n       Looking back on our lives, major life decisions have been \n     based upon the availability and affordability of health \n     insurance for our family. I have had to pass up job \n     opportunities and make other major sacrifices to ensure we \n     had affordable insurance. Now that isn't even possible.\n\n  Valerie is one of the 14,000 Americans who lose their health care \ncoverage every day we do not act. Mr. President, 14,000 is a very big \nnumber, but it is just a number. Behind each one of those 14,000 people \nis a story like Valerie's and a family who is worried and anxious, \nperhaps even frightened.\n  For Emily, a resident of Barrington, the continuation of the status \nquo would prolong the endless runaround she and her husband have \nendured to get just one health insurance claim resolved.\n  Last March, Emily's husband required back surgery. The insurance \ncompany preapproved the coverage, assuring him the surgery would be \npaid for. With this assurance, Emily's husband went to the hospital and \nwent through with the surgery.\n  Months later, however, the insurance company still had not paid. They \nbegan to ask for more information. Emily resubmitted lengthy paperwork, \nbut she heard nothing back. Nine months have now passed--9 months--and \nthe insurer has yet to pay the $17,000 charge for her husband's \nsurgery.\n  Nationally, insurance company overhead has more than doubled in the \npast 6 years. It is up more than 100 percent in the past 6 years. It is \nnow estimated to cost America $128 billion. What do you suppose they \nspent that money on when they doubled their overhead and their \nbureaucracy? More people to take cases such as Emily's and find more \nways to deny and delay their payment.\n  If we do not change the status quo, there will be even more insurance \nbureaucracy, even more fighting to delay or deny claims, and even more \npeople such as Emily and her husband who are on the short end of the \nstick when the insurance companies engage with them.\n  For Christine, a concerned mother in Providence, the status quo has \nleft her worried sick about her son. Christine has always provided \nhealth insurance for her family, but when her son turned 23 years old \nhe became ineligible for coverage under her insurance policy.\n  In this difficult economy, Christine's son has only been able to find \npart-time work, like so many other Americans, so many Rhode Islanders. \nChristine writes this:\n\n       It breaks my heart when he expresses to me that he feels \n     insecure and strange that he is not covered medically.\n\n  Christine prays that nothing goes wrong with her son that would \nrequire medical care, and asks me: ``What is he to do?''\n  Well, when this bill passes, Christine's son will have something to \ndo. He will be able to stay on her family coverage until he turns 26.\n  These stories I have shared today--stories from anxious families of \nfear, uncertainty, and frustration--are the direct result of the \nrampant dysfunction in the broken status quo of our health care system. \nI know the Presiding Officer, who comes from Minnesota, sees this in \nhis home State every day.\n  The legislation we passed in the Senate on Christmas Eve will begin \nto correct this rampant dysfunction. It will begin to make our system \nstart to work for the American people and not support the insurance \ncompanies working against them.\n  To our Republican colleagues who seek to delay and obstruct this \nhistoric reform, I have to say we need to pass comprehensive health \ncare reform so people like Valerie never have to make the choice \nbetween health insurance for herself and health insurance for her \nchildren. We need to pass comprehensive health care reform so that \npeople such as Emily and her husband can't be denied care or denied \npayment or get the runaround from profit-driven insurance companies. We \nneed to pass comprehensive health care reform so that children such as \nChristine's son can stay on their parents' insurance policies, \nparticularly during this tough economy, until the age of 26, helping \nthem get by during those exciting, challenging, tumultuous years when a \nyoung person gets out of college and starts to find their way in the \nworkforce, those years between college and an established career.\n\n  These changes will make a real difference in the lives of millions of \nAmericans. I hope all of my colleagues will hit the reset button on \ntheir opposition and will think of the Emilys and the Valeries and the \nChristines in their home States, the thousands of Americans whose lives \nwill be made better in real and important ways by this reform. I urge \nthem to join us in supporting this historic effort.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Genevieve ``Gene'' \nSegerblom for a lifetime of service to her family, community, and the \nentire State of Nevada. It has been my privilege to serve the State of \nNevada for close to 45 years in a variety of capacities, and during \nthis time I have worked alongside monumental figures from my home \nState. Yet, perhaps no other person with whom I have come in contact \nover these years has been as great a force for good as has Gene. Gene \nwill soon be celebrating her 92nd birthday, and on this occasion I am \nhappy to recognize her life and accomplishments before the U.S. Senate.\n  Gene was born in Ruby Valley, near Elko, NV. Gene and her family \nmoved to Salt Lake City when she was a baby, but the Great Depression \nbrought them to the Reno area, where Gene attended junior high school. \nAfter graduating from high school in Winnemucca, Gene enrolled as a \nmechanical engineering student at the University of Nevada but changed \nher major to education. It was during this time that Gene met Cliff \nSegerblom, the man she eventually married and with whom she raised two \nchildren, Robin and Richard. After her graduation, Gene relocated to \nBoulder City, NV, where she worked as a school teacher.\n  This upcoming Monday, March 15, Gene will celebrate her 92nd birthday \nat an event honoring her late husband's artwork. Nevada: The \nPhotography of Cliff Segerblom, is certain to display Cliff's marvelous \ntalent in capturing with his artistic eye the state that I love. I \nwould like to take a moment to speak about Gene's husband Cliff. Cliff \nSegerblom was one of Nevada's most accomplished artists. Although he \nwas best known for his work with watercolors, Cliff also thrived in \nphotography and acrylics. I am lucky enough to own some of Cliff's \nincredible paintings, and I count them among my most prized \npossessions. Gene's husband displayed incredible gifts, and I know that \nall of Nevada has been enriched by his talents.\n  Gene is a third-generation Nevadan and comes from a family with a \nlong tradition of public service in Nevada. Her grandfather, W. J. \nBell, was in the Nevada Legislature, and her mother, Hazel Bell Wines, \nwas a Humboldt County assemblywoman. Like her mother and grandfather \nbefore her, Gene took an active interest in the betterment of her \ncommunity. In 1979, she ran for and won a seat on the Boulder City \nCouncil. Her election coincided with an uneasy period of growth for \nBoulder City, a time in which the city's water and power resources were \ndwindling. However, Gene met the problem head-on and helped to bring \nabout an era of sustainable growth to Boulder City.\n  By 1993, Gene was serving in the Nevada State Assembly, representing \nBoulder City, Henderson, Laughlin, and my hometown of Searchlight. In \n2000, Gene Segerblom's time in the assembly came to a close. However, \nit was not long before her son Richard ``Tick'' Segerblom followed in \nhis mother's footsteps and was elected to the Nevada State Legislature.\n  My wife Landra and I feel grateful for the chance to call Gene a dear \nfriend. Indeed, Gene's life has been one of friendship and compassion \nto all Nevadans. I am proud of all that she has accomplished, and all \nshe will continue to achieve. I wish her a very happy 92nd birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1453-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1453-S1454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TAX EXTENDERS ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the economic downturn has continued for a \nyear-and-a-half now and has affected most Americans in some way.\n  Congress has approved a number of measures, which I supported, aimed \nat helping those Americans. It recently extended unemployment benefits \nfor those who do not have a job. It also expanded the eligibility \nrequirements and duration for COBRA health benefits for those between \njobs, and provided a subsidy for those premiums.\n  I could not, however, support the so-called jobs bill put forward by \nthe majority leader and recently passed by the Senate.\n  A jobs bill should create jobs. Beyond some of the tax extenders, \nthere is little in this bill that provides a foundation for jobs \ncreation.\n  The bill is essentially a large spending package that extends, \nthrough 2010, aspects of current law. The provisions it contains, such \nas long-term extensions of unemployment insurance, COBRA, and FMAP \nState aid, do not promote jobs growth, and, in fact, anticipate that \nunemployment will still be a serious problem for the remainder of the \nyear.\n  A negative correlation exists between unemployment benefits and work \nincentives. As President Obama's chief economist Larry Summers has \nwritten:\n\n       Government-assistance programs contribute to long-term \n     unemployment by providing an incentive, and the means, not to \n     work. Each unemployed person has a 'reservation wage'--the \n     minimum wage he or she insists on getting before accepting a \n     job. Unemployment insurance and other social-assistance \n     programs increase that reservation wage, causing an \n     unemployed person to remain unemployed longer.\n\n  He further concludes:\n\n       Unemployment insurance also extends the time a person stays \n     off the job.\n\n  That analysis underscores my point. While I do not disavow the need \nfor unemployment benefits and have supported every short-term \nextension, I do believe that long-term extensions of those benefits do \nnot lead to job creation and should not be touted as part of a jobs \nbill.\n  The cost of this bill is also a problem. When President Obama signed \nthe pay-go Act 4 weeks ago, he said:\n\n       Now, Congress will have to pay for what it spends, just \n     like everybody else.\n\n  This bill waives those brand new pay-go requirements and adds more \nthan $100 billion to the already-exploding deficit.\n  Good jobs legislation would address the underlying problem of \nunemployment, rather than treating the symptoms of a weak economy. Good \njobs provide far more security to American families than temporary \ngovernment benefits do.\n  There are a number of steps Congress can take that will actually put \nAmericans back to work.\n  One is ending the constant cycle of spending billions of dollars the \nTreasury does not have. When the government borrows money--it borrowed \n$1.4\n\n[[Page S1454]]\n\ntrillion last year--it's more difficult for the private sector to \nborrow and invest. When businesses can't grow their operations, they \ncan't afford to hire new employees.\n  Congress can also ameliorate the uncertainty that is preventing new \nhiring by not raising taxes and costs on employers. Unless they are \nextended, the lower tax rates that have been in place since 2001 are \nset to expire at the end of this year, triggering a $2 trillion tax \nincrease over the next decade. Businesses will remain timid about \nhiring if they think new taxes will add to the cost of their business \nand consume the capital that could be used to pay new employees.\n  There are other steps Congress can take--promoting our Nation's \nexports by passing free-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and \nSouth Korea, and increasing production of domestic energy resources, \nfor example.\n  Passing bills that increase our Nation's debt and create \ndisincentives to work will not encourage investment in the economy. If \nwe want business owners and entrepreneurs to start creating jobs, \nCongress should act so that it does not become harder and more \nexpensive to do business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1454-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARY McBRIDE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Covering a region that spanned 13 \ncounties and 24,239 square miles, Judy brought a tireless dedication to \nthe needs of my constituents in this vast region. A longtime resident \nof Whitman County, Judy and her husband farmed wheat, dried peas, and \nlentils. This gave her deep understanding and firsthand knowledge of \nthe challenges facing our farmers and agricultural communities. Over \nthe years, Judy continuously worked to ensure that the people of \nWashington State, whether they lived in Spokane or in Omak, were well \nserved by the Federal Government.\n  I would like to thank Judy for her years of service to me and the \npeople of Washington State. Her career is a tremendous example of \npublic service, and her dedication to her work is truly appreciated. I \nwish her all the best in her future endeavors and know that her many \ntalents will continue to serve the Farm Service Agency in the Obama \nadministration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1454-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING KENT M. RONHOVDE\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn that Kent M. \nRonhovde of the Congressional Research Service died on February 19. Mr. \nRonhovde devoted a 36-year career at CRS to serving both sides of the \naisle and both sides of the Capitol, Senate and the House.\n  Mr. Ronhovde was a senior leader and an adviser to Director Daniel P. \nMulhollan. For the last 7 years as Associate Director of the Office of \nCongressional Affairs and Counselor to the Director, he brought astute \njudgment and keen insight into some of the most sensitive issues facing \nthe Service.\n  CRS provides members of Congress authoritative, objective and \nnonpartisan analysis. All of us appreciate CRS experts' solid advice \nuntainted by advocacy, hidden agendas or personal biases. Kent Ronhovde \nwas instrumental in preserving those core values of CRS.\n  Mr. Ronhovde was the primary liaison between CRS and its Senate and \nHouse oversight committees. He managed the CRS Review Office in which \nall CRS written work is judged for conformance with CRS policies.\n  Mr. Ronhovde was a native Washingtonian who received his JD at \nGeorgetown University Law Center and served in Vietnam. He subsequently \nearned a master's in public administration while at CRS. CRS hired him \nin 1974 as an attorney and he rose progressively through the American \nLaw Division and CRS senior management.\n  Some of us here today may remember Mr. Ronhovde's excellent work as a \nlegislative attorney in the American Law Division in the 1970s and 80s. \nHe served senators, committees and their staffs in such areas as \ncriminal law, intelligence activities, gun control and terrorism. He \nwrote extensively on legal issues raised in connection with the reports \nof the Senate Select Committee to Study Government Operations with \nRespect to Intelligence Activities--Church Committee--and of the House \nSelect Committee on Assassinations.\n  His distinguished performance led to his selection as section head in \n1985 and assistant chief of the division in 1986. As assistant chief, \nhe managed the Federal Law Update, a twice-yearly series of seminars on \nimportant issues of law and policy related to the legislative business \nof Congress. In 1996, he was promoted to a senior management position \nin CRS and in 2003 assumed the duties of associate director and \ncounselor to the Director. Throughout this illustrious career, Mr. \nRonhovde guarded and exemplified CRS's core values: authoritativeness, \nconfidentiality and objectivity. He honored and respected CRS's role in \nserving the Congress and he ensured the role was undertaken judiciously \nand wisely. His astute counsel, sound judgment and devotion to the \ninstitutions of CRS and Congress will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. President, I extend my sincerest condolences to Mr. Ronhovde's \nwife Juliet, daughters Kristen and Brooke, their families, and to all \nhis many friends and colleagues at CRS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1454-4", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1454-S1455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, last week, the Supreme Court \nheard oral arguments in the McDonald v. City of Chicago case.\n  Despite much of the rhetoric surrounding this case, McDonald v. \nChicago isn't a case about gun control. It is a case about our \nconstitutional, fundamental rights as Americans.\n  Our freedoms in the Bill of Rights--including those of speech and \nreligion and the press--are incorporated by the 14th amendment. They \ncannot be infringed upon by the states. The Supreme Court ruled on that \nissue long ago.\n  The issue in McDonald is whether an individual's second amendment \nright to keep and bear arms must be protected against State \ninfringement. The case follows the Court's landmark 2008 ruling in \nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller. In Heller, the Court--for the first \ntime--ruled that the second amendment protects an individual's right to \nkeep and bear arms.\n  There is precedent dating back more than 100 years that reaffirms \nthat the second amendment applies only to the\n\n[[Page S1455]]\n\nFederal Government. However, in 1873, the Court began to develop modern \nincorporation doctrine principles. These principles were used to \ndetermine if amendments apply to the States through the due process \nclause of the 14th amendment.\n  The Court in McDonald is likely to use the modern incorporation \ndoctrine, rather than simply uphold precedent from its previous second \namendment cases.\n  The Supreme Court in Duncan v. Louisiana summarized the modern \nincorporation doctrine, stating, ``the question has been asked whether \na right is among those fundamental principles of liberty and justice \nwhich lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions . . . \nwhether it is basic in our system of jurisprudence . . . and whether it \nis a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial.''\n  I believe the second amendment right to bear arms is a fundamental, \nconstitutional right of law-abiding Americans. And, like most of the \nBill of Rights, it must also be protected from unreasonable state \nrestrictions.\n  Since the Heller decision, three appellate courts have addressed \nwhether the second amendment applies to the States. Two of the courts, \nthe Second and Seventh Circuits, followed Supreme Court precedent. They \nheld that the second amendment only applies to the Federal Government. \nThis was not because the judges were in favor of gun control--as many \ntried to state during Justice Sotomayor's confirmation hearing. \nInstead, it was because they showed judicial restraint. They recognized \nthat only the Supreme Court should overturn its own precedent. In the \nthird case, the Ninth Circuit failed to follow Supreme Court precedent. \nInstead, it applied modern incorporation principles. It held that the \nsecond amendment is incorporated by the 14th amendment and protected \nagainst State infringement. Although I think the Ninth Circuit should \nhave followed precedent, I agree with their analysis.\n  I would emphasize this: Even if the Court decides that the second \namendment does not apply to the States, citizens do not need to worry \nthat people are going to start taking away their firearms.\n  Forty-four State constitutions contain provisions addressing the \nright to bear arms. Most of these are much clearer than the Federal \nConstitution. They were adopted more recently and address specific \nissues such as concealed carry laws.\n  New Mexico's Constitution states: No law shall abridge the right of \nthe citizen to keep and bear arms for security and defense, for lawful \nhunting and recreational use and for other lawful purposes, but nothing \nherein shall be held to permit the carrying of concealed weapons. No \nmunicipality or county shall regulate, in any way, an incident of the \nright to keep and bear arms.\n  I am confident that our citizens' right to bear arms will continue, \nregardless of the McDonald decision. However, I believe that the Court \nwill hold that the second amendment is incorporated by the 14th \namendment.\n  When the Court asks whether the right to bear arms is ``among those \nfundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of \nall our civil and political institutions . . . and is deeply rooted in \nthis nation's history and tradition,'' I have no doubt in the \nconclusion they will reach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1455-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  RECOGNIZING DAMARISCOTTA RIVER GRILL\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I honor a small restaurant in \nmy home State of Maine that has taken a creative approach to bringing \npeople together by hosting a number of community-oriented events. \nLocated in the charming and quaint town of Damariscotta, the \nDamariscotta River Grill has become a well-known name in the midcoast \nMaine dining scene by providing diners with a comfortable and welcoming \nenvironment to enjoy a good meal while meeting local artists.\n  The Damariscotta River Grill opened in late 2003 and has quickly \nbecome a recognized name throughout Maine's burgeoning restaurant \nscene. Noted for its fresh and diverse menu, the Grill offers customers \nan eclectic mix of local seafood, meats, and produce. For lunch, the \nrestaurant makes a wide array of sandwiches, and on Sundays the \nrestaurant prepares a delectable brunch complete with an incredible \nnumber of options for landlubbers and seafood lovers alike.\n  The restaurant has quickly caught the attention of critics from far \nand wide, who all agree that the Damariscotta River Grill is not to be \nmissed when visiting Midcoast Maine. Publications as divergent as the \nBoston Herald, New York Times, Portland Press Herald, and Fodor's have \npraised the consistent and mouthwatering cuisine that chef-owner Rick \nHirsch cooks up year round. Cape Cod Today went as far as to say that \nthe restaurant offers `` . . . as original and appealing a menu as any \nin New England''--a ringing endorsement given the number of superb \nestablishments throughout the six-state region!\n  On March 30, Chef Rick Hirsch will be acknowledged for his hard work \nand dedication in producing such a high-caliber restaurant when he \nreceives the Maine Restaurant Association's 2010 Chef of the Year award \nat a ceremony in Portland. A graduate of the renowned Johnson & Wales \nUniversity in Rhode Island, Mr. Hirsch is extraordinarily deserving of \nthis prestigious award, which recognizes Mr. Hirsch's more than two \ndecades of culinary experience as the owner of two restaurants in \nMaine--the Damariscotta River Grill, as well as the Anchor Inn \nRestaurant in Round Pond--and his Red Plate Catering business.\n  Additionally, since its inception, the Damariscotta River Grille has \nbeen an engaged participant in the local community. The Maine winner of \nthe National Restaurant Association's 2008 Restaurant Neighbor Award, \nthe Damariscotta River Grill contributes regularly and generously to \nnumerous regional organizations and initiatives, including the Boys and \nGirls Clubs' wreath sale each year. The restaurant is also involved in \nthe annual Chocolate Fest, which was just held last month, to support \n``Healthy Kids!,'' a program that helps prevent child abuse and neglect \nin Lincoln County through educational outreach to families.\n  Beyond fundraisers for charities and other organizations, the \nDamariscotta River Grill hosts inventive gatherings to attract the \nrestaurant's loyal following. To highlight its Wine Spectator award-\nwining wine list, the restaurant's Wine Club features at least six wine \nand food tastings with a wine expert, as well as door prizes and \ndiscounts on wine purchases. Additionally, the Grill's ``Art At the \nGrill'' series, presently in its 5th year, shines a significant \nspotlight on area artists. The restaurant displays an artist's work for \na period of time, and hosts a reception, open to the public, where \nguests can speak with the artists about their work. In 2010, the \nrestaurant plans to host over 15 artists, including painters, potters, \nphotographers and fabric artists through this unique project.\n  The Damariscotta River Grill has become a favorite of locals and \ntourists alike because of its wide-ranging menu and unique character \nand charm. Chef Hirsch, along with his wife and business partner, Jean \nKerrigan, has created something truly special in downtown Damariscotta. \nI congratulate Mr. Hirsch on his well-deserved award, and wish everyone \nat the Damariscotta River Grill a remarkable and successful \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1455-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1455-S1456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4573.

To part with \n     the land was the same as committing suicide.'' [Destiny's \n     Landfall: A History of Guam, by Robert F. Rogers, University \n     of Hawai'I Press, 1995, page 142]; and\n       Whereas, the Naval government, from 1898 until 1950, \n     completely ignored the Chamorro people's devotion to the \n     land, issuing their second order, on January 30, 1899, to \n     confiscate land in the Piti area to use for a coaling site \n     and Navy yard. The people of Guam were never compensated for \n     that very first land taking, just the ``first of a long \n     series of controversial steps whereby United States \n     governmental agencies acquired large portions of land on \n     Guam'' [Rogers, page 115]; and\n       Whereas, the Naval government held over one-third of the \n     island of Guam on the eve of World War II, and within three \n     (3) months of the liberation of the island in 1944, five (5) \n     airfields were built; and\n       Whereas, by Public Law 594, the Land Acquisition Act passed \n     by the U.S. Congress on August 2, 1946, the Navy Department \n     was authorized to acquire private land needed for permanent \n     military installations on the island, but compensation was \n     inadequate, due in part to a lack of proper land valuation in \n     the largely agrarian island, amounting to only pennies on the \n     dollar for the actual value of the land; and\n       Whereas, from 1947 to 1950, the main mission of Guam's \n     military command was to complete building facilities, and for \n     this purpose large pieces of land were taken; and\n       Whereas, the postwar land takings were mixed in time and \n     process with limited and inadequate compensation for personal \n     injury and death and property damage under the Federally-\n     created Land and Claims Commission; and\n       Whereas, the United States federal government still has not \n     appreciated the connection between compensation for the \n     sufferings of the people of Guam at the hands of the Japanese \n     occupiers and the takings of land; and\n       Whereas, the Land and Claims Commission condemned land, but \n     became bogged down in the legal complexities of hundreds of \n     property transactions. Rogers states [p. 215] that, ``The \n     commission was understaffed as well as inexperienced in real \n     estate matters. Higher commands nonetheless pressured the \n     staff to meet tight deadlines for land transfers in order for \n     construction of new military projects to proceed''; and\n       Whereas, when former landowners or their heirs attempted to \n     take these injustices to Federal court for redress of the \n     situation, they were told that the statute of limitations had \n     been exceeded; and\n       Whereas, without consultation with Guam officials or owners \n     of leased properties, the new civilian governor, Carlton \n     Skinner, signed a quitclaim deed on July 31, 1950, the day \n     before the Organic Act went into effect, whereby the \n     Government of Guam transferred all condemned property to the \n     United States of America ``for its own use.'' This left the \n     Navy and Air Force in direct control of about forty-nine \n     thousand six hundred (49,600) acres, or over thirty-six \n     percent (36%) of the island; and\n       Whereas, the very first case in the new court under the \n     Organic Act, which granted American citizenship to the \n     Chamorros, was a retaking of all of the previous takings, to \n     ensure that no claim could be made that land could not be \n     taken from the Chamorros prior to their becoming American \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas, in 1977, the creation of the new War in the \n     Pacific Memorial Park saw the condemnation of coastal land in \n     the Agat area, thus preventing the construction of the Agat \n     Marina for many years; and\n       Whereas, in the 1980's, the U.S. Congress attempted to \n     correct the obvious injustice of the postwar land takings by \n     authorizing the land taking cases to be reopened and \n     additional compensation be paid; and\n       Whereas, while many former landowners accepted the class \n     action settlement under this law, some previous landowners of \n     large holdings, such as those at Andersen Air Force Base and \n     including the very land at NCTS envisioned by the federal \n     government for the new Marine Corps base, opted out of the \n     settlement and their claims against the federal government \n     under that law have not been settled to this day; and\n       Whereas, the final insult to the people of Guam came when \n     the three hundred eighty-five (385) acres of the former Naval \n     Facility, Guam at Ritidian Point was declared excess in the \n     1990's and was grabbed quietly, without fanfare or advance \n     notice, by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, rather than \n     being returned to the original landowners via the Government \n     of Guam; and\n       Whereas, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney handling land \n     matters in Guam in 2000 and\n\n[[Page S1457]]\n\n     2001, freely admitted that many Chamorro landowners at the \n     time were cheated out of their land by land agents telling \n     them that the paperwork to be signed was compensation for \n     damage to coconut trees or that the land would be returned to \n     the owner once there was no longer any need for it; and\n       Whereas, this sordid history of the people of Guam's most \n     precious resource, other than its children, needs to be and \n     must be appreciated by the United States federal government; \n     and\n       Whereas, in response, I Liheslatura has specifically \n     enacted legislation addressing Federal acquisition of \n     property, including:\n       (a) Public Law 29-113, specifically Sec. 15105 of Chapter \n     15, Title 21 of the Guam Code Annotated, which calls for duly \n     enacted legislation by I Liheslatura to authorize ``the \n     acquisition by condemnation or otherwise of private \n     property'' by means of Congressional appropriation to acquire \n     property for public use; and\n       (b) Public Law 30-21, specifically Sec. 2401 (c) of Chapter \n     24, Title 1 of the Guam Code Annotated, which tasks the Guam \n     First Commission to determine which land the federal \n     government may intend to lease or sub-lease, exchange for \n     other land, or purchase, and to report their findings to I \n     Liheslatura and I Maga'lahi, and also requires Legislative \n     approval of any Federal acquisition of government of Guam \n     property, whether by lease, sub-lease, exchange or sale; \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That I Mina'Trenta Na Liheslaturan Guahan does \n     hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, absolutely oppose \n     the use, or threat of use, of eminent domain/condemnation for \n     any acquisition of any additional Guam land, private or \n     public, for any purpose whatsoever related to the planned \n     military buildup; and be it further\n       Resolved, That I Mina'Trenta Na Liheslaturan Guahan does \n     hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, demand negotiations \n     at arms length, with a level table, and without undue \n     pressure being exerted on Guam landowners by the United \n     States federal government/Department of Defense, for the \n     acquisition of any additional land, public or private; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That I Mina'Trenta Na Liheslaturan Guahan does \n     hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, demand dealings \n     concerning land are held in good faith between the United \n     States federal government/Department of Defense and private \n     landowners that are willing to lease/sell their property to \n     the federal government, and are also held in good faith with \n     the official representatives of the people of Guam in \n     discussing the potential lease of land from the government of \n     Guam; and be it further\n       Resolved, That I Mina'Trenta Na Liheslaturan Guahan does \n     hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, demand that the \n     federal government renounce any repeat of history, and \n     declares that condemnation SHALL NOT be a tool available to \n     the federal government, either directly or through the use of \n     intimidation, in relation to the Guam military buildup; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That I Mina'Trenta Na Liheslaturan Gudhan does \n     hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, recognize and \n     memorialize the many years of injustice and mistreatment of \n     the people of Guam, as reflected in the foregoing history of \n     Federal land takings; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Speaker certify, and the Legislative \n     Secretary attest to, the adoption hereof, and that copies of \n     the same be thereafter transmitted to the Honorable Barack \n     Obama, President of the United States;

A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of New Mexico requesting the support in the \n     preservation of the Navajo Code Talkers' remarkable legacy; \n     to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                      Senate Joint Memorial No. 51\n\n       Whereas, the few living Navajo Code Talkers are undertaking \n     a multi-year project to build an educational, historical and \n     humanitarian facility that will bring pride to Native \n     American and Non-Native American communities alike, educate \n     the young and old and conserve the instruments of freedom \n     gifted to the American people by an awe-inspiring group of \n     young Navajo men during World War II; and\n       Whereas, during World War II, these modest young Navajo men \n     fashioned from the Navajo language the only unbreakable code \n     in military history; and\n       Whereas, these Navajo Radio Operators transmitted the code \n     throughout the dense jungles and exposed beachheads of the \n     Pacific theater from 1942 to 1945, passing over eight hundred \n     error-free messages in forty-eight hours at Iwo Jima alone; \n     and\n       Whereas, the bravery and ingenuity of these young Navajo \n     men gave the United States and allied forces the upper hand \n     they so desperately needed, finally hastening the war's end \n     and assuring victory for the United States; and\n       Whereas, after being sworn to secrecy for twenty-three \n     years after the war, these young Navajo men eventually came \n     to be known as Navajo Code Talkers and were honored by \n     President George W. Bush more than fifty years after the war \n     with Congressional Gold and Silver Medals in 2001; and\n       Whereas, the Navajo Code Talkers are now in their eighties, \n     and with fewer than fifty remaining from the original four \n     hundred, the urgency to capture and share their stories and \n     memorabilia from their service in the war is now critical; \n     and\n       Whereas, these American treasures and revered elders of the \n     Navajo Nation have come together to tell their story, one \n     that has never been heard, from their own hearts and in their \n     own words; and\n       Whereas, the Navajo Code Talkers' heroic story of an \n     ancient language, valiant people and a decisive victory that \n     changed the path of modern history is the greatest story \n     never told; and\n       Whereas, the Navajo Code Talkers ultimately envision a \n     lasting memorial, the Navajo Code Talkers Museum and Veterans \n     Center, on donated private land; and\n       Whereas, the Navajo Code Talkers' mission is to create a \n     place where their legacy of service will inspire others to \n     achieve excellence and instill core values of pride, \n     discipline and honor in all those who visit; and\n       Whereas, through the lead efforts of the Navajo Code \n     Talkers foundation and many partners and individuals, the \n     Navajo Code Talkers' legacy, history, language and code will \n     be preserved to benefit all future generations; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of New Mexico, \n     That the United States Congress, Department of the Interior, \n     Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Health and \n     Human Services, Department of Defense, Department of \n     Agriculture, Department of State and Department of Energy be \n     requested to support the preservation of the Navajo Code \n     Talkers' remarkable legacy; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be transmitted to \n     the President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Defense, the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary \n     of State, the Secretary of Energy and the New Mexico \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-87. A memorial adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     New Mexico urging Congress to expedite the passage of \n     legislation to enact the necessary amendments to the Surface \n     Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to clarify that \n     uncertified states have authority to use payments for non-\n     coal mine reclamation projects; to the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources.\n\n                         Senate Memorial No. 30\n\n       Whereas, New Mexico is known to have some of the richest \n     uranium resources in the nation in the area known as ``The \n     Grants Mineral Belt''; and\n       Whereas, dating back to the 1940s, states such as New \n     Mexico mined uranium for the benefit of the Atomic Energy \n     Commission and the federal government's Nuclear Weapons \n     Program; and\n       Whereas, the Atomic Energy Commission did not require that \n     early mines be reclaimed; and\n       Whereas, research shows that many uranium mines were \n     abandoned and never reclaimed; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has direct responsibility \n     to provide funding, both for the initial surveying of these \n     mines and for potential subsequent reclamation where \n     warranted; and\n       Whereas, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of \n     1977 is a federal law that mandates a reclamation fee on each \n     ton of coal produced in the country, and Title IV of that Act \n     provides for abandoned mine reclamation; and\n       Whereas, in 2006, the United States Congress passed \n     amendments to Title IV of the Surface Mining Control and \n     Reclamation Act of 1977 providing that the funds collected \n     from the reclamation fees will now go directly to the states \n     rather than be appropriated by Congress; and\n       Whereas, the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior \n     has interpreted those 2006 amendments to limit uncertified \n     states, such as New Mexico, from using the funds available \n     through the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of \n     1977 for non-coal mine reclamation; and\n       Whereas, following the 2006 amendments, the Office of \n     Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement promulgated \n     regulations that restrict uncertified states from using funds \n     available through the Surface Mining and Control Reclamation \n     Act of 1977 for non-coal mine reclamation; and\n       Whereas, Secretary Ken Salazar of the Department of the \n     Interior has suggested that a legislative solution is \n     necessary in order to allow funding distribution under \n     Section 411(h)(1) of the Surface Mining Control and \n     Reclamation Act of 1977 to be used for non-coal mine \n     reclamation; Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S1458]]\n\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Mexico, That \n     Congress be requested to expedite the passage of legislation \n     to enact the necessary amendments to the Surface Mining \n     Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to clarify that \n     uncertified states have authority to use payments for non-\n     coal mine reclamation projects; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be transmitted to \n     the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     the President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate and the \n     New Mexico Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-88. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of West Virginia urging support of \n     West Virginia's coal industry by encouraging measures that \n     protect miners and their families, provide incentives for the \n     development of advanced coal technologies, enhance the energy \n     independence of the State and the nation, protect the \n     environment from which coal is mined, and supply consumers \n     with cleaner and more affordable energy produced from coal; \n     to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 402\n\n       Whereas, the coal industry provides salaries and benefits \n     to thousands of West Virginians; and\n       Whereas, the coal industry is responsible for millions of \n     dollars of tax revenues that are used to fund important \n     government services and programs; and\n       Whereas, the coal industry is vitally important to the \n     economic welfare of this State and its citizens; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature, with the leadership and support \n     of the Governor, has worked to enact legislation to ensure \n     the future of West Virginia coal, including the adoption of \n     sweeping coal mine safety reforms, planning requirements for \n     post-mining land use, an alternative and renewable energy \n     portfolio featuring clean coal technology, and a regulatory \n     framework for carbon capture and sequestration projects; and\n       Whereas, recent events at the federal level, most notably \n     the debate over ``cap and trade'' legislation in Congress and \n     obscure regulatory actions by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, are casting a shadow of doubt and uncertainty over \n     the future of the coal industry in West Virginia; and\n       Whereas, for the sake of those individuals who depend upon \n     coal to support themselves and their families, the House of \n     Delegates, the Senate, the Governor and West Virginia's \n     congressional delegation must work together to secure the \n     future of the coal industry, and with it the future of the \n     State; therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, That the West Virginia \n     House of Delegates will continue to support the West Virginia \n     coal industry by encouraging measures that protect miners and \n     their families, provide incentives for the development of \n     advanced coal technologies, enhance the energy independence \n     of the State and the nation, protect the environment from \n     which coal is mined, and supply consumers with cleaner and \n     more affordable energy produced from coal; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the West Virginia House of Delegates \n     requests that West Virginia's congressional delegation resist \n     and oppose efforts at the federal level to undermine the \n     future of West Virginia's coal industry; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates forward \n     a certified copy of this resolution to United States Senators \n     Robert C.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nan increase, effective December 1, 2010, in the rates of compensation \nfor veterans with service-connected disabilities and the rates of \ndependency and indemnity compensation for the survivors of certain \ndisabled veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today, as Chairman of the Senate Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, I introduce the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-\nLiving Adjustment Act of 2010.\n  This measure would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nincrease, effective December 1, 2010, the rates of veterans' \ncompensation to keep pace with the rising cost of living in this \ncountry, if such an adjustment is triggered by an increase in the \nConsumer Price Index. This legislation, commonly referred to as the \nCOLA, would make an increase available to veterans at the same level as \na cost-of-living increase, if provided to those who receive Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  My colleagues on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, including \nSenators Burr, Rockefeller, Murray, Sanders, Brown of Ohio, Tester, \nBegich, Burris, Specter, Isakson, and Graham join me in introducing \nthis important legislation. I appreciate their continued support of the \nNation's veterans.\n  Congress regularly enacts a cost-of-living adjustment for veterans' \ncompensation in order to ensure that inflation does not erode the \npurchasing power of those veterans and survivors who depend upon this \nincome to meet their daily needs. Last year, Congress passed, and the \nPresident signed into law, Public Law 111-37. While there was no cost-\nof-living increase in 2010 due to a decline in the Consumer Price \nIndex, the 2011 adjustment has not yet been determined.\n  The COLA affects, among other benefits, veterans' disability \ncompensation and dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving \nspouses and children. It is projected that over 3.5 million veterans \nand survivors will be in receipt of compensation benefits in fiscal \nyear 2011. Many of these recipients depend upon these tax-free payments \nnot only to provide for their own basic needs, but those of their \nspouses and children as well.\n  It is important that we view veterans' compensation, including the \nCOLA, and indeed all benefits earned by veterans, as a continuing cost \nof war. It is clear that the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan \nwill continue to result in injuries and disabilities that will yield an \nincrease in claims for compensation.\n  Payment of disability compensation to those of our Nation's veterans \nwho have an illness or disability related to their service constitutes \none of the central missions of the Department of Veterans Affairs. It \nis a necessary measure of appreciation afforded to those veterans whose \nlives were forever altered by their service to this country.\n  I urge our colleagues to work together to ensure this benefit remains\n\n[[Page S1461]]\n\navailable and is not diminished by the effects of inflation. I also ask \nour colleagues for their continued support for the Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3107\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Army to conduct levee \nsystem evaluations and certifications on receipt of requests from non-\nFederal interests; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nCommunity Flood Protection Act of 2010.\n  We have all seen, and many of us have experienced firsthand, the \ndevastation that a flood can bring to any community. This devastation \nis experienced equally, whether your home is in an area that is high or \nlow hazard, rural or urban, wealthy or poor. Flood control is a multi-\npronged effort involving structural and non-structural flood control \nmeasures, hazard mitigation, emergency planning, and insurance. Our \nNation has a myriad of programs designed to address flood hazards. FEMA \nproduces flood maps to define the risk and operates hazard mitigation \nprograms to reduce risk. The National Flood Insurance Program, NFIP, \nprovides flood insurance to property owners in a mapped risk area. The \nArmy Corps of Engineers designs and constructs flood control projects. \nThis hodgepodge of responsibilities has always been a challenge for the \nU.S., and it continues to be one today.\n  Nowhere is this challenge more evident than in the process of FEMA's \nmap modernization program, the Corps' levee certification \nresponsibilities, and NFIP program requirements. This issue has \nlingered around the edges for years, and its impact is now being felt \nin an enormous way in Montana where communities struggling to navigate \nthe maze of what seems to be an overwhelming Federal bureaucracy are \nincredibly frustrated.\n  Let me begin by saying that it is important that we recognize the \nrisks we face before we make snap judgments about whether preventive \naction should or shouldn't be taken. Specifically, it is a good idea \nfor FEMA to update our Nation's flood maps so that we can be honest \nwith ourselves about the risks we face. However, that process, must be \ntransparent and it must recognize the differences between Sacramento, \nCA, and Saco, MT. It can be overwhelming for a small community in \nMontana to participate in this process. That is why I have written to \nFEMA Director Craig Fugate asking him to consider the needs of small, \nrural communities as the Agency progresses with its map modernization \nprogram.\n  Once flood hazards are accurately mapped, communities must work to \nensure that their flood control structures, if they have them, are up \nto par and can actually provide protection for the hazards they face. \nWithout a levee ``certification'' by a professional engineer, those \nportions of a community located behind the levee, believing for years \nthat they had adequate flood protection, are suddenly faced with a map \nthat depicts them as in the floodplain, unprotected, required to \npurchase flood insurance.\n  It seems like it would be a simple process to get a levee \ncertification. Traditionally, the Army Corps has performed this work. \nHowever, in 2008 the Army Corps of Engineers established a policy that \nit would no longer perform levee certifications on non-Federally \noperated levees. This policy has left communities like Great Falls, \nMontana high and dry when it comes to a certification process. I wrote \nto the Corps of Engineers on February 18, 2010, asking the Agency to \nre-evaluate this policy.\n  I hope that the Corps will change their policy. But, Montana cannot \nwait for that to happen. Great Falls, Vaughn, Miles City, Glendive, \nSaco, Havre, Forsyth, Malta, Glasgow and others cannot wait for the \nCorps deliberations. That is why I am introducing legislation today \nthat will give the Corps direct authority to perform levee \ncertifications. In addition, my bill includes special provisions for \nsmall communities and for those levee districts that are operated by a \nvolunteer staff, allowing the Corps to perform these certifications at \n100 percent Federal cost.\n  This bill is one step in what will be a long process for all of us as \nwe update and upgrade our knowledge of the risks posed by flooding, our \ncurrent level of protection, and additional steps we need to take to \nensure that lives and property are not unnecessarily lost. In the \nprocess of that upgrade, we cannot lose sight of the impact of this \nprocess and these decisions on our local communities.\n  We don't want the cost of staying in the NFIP to rise above the point \nwhere small communities can participate. We don't want a burdensome \nFederal bureaucracy to make it impossible for people to make good \ndecisions about their own safety and that of their community. In these \neconomic times, rural communities are struggling to come up with enough \nmoney just to keep afloat, and a hefty certification fee can be an \nundue burden.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 2010.\n     Administrator W. Craig Fugate,\n     Office of the Administrator, Federal Emergency Management \n         Agency, C Street, S.W., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Fugate: I am writing to express concern \n     about the impact of FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Map \n     Modernization on small communities across Montana. Let me \n     state up front that I fully support your agency's efforts to \n     provide the nation with digital flood hazard data and maps \n     that are more reliable, It is critically important that land \n     owners are protected against the risk to life and property \n     posed by flooding.\n       However, as your agency conducts the Map Modernization in \n     Montana, I urge you to take every possible step to \n     accommodate the unique circumstances small rural communities \n     face. For example, small towns often\n\n[[Page S1462]]\n\n     cannot afford to challenge FEMA's preliminary flood insurance \n     study. These communities are left in the untenable position \n     of paying thousands of dollars for an engineering firm to \n     develop the revised flood insurance study required to appeal \n     FEMA's preliminary study, or to accept FEMA's preliminary \n     flood insurance study as is, even if there are valid grounds \n     to dispute the study's findings. It is clear that an improved \n     appeals process could help correct errors made during FEMA's \n     map modernization and thus prevent unneeded flood insurance \n     expenses.\n       Please provide a detailed list of the steps your agency is \n     taking to accommodate the special needs of rural communities \n     during the map modernization process. Specifically, detail \n     how your agency accommodates appeals to a preliminary flood \n     insurance study by small communities with small budgets.\n       Thank you for your prompt response to this request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Max Baucus.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 18, 2010.\n     Hon. Jo-Ellen Darcy,\n     Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), U.S. Army \n         Corps of Engineers, G Street, NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Assistant Secretary Darcy: I am writing to you \n     regarding the January 23, 2008 memo establishing priorities \n     for Fiscal Year 2008 Levee Safety Program Inspection Funds. \n     Specifically, I would like you to provide additional \n     justification for your policy determination that levee \n     certification is a non-Federal responsibility and that these \n     certifications will not be funded using Federal funds.\n       Throughout Montana and the rest of the country, non-Federal \n     sponsors for Federally-constructed levees are struggling to \n     work through the FEMA floodplain re-mapping process and the \n     associated requirements for levee certification. I recognize \n     the need to ensure that accurate information is provided to \n     property owners and decision-makers regarding the residual \n     risk of flooding that exists behind a flood control structure \n     and to ensure that such properties are adequately insured to \n     prevent excessive disaster payments by the Federal \n     government, I understand that FEMA's map updates will portray \n     a floodplain area protected by a certified levee as an area \n     with 1 in 100 year flood protect and a floodplain area that \n     is protected by an uncertified levee as unprotected.\n       Therefore, the levee certification process is a critical \n     step in the nation's efforts to ensure that our existing \n     flood control system offers viable protection for life and \n     property. First and foremost, from an engineering \n     perspective, it is important that any flaws or shortcomings \n     in our existing levees are identified and repaired before a \n     disaster, not after. Second, because the certification of a \n     levee is the determining factor in how a particular \n     floodplain will be mapped and what insurance requirements \n     will apply, it is important that communities have access to a \n     clear, reasonable process to obtain this certification,\n       Prior to January 2008, the Corps performed levee \n     certifications for Federally-constructed levees. On January \n     23, 2008, a memorandum regarding prioritization of fiscal \n     year 2008 funds was released by your office, which precluded \n     the Corps from using fiscal year 2008 funds to perform levee \n     certifications and stated that levee certification is a non-\n     Federal responsibility. Please provide your justification for \n     this abrupt change in policy, in addition to a cost analysis \n     of the impact of this change to non-Federal sponsors. Please \n     describe the outreach that was performed prior to and after \n     this decision to ensure that levee managers throughout the \n     country were properly informed. Please articulate, in detail, \n     the options available for levee districts seeking \n     certification of their Federally-constructed levee. In \n     determining the effective date of your new policy, was a \n     transition plan considered and/or implemented for those \n     levees that were already moving through the remapping process \n     and were anticipating that the certification process would be \n     conducted by the Corps? Was consideration given to the \n     differing technical and financial capabilities of levee \n     districts throughout the country to ensure that small, rural \n     communities are not adversely impacted by this policy change \n     when compared to large communities? Has the Corps considered \n     the lack of engineering resources in certain parts of the \n     country as a planning factor for implementing the new January \n     2008 policy? The January 23 memo states that the Corps can \n     perform levee certification on a reimbursable basis. How do \n     the limitations adopted in 31 U.S.C. 6505, as amended, affect \n     the ability of the Corps to perform these certifications? \n     Have levee districts in small, rural communities elected to \n     pay the Corps to perform levee certifications since January \n     2008? Please describe how this decision was and continues to \n     be coordinated with the FEMA remapping process. Thank you for \n     your attention to this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Max Baucus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1462-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 451--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR A DESIGNATION OF A \n                 ``WELCOME HOME VIETNAM VETERANS DAY''\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Ms. \nMurkowski, and Mr. Johanns) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Veterans Affairs:\n\n                              S. Res. 451\n\n       Whereas the Vietnam War was fought in the Republic of South \n     Vietnam from 1961 to 1975, and involved North Vietnamese \n     regular forces and Viet Cong guerrilla forces in armed \n     conflict with United States Armed Forces and the Army of the \n     Republic of Vietnam;\n       Whereas the United States Armed Forces became involved in \n     Vietnam because the United States Government wanted to \n     provide direct military support to the Government of South \n     Vietnam to defend itself against the growing Communist threat \n     from North Vietnam;\n       Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces began \n     serving in an advisory role to the Government of the Republic \n     of South Vietnam in 1961;\n       Whereas, as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents on \n     August 2 and 4, 1964, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Gulf \n     of Tonkin Resolution (Public Law 88-408), on August 7, 1964, \n     which provided the authority to the President of the United \n     States to prosecute the war against North Vietnam;\n       Whereas, in 1965, United States Armed Forces ground combat \n     units arrived in Vietnam;\n       Whereas, by the end of 1965, there were 80,000 United \n     States troops in Vietnam, and by 1969, a peak of \n     approximately 543,000 troops was reached;\n       Whereas, on January 27, 1973, the Treaty of Paris was \n     signed, which required the release of all United States \n     prisoners-of-war held in North Vietnam and the withdrawal of \n     all United States Armed Forces from South Vietnam;\n       Whereas, on March 30, 1973, the United States Armed Forces \n     completed the withdrawal of combat units and combat support \n     units from South Vietnam;\n       Whereas, on April 30, 1975, North Vietnamese regular forces \n     captured Saigon, the capitol of South Vietnam, effectively \n     placing South Vietnam under Communist control;\n       Whereas more than 58,000 members of the United States Armed \n     Forces lost their lives in Vietnam and more than 300,000 \n     members of the Armed Forces were wounded;\n       Whereas, in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was \n     dedicated in the District of Columbia to commemorate those \n     members of the United States Armed Forces who died or were \n     declared missing-in-action in Vietnam;\n       Whereas the Vietnam War was an extremely divisive issue \n     among the people of the United States and a conflict that \n     caused a generation of veterans to wait too long for the \n     United States public to acknowledge and honor the efforts and \n     services of such veterans;\n       Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces who \n     served bravely and faithfully for the United States during \n     the Vietnam War were often wrongly criticized for the policy \n     decisions made by 4 presidential administrations in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the establishment of a ``Welcome Home Vietnam \n     Veterans Day'' would be an appropriate way to honor those \n     members of the United States Armed Forces who served in South \n     Vietnam and throughout Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War;

which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 452\n\n       Whereas, in 2003, Japan was the largest market for United \n     States beef, with exports valued at $1,400,000,000;\n       Whereas, after the discovery of 1 Canadian-born cow \n     infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) disease \n     in the State of Washington in December of 2003, Japan closed \n     its market to United States beef, and still restricts access \n     to a large number of safe United States beef products;\n       Whereas for years the Government of the United States has \n     developed and implemented a multilayered system of \n     interlocking safeguards to ensure the safety of United States \n     beef, and after the 2003 discovery, the United States \n     implemented further safeguards to ensure beef safety;\n       Whereas a 2006 study by the United States Department of \n     Agriculture found that BSE was virtually nonexistent in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the internationally recognized standard-setting \n     body, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), has \n     classified the United States as a controlled risk country for \n     BSE, which means that United States beef is safe for export \n     and consumption;\n       Whereas, from 2004 through 2009, United States beef exports \n     to Japan averaged roughly $196,000,000, less than 15 percent \n     of the amount the United States sold to Japan in 2003, \n     causing significant losses for United States cattle \n     producers; and\n       Whereas, while Japan remains an important ally and trading \n     partner of the United States, this unscientific trade \n     restriction is not consistent with fair trade practices, nor \n     with United States treatment of Japanese imports: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it is not in the interest of either the United States \n     or Japan to arbitrarily restrict market access for their \n     close partners;\n       (2) trade between the United States and Japan should be \n     conducted with mutual respect and based on sound science;\n       (3) since banning United States beef in December 2003, \n     Japan has not treated United States beef producers fairly;\n       (4) both Japan and the United States should comply with \n     guidelines based on sound science;\n       (5) Japan should immediately expand market access for \n     United States exporters of both bone-in and boneless beef \n     beyond the existing standard of beef from cattle 20 months \n     and younger; and\n       (6) the President should insist on increased access for \n     United States exporters of beef and beef products to the \n     market in Japan.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise to offer a resolution supporting \nincreased access for U.S. beef and beef products to the country of \nJapan. Let me step back and set the stage for this resolution.\n  On December 23, 2003, one cow was discovered in the United States \nwith BSE, the disease sometimes referred to in a kind of slang way as \n``mad cow disease.'' Even though that animal was actually born in \nCanada, the reaction of our trading partners around the world was swift \nand devastating. Almost immediately, Japan and other countries closed \ntheir markets to U.S. beef. Virtually with the snap of a finger, we \nlost over 90 percent of our export market. It just disappeared. At the \ntime, Japan was the largest export market for U.S. beef. It had a value \nto our producers of $1.4 billion.\n  We began work to address BSE in this country dating all the way back \nto 1988, when the Department of Agriculture established a BSE committee \nto make recommendations on appropriate regulatory controls. Our \ngovernment has developed and implemented a multilayered system of \ninterlocking safeguards to ensure the safety of American beef. After \nthe 2003 BSE discovery, we added even more safeguards. These efforts by \nour government, in coordination with U.S. cattle producers, have paid \noff. A 2006 study by USDA found that BSE was virtually nonexistent \namong the 40 million adult cattle in our country. Again in 2007, the \nWorld Organization for Animal Health, the internationally recognized \nstandard-setting body, also known as OIE, classified the United States \nas a ``controlled risk'' country for BSE. This classification simply \nmeans that because of the expansive system of safeguards that are in \nplace, U.S. beef is safe for export and for consumption.\n  Interestingly enough, that is the identical classification the OIE \ngave to Japan just last year. So as Japan asked their trading partners \nto treat them fairly under OIE standards, we are asking them to reopen \ntheir market for our beef.\n  Seven years have passed. We have proven, time and again, the \neffectiveness of our safety system. The Japanese still restrict most \nU.S. beef products. Japan's actions are not consistent with fair \ntrading practices, nor with the U.S. treatment of Japan's imports. That \nis why I agreed to meet last week with the Japanese Ambassador to \ndiscuss this matter. I asked the Ambassador: What would happen if the \nUnited States said it doesn't want any more car parts from Japan until \nthey can assure us that there are absolutely no defects? That is \nessentially what it has done to our beef industry. If we in the United \nStates said we would never do anything in response to the current \nToyota situation that they have not already done to us, that would not \nbe a good deal for Japan when it comes to exports. Their treatment of \nour beef has cost our Nation's beef industry billions of dollars and \nhas been economically devastating to States such as mine, the State of \nNebraska. If we treated their products the same way, it would be \nequally as devastating to Japan because we are a major importer of \nJapanese goods. Over the last 6 years, the United States has purchased, \non average, over $132 billion in Japanese goods annually. In 2009 \nalone, even in the midst of a global economic downturn, the United \nStates purchased $95.9 billion of products from Japan. Cars led the \nway. We purchased $31.5 billion in vehicles and parts. Beyond that, we \nbought $19.5 billion in nuclear reactors, machinery, and parts. Just \nover $15 billion worth of electronics we bought from Japan, another $5 \nbillion in optic, photo, medical or surgical instruments, and dozens \nand dozens of other products that add up to another $25 billion.\n  I wish to make something clear. I am not advocating that the United \nStates close its borders to Japan's products. Japan is a valued friend. \nBut what I do say I say directly and with the resolution: Sanctions on \nour beef do not represent the act of a friend nor that of a fair \ntrading partner. There is simply no scientific justification for their \nrestrictions, none whatsoever, a point my friends from Japan cannot \ndeny. Quite honestly, Japan's standard of accepting only beef from \ncattle aged 20 months and younger was pulled out of thin air. It is \nnothing more than an economic sanction.\n  I have been dealing with this issue for nearly 7 years, first as the \nGovernor of Nebraska, then as our Agriculture Secretary, and now as a \nSenator. My confirmation hearing before this body to become Secretary \nof Agriculture was dominated by one topic: Opening Japan's borders to \nour beef.\n  I come forward to offer this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. The \nresolution does not say we want to keep Japanese products out of the \nUnited States. It is in the interest of neither the United States nor \nJapan to arbitrarily restrict market access for friends and close \npartners. We are both with Japan. Trade between the United States and \nJapan should be conducted with mutual respect and based on sound \nscience, something we haven't seen from Japan in this area in the last \n7 years. My resolution does say that both Japan and the United States \nshould comply with science-based standards. It also states the Obama \nadministration should insist on increased access for U.S. beef and beef \nproducts to Japan.\n  Very simply, it is time for fair treatment from our friends in Japan. \nI will continue to press this issue. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting a resolution that basically says trade should be fair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1463-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1463-S1464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 453--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF ``NATIONAL \n                          PUBLIC HEALTH WEEK''\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico (for himself, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Burris, \nMr. Wyden, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Tester, Mr. Begich, Mr. Durbin, \nand Mr. Merkley) submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise to ask the U.S. Senate \nto resolve that April 5th-11th be known as National Public Health Week \n2010. I submit this resolution along with my colleagues Senators Akaka, \nBegich, Sherrod Brown, Burris, Durbin, Menendez, Tester, Wyden, and \nBerkley.\n  Since 1995, we have recognized the first week in April as National \nPublic Health Week in order to help focus the efforts of hundreds of \nthousands of public health professionals and organizations to educate \nthe public, policymakers, and practitioners about the importance of \npublic health.\n  This year's theme is ``A Healthier America: One Community at a \nTime.'' This is especially timely since I hope that we sill soon pass \ncomprehensive health care reform and because for the first time, the \nnext generation is not expected to be healthier that the previous one. \nThis is also consistent with the First Lady Michelle Obama's efforts to \nreduce child obesity.\n  Our Nation's health is in poor shape. Despite spending more money on \nhealth care than any other country, more than 47 million Americans \nstill do not have health insurance, nearly 900,000 people die from \ndeaths that can be prevented each year, and we lag far behind the rest \nof the developed world in preventing obesity, HIV/AIDS infections, and \nmany other diseases.\n  During this week, public health workers across the country will be \nfocusing on how to more fully and effectively achieve a healthier \nNation. They will be addressing the underlying social and economic \nconditions that encourage individuals and communities to be healthy, as \nwell as shifting us from a Nation solely focused on treating individual \nillness to one that also promotes population-based health services that \nencourage preventive and early intervention practices.\n  For example, public health and prevention strategies from the \nfoundation for health system reform. Community-level intervention has \nmore positive health impact on people than individual interventions \nalone. Population-based programs address main causes of disease, \ndisability and health disparities for a wide range of people and can \nhelp achieve increased value for our health dollar.\n  During National Public Health Week, Americans will be asked to \nchampion public health by making healthy changes--big and small--in \ntheir families, individual neighborhoods, workplaces and schools.\n  I wish to thank the American Public Health Association for leading \nthis effort and the National Association of County and City Health \nOfficials, Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and \nPartnership for Prevention for endorsing this recognition, and helping \nus highlight the importance of strengthening our public health system \nand encouraging Americans to value public health and take part in \npreventing disease and building healthier communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1464-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1464-S1465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3466.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The illicit nuclear activities of the Government of \n     Iran and its support for international terrorism represent \n     threats to the security of the United States, its strong ally \n     Israel, and other allies of the United States around the \n     world.\n       (2) The United States and other responsible countries have \n     a vital interest in working together to prevent the \n     Government of Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons \n     capability.\n       (3) The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly \n     called attention to Iran's illicit nuclear activities and, as \n     a result, the United Nations Security Council has adopted a \n     range of sanctions designed to encourage the Government of \n     Iran to cease those activities and comply with its \n     obligations under the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \n     Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, \n     and entered into force March 5, 1970 (commonly known as the \n     ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'').\n       (4) The serious and urgent nature of the threat from Iran \n     demands that the United States work together with its allies \n     to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.\n       (5) The United States and its major European allies, \n     including the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, have \n     advocated that sanctions be strengthened should international \n     diplomatic efforts fail to achieve verifiable suspension of \n     Iran's uranium enrichment program and an end to its illicit \n     nuclear activities.\n       (6) There is an increasing interest by States, local \n     governments, educational institutions, and private \n     institutions to seek to disassociate themselves from \n     companies that conduct business activities in the energy \n     sector of Iran, since such business activities may directly \n     or indirectly support the efforts of the Government of Iran \n     to achieve a nuclear weapons capability.\n\n[[Page S1466]]\n\n       (7) Black market proliferation networks continue to \n     flourish in the Middle East, allowing countries like Iran to \n     gain access to sensitive dual-use technologies.\n       (8) The Government of Iran continues to engage in serious, \n     systematic, and ongoing violations of human rights and \n     religious freedom, including illegitimate prolonged \n     detention, torture, and executions. Such violations have \n     increased in the aftermath of the presidential election in \n     Iran on June 12, 2009.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Prevent \n     All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009'' or ``PACT Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the sale of illegal cigarettes and smokeless tobacco \n     products significantly reduces Federal, State, and local \n     government revenues, with Internet sales alone accounting for \n     billions of dollars of lost Federal, State, and local tobacco \n     tax revenue each year;\n       (2) Hezbollah, Hamas, al Qaeda, and other terrorist \n     organizations have profited from trafficking in illegal \n     cigarettes or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps;\n       (3) terrorist involvement in illicit cigarette trafficking \n     will continue to grow because of the large profits such \n     organizations can earn;\n       (4) the sale of illegal cigarettes and smokeless tobacco \n     over the Internet, and through mail, fax, or phone orders, \n     makes it cheaper and easier for children to obtain tobacco \n     products;\n       (5) the majority of Internet and other remote sales of \n     cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are being made without \n     adequate precautions to protect against sales to children, \n     without the payment of applicable taxes, and without \n     complying with the nominal registration and reporting \n     requirements in existing Federal law;\n       (6) unfair competition from illegal sales of cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco is taking billions of dollars of sales away \n     from law-abiding retailers throughout the United States;\n       (7) with rising State and local tobacco tax rates, the \n     incentives for the illegal sale of cigarettes and smokeless \n     tobacco have increased;\n       (8) the number of active tobacco investigations being \n     conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and \n     Explosives rose to 452 in 2005;\n       (9) the number of Internet vendors in the United States and \n     in foreign countries that sell cigarettes and smokeless \n     tobacco to buyers in the United States increased from only \n     about 40 in 2000 to more than 500 in 2005; and\n       (10) the intrastate sale of illegal cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco over the Internet has a substantial effect \n     on interstate commerce.\n       (c) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) require Internet and other remote sellers of cigarettes \n     and smokeless tobacco to comply with the same laws that apply \n     to law-abiding tobacco retailers;\n       (2) create strong disincentives to illegal smuggling of \n     tobacco products;\n       (3) provide government enforcement officials with more \n     effective enforcement tools to combat tobacco smuggling;\n       (4) make it more difficult for cigarette and smokeless \n     tobacco traffickers to engage in and profit from their \n     illegal activities;\n       (5) increase collections of Federal, State, and local \n     excise taxes on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco; and\n       (6) prevent and reduce youth access to inexpensive \n     cigarettes and smokeless tobacco through illegal Internet or \n     contraband sales.\n\n     SEC. 2.

SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT \n                   OF THIS ACT.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that unique harms are \n     associated with online cigarette sales, including problems \n     with verifying the ages of consumers in the digital market \n     and the long-term health problems associated with the use of \n     certain tobacco products. This Act was enacted recognizing \n     the longstanding interest of Congress in urging compliance \n     with States' laws regulating remote sales of certain tobacco \n     products to citizens of those States, including the passage \n     of the Jenkins Act over 50 years ago, which established \n     reporting requirements for out-of-State companies that sell \n     certain tobacco products to citizens of the taxing States, \n     and which gave authority to the Department of Justice and the \n     Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to \n     enforce the Jenkins Act. In light of the unique harms and \n     circumstances surrounding the online sale of certain tobacco \n     products, this Act is intended to help collect cigarette \n     excise taxes, to stop tobacco sales to underage youth, and to \n     help the States enforce their laws that target the online \n     sales of certain tobacco products only. This Act is in no way \n     meant to create a precedent regarding the collection of State \n     sales or use taxes by, or the validity of efforts to impose \n     other types of taxes on, out-of-State entities that do not \n     have a physical presence within the taxing State.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for supporting S.1147, \nthe Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking, PACT, Act. The PACT Act closes \nloopholes in current tobacco trafficking laws, enhances penalties for \nviolations, and provides law enforcement with new tools to combat the \ninnovative methods being used by cigarette traffickers to distribute \ntheir products. With its passage, we cut off a source of funding for \nterrorists and criminals raise more money, enhance states' ability to \ncollect significant amounts of tax revenue, and further limit kids from \neasy access to tobacco products sold over the internet.\n  By passing this bill, we are solving a serious problem that is \ngrowing every day. In 1998, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms \nand Explosives, BATFE, had six active tobacco smuggling investigations. \nToday there are more than 400 active tobacco smuggling investigations.\n  Last November, BATFE announced that they were charging 14 people with \npaying over $8 million, nearly 40 firearms, and drugs to purchase more \nthan 77 million contraband cigarettes to sell in New York. Moreover, \ntwo of the conspirators were also charged with hiring a hitman to kill \ntwo people they believed to be stealing contraband cigarettes. The \nproblem is significant, and today we are giving law enforcement the \nadditional tools they need to root out and end cigarette trafficking \nand related crimes.\n  The number of cases alone does not sufficiently put this problem into \nperspective. The amount of money involved is truly astonishing. \nCigarette trafficking, including the illegal sale of tobacco products \nover the Internet, costs States billions of dollars in lost tax revenue \neach year. It is estimated that we lose $5 billion of tax revenue, at \nthe Federal and State level, each year. As lost tobacco tax revenue \nlines the pockets of criminals and terrorist groups, states are being \nforced to squeeze their budgets even tighter by cutting programs and \nincreasing college tuition. Tobacco smuggling may provide some with \ncheap access to cigarettes, but those cheap cigarettes are coming at a \nsignificant cost to the rest of us.\n  The cost to Americans is not merely financial. Tobacco smuggling has \ndeveloped into a popular, and highly profitable, means of generating \nrevenue for criminal and terrorist organizations. Hezbollah, al-Qaida \nand Hamas have all generated significant revenue from the sale of \ncounterfeit cigarettes. That money is often raised right here in the \nUnited States, and it is then funneled back to these international \nterrorist groups.\n  In July 2004, the 9/11 Commission recommended that ``[v]igorous \nefforts to track terrorist financing must remain front and center in \nU.S. counterterrorism efforts.'' And the 9/11 commission stressed that \nit is important to rely, in part, on traditional criminal tools to \ndisrupt terrorist fundraising efforts, since they often raise money by \ntrafficking in counterfeit goods. Specifically, it said, \n``[c]ounterterrorism investigations often overlap or are cued by other \ncriminal investigations, such as money laundering or the smuggling of \ncontraband.'' All too often, that contraband is cigarettes.\n  By passing this bill today, we are sending a strong message that \nterrorist organizations can no longer exploit the weaknesses in our \ntobacco laws to generate significant amounts of money. Cutting off \nfinancial support to terrorist groups is an indispensable part of \nprotecting the country against future attacks.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, GAO, cigarette \ntrafficking investigations are growing more and more complex, and take \nlonger to resolve. More people are selling cigarettes illegally, and \nthey are getting better at it. As these cases become more difficult to \ncrack, we owe it to law enforcement officials to do our part to lend a \nhelping hand. The PACT Act does that by enhancing BATFE's authority to \nenter premises to investigate and enforce cigarette trafficking laws. \nIt also increases penalties for cigarette trafficking under the Jenkins \nAct from a misdemeanor to a felony. Instead of a slap on the wrist, we \nneed to show these people we mean business and make sure the \ninvestigative efforts of our law enforcement officers pays off. Unless \nthese existing laws are strengthened, traffickers will continue to \noperate with near impunity.\n  Just as important, though, we must enable our country's law \nenforcement officials to combat the cigarette smugglers of the 21st \ncentury. The internet represents a new obstacle to enforcement. Illegal \ntobacco vendors around the world evade detection by conducting \ntransactions over the internet, and then shipping their illegal \nproducts around the country to consumers. Just a few years ago, there \nwere less than 100 vendors selling cigarettes online. Today, \napproximately 500 vendors sell illegal tobacco products over the \nInternet.\n  Without innovative enforcement methods, law enforcement will not be \nable to effectively address the growing challenges facing them today. \nThe PACT Act sets out to do just that by empowering states to go after \nout-of-state sellers who are violating their tax laws in Federal court. \nIt also cuts off their method of delivery. A significant part of this \nproblem involves the shipment of contraband cigarettes through the \nUnited States Postal Service, USPS. This bill would cut off online \nvendors' access to the USPS. We would treat cigarettes just like we\n\n[[Page S1487]]\n\ntreat alcohol, making it illegal to ship them through the U.S. mails \nand cutting off a large portion of the delivery system.\n  In addition to cracking down on tobacco smuggling, the bill will keep \ntobacco out of the hands of kids. One of the primary ways children get \naccess to cigarettes today is on the Internet and through the mails. \nThe PACT Act contains a strong age verification section that will \nprevent online sales of cigarettes by requiring sellers to use a method \nof shipment that includes a signature and photo ID check upon delivery. \nMost States already have similar laws on the books, and this would \nsimply make sure that we have a national standard to ensure that the \nInternet is not being used to evade ID checks required at our grocery \nand convenience stores.\n  It is important to point out that this bill has been carefully \ndrafted, following negotiations with numerous interested parties, \nincluding the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, the National Association \nof Attorneys General, the Department of Justice, and various tribal \ngroups, to ensure that it would be strictly neutral in regards to \ntribal sovereignty and tribal immunity rights. The PACT Act would \nneither expand nor contract the current scope of tribal sovereignty and \nimmunity, as determined by Federal statute and judicial \ninterpretations. Also, the bill makes clear that it cannot be used to \nexpand, contract, or otherwise change the scope of tribal sovereignty \nand immunity.\n  The commonsense approach of the PACT Act has brought together a \nstrong coalition of supporters. Tobacco companies and public health \nadvocates; State law enforcement and Federal law enforcement; and \nRepublicans and Democrats alike all agree that this is an issue that \nmust be addressed. Today, we begin to provide law enforcement \nauthorities with the tools they need to combat a very serious threat to \nour States' coffers, national security, and public health.\n  Again, I thank leadership, the cosponsors of the bill, and all of my \ncolleagues for their support of the PACT Act.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the committee substitute be \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action \nor debate, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1147), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/11/senate-section/article/S1487-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MARCH 15, 2010\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
