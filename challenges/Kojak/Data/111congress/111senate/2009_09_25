Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for at least several months, Congress, as \nwe\n\n[[Page S9862]]\n\nknow, has been considering comprehensive health reform legislation \nwritten and moved through committees without bipartisan support. The \nSenate Finance Committee, now the last committee, is apparently \nconsidering a proposal that was originally believed to possibly garner \nbipartisan support. However, it has not. At the end of the day, the \nbill has ended up being divided along partisan lines.\n  I agree that bipartisanship alone does not propose good legislation, \nbut I can guarantee that partisan legislation pushed through Congress \non artificial deadlines will not engender confidence or the support of \nthe American people. Not one of the bills in the House or Senate \ncommittees has received a Republican legislator's vote--now they are \ncounting on perhaps one--nor did any of the bills deserve the vote of \nany Member of Congress. I hope reason will prevail this week.\n  Unfortunately, as written, the administration's and Senator Baucus's \nproposal does not warrant the support of the American people or Members \nof Congress. During the August recess we saw millions of Americans come \nto townhall meetings across this country and express their concerns. \nWhile some have dismissed these peaceful revolutionaries and impugned \ntheir motives, I believe these citizens should be listened to. This \npeaceful resolution is like nothing I have ever seen in my nearly 30 \nyears of elected office. Americans have made it abundantly clear they \ndo not want government taking over their health care decisions. But, \nunfortunately, that is the reality of the proposals before the Senate \nFinance Committee and those that have already been passed. Senator \nBaucus's proposal is not any different. It increases or creates new \ngovernment control in all aspects of our health care system, increases \nhealth care taxes, and makes cuts to Medicare that reduce benefits and \nweaken its fiscal health.\n  The administration's bill being considered this week in the Finance \nCommittee puts Washington in control of health insurance regulations by \ndefining what is ``acceptable health insurance coverage'' and what \nAmericans must pay for this coverage. Washington also seeks to tell \nAmericans that they have no more than four insurance plan coverage \nlevels available to them, the least costly of which would be more \nexpensive than many individual and small group policies today.\n  In addition, the proposal decides which health care industry should \nbe taxed and then imposes billions in new taxes on them. There are new \ntaxes on prescription drugs, there are new taxes on medical devices, \nthere are new taxes on laboratory tests, and there are new taxes on \ninsurance companies.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has confirmed what we know: that \nthese taxes will be passed on to the consumers and will drive up health \ninsurance premiums, directly contradicting the goal all of us shared \ntogether. This week CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf in the Senate \nFinance Committee said:\n\n       Our judgment is that that piece of legislation would raise \n     insurance premiums by roughly the amount of the money \n     collected.\n\n  If there are some out there who are not concerned by this massive \ngovernment expansion, here is the kicker. The tax increases start right \naway even though many coverage provisions do not begin for 4 years, \nmaking the real 10-year implementation cost between $1.5 and $2 \ntrillion. While it may seem to most Americans that reform is all about \nregulating health insurers and getting people covered, America's \nseniors who depend on Medicare would be wrong to assume their benefits \nwill not be affected under the proposal that is being considered in the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  The administration's proposal under consideration in the Finance \nCommittee cuts $500 billion from Medicare and allocates it to creating \na new entitlement that we know taxes and costs too much. Instead of \nimproving Medicare's financial stability, the proposal cuts nearly $120 \nbillion from hospitals serving Medicare patients, more than $40 billion \nfrom Medicare home health providers, and approximately $130 billion of \nthe cuts come from Medicare Advantage.\n  CBO confirmed the obvious--that taking $130 billion from Medicare \nAdvantage is a cut in the extra benefits provided to seniors despite \nprotestations that this is not a cut from the other side and from \nPresident Obama.\n  From the Associated Press:\n\n       Congress' Chief Budget Officer is contradicting President \n     Barack Obama's oft-stated claim that seniors would not see \n     their Medicare benefits cut under a health care overhaul.\n\n  Candidate Obama campaigned to make this cut, but now we hear the \nother side twist themselves in circles trying to obscure the facts. \nAmericans should understand what is in these proposals and make up \ntheir own minds. But the other side must not agree. Why else would \nDemocrats vote down an amendment in the Senate Finance Committee that \nwould have simply required the legislative language to be posted online \nfor 72 hours before voting on the proposals? This is what happens when \nyou do not have online or prior information concerning amendments.\n  The Finance Committee passed a Democratic amendment earlier Wednesday \nby voice vote that they thought would have no impact on the bill's \nbottom line. Hours later, the committee staff learned from CBO that \nSenator Debbie Stabenow's amendment on foster care would actually cost \n$600 million. This is why we need to have cost estimates and online \nscrutiny not only by Members of Congress and their staffs but by the \nAmerican people before we adopt amendments.\n  Let me read from the press release issued by Senator Baucus this \nweek:\n\n       At the urging of Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max \n     Baucus, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [known \n     as CMS] has cracked down on insurance compan[ies] . . . The \n     CMS investigation into the beneficiary letter was prompted by \n     a Baucus request.\n\n  This is a press release issued by the office of the Senator from \nMontana himself. And what did Senator Baucus's urging result in? A gag \norder from the acting head of the CMS Center for Drug and Health Plan \nChoices. Shockingly, the CMS subgroup ordered health plans offering \nMedicare Advantage benefits to stop communicating with their members \nwhat the CBO tells us is true, that taking $130 billion from Medicare \nAdvantage is a cut.\n  Let's be clear. This is government-imposed restrictions on free \nspeech. How is it that we have an agency of government telling a \nprivate corporation they are not free to express their opinions or \nviews on anything the Congress does?\n  So where does this leave us? The proposal expands failing Medicaid, \nincreases government control in the health care of every American, and \ndrives up premiums by raising taxes on health care and health \ninsurance. Then the proposal forces you or your employer to purchase \ntheir more expensive insurance. But to hide the impact, we are going to \nsubsidize some Americans for this more expensive coverage, and if they \ndo not purchase this more expensive coverage, the proposal tells the \nIRS to come after them with new tax penalties.\n  The recent poll this morning, published in various newspapers, shows \nthere continues to be waning support and a lack of understanding of the \nPresident's proposal. I think that is perfectly logical because the \nPresident says: If you like your present health insurance, you can keep \nit. Then CBO determines, and others, if your employer provides you with \nhealth care benefits and chooses the government option, then you as the \nemployee do not have the ability to keep your health insurance policy \nif you like it.\n  So I think it is pretty clear the strategy of the administration is \nto try to ram something through the Senate and the House, rewrite it in \nconference, and certainly without Republican participation. I hope that \nis not the case.\n  I look forward to continued discussion of this very vital issue for \nthe American people on the floor of the Senate and in the various \nforums around the country. I intend to continue to have health care \ntownhall meetings in my State as they have been very helpful both in \ninforming my constituents and my constituents informing me.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S9863]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Senators are still hashing out the \ndetails of the Democrat health care proposal that they plan to bring to \nthe floor, and it isn't getting any better.\n  Americans wanted us to work together on reforms that improve the \nsystem we have. What they are getting instead is a bill that creates an \nentirely different system in which government plays a bigger and bigger \nrole in people's health care decisions. They are slapping this plan \ntogether as quickly as possible, and then they are going to force it on \nthe American people whether they like it or not. That is what is going \non this week in the hearing room of the Finance Committee.\n  Supporters of this bill are watching the clock. They know the longer \nit sits out there, the more Americans will oppose this trillion-dollar \nexperiment that cuts Medicare, raises taxes, and threatens the health \ncare choices that millions of Americans now enjoy. That is why they \nstruck down a commonsense amendment this week that would have given the \nAmerican people 72-hours to look at the details of this legislation.\n  They are rushing it through, hoping no one gets to see the fine \nprint. Why else would they deny this 72-hour amendment that gives \npeople the time they need to read a 1,000-page bill? Why else would \nthey be dismissing anyone who raises a peep of opposition? Why else \nwould they be asking people to forward fishy e-mails to the White \nHouse? And why else would the administration order an investigation \ninto a private company for telling its clients the truth about what \nthis legislation would mean for them?\n  More and more, it seem like supporters of this legislation just don't \nbelieve that the American people know what is best for themselves, so \nthey want to keep them in the dark about the details. But that is not \nthe way democracy works. And that is why Republicans sent a letter to \nthe Department of Health and Human Services yesterday calling on the \nHHS Secretary to rescind the gag order that it placed on companies that \nwant to tell seniors how health care legislation will affect them. \nSeniors deserve to know what is in this bill, and insurers should be \nfree to tell them.\n  But until that gag rule is lifted, we will tell seniors ourselves, \nbecause it hits them hard. It cuts services that millions of seniors \ncurrently enjoy. It could force seniors off the plans they have with \nnearly $140 billion in cuts to one popular Medicare plan; it calls for \nnearly $120 billion in Medicare cuts for hospitals that care for \nseniors; more than $40 billion in cuts to home health agencies; and \nnearly $8 billion in cuts to hospice care.\n  Everyone agrees Medicare needs reform. This isn't reform. Lawmakers \nwant to use Medicare as a piggy bank to pay for their experiment, and \nseniors are going to suffer for it. The response we keep getting from \nthe administration is that hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to \nMedicare won't affect services. Who can blame seniors for scratching \ntheir heads over that one? How do you cut half a trillion dollars from \nsomething without anybody noticing the difference? Seniors, rightly, \njust aren't buying it.\n  Americans want reform. They want lower costs. They want greater \naccess for people without insurance. And they want Congress to deliver \ncommonsense solutions to all these problems. What they are getting \ninstead is a trillion-dollar experiment that cuts Medicare, raises \ntaxes, and threatens the health care options that millions of Americans \nnow enjoy. And they are being told it all has to be done as fast as \npossible to meet some artificial deadline that no one can explain.\n  Americans want us to slow down, and Congress is putting its foot on \nthe accelerator. Americans want to know what this bill would mean for \nthem, and Congress won't let them read it before a vote, won't even \nallow them 72-hours to look over the details of a 1,000 page piece of \nlegislation that will affect one of the most significant aspects of \ntheir lives. Americans have concerns about what they're hearing, and \nthey are being told to shut up, sit down, and take the health care we \ngive you.\n  This is precisely the kind of condescending attitude from lawmakers \nin Washington that ordinary Americans are tired of. This is the kind of \nthing they are protesting and speaking out against across the country. \nAnd over the last few months, Congress hasn't given them any reason to \nbelieve that their concerns aren't exactly right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last evening the Senate passed a 3-month \nextension--until December 31--of the Federal Aviation Administration \nreauthorization bill, and I wanted to mention a word about that.\n  The 3-month extension is necessary because the authorization ends at \nthe end of this month, September 30. This is such an important issue, \nso I hope we are able to find time on the floor of the Senate--I have \ntalked to the majority leader, Senator Reid, about finding time on the \nfloor to consider the FAA reauthorization bill, which includes \nimportant provisions to modernize our air traffic control system.\n  Let me talk about the process for getting a bill considered on the \nfloor just for a moment. It has been difficult here to get things done \non the floor of the Senate. Sometimes we have had cooperation, \nsometimes not. Sometimes on very noncontroversial things we have had to \nfile cloture just on the motion to proceed. It takes 2 days to get \ncloture, have a vote on cloture, and then the minority has insisted on \n30 hours postcloture. So you have to take the better part of a week \njust to get to a piece of legislation, even the noncontroversial ones. \nSo my hope would be that perhaps we could get more cooperation \nparticularly when it comes to passing the FAA Reauthorization Act.\n  The FAA Reauthorization Act is critically important because we need \nto modernize the air traffic control system. I chair the Aviation \nSubcommittee, and that is why I wish to bring this bill to the floor, \nalong with my colleague, Senator Rockefeller, and move rather rapidly \non the issue of modernization of the air traffic control system.\n  We are still flying using ground-based radar systems that have been \naround for a long time. Previously, I described on the floor of the \nSenate that when flying began in this country and we started to haul \nmail by airplanes, planes could only fly during the day when the pilot \ncould see. Then eventually they began flying at night by building big \nbonfires 50 or 100 miles out so the pilot could see the direction they \nwere supposed to head. Then, with more sophistication, we developed \nground-based radar and we put transponders in an airplane which send \nsignals to a radar on the ground, and that radar then puts a little \nsignal on a\n\n[[Page S9864]]\n\nscreen that says: Here is where the airplane is. Well, that is all \nfine, except in most cases it's actually: This is where the airplane \nwas. Because for the next 7 seconds that jet is elsewhere. It is \nmoving. So you have a single dot on a ground-based radar system, and \nthe transponder says, here is where that jet airplane is, but it is \nreally not there anymore. It is there for just a nanosecond, and during \nthe rest of the sweep of the radar that airplane is somewhere else.\n  We need to go to an entirely new system. Europe and the United States \nare both moving to a system that uses GPS so that we know exactly where \nthat airplane is. It is a much more effective system and a safer \nsystem. It will save energy. It will allow airlines to fly more direct \nroutes, so it will save time for passengers. It will be better for the \nenvironment because planes will be using less energy. All of that is \ntrue. But we can't get there until we pass the provisions that move the \nFAA forward with modernization that are part of the FAA reauthorization \nbill.\n  I and others have worked on this for a long time. We extended the \nexisting reauthorization last evening until the end of the year, but \nbetween now and then we need to pass the reauthorization bill through \nthe Senate so that we can conference it with the House and get a bill \nto the President.\n  It also includes provisions dealing with safety. For example, I have \nchaired two hearings on the tragic accident in Buffalo, NY, with the \nColgan Air flight in which many lives were lost. We have included in \nthis legislation issues dealing with the FAA and the issues of pilot \nfatigue, crew rest, pilot training, and other issues dealing with \nsafety that are very important.\n  We also include the Passengers' Bill of Rights, which some of my \ncolleagues have worked on for a long while. I included that in the mark \nthat has now passed the Commerce Committee. It includes, for example, \none little piece in the Passengers' Bill of Rights says that if you are \non an airplane and you are stranded someplace on a tarmac, they can't \nkeep you more than 3 hours without being required to take you back to \nthe terminal. We have had examples--tragic examples, I should say--of \npeople being stuck on an airplane for way too many hours and not \nallowed to come back to the terminal. Well, we put a provision in here \ndealing with that which relates to the Passengers' Bill of Rights.\n  My point is this: This is important to passengers, it is important to \nthe airlines, and it is important to our country to get this done and \nget it done right. My fervent hope is that we will get time on the \nschedule and get it through the Senate so that we can get it to \nconference with the House of Representatives and see if we can get done \nwhat should have been done 2 years ago. It is called the Air Traffic \nControl Modernization Program. It is part of the FAA Reauthorization \nAct, and it is very important for this country.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. President, I want to talk just for a moment about energy. I know \nwe have been spending a lot of time dealing with health care. I believe \nthe Finance Committee is meeting and working on a health care bill, as \nwe speak, and that is important to continue that work. Another \nimportant issue for the Senate to address is energy. I want to talk \njust for a moment about the need for an expanded energy program in this \ncountry and a new set of energy policies. Just as we have reported an \nFAA reauthorization bill, we have also reported a bill out of the \nSenate Energy Committee. I worked with Senator Bingaman and others on a \nbipartisan bill, and we have reported a very important bill out of the \nEnergy Committee which is now on the Senate calendar. If we can pass it \nin the Senate and House, resolve the differences, and have the \nPresident sign it, this legislation can move us in the direction toward \naddressing the climate change. But it also makes us less dependent upon \nforeign energy, thus improving our energy and our national security \nsituation.\n  Here are the issues. We produce millions of barrels of oil every \nsingle day by sucking it out of our planet. We stick little straws in \nthe dirt, and we suck oil out at a rate of about 85 million barrels a \nday. Think about a globe in your office or someplace at school and look \nat where we are relative to the size of the planet. Even though we \nproduce 85 million barrels a day for the world, one-fourth of it comes \nto this patch called the United States of America. We use one-fourth of \nall the oil that is sucked out of our planet every single day, so we \nhave a prodigious appetite for energy.\n  That is not surprising. Everything we do uses energy, and we are an \nadvanced industrial country. We get up in the morning and turn on a \nswitch and the light goes on. We plug in an electric razor and shave. \nWe use it for the coffee maker or for the toaster by using electricity. \nWe open the refrigerator which keeps the food cool all the time. We get \nin our cars, put a key in the ignition and ignite an engine with \nprobably 250 horses to take us to work or to get a doughnut and coffee. \nWe are unbelievable users of energy, and we do not even think much \nabout it. But if tomorrow morning we awoke and none of that energy were \navailable, our lives would change in a dramatic way.\n  Now think of this: Although we need one-fourth of 85 million barrels \nof oil today, brought to this country, almost 70 percent of the oil we \nuse is produced elsewhere. Some of it is produced in countries that do \nnot like us very much. Then in addition to nearly 70 percent being \nproduced elsewhere, about 70 percent of the oil in this country is used \nin the transportation sector. So those are the elements of things that \nought to concern us. How do we deal with all of this?\n  What we need to do is produce more energy at home. We also need to \nproduce different kinds of energy. I happen to believe we ought to \nproduce virtually every kind of energy to the extent that we can do so, \nand do it with an eye and understanding on how that impacts climate \nchange issues. We should be attending to and producing more renewable \nenergy--including wind, solar, biomass and other renewable resources. \nDeveloping renewables will move us in the direction of addressing \nclimate change.\n  So here is what we have done in the Energy Committee. We have \nproduced a piece of legislation that maximizes the use of renewable \nenergy.\n  Here is a picture of wind turbines. They are plentiful in my State \nand in many other States as well. We are taking energy from the wind \nand producing electricity. When we put up a turbine, it can blow for 10 \nyears, 20 years or 50 years so that we are getting energy from the \nwind. It is renewable, increasingly reliable, carbon free, and very \nprotective of the environment.\n  By producing electricity from the wind, solar or biomass resources, \nwe are capable of extending and expanding our energy supply and in many \nways, making us less dependent on foreign oil or energy that comes from \nforeign sources. This is especially true as we work to electrify our \ntransportation system.\n  One of the things we did with respect to wind energy is, for the \nfirst time in the Senate Energy bill, establish a national renewable \nelectricity standard. We said we believe there ought to be a \nrequirement of how much of our nation's electricity should come from \nrenewable energy. So we have a 15-percent requirement. When we get a \nbill to the Senate floor, we ought to increase it to a 20-percent \nrequirement where 5 percent is for energy efficiency and 15 percent is \nfor renewable energy. I would like to see if we can strengthen that \nstandard which came out of the Energy Committee. But at least the first \nrenewable electricity standard of 15 percent is in the committee passed \nbill. It is very important that we a starting point for where we want \nto be.\n  There is this old saying: If you don't care where you are, you are \nnever lost. That is very true for public policy in this country. If you \ndon't care where you are, then you don't set goals. But we should set \ngoals because we are unbelievably and dangerously dependent on energy \nfrom other countries. That doesn't make any sense to me, so we must \nmaximize the production of renewable energy.\n  The problem is where the Sun shines or where the wind blows and where \nwe can produce electricity from the wind and the Sun may not \nnecessarily be where we most need the energy. What we need to do is \nproduce energy where we can and move it to the load centers where they \nneed the electricity. So we have a transmission piece in this energy \nlegislation which is very important because it essentially will create \nan interstate highway of transmission\n\n[[Page S9865]]\n\ncapability to maximize the production of renewable energy and move it \nto where it is needed, the load centers.\n  We cannot seem to produce or build transmission capabilities at this \npoint to the scale we need it. We have--we built 11,000 miles of \nnatural gas pipelines in the last 9 years in this country to move \nnatural gas, but we have only been able to build 668 miles of \ninterstate, high voltage transmission lines. We just can't get it done. \nThere are 100 different ways for people to say no. We put a \ntransmission piece in this legislation which will move us down the road \nto maximize the production and the movement of renewable energy. This \nis a positive step for this country.\n  Here is a chart that describes what has happened with domestic \nproduction and use of petroleum in our country from 1981 to today. It \nis pretty clear from this graph what has happened, and this ever \ngrowing gap is what makes us dangerously dependent on foreign oil. We \nuse a lot of oil, and we are unbelievably dependent on foreign oil. As \nI indicated, some of it is from countries that don't like us very much, \nand that is not smart at all.\n  The Energy bill passed in the Energy Committee awaiting floor action \nis legislation that contains an amendment I successfully offered that \nwould open access to the eastern gulf of Mexico which is closed for oil \nand gas production. It would open it for oil and gas production. That \nis very important because there are substantial amounts of production \navailable to us in this region.\n  Down in the Cuban waters we have this misguided embargo against Cuba \nfor the last 50 years that has not worked. It continues, and at the \nsame time, the Cubans are opening their waters for oil and gas \nproduction to companies based in other countries. We understand there \nis about a half million barrels a day for production available in these \nwaters. The Spanish are there, the Indians are there, Canada is there--\nthey are all seeking to develop the resources, but American oil \ncompanies can't because of that embargo. That makes no sense to me, and \nwe ought to remove that embargo, in my judgment. But the point is, the \nbill I have just described actually opens a substantial area for \nadditional oil and gas production that came from an amendment passed \nwith bipartisan support.\n  Here is another chart describing where we get our energy. It includes \ncoal, petroleum, natural gas, hydroelectric, renewables, and nuclear. I \nhappen to think to the extent that we can, even as we take action to \nprotect our environment, we ought to consider all types of energy to \nmake us less dependent on foreign energy.\n  Coal--I recognize, by using coal to produce energy, we release carbon \ninto the atmosphere. That is difficult when we are dealing with a need \nto address climate change. In the appropriations committee I chair on \nenergy and water, what we are doing is making sure we are investing in \nfinding ways to remove the carbon from fossil energy. I believe it can \nbe done. I believe one day we will have a near-zero emission, coal-\nfired, electric-generating plant.\n\n  I think we ought to do a lot of everything and do it well. I believe \nthere are so many exciting things going on that will alter our future, \nif we just keep investing in them and make them happen.\n  I want to show a chart that is kind of a Byzantine chart, actually. \nThis might not mean much to anybody at first glance, but this is algae. \nIt is single-cell pond scum. We have all seen in very common places, \nespecially those of us who grew up in rural areas. In a pond when the \nSun shines we will see this film develop, this green slimy stuff in a \npond. It is pond scum, right? Algae.\n  When I became chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I restarted the algae research work that had been \ndiscontinued for 15 years. Why would we research algae? Here is why: \nBecause if CO2 is a problem in coal-burning or fossil-fired \nplants, what we can do with it is take the CO2 from the \nfacility and feed it into a big old greenhouse. We can grow algae \nbecause algae grows with sunlight, water, and CO2. We get \nrid of the CO2 by feeding it into and growing the algae, \nthen harvesting the algae and producing a diesel fuel. We take the \nCO2, which is a problem because we want to protect the \natmosphere.\n  There is research going on right now in which I believe Exxon and Dr. \nCraig Venter are working on for new algae research. They are taking the \nalgae and excreting the lipids which, with little manipulation, would \nthen become petroleum projects. Dr. Venter was also one of several \nleading scientists involved in the research to map the human genome \nwhich gave us the first owners manual for the human body. Dr. Venter \nand Dr. Francis Collins are remarkable Americans. He is now doing \nresearch in which people are trying to determine how to create \nsynthetic microbes that would consume coal and, in the process of \nconsuming coal, leave methane gas behind.\n  Isn't that interesting? Isn't it something, if we could have \nsynthetic microbes turn coal into gas by consuming the coal? I don't \nknow what the future holds for all of this. I do know this. The Energy \nbill we have passed in our Energy Committee builds on a lot of these \ninteresting and important ideas, and I believe does it well. While I \nhaven't mentioned nuclear, there are loan guarantee funds and other \nincentives that Congress has already passed to try to build some of the \nfirst few nuclear projects, which obviously don't produce carbon.\n  I think it is important that we recognize we should do a lot of \nthings, do them well, make us less dependent on foreign oil, protect \nthe environment, and provide greater national security and energy \nsecurity as a result. That is the point of it all.\n  The reason I have described all this--I come from a State that \nproduces a lot of energy and I am on the Energy Committee. I am the \nsecond ranking Democrat on the committee. I am also chairman of the \nappropriations subcommittee that funds all energy and water projects, \nand that is a great opportunity for me because I come from a State that \nproduces a lot of energy. We have virtually every form of energy. In \nthe western half of that State, we produce a lot of oil and natural \ngas. We produce a lot of coal. We also have a great deal of wind and \nbiomass. In fact we have more wind than any State in America. According \nto the Department of Energy, we are the Saudi Arabia of wind.\n  Also, we have a plant that uses lignite coal and produces from \nlignite coal synthetic natural gas. It is the only plant of its kind in \nthe United States. We take CO2 from that facility, put it in \na pipeline to inject into the oil fields in Canada. We are taking \nCO2, sequestering it, selling it, using it in enhanced oil \nrecovery because a very small amount of oil a new oil field is actually \nbrought up until we use additional means to move it. We can do that by \ninjecting it with CO2 which stays in the ground. Then we can \nbring up a lot more oil. We are doing all these things.\n  The reason I wanted to talk about this today is we need to get that \nEnergy bill to the floor of the Senate, get it passed, get it to the \nPresident for signature. It is a significant first step in the \ndirection of addressing climate change but is also a significant step \nin making us less dependent on foreign oil.\n  Senator Bingaman and Senator Murkowski, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Energy Committee, worked with me and other Members for \nmany months to produce this legislation. Some say let's merge it with \nclimate change.\n  We should put this energy bill and climate change together and bring \nit to the floor for a debate. Well, you know what. I have said I think \nit would be far more beneficial, as a matter of practical policy, to \nbring the Energy bill to the Senate floor, pass it, put that progress \nin the bank because it is a significant stride toward addressing \nclimate change, then follow that up with a climate change bill behind \nthat.\n  I know some have interpreted my remarks as saying I do not support \nclimate change legislation. Well, I have already spoken on the floor to \nclarify that point. I do not support a cap-and-trade bill as it relates \nto the market trade portion of cap and trade.\n  I do not intend and do not have any interest in consigning the price \nof energy tomorrow to the decisions in a $1 trillion carbon securities \nmarket that will be populated by investment banks and speculators today \nthat are going to tell us what they believe the price of carbon should \nbe tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S9866]]\n\n  I have had way too much acquaintance with markets that are broken and \nmarkets that do not work in recent years to believe that is what we \nought to do. I do believe there is something significant happening with \nrespect to our climate changing. I believe this country should take, at \na minimum, a series of important ``no regret'' steps in addressing \nthose issues.\n  But I have great difficulty with those who believe we should do cap-\nand-trade bill when you talk about carbon marking trading, given the \nexperience we have had in recent years in other markets. We have \ndiscovered that time on the Senate floor is evaporating quickly because \nhealth care is taking longer than one would have expected.\n  We must also do financial reform. I would hope that financial reforms \ncome after health care. My own view is we do financial reform first \nthis year because that would have established the foundation by which \npeople could have confidence in the system that steered this country's \neconomy into the ditch. I have expressed this to the President.\n  But I understand health care is a very serious problem as well. So we \nneed to consider health care and financial reform. I also hope we can \nconsider the issue of FAA reauthorization; all these things and others \nare needed to be done before the end of the year. The majority leader \nunderstands all of that, is working very hard to try to fit the pieces \nof that puzzle into the time available.\n  My only point for expressing the point on the floor is that I would \nvery much hate to lose some important work on energy that affects \nvirtually every form of energy, including energy efficiency, the first \never national RES, more transmission, additional access to oil, and \nmore that will make us less dependent on foreign oil and start to \naddress climate change.\n  All of that is part of a plan that I think is a plan that will \nadvance the interests of this country. So my hope is that in the coming \nweeks, as we think through and talk through what should be our agenda \nin the near future, my hope is we can find a way to move these \nimportant parts of an energy bill.\n  This, I think, should represent a significant opportunity for \nbipartisanship at a time when there has been precious little. Too \nlittle bipartisanship exists right now. But if there is any area in \nwhich most of us would believe our country's best interests reside, it \nhas to be producing more energy and doing it the right way, protecting \nour environment at the same time. That is very much what this Energy \nbill strives to do.\n  It will advance our country's interests, and so my hope is that when \nthe calendar turns for the new year, we will have sent to the \nPresident's desk an energy policy that has a lot to commend in it for \nthis country's future.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a bill that will \nincrease energy security and combat poverty through greater \ntransparency in the oil, gas and mining industries.\n  This week, Senator Lugar and I, along with Senators Schumer, Wicker \nand Feingold, introduced the Energy Security Through Transparency Act. \nThis legislation will require all companies listed on U.S. exchanges to \ndisclose their payments to foreign governments for the extraction of \noil, gas and minerals on a country-by-country basis. This disclosure \nwould apply to all companies that file with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, SEC, regardless of where they are based, and would be added \nto existing SEC requirements.\n  This legislation will set a new international standard for corporate \nand State behavior.\n  With this bill, we are changing the paradigm within the world's oil, \ngas and mining companies operate, and,\n\n[[Page S9867]]\n\nimportantly, changing the nature of their relationship with the \ngovernments in the countries in which they operate.\n  This is critical to our energy security, our national security and \nfor the welfare of the citizens of these countries.\n  When we look at countries situated on oil and natural gas reserves, \nwe think these countries have won the global version of the economic \nlottery. But what economists have found by studying these resource-rich \ncountries is that they often fare worse than their resource-poor \nneighbors, both economically and politically.\n  In these countries rich in natural resources, governments do not \nprovide the most basic of information concerning natural resource \nrevenues. This lack of transparency facilitates and even encourages \ncorruption. This often leads to grinding poverty in countries that are \nparadoxically rich in natural resources.\n  This legislation will provide much-needed regulatory and legal \nsupport to existing initiatives such as the Extractive Industries \nTransparency Initiative, EITI, and Publish What You Pay.\n  It is critical that the United States lead by example on \ntransparency. That is why this legislation also encourages the United \nStates to become an implementing country under EITI.\n  U.S. implementation of EITI would have practical and symbolic value \non a number of fronts.\n  While this legislation puts human rights front and center in the \nglobal energy discussion, it also empowers people to fight corruption \nand hold their governments accountable. Greater transparency will lead \nto greater stability in countries that benefit from their natural \nresources and will lessen volatility in the global energy market, \nmaking them more conducive for long-term investments.\n  Just as importantly, U.S. implementation would bolster the momentum \nfor the EITI, helping to make it a truly global standard for \ntransparency in extractive industries. Leading by example is one of the \nmost powerful ways the U.S. can encourage other countries to sign on to \nthe initiative.\n  I look forward to working with our colleagues to ensure passage of \nthis important and timely legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/25/senate-section/article/S9867-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE SITUATION IN HONDURAS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Monday, September 21, President Manuel \nZelaya returned to Tegucigalpa, Honduras, for the first time since he \nwas deposed and exiled in a June 28th coup d'etat, taking refuge in the \nBrazilian Embassy. His return has led to the installation of a curfew, \nviolence between Zelaya's supporters and Honduran security forces, and \ntroubling reports of the detention and physical abuse of his \nsupporters.\n  I am encouraged by reports that representatives of Roberto \nMicheletti, who currently occupies the Presidency, have met with \nPresident Zelaya. As divided as these two factions are, these talks \nneed to continue in order to resolve this situation peacefully before \nthe country descends into further bloody confrontations between \ncivilians and police, or it leads to violent fractures within the \nmilitary.\n  I continue to believe that the proposal for the restoration of \nPresident Zelaya and early elections, put forward by Costa Rican \nPresident Oscar Arias, has the best chance of resolving this conflict. \nBrute force, like that reported from Honduras this week, will achieve \nnothing but further polarization.\n  If President Zelaya is guilty of violating the law, as some have \nmaintained, there are constitutional procedures for dealing with that. \nBut by abusing the law themselves and simply throwing him out of the \ncountry, those who claim to have acted in the interests of the Honduran \npeople only compounded the country's problems. Honduras, an \nimpoverished country that needs the support of the United States and \nits neighbors, can ill afford this crisis to continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/25/senate-section/article/S9867-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING FRANK FERTITTA\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President. I wish to honor the memory of a remarkable \nhuman being who inspired those around him with kindness, generosity, \nand devotion. He was a man who loved his family and understood the \nvalue of education.\n  Lately, it seems that heads of corporations and big businesses have \nbecome about as popular as lawyers and politicians. Well, you don't \nhave to look further than the legacy of Frank Fertitta, Jr., to \nunderstand that compassion and respect can very much be part of a \nsuccessful mission statement.\n  The name Fertitta may be best known in Las Vegas, NV, but the lessons \nof how this gaming patriarch lived his life should be emulated around \nthe world.\n  Frank Fertitta, Jr., moved to Las Vegas in 1960 with his lovely wife \nVictoria. He started as a bellman and slowly worked his way through the \nranks--dealer, pit boss, general manager. But what he will be \nremembered for professionally is his vision and understanding of \nbusiness and human nature.\n  In 1976, Frank opened a 5,000-square-foot building called The Casino. \nThose around him had their doubts about whether this venture would \nsucceed. Instead, Frank became a pioneer of a gaming niche that catered \nto locals. His little experiment eventually became the Palace Station. \nThirty-three years after that first venture, Station Casinos today has \n18 casinos and resorts and employs more than 13,000 people. And today, \nanother generation of Fertittas is working to keep the vision of Frank \nFertitta, Jr., alive and well.\n  His success, however, is not what made Frank Fertitta, Jr., so \nextraordinary. It was his character and integrity that truly made him \nan example to all. With the utmost respect, he was called Mr. Fertitta \nby longtime employees and patrons of Station Casinos. That is because \nhe showed respect to all he came into contact with, and they knew it.\n  I was fortunate to know Mr. Fertitta and call him a friend. He was \ngenuine and unwavering in his support. The kind of person you were \nblessed to have in your life.\n  Described as quiet and polite, family and faith were the foundations \nof his life. Mr. Fertitta showed how a successful, hard-working \nbusinessman can also be a dedicated family man. Each week his whole \nfamily gathered at his and Victoria's home for Sunday dinner. This was \na tradition that all of the Fertittas have cherished over the years. \nAnyone who knew him knew his family came first.\n  He was also a consistent and valued friend to many philanthropic \norganizations in Las Vegas. He and Victoria were involved with the \nUniversity of Nevada Las Vegas, Bishop Gorman High School, Catholic \nCharities of Southern Nevada, the Nevada Cancer Institute, Opportunity \nVillage, St. Judes Ranch, and the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for \nBrain Health.\n  It is one thing to be generous with your resources. It is another \nthing to raise your children to also be generous with theirs. That was \npart of Mr. Fertitta's success. He was proud that his children had \nbecome such generous contributors to the community. They did so because \nhe set such a strong example.\n  Las Vegas lost a visionary with the recent passing of Mr. Fertitta. \nHe taught us all how to respect others--regardless of one's status, how \nto dream big, and how to give back to our communities. There aren't \nmany people like Mr. Fertitta in the world. We should all take a page \nfrom his mission statement to ensure that his brand of success lives \non.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/25/senate-section/article/S9867-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9867-S9868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                2009 SERVICE TO AMERICA MEDAL RECIPIENTS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I honor and congratulate \nthree outstanding Federal employees from Maryland--Thomas Alexander \nWaldmann, Patricia Guerry and Deborah Jin--who have recently been \nawarded Service to America medals in recognition for their great work.\n  Our Federal employees are on the front lines every day, working hard \nfor America. Their commitment to public service makes life better for \nus all. I am proud to honor these three terrific Federal employees from \nMaryland today.\n  For the past five decades, Dr. Thomas Alexander Waldmann has devoted \nhimself to performing cutting-edge\n\n[[Page S9868]]\n\nscience at the National Institutes of Health. His work has resulted in \ngreat advances in treatment for patients with multiple sclerosis, \nvarious types of cancer and AIDS. Dr. Waldmann's commitment to \ntransforming scientific research to save and improve lives has earned \nhim the nickname ``renaissance scientist'' by his peers. His seminal \nresearch extends from the study of the immune system to clinical trials \nof immunotherapeutic agents, which help your immune system perform \nbetter. His innovative use of clinical trials has helped transform the \nway trials are used to treat patients, and has led to the development \nof treatments for fatal forms of leukemia and lymphoma and for multiple \nsclerosis.\n  Dr. Patricia Guerry of the U.S. Naval Medical Research Center is an \ninnovator in combating food-borne illnesses throughout the world. After \nthe discovery of the most common cause of food-borne illnesses, the \nCampylobacter microbe, in the late 1970s, researchers struggled to \nunderstand it and develop vaccines to combat it. But Dr. Guerry was \nunwavering in her quest to study the Campylobacter microbe, overcoming \nmany barriers and working with limited resources to develop a promising \nnew vaccine that may be only a couple years away from human trials. \nOver the past 3 years, Dr. Guerry and her group have had impressive \nsuccess in advancing a vaccine, working at a breakneck pace. Dr. \nGuerry's success is especially promising for American troops abroad, \nwho are particularly vulnerable to food poisoning.\n  Dr. Deborah Jin is another pioneering researcher. A research team \nleader at the JILA-National Institute of Standards and Technology joint \ninstitute in Boulder, CO, Deborah and her team have made great advances \nin the field of physics, including the creation of a new form of \nmatter, a major discovery in the race toward superconductivity. \nSuperconductivity--using extremely low temperatures to move electrons \nthrough a magnetic field--can potentially lead to breakthroughs in \nenergy efficiency and computing. Deborah's team raced against six other \nteams worldwide to be the first to make this discovery.\n  These three Marylanders exemplify the very best that our Federal \nemployees have to offer. But don't think that there aren't thousands of \nstories like this across the country, from Atlanta to Silver Spring. \nThey work hard so that the American people have a government they can \ncount on. I will continue to stand sentry so that Federal employees get \nthe pay and benefits they have earned and the job security they \ndeserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/25/senate-section/article/S9868-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CAROL BROADNAX\n\n Mr. PRYOR.

Ms. Carol \nBroadnax, a long-time resident of Alexandria, VA, is retiring on \nOctober 2, 2009, after 42 years of service in our Federal Government. I \nwant to recognize Carol's outstanding service to the public, and \nespecially, her 30 years of Federal service at the U.S. Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission. Carol started out at the CPSC as a clerk \ntypist and then as a secretary in the Directorate for Communications \nunder Kenneth Rashid and Bessie Draper at the 18th Street location, and \nthen she moved to the agency's Bethesda, MD, location. There, she \nworked in the Office of the General Counsel as the secretary for \nRichard Allen, general law division.

the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1720. A bill to amend title VII of the Public Health Service Act \nto provide improved training and primary\n\n[[Page S9870]]\n\ncare; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I, along with Senator Leahy, introduce \nthe Health Professions and Primary Care Reinvestment Act, which seeks \nto enhance the training and education of primary care providers and \nestablish a new system for evaluating and analyzing primary care \nworkforce programs funded by Title VII Health Professions Education and \nTraining grants.\n  In 1963, in response to an impending physician shortage, Congress \npassed and President Johnson signed the Health Professions Educational \nAssistance Act into law. Qualified educational and medical institutions \nbecame eligible for grants to support primary care curriculum and \nfaculty development, and scholarships and loans to train individuals in \ncertain primary care health professions.\n  The country is, once again, facing a physician shortage. However, \nthis time, the shortage is one component of a larger system-wide \ncrisis.\n  The Health Professions and Primary Care Reinvestment Act takes an \nimportant step toward providing our primary care providers with the \nnecessary resources for better coordinating care, integrating treatment \noptions, and communicating with patients. It also would enhance the \nevaluation and analysis of programs funded by Title VII grants in an \neffort to ensure that funding is appropriately allocated.\n  The Title VII program deserves a robust evaluation and restructuring \nand I believe that the provisions set forth in the Health Professions \nand Primary Care Reinvestment Act will accomplish that goal. My \ncolleagues on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nagreed and voted to include similar provisions in the Affordable Health \nChoices Act, which was reported out of the Committee on July 15, 2009.\n  We must continue our efforts to reform our health care system. In \ndoing so, we must not forget about the important need to ensure an \nadequate workforce to care for patients. I look forward to the full \nSenate considering these vitally important reforms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1720\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 289\n\n       Whereas the year 2009 marks the 70th anniversary of the \n     start of World War II, a war that should be remembered for \n     introducing the world to the repulsive and unprecedented \n     barbarism and cruelty of Nazi Germany;\n       Whereas Poland was the first country attacked and enslaved \n     by the government and armed forces of Nazi Germany as part of \n     the methodical extermination of European Jewry by Nazi \n     Germany;\n       Whereas 6,135 Christian men and women of Poland acted with \n     great integrity and courage, risking their lives and the \n     lives of their families, to save their Jewish countrymen and \n     countrywomen from the barbarism and extermination of the \n     Nazis;\n       Whereas the 6,135 Christian men and women of Poland who \n     acted to save their Jewish countrymen and countrywomen did so \n     in spite of the threat of their immediate execution and the \n     execution of their families, a threat that people in no other \n     country in Nazi-occupied Europe had to endure; and\n       Whereas the 6,135 Christian men and women of Poland who \n     acted to save their Jewish countrymen and countrywomen \n     represent approximately 27 percent of the ``Righteous Among \n     the Nations'' honored by Yad Vashem in the Republic of \n     Israel: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate encourages the people of the \n     United States to reflect on and remember the integrity and \n     courage of the 6,135 Christian men and women of Poland who \n     acted to save their Jewish countrymen and countrywomen from \n     extermination by Nazi Germany.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to submit \na resolution encouraging the people of the U.S. to reflect on and \nremember the integrity and courage of the 6,135 Polish Christians who \ntook action to save their Jewish countrymen and countrywomen from \nextermination by Nazi Germany. Earlier this year I cosponsored S. Res. \n9, a resolution commemorating 90 years of U.S.-Polish diplomatic \nrelations, during which Poland has proven to us be an exceptionally \nstrong partner to the U.S. in advancing freedom around the world. Today \nI want to recognize a time in history when such a freedom was \nchallenged in Poland and around the world by a despotic regime, and \nmore importantly pay tribute to those few who fought this tyranny and \nhelped save innocent lives.\n  This year marks the 70th anniversary of the start of World War II, a \nwar remembered for the cruelty of Nazi Germany, as well as for the \nforces that eventually overcame this cruelty. Following World War II, \nYad Vashem and a Remembrance Authority was established to embark on a \nworldwide project to identify those individuals who helped Jews during \nthe Holocaust. All rescuers of European Jews during World War II are \nhonored today as the ``Righteous Among the Nations'' by Yad Vashem in \nthe State of Israel. Poland's 6,135 ``Righteous'' rescuers constitute \nsome 27 percent of the 22,765 ``Righteous'' throughout the world. \nFurthermore, while unknown in number, it is important to remember those \nPolish Christians who were caught and summarily executed along with \ntheir families while attempting to carry out such rescues. While their \nstories may never be told, it is important to mention their heroic \nefforts.\n  The 6,135 ``Righteous'' Polish Christians whose acts of courage and \nintegrity have been documented by witnesses should be appropriately \nhonored. These Polish Christians who were willing to risk their own \nlives and those of their families to save Polish Jews should not be \nforgotten. These 6,135 Polish Christians will always stand as universal \nexemplars and role models of human compassion who acted above and \nbeyond the normal expectations of courage and integrity. Thus, I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution which reflects \non and remembers the Polish Righteous Among the Nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/25/senate-section/article/S9872-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2556.

Should Region 10 sell, in the current fiscal \n     year, the annual average portion of the decadal allowable \n     sale quantity called for in the current Tongass Land \n     Management Plan in sales which are not deficit when appraised \n     using a residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska \n     values for western red cedar, all of the western red cedar \n     timber from those sales which is surplus to the needs of \n     domestic processors in Alaska, shall be made available to \n     domestic processors in the contiguous 48 United States at \n     prevailing domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in the \n     current fiscal year, less than the annual average portion of \n     the decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the Tongass \n     Land Management Plan in sales which are not deficit when \n     appraised using a residual value approach that assigns \n     domestic Alaska values for western red cedar, the volume of \n     western red cedar timber available to domestic processors at \n     prevailing domestic prices in the contiguous 48 United States \n     shall be that volume: (1) which is surplus to the needs of \n     domestic processors in Alaska; and (2) is that percent of the \n     surplus western red cedar volume determined by calculating \n     the ratio of the total timber volume which has been sold on \n     the Tongass to the annual average portion of the decadal \n     allowable sale quantity called for in the current Tongass \n     Land Management Plan. The percentage shall be calculated by \n     Region 10 on a rolling basis as each sale is sold (for \n     purposes of this amendment, a ``rolling basis'' shall mean \n     that the determination of how much western red cedar is \n     eligible for sale to various markets shall be made at the \n     time each sale is awarded). Western red cedar shall be deemed \n     ``surplus to the needs of domestic processors in Alaska'' \n     when the timber sale holder has presented to the Forest \n     Service documentation of the inability to sell western red \n     cedar logs from a given sale to domestic Alaska processors at \n     a price equal to or greater than the log selling value stated \n     in the contract. All additional western red cedar volume not \n     sold to Alaska or contiguous 48 United States domestic \n     processors may be exported to foreign markets at the election \n     of the timber sale holder. All Alaska yellow cedar may be \n     sold at prevailing export prices at the election of the \n     timber sale holder.\n\n              colorado cooperative conservation authority\n\n       Sec. 418.

Mr. President, today, with Ranking Member Richard Burr, I \nhave introduced legislation that would authorize the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to proceed with certain medical facility leases for \nfiscal year 2010. These leases include facilities in nine different \nStates, including South Carolina, Georgia, California, Alabama, \nPennsylvania, North Carolina, Kansas, Texas, and Florida.\n  We are moving this bill at this time because I have been advised that \nVA can proceed with preliminary steps relating to these leases in \nadvance of an appropriation, if authorization is in place. While I hope \nthat the Senate will pass an appropriations bill for VA as soon as \npossible, this is something we can do today. I will soon introduce \nanother bill to fully authorize VA's construction projects. In the \nmeantime, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, which will enable \nVA to secure the space it needs to care for veterans from all \nconflicts.\n  Mr. REID.
