Mr. President, we know the House-passed health care \nbill will cut Medicare, raise taxes, and raise premiums. We also know \nthe bill being developed by the majority leader will do the same. This \nmorning, I want to focus on the $\\1/2\\ trillion cuts in Medicare--$\\1/\n2\\ trillion over 10 years.\n  We have here the House-passed health care bill in its entirety. This \nis a 2,000-page, as the Wall Street Journal called it, ``monstrosity.'' \nIn the area of the Medicare cuts, what does that mean? When you say you \nare going to cut Medicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion over 10 years, what does \nit mean? It means cuts to hospitals, cuts to Medicare Advantage, cuts \nto nursing homes, cuts to home health care, and cuts to hospice. Those \nvital programs would be collectively subjected to $\\1/2\\ trillion in \ncuts over 10 years.\n  Focusing on hospice, this is the section of the bill that deals with \nhospice. The legalese is a little bit mind-boggling, but to give you a \nsense of how these things are written, it says, ``Subclause (VII) of \nsection''--and it goes on:\n\n       . . . 1814(i)(1)(c)(ii) of the Social Security Act . . . is \n     amended by inserting after ``the\n\n[[Page S11394]]\n\n     market basket percentage increase'' the following: ``(which \n     is subject to the productivity adjustment . . . ''\n\n  Described in another section.\n  You would have to be steeped in legalese and minutia to understand \nwhat that means, so I am going to interpret it for our colleagues so \nthey will know what that means. It means an $8 billion cut to hospice. \nThat is what that language means, an $8 billion cut to hospice.\n  What does that mean for seniors? According to Victoria Scarborough, \nwho is a nurse in Danville, KY, it means sacrificing patient care. Here \nis what she had to say about the prospect of an $8 billion cut to \nhospice:\n\n       We are able to do this--provide excellent health care at \n     low cost--because we are present at the bedside with the \n     patient, sitting at the kitchen table, holding a spouse's \n     hand. We depend upon our highly skilled personnel; our \n     ``services'' are our people. For hospices the productivity \n     adjustment makes little sense, we need our people.\n\n  That illustrates the impact of an $8 billion cut in hospice.\n  On the chart behind me, I mention the other areas that are being cut: \nhospitals, Medicare Advantage, nursing homes, home health, and hospice, \nwhich I just described.\n  Another cut would be to Medicare Advantage. The section of the bill--\nthis is the front page--dealing with the Medicare Advantage reforms, \nthey are called, says ``Phase-In Of Payment Based On Fee-For-Service \nCosts.'' What does that mean? What does ``Phase-In Of Payment Based On \nFee-For-Service Costs'' mean? It means that $236 billion in cuts to \nMedicare will occur--$236 billion in this program out here, Medicare \nAdvantage, that will occur as a result of this bill. What does that \nmean, the $236 billion of cuts to Medicare Advantage? The Congressional \nBudget Office has said it means fewer benefits for seniors. That is the \nCongressional Budget Office that says it means fewer benefits for \nseniors.\n  Norma Hylton of Lexington, KY, recently wrote:\n\n       Mr. Obama says he'll take away the Medicare Advantage \n     plans. . . . This makes us very concerned about the \n     healthcare plans being debated. I truly believe all seniors \n     (maybe others) will suffer.\n\n  We know the overall bill raises taxes, raises health insurance \npremiums for the 85 percent of Americans who already have health \ninsurance, and cuts Medicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion. This morning, what I \ntried to do is point out what some of those cuts mean; what taking $8 \nbillion out of hospice means, this important program dealing with folks \nwho are at the end of life; and what taking $236 billion out of \nMedicare Advantage means, as a practical matter, to constituents in my \nState and across the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/17/senate-section/article/S11394-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Republican leader just came to the \nfloor, as he has with regularity, to speak to the issue of health care \nreform. We are all addressing it because it is a major issue we are \nfacing in this Congress, a major opportunity for this country to deal \nwith a health care system that needs to be fixed. There are parts of it \nthat are very strong but parts of it that need to be fixed.\n  The cost of health care today in America is going up so fast that it \nis outstripping the ability of individuals and businesses to buy health \ninsurance coverage. We have seen the cost of premiums go up three times \nfaster than wages. The story is obvious. For most workers across \nAmerica, the choice each year is take-home pay or increased costs for \nhealth insurance, and they understand it is unsustainable.\n  Just 10 years ago, the cost of a health insurance plan for a family \nof four was $6,000. This year, it is $12,000, on average. Ten years \nfrom now, it will be $24,000. To think that 10 years from now people \nwill have to work to earn $2,000 a month just to pay for the health \ncare for a small family tells you we have to make a change.\n  The Senator from Kentucky on the Republican side came to the floor to \ncriticize not the Senate bill but the House bill. I would say to the \nSenator from Kentucky, in all fairness, let's address the Senate bill \nwhich will be reported this week. It has literally been reviewed by the \nCongressional Budget Office for the last 3 or 4 weeks, and it will come \nout this week and be posted on the Internet for everyone to read in its \nentirety. At that point, I think the criticisms leveled by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky will be put in context. Let's look at the Senate bill.\n  I would also like to stand here and wave before you a copy of the \nRepublican bill on health care reform, but it does not exist. There is \nno Republican alternative to health care reform. They are satisfied \nwith the current system. They want to keep the status quo. Like the \nhealth insurance companies, they are happy with what exists. But most \nAmericans, and certainly those I represent in Illinois, know better. \nThey know we are at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to health \ncare if we have to rely on health insurance companies for permission \nfor coverage because they are going to say no. Repeatedly, they say no. \nThey deny you coverage when you need it the most, because of a \npreexisting condition. They deny you coverage because they say it costs \ntoo much. They deny you coverage because they don't want to cover a \ncertain drug and they want to challenge you to fight them and appeal \nthat decision. They deny coverage when you decide to change a job or \nlose a job. They deny coverage when a child reaches the age of 23 and \nis so-called emancipated and on his own. That is the existing system \nwhich the Republicans are supporting. They can support it if they wish, \nbut most Americans do not. Most Americans want to see real health care \nreform.\n  Let's spend a moment speaking about Medicare, which the Senator from \nKentucky addressed. Our goal is not only to preserve Medicare. As a \npolitical party, it was Democrats who created Medicare. It was \nRepublicans who called it socialized medicine and opposed it. Over the \nyears, they have tried to trim back on Medicare benefits, to reduce \ncoverage and turn Medicare over to private insurers. That effort was \ncalled Medicare Advantage. When private health insurance companies came \nbefore Congress and said: We can do a better job than the government, \nwe can offer Medicare coverage at a lower cost and do it more \nefficiently because we are the private sector, Republicans accepted \nthat premise and tried to take away Medicare coverage from the \ngovernment and offer it to private health insurance companies.\n  What happened? Some private health insurance companies did do it at a \nlower cost but not all of them. In fact, when it was all said and done, \nMedicare Advantage, this so-called private rescue of the Medicare \nProgram, ended up costing 14 percent more than the Medicare Program \nitself. In other words, the Medicare Program was subsidizing private \nhealth insurance companies that couldn't keep their promise to deliver \nMedicare at a lower cost.\n  The Senator from Kentucky comes to the Chamber to defend those \nprivate health insurance companies, defend the subsidy they receive at \nthe expense of Medicare. That is unacceptable and indefensible. \nMedicare offers the basic plan most Americans trust when they reach the \nage of 65. We are going to find a way to make sure we put Medicare on \nsound footing. The future of Medicare is in doubt if we don't deal with \nthe underlying problems in our health care system today.\n  The Senator from Kentucky and his Republican side have no \nalternative. They are not offering health care reform or change. They \nare standing with the health insurance companies, defending Medicare \nAdvantage, which enjoys this healthy subsidy from the Federal \nGovernment, and, frankly, not supporting our efforts to bring real \nreform to health insurance.\n  I can tell my colleagues the Medicare provisions in the House bill \nreferred to\n\n[[Page S11395]]\n\nby the Senator from Kentucky were supported by AARP. They have been \nsupported by other organizations: the Leadership Council of Aging \nOrganizations, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare. How does the Senator from Kentucky explain that; that they \nwould endorse this approach to Medicare while he says it would destroy \nMedicare. Frankly, he happens to be mistaken. What we are doing is \nputting Medicare on a sound financial footing, reducing the increase in \ncost in medical procedures so Medicare isn't stripped of the basic \nfunds it has.\n  In fact, when it is all said and done, we find that the House bill, \nthe bill the Senator from Kentucky references, extends the life of the \nMedicare trust fund by an additional 5 years. How does the Senator from \nKentucky explain that? If this is destroying Medicare, how does this \nhealth care reform extend its life?\n  Under the bill, overall national spending on health care would \nincrease by only .8 percent over the next 10 years, compared to current \nlaw, even though 34 million Americans would be gaining coverage. Under \nthe bill, out-of-pocket spending on health care would decline by more \nthan $200 billion over what it would have been by the year 2019.\n  When it comes to Medicare Advantage, the Senator from Kentucky says \nit offers more benefits for seniors. I am not opposed to offering more \nbenefits for seniors, but I wish to make sure each and every senior \nunder Medicare has a basic Medicare package they can count on and \nafford and that Medicare is put on a permanent, sound financial \nfooting. Unfortunately, on the Republican side, they have offered no \nalternative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/17/senate-section/article/S11395-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11395-S11396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MILCON APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is a proposal by the Federal \nGovernment that relates to a small town in the State I represent. The \ntown is Thomson, IL. It is in Carroll County. It is 150 miles from \nChicago in the northwestern portion. Carroll County is one of the \nsmall, rural counties which has been struggling because a lot of \nemployers have gone and a lot of people have moved. Those who remain \nare hit hard by the recession and desperate for employment. The mayor \nof Thomson, Jerry ``Duke'' Hebeler, wrote a letter to me and Governor \nQuinn and others asking for us to consider a prison which had been \nopened there for expansion as a Federal prison, and the administration \nis now looking at that possibility. If the Federal Government moves to \ntake over this prison, it could create up to 3,000 jobs in the area, \ngood-paying jobs with benefit packages. It would be a dramatic infusion \ninto the local economy. In fact, it is estimated it would increase \ngrowth in the local economy by over $200 million a year, almost $1 \nbillion over 4 years.\n  There is nothing that could be brought more quickly to have that kind \nof positive impact on a local economy. Part of this is to transfer the \ndetainees from Guantanamo to this new prison and basically close \nGuantanamo. Guantanamo detainees cost the Government about $430,000 a \nyear per detainee. It is an extremely expensive facility, manned by the \nDepartment of Defense. Of course, we have to provide barracks and \naccommodations and creature comforts that we want our men and women in \nuniform to have at Guantanamo. Moving it to Thomson, IL, will \ndramatically reduce that cost.\n  There are those who resist this and do not want to see us move \nforward. I say they don't understand these detainees would be placed in \na portion of this Thomson facility run by the Department of Defense. \nThey would be in what is virtually the most secure prison in America \ntoday, where there has, incidentally, never been an escape from the \nsupermax facility since it was built. They would be housed in this \nsituation with no visitors. In military prisons, there is no \nrequirement for visitation, even though some critics have said \notherwise. They would not be released into the general population under \nany conditions because we have passed laws saying that will never \nhappen, prohibiting release of these detainees into America. The net \nresult is to create a dramatic number of new jobs.\n  Today we are going to consider amendment No. 2774 to the Military \nConstruction appropriations bill, offered by Senator Inhofe of \nOklahoma. It prohibits any funds in this bill from being used to \nconstruct or modify a facility to hold a detainee from Guantanamo. The \nObama administration strongly opposes this amendment, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join. This morning Senators Reid and McConnell received \na letter from Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Homeland Security \nSecretary Janet Napolitano, and Attorney General Eric Holder, \nexpressing strong opposition to the Inhofe amendment. It reads, in \npart:\n\n       Like the President and numerous others, both Republicans \n     and Democrats, we are convinced that closing the Guantanamo \n     Bay detention center is in the national security interests of \n     the United States. . . . We acknowledge that closing \n     Guantanamo has proven difficult, but that is not a reason for \n     the Congress to preclude this important national security \n     objective. . . . We need to get on with the work of enhancing \n     our national security by finally closing the Guantanamo \n     Bay detention center. The Inhofe amendment would have the \n     opposite effect and would likely prevent further progress \n     on this important issue. We ask that you join us in \n     opposing the Inhofe amendment.\n\n  Let me be clear. This amendment would not prevent Guantanamo \ndetainees from being transferred to the United States. Under current \nlaw, detainees can be transferred to the United States to be \nprosecuted. The Inhofe amendment does not change this. Here is what it \nwould do: It would prohibit the Obama administration from upgrading \nsecurity at any facility in the United States where Guantanamo \ndetainees would be held. That is unwise and unprecedented. It certainly \nis not in the best interests of homeland security in the United States.\n  Let's take a hypothetical situation. In fact, let's move beyond a \nhypothetical. Let's take a real-life example. Last Friday, Attorney \nGeneral Eric Holder announced five Guantanamo detainees who were \nallegedly involved in the 9/11 terrorist attack will be prosecuted in \nFederal court in the Southern District of New York. They include Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. I agree \nwith Michael Bloomberg, the Republican mayor of New York, who recently \nsaid:\n\n       I support the Obama Administration's decision to prosecute \n     9/11 terrorists here. It is fitting that 9/11 suspects face \n     justice near the World Trade Center where so many New Yorkers \n     were murdered. . . . I have great confidence that the [New \n     York Police Department], with federal authorities, will \n     handle security expertly.\n\n  Federal courts are clearly capable of prosecuting terrorists. Since \n9/11, we have successfully prosecuted 195 terrorists in our article III \nFederal courts. I strongly support the Attorney General's decision to \nprosecute these suspects in Federal court. But regardless of how one \nfeels about the issue, every Member of Congress should know what the \nInhofe amendment means. Under the Inhofe amendment, the government \ncould not spend any money to upgrade security facilities in New York \nCity to make certain any of these terrorist suspects are held safely. \nWe would be prohibited from spending money because Guantanamo detainees \nare involved. How much sense does that make? If there is the need to \nupgrade security so they can be tried in a safe environment with no \ndanger to the people of New York City, we want to spend that money, if \nnecessary. The Inhofe amendment stops us, precludes us from spending \nthat money. Why would the Senator from Oklahoma want to tie the \nPresident's hands?\n  In his zeal to keep open Guantanamo, he is trying to limit this \nadministration. I think that is a mistake. He believes--others do as \nwell--we should not close Guantanamo. I agree with GEN Colin Powell. He \nsaid: If I had my way, I wouldn't close Guantanamo tomorrow. I would \nclose it this afternoon. He knows, and we know, it has become a \ndangerous symbol to the world, a dangerous symbol being used by \nterrorist organizations to recruit more for their ranks. That is why \nGEN Colin Powell has called for the closure of Guantanamo. That is why \nit has also been called on to close by former President George W. Bush, \nwho on eight different occasions called for its closure. GEN David \nPetraeus has also called for its closure, as has ADM Mike Mullen, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as Robert Gates, \nSecretary of\n\n[[Page S11396]]\n\nDefense under Presidents Bush and Obama. I urge colleagues to oppose \nthe Inhofe amendment, give this administration the tools it needs to \nkeep America safe. Let us not second-guess them when it comes to safety \nand security for America's people. That is what the Inhofe amendment \nwould do. That, in and of itself, would be a serious mistake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/17/senate-section/article/S11396-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11396-S11397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, tomorrow, Chairman Tom Harkin will lead \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the markup of a \nfood safety bill, S. 510, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. I \nintroduced this bill with Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and a \nbroad coalition of Senators from both sides of the aisle. I thank those \nSenators--especially the late Senator Ted Kennedy, who joined as a \ncosponsor of the bill, and Senators Dodd, Burr, Isakson, Alexander, \nKlobuchar, and Chambliss--for joining me to fight for America's food \nsafety. Since we introduced this bill, a number of other Members have \nsigned on, including Senators Hatch, Gillibrand, Tom Udall, and Senator \nBurris. We are pleased to have their support. There is bipartisan \nsupport for the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act because food safety \nis not a partisan issue. The safety of our food supply affects \neverybody every day.\n  As we learned from recent events, eating unsafe food--whether it is \nspinach contaminated with E. coli, peanut butter laced with salmonella \nor melamine-spiked candy--can lead to serious illness and death. Every \nyear 76 million Americans suffer from preventable foodborne illness; \n325,000 are hospitalized each year and 5,000 will die. Every 5 minutes, \nthree people are rushed to the hospital because the food they ate made \nthem sick. At the end of each day, 13 will die. The tragedy of these \ndeaths is clear. We certainly recognize the anguish of loved ones who \nlose someone to food contamination. What is less understood are the \nlong-term consequences for those who do survive. Victims are affected \nfor months, sometimes years, after they leave the hospital.\n  Last week, the Center for Foodborne Illness, Research & Prevention \nreleased a report on the long-term health consequences of foodborne \nillness. The report shows it is often the lasting damage that causes \nmore pain and suffering than the immediate effects felt right after \neating contaminated food. That means that after the initial stomach \naches and diarrhea have run their course, many foodborne illness \nvictims will suffer from a lifetime of paralysis, kidney failure, \nseizures and mental disability and sometimes premature death. What is \nworse, children, pregnant women, and elderly Americans are among the \nmost vulnerable.\n  I wish to show you a photo of this lovely young girl. Her name is \nRylee. She knows the story of foodborne illness personally. On the \nmorning of her ninth birthday, Rylee learned her family would celebrate \nby taking a road trip to an aquarium. Rylee couldn't have been more \nexcited. Similar to many 9-year-olds, this cute little girl loved to \nsing and dance. On the morning of her birthday, she was doing both. \nBefore the end of the day, Rylee was rushed to the hospital, where she \nwas hospitalized for a month. Before she got to the aquarium, Rylee ate \na salad. What she didn't know was the salad contained spinach that was \nlaced with E. coli. The next day, Rylee had a stomach ache and severe \ndiarrhea.\n  Her condition continued to worsen. Days later she was in excruciating \npain. Her blood pressure was abnormally low. She was dehydrated, and \nher kidneys began to fail. As her parents watched in horror, Rylee \nbegan to hallucinate on the hospital bed. Rylee and her family were \nsuffering more pain than they ever thought imaginable--all because \nRylee had eaten a salad she thought was safe.\n  She escaped this incident with her life. But she, like millions of \nfoodborne illness victims, will endure health complications \nindefinitely. She will need multiple kidney transplants over the course \nof her life. She had to endure a painful surgery and challenging speech \ntherapy, so she can no longer sing or speak with a loud voice.\n  Rylee has not given up hope. She was recently walking the Halls of \nCongress advocating for food safety reform. I heard her share her story \nwith hundreds of parents, victims, and other supporters of the Make Our \nFood Safe Coalition.\n  Although her voice is now permanently softer and lower than it was \nbefore her illness, we heard Rylee's message loudly and clearly: All \nAmericans deserve food that is safe.\n  Mr. President, I would like to show you another photo I have in the \nChamber. This is a picture of Mary Ann of Mendota, IL. She is 80 years \nold. Mary Ann is pictured with her young grandson. I shared her story \nwith the HELP Committee just a few weeks ago.\n  Mary Ann was planning a big Labor Day family celebration, and she \ndecided to make a spinach salad. She used spinach which she did not \nknow was contaminated with E. coli.\n  Hours after eating the spinach, Mary Ann was sprawled across her \nbathroom floor--vomiting violently and experiencing uncontrollable \ndiarrhea. Then her kidneys failed.\n  Instead of spending time with her family on that holiday, she spent \nit in the hospital, staying there for 6 weeks, receiving medical \ntreatment intravenously. Thankfully, Mary Ann is alive, but the quality \nof her life is never going to be the same.\n  This country has a good system, and most of our food is safe. But \nthere are far too many lives--such as Mary Ann's and Rylee's--that have \nbeen compromised by the long-term effects of foodborne illness.\n  Parsing the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act is an important step \ntoward ensuring that the food we eat is safe and that we no longer hear \nthese heartbreaking stories. This act will finally provide the FDA with \nthe authority and resources it needs to prevent, detect, and respond to \nfood safety problems.\n  The bill will increase the frequency of inspection at all food \nfacilities, according to the risk they present. Because FDA does not \ncurrently have the resources or statutory mandate to inspect more \nfrequently, most facilities are only inspected by the FDA about once \nevery decade. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act will require high-\nrisk facilities to be inspected annually. Lower risk facilities would \nbe inspected every 4 years.\n  The bill gives the FDA long-overdue authority to conduct mandatory \nrecalls of contaminated food. Most people are stunned to know that the \nFederal Government does not have the authority to recall contaminated \nfood. This bill will change that when it is signed into law.\n  Most companies cooperate with the FDA's recall efforts, but we have \nto make sure those who hesitate and are uncooperative are called into \nline.\n  Some--such as the Peanut Corporation of America, which distributed \nthousands of pounds of peanuts and peanut paste contaminated with \nsalmonella--did not fully or quickly recall the food that was on the \nmarkets that made people sick. The food safety bill in HELP will change \nthat by ensuring that the FDA can compel a company to recall food.\n  Experts agree that individual businesses are in the best position to \nidentify and prevent food safety hazards. People who run these \nfacilities know where the vulnerabilities are on their assembly lines, \nand they know which hazards the food products they work with are most \nat risk for. That is why the bill asks each business to identify the \nfood safety hazards at each of its locations and then implement a plan \nthat addresses the hazards.\n  The bill gives FDA the authority to review and evaluate those food \nsafety hazard prevention plans and to hold companies accountable for \nnot complying with the requirements of the plan.\n  Finally, the bill gives the FDA the authority to prevent contaminated \nfood from other countries from entering the United States. Importers \nwill have to verify the safety of foreign suppliers and imported food \nso we know the food we are bringing into our country is safe. If a \nforeign facility refuses U.S. food safety inspections, the FDA will \nthen have the authority to deny entry to imports from that facility.\n  The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act employs these and other \ncommonsense approaches to help the FDA do its job of ensuring the food \nwe eat is safe. The bill is balanced, bipartisan, and it is supported \nby a broad coalition\n\n[[Page S11397]]\n\nof not just consumer advocates but the major business interests in food \nproduction and marketing.\n  I thank Chairman Tom Harkin of Iowa and Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming \nfor leading the markup of S. 510. I hope this bill will come to the \nSenate floor. I know my Republican colleagues who have joined me as \ncosponsors believe, as I do, this is a step in the right direction of \nensuring the food supply in America is even safer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, not long ago, eight Democratic Senators \nwrote to the majority leader and said what all 40 Republican Senators \nhave expressed and what most Americans--I think maybe 99 percent of \nAmericans--would say we need to do. They said: Before we proceed to a \nvote on the health care bill that is so much in discussion across this \ncountry today, that we, No. 1, have a complete legislative text; that \nwe, No. 2, have a complete estimate of its costs from the Congressional \nBudget Office; and, No. 3, it be on the Internet for 72 hours so the \nAmerican people can read it--read the text, know what it costs, have \ntime to consider both.\n  We are looking forward to that bill. What we know is, we have a \n2,000-page bill that has been passed by the House of Representatives \nnarrowly. The majority leader has had in his office a secret bill that \nhe is working on which we have not seen yet.\n  This morning, I would like to talk about one of the reasons it is \nimportant we be able to read the text, know what it costs, and know how \nit affects each American. We have talked a lot about how the bills we \nhave seen so far have the effect of raising insurance premiums, \nincreasing taxes, cutting Medicare, and increasing the Federal debt, \nwhen what we are supposed to be doing is reducing the cost of health \ncare for individuals and families and reducing the cost of health care \nto the government which is spiraling out of control in terms of deficit \nspending.\n  But all of that obscures an even more serious problem with the health \ncare bills we have seen so far; that is, the effect on the States. As a \nformer Governor of Tennessee, that is what I want to address for a few \nminutes this morning.\n\n  I picked up my newspaper in Nashville on Sunday morning, and here was \nthe headline: ``[Governor] Bredesen Faces Painful Choices as \n[Tennessee] Begins Budget Triage.'' ``Triage''--that is a sort of talk \nusually reserved for an emergency room.\n  I have said several times--and some people, I am sure, thought I was \nbeing facetious--that any Senator who votes to expand Medicaid and \ntransfer enormous costs to the States ought to be sentenced to go home \nand serve as Governor for 2 terms and try to implement the Medicaid \nProgram, which is bankrupting States and ruining public higher \neducation. I am not facetious when I say that because if we have a \nchance to read these bills and know what they cost, they have the \npotential to literally bankrupt States and ruin public higher \neducation.\n  But do not take my word for it. Here is the Nashville Tennessean and \nthe Knoxville News Sentinel writing about Governor Bredesen of \nTennessee. Knoxnews.com reports: ``relentless bad news.'' Now, \nTennessee is ``fiscally better off than many States.'' The ``shortfall \nis less severe than the Bredesen administration estimate[d].'' ``But \nthere is no quarrel,'' according to the State's largest newspapers, \nthat Tennessee's State government ``faces a grim situation''--``$750 \nmillion in cuts.'' Then things got worse because the money coming in \nthis year is less than was expected. The Governor ``has told his \ndepartment heads to present him with suggestions for budget cuts of 6 \npercent and to include contingency plans for adding another 3 \npercent.''\n  Those are real cuts. We talk about cuts in Washington. We talk about \nreducing the rate of growth. Those are not real cuts. In Tennessee and \nin California and in Illinois, and all across this country, cuts are \ncuts. You spend less this year than you did the year before.\n  ``Layoffs . . . are likely, the Governor says.'' ``This will be my \ntoughest budget year.''\n  Charles Sisk, writing in the Tennessean of November 16, says:\n\n       Tennessee might release as many as 4,000 non-violent \n     felons, possibly even including people convicted of drug \n     dealing and robbery, under a plan outlined Monday by the \n     Department of Correction to deal with the state's budget \n     crisis.\n\n  The National Governors Association, in an analysis last week, points \nout a combination of the economic downturn--the deepest since the Great \nDepression--and the increase in State Medicaid--now, this is not \nMedicare for seniors we are talking about; this is the largest program \nfor low-income Americans, 60 million Americans for which States pay \nabout one-third of that cost, which the health care plans we have seen \nintend to dump about 14 million more Americans into--spending for those \nprograms average 8 percent growth this year, while Governors such as \nGovernor Bredesen are making actual cuts. Well, you can imagine what \nthat is doing to other important State programs and tuition.\n  The Washington Post reported what the Office of the Actuary at the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services said over the weekend; which \nis, generally speaking, when we add more people to the Medicaid Program \nthe doctors and the hospitals who are expected to serve them will not \nbe willing to serve them. I will say more about that in a minute.\n  So how in the world, in the light of these conditions, could we even \nbe thinking about a provision in this health care bill that would add \ntens of billions of new costs to the States? We decide in Washington \nthat it is a great idea to expand health care, but we send the bill to \nthe Governors and the legislators who are in their worst fiscal \ncondition since the Great Depression.\n  That is called an unfunded mandate. If we think it is such a great \nidea to dump 14 million more Americans into a low-income program called \nMedicaid--for which 50 percent of doctors will not see new patients \nbecause they are so under-reimbursed--then we should pay for it somehow \nin the Federal budget instead of dumping the bill onto the States.\n  For Tennessee, the costs will be, according to Governor Bredesen, who \nis a Democrat and the cochairman of the National Governors Association \nhealth care caucus--he says this will cost our State $1.4 billion over \nthe next 5 years.\n  This is real money. How much money? Well, based on my experience as \nGovernor, I do not see how the State of Tennessee could afford to pay \nthat without instituting a new State income tax or without doing \nserious damage to higher education in Tennessee or both. And I believe \nit is true of every State in America. The majority leader thought it \nwas true of his State, so he fixed it for his State and three others, \nbut for just 5 years. Then what happens after the 5 years? Well, you \nput the bridge out on the chasm a little further and you fall off as \nfar or maybe farther than you already would.\n\n  Forty percent of physicians, according to a 2002 Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Committee survey, restrict access for Medicaid patients. So we \nare saying here we have a great health care reform bill and not only is \nit going to bankrupt States but it doesn't do any favors for a great \nmany low-income Americans, because we are putting them in a system \nwhere 40 percent of doctors won't see them freely, and 50 percent of \ndoctors won't see new Medicaid patients at all. In some States, the \nnumber of doctors who will see babies, who will see children, is as low \nas 20 or 30 or 40 percent. So as a way of partially dealing with that, \nthe House bill says, OK, States are going to be required to pay primary \ncare doctors who see Medicaid patients as much as Medicare doctors are \npaid. That adds another big new bill to the State, runs up\n\n[[Page S11398]]\n\nthe State taxes, runs up the college tuition payments when the States \nare unable to properly fund the colleges and the universities and the \ncommunity colleges. So my colleagues can see why this is so much \ntrouble: billions more for the Federal Government; billions more for \nthe States. Then it is like giving the low-income Americans who end up \nin this government program, which is expanding, a ticket to a bus line \nthat doesn't operate half the time, because half the doctors won't see \nnew Medicaid patients.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Add to all of that the idea of dumping 14 million more low-income \nAmericans into the Medicaid Program not only ruins States fiscally, \nhurts public higher education in the States, puts these patients in \nprograms that doctors won't see; it is a program where $1 out of $10 is \nwasted by fraud and abuse, according to the Government Accountability \nOffice.\n  Republicans suggest that instead of these comprehensive, sweeping, \n2,000-page bills that raise taxes, raise premiums, raise the debt, add \nto State taxes, hurt higher education because of what I described, and \nput low-income Americans into a program that half the doctors won't \nsee, we should move step by step to reduce costs. We should start with \nsmall business health plans that allow businesses to pool their \nresources and insure more people at a lower cost; allow purchasing of \nhealth insurance across State lines; reduce the number of junk lawsuits \nagainst doctors; create health insurance exchanges so more Americans \ncan shop for cheaper health insurance; and do something about waste, \nfraud, and abuse. If we were to take those steps, that would be real \nhealth care reform because it would be reducing costs to the American \npeople and to our government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the articles I referred \nto earlier be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From knoxnews.com, Nov. 15, 2009]\n\n                       News on State Budget Grim\n\n                           (By Tom Humphrey)\n\n       Nashville--Phil Bredesen, preparing the last state budget \n     he will present as Tennessee's governor, will begin on Monday \n     hearing recommendations from his most trusted advisers on how \n     to cut spending plans to account for relentless bad news.\n       Tennessee, according to a nationwide study released last \n     week, is fiscally better off, than many states. Further, \n     according to a legislative committee's staff calculations, \n     the current state revenue shortfall is less severe than the \n     Bredesen administration estimates.\n       But there is no quarrel with the general proposition that \n     Tennessee state government faces a grim situation.\n       The budget plan adopted in June and now in place for the \n     present fiscal year, which began July 1, includes the \n     anticipation that about $750 million in cuts will be needed \n     for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010--most of that \n     amount in reductions avoided this year by using federal \n     stimulus money.\n       And that was before things got worse. According to the \n     state Department of Finance and Administration, which is part \n     of Bredesen's administration, state tax collections are \n     already $101.3 million less than assumed when this year's \n     budget was enacted.\n       ``The stimulus has kind of concealed what's been going on \n     in terms of revenues,'' Bredesen said.\n       Overall, federal funding provides about $12.1 billion of \n     the $29.6 billion state budget this year. General state taxes \n     provide about $12.6 billion--the shrinking portion that funds \n     general state government--with the rest coming from earmarked \n     revenues such as college tuition and license fees.\n       The Legislature's Fiscal Review Committee staff has \n     calculated that the state revenue shortfall currently is just \n     $7.2 million below what it was projected back when the \n     current budget was presented to lawmakers. An explanation of \n     the differences gets pretty complex, including a committee \n     estimate that the state's tax take will decline more \n     dramatically in the next few months than does the Bredesen \n     administration's projection of a rebound.\n\n\n                            A very deep hole\n\n       But there is uniform agreement that the state's budget \n     picture is grim.\n       ``The state remains in a very deep hole that it is not \n     going to climb out of in this budget year,'' said Jim White, \n     executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee. ``That \n     hole is going to require very painful and drastic budget \n     reductions across much of state government. The only question \n     is how bad it will be.''\n       White says $290 million in cuts will be needed in addition \n     to the programmed $750 million in cuts.\n       Bredesen, accepting his staff calculations, has told his \n     department heads to present him with suggestions for budget \n     cuts of 6 percent and to include contingency plans for adding \n     another 3 percent in cuts if things go even worse than \n     expected. That process begins Monday with the Department of \n     Education.\n       The state funds public schools statewide through the Basic \n     Education Program. The governor and the Legislature avoided \n     cuts to the BEP for the current year.\n       Avoiding them again, Bredesen said, will be a priority. But \n     any increase in education funding, such as needed for making \n     more children eligible for pre-kindergarten programs, is \n     forgotten.\n       Another priority is honoring commitments to economic \n     development projects, Bredesen has said.\n       Keeping education and economic development commitments \n     whole, of course, requires deep cutting in other areas, such \n     as the Department of Children's Services or the Department of \n     Mental Health, which were aided by federal stimulus money \n     this year.\n\n\n                      Employee furloughs an option\n\n       Layoffs of state employees are likely, the governor says, \n     though he will look at alternatives such as furloughs.\n       ``This will be my toughest budget year,'' said Bredesen, \n     who will leave office in January 2011, after his successor is \n     elected next year. ``I hate to go out that way, but that's \n     the way it is.''\n       Bredesen has taken some partisan criticism for the budget \n     situation. Senate Republican leader Mark Norris, for example, \n     recently declared Bredesen should have made deeper cuts in \n     the current budget in accord with a GOP proposal that the \n     Democratic governor branded ``stupid'' during the legislative \n     session.\n       But Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey, a Republican who is seeking \n     his party's nomination for election as governor next year, \n     said he generally agrees with the Bredesen approach.\n       ``The governor is doing exactly as I'll do when I'm \n     governor,'' he told reporters last week.\n       ``It's going to be a tough budget year. The only upside is \n     that people realize we're in tough times and it's not going \n     to be easy.''\n       Tennessee is apparently in better shape, fiscally speaking, \n     than many other states.\n       In a rating of all 50 states' fiscal status last week, the \n     Pew Center for the States declared that there are 10 states \n     threatened with ``economic disaster,'' with California \n     leading the list. The rating assigned a score for each state, \n     with the higher scores indicating a more dangerous financial \n     situation.\n       California had a 30, and all the others in the top 10 \n     problem states had a score of 22 or greater.\n       Tennessee's score was 15, the same as North Carolina. Other \n     border states have lower scores, including Arkansas at 14 and \n     Virginia at 13, while others had higher scores, including \n     Kentucky at 21 and Mississippi at 20.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 15, 2009]\n\n                 Report: Bill Would Reduce Senior Care\n\n                          (By Lori Montgomery)\n\n       A plan to slash more than $500 billion from future Medicare \n     spending--one of the biggest sources of funding for President \n     Obama's proposed overhaul of the nation's health-care \n     system--would sharply reduce benefits for some senior \n     citizens and could jeopardize access to care for millions of \n     others, according to a government evaluation released \n     Saturday.\n       The report, requested by House Republicans, found that \n     Medicare cuts contained in the health package approved by the \n     House on Nov. 7 are likely to prove so costly to hospitals \n     and nursing homes that they could stop taking Medicare \n     altogether.\n       Congress could intervene to avoid such an outcome, but ``so \n     doing would likely result in significantly smaller actual \n     savings'' than is currently projected, according to the \n     analysis by the chief actuary for the agency that administers \n     Medicare and Medicaid. That would wipe out a big chunk of the \n     financing for the health-care reform package, which is \n     projected to cost $1.05 trillion over the next decade.\n       More generally, the report questions whether the country's \n     network of doctors and hospitals would be able to cope with \n     the effects of a reform package expected to add more than 30 \n     million people to the ranks of the insured, many of them \n     through Medicaid, the public health program for the poor.\n       In the face of greatly increased demand for services, \n     providers are likely to charge higher fees or take patients \n     with better-paying private insurance over Medicaid \n     recipients, ``exacerbating existing access problems'' in that \n     program, according to the report from Richard S. Foster of \n     the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n       Though the report does not attempt to quantify that impact, \n     Foster writes: ``It is reasonable to expect that a \n     significant portion of the increased demand for Medicaid \n     would not be realized.''\n       The report offers the clearest and most authoritative \n     assessment to date of the effect that Democratic health \n     reform proposals would have on Medicare and Medicaid, the \n     nation's largest public health programs. It analyzes the \n     House bill, but the Senate is also expected to rely on \n     hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare cuts to finance \n     the package that Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) hopes \n     to take to the floor this\n\n[[Page S11399]]\n\n     week. Like the House, the Senate is expected to propose \n     adding millions of people to Medicaid.\n       The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administers \n     the two health-care programs. Foster's office acts as an \n     independent technical adviser, serving both the \n     administration and Congress. In that sense, it is similar to \n     the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which also has \n     questioned the sustainability of proposed Medicare cuts.\n       In its most recent analysis of the House bill, the CBO \n     noted that Medicare spending per beneficiary would have to \n     grow at roughly half the rate it has over the past two \n     decades to meet the measure's savings targets, a dramatic \n     reduction that many budget and health policy experts consider \n     unrealistic.\n       ``This report confirms what virtually every independent \n     expert has been saying: [House] Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi's \n     health-care bill will increase costs, not decrease them,'' \n     said Rep, Dave Camp (Mich.), the senior Republican on the \n     House Ways and Means Committee. ``This is a stark warning to \n     every Republican, Democrat and independent worried about the \n     financial future of this nation.''\n       Democrats focused Saturday on the positive aspects of the \n     report, noting that Foster concludes that overall national \n     spending on health care would increase by a little more than \n     1 percent over the next decade, even though millions of \n     additional people would gain insurance. Out-of-pocket \n     spending would decline more than $200 billion by 2019, with \n     the government picking up much of that. The Medicare savings, \n     if they materialized, would extend the life of that program \n     by five years, meaning it would not begin to require cash \n     infusions until 2022.\n       ``The president has made it clear that health insurance \n     reform will protect and strengthen Medicare,'' said White \n     House spokeswoman Linda Douglass. ``And he has also made \n     clear that no guaranteed Medicare benefits will be cut.''\n       Republicans argued that the report forecasts an increase in \n     total health-care spending of more than $289 billion.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Knoxville News Sentinel, Nov. 15, 2009]\n\n       Bredesen Faces Painful Choices as TN Begins Budget Triage\n\n                           (By Tom Humphrey)\n\n       Phil Bredesen, preparing his last state budget as \n     Tennessee's governor, will begin on Monday hearing \n     recommendations from his most trusted advisers on how to cut \n     spending to account for relentless bad news.\n       Tennessee, according to a nationwide study released last \n     week, is fiscally better off than many states. Further, \n     according to a legislative committee's staff calculations, \n     the current state revenue shortfall is less severe than the \n     Bredesen administration estimates.\n       But there is no quarrel with the general proposition that \n     Tennessee state government faces a grim situation.\n       The budget plan adopted in June and now in place for the \n     present fiscal year, which began July 1, includes the \n     anticipation that about $750 million in cuts will be needed \n     for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010--most of that \n     amount in reductions avoided this year by using federal \n     stimulus money.\n       And that was before things got worse. According to the \n     state Department of Finance and Administration, which is part \n     of Bredesen's administration, state tax collections are \n     already $101.3 million less than assumed when this year's \n     budget was enacted.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Tennessean, Nov. 16, 2009]\n\n                State May Release Prisoners To Cut Costs\n\n                             (By Chas Sisk)\n\n       Tennessee might release as many as 4,000 non-violent \n     felons, possibly even including people convicted of drug \n     dealing or robbery, under a plan outlined Monday by the \n     Department of Correction to deal with the state's budget \n     crisis.\n       Correction Commissioner George Little said the department \n     would have no choice but to recommend early release of \n     inmates if it were to implement the budget cuts called for by \n     Gov. Phil Bredesen. The department has already squeezed out \n     savings and left more than 300 positions unfilled, and it is \n     relying heavily on federal stimulus funding in its current \n     budget, he said.\n       ``This isn't scare tactics,'' he said. ``We've got to make \n     ends meet. . . . We would not propose these sorts of very \n     serious and weighty options if we were not in such dire \n     circumstances.''\n       Bredesen, who does not have to submit his budget plan until \n     Feb. 1, did not commit to the plan.\n       ``If you were going to take that dramatic step, I would \n     only want to do it with the assurance that I got the budget \n     savings I would expect,'' Bredesen said.\n       The plan, which Little described on the first day of state \n     budget hearings, would involve releasing prisoners from local \n     jails, saving the department in per diem expenses.\n       To meet Bredesen's goal of cutting 6 percent, or $35 \n     million, from the Department of Correction's budget, as many \n     as 2,155 inmates held in local jails would need to be \n     released, Little said. Another 1,078 prisoners would need to \n     be released from the state's jails if Bredesen were to call \n     for an additional cut of 3 percent, as the governor has \n     indicated he might do.\n       Alternatively, the department could close one or two of the \n     state's 14 prisons, a move that would result in the release \n     of about 4,000 felons. Such a move would likely result in the \n     release of more dangerous criminals, but it would prevent \n     local sheriffs, judges and district attorneys from replacing \n     inmates who were released with other criminals.\n       In either scenario, the department would aim to release \n     inmates who had committed Class C, D or E property crimes. \n     Class C felonies include crimes such as drug dealing, bribery \n     and simple robbery and carry a sentence of three to 15 years. \n     Class D and Class E felonies are less serious crimes.\n       The state currently has about 19,700 in its prisons, but \n     the department already had plans to reduce that population to \n     18,500 inmates with the closure of the state prison in \n     Whiteville at the end of next year. Most of the budget for \n     that facility had come from the $48 million in federal \n     funding that the department is getting during the current \n     fiscal year--money that will largely disappear once the \n     stimulus program has run its course.\n       ``We've, frankly, exhausted all of our options other than, \n     frankly, prison population management,'' Little said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              The State Fiscal Situation: The Lost Decade\n\n       The fiscal condition of states deteriorated dramatically \n     over the last two years because of the depth and length of \n     the economic downturn, and state officials do not expect this \n     situation to improve any time soon. Previous downturns have \n     proven that the worst budget years for a state are the two \n     years after the national recession is declared over. States' \n     recoveries from the current recession, however, may be \n     prolonged with most economists projecting a slow and \n     potentially jobless national recovery. Moreover, even when \n     recovery begins, states will continue to struggle because \n     they will need to replenish retiree pension and health care \n     trust funds and finance maintenance, technology and \n     infrastructure investments that were deferred during the \n     crisis. They will also need to rebuild contingency or rainy \n     day funds. The bottom line is that states will not fully \n     recover from this recession until late in the next decade.\n       The Current Situation--The recent economic downturn started \n     in December 2007 and likely ended in August or September \n     2009, making it one of the deepest and longest since the \n     Great Depression. State revenues were down 4.0 percent in the \n     last quarter of calendar year 2008, and 11.7 and 16.6 percent \n     in the first two quarters of 2009, respectively. These \n     findings are consistent with the Fiscal Survey of States \n     estimate that state revenues declined 7.5 percent in fiscal \n     year (FY) 2009, which for most states ended June 30, 2009.\n       Revenues will likely continue down for another one or two \n     quarters before turning up slowly. This precipitous drop in \n     state revenues is consistent with past recessions in which \n     the trough in state revenue generally coincides with the peak \n     in unemployment. Most economists forecast that unemployment \n     will continue to increase for several months and possibly \n     into the first quarter of 2010.\n       Similarly, Medicaid spending, which is about 22 percent of \n     state budgets, averaged 7.9 percent growth in FY 2009, its \n     highest rate since the end of tile last downturn six years \n     ago. Medicaid enrollment is also spiking, with projected \n     growth of 6.6 percent in FY 2010 compared with 5.4 percent in \n     2009. The combination of falling revenues, which accompany \n     high unemployment,and an explosion in Medicaid enrollment, \n     which occurs very late in an economic downturn, explain why a \n     recession's greatest impact on state budgets occurs one to \n     two years after the downturn is over. States' budget problems \n     are reflected in the latest Fiscal Survey of States, which \n     shows states closed budget gaps of $72.7 billion in FY 2009 \n     and $113.1 billion in FY 2010. This includes tax and fee \n     increases of $23.8 billion in 2010. Even with cuts and tax \n     increases, states are experiencing new budget shortfalls \n     totaling $14.5 billion for 2010 and $21.9 billion for 2011. \n     Given projected revenue shortfalls, however, these shortfalls \n     will increase dramatically over the next several months.\n       The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)--Of the \n     $878 billion in ARRA funds, about $246 billion came to or \n     through states in more than 40 programs. Most importantly, \n     the $87 billion in Medicaid funds and the $48 billion in \n     state stabilization funds were flexible and allowed states to \n     offset planned budget cuts and tax increases. The Medicaid \n     funds allowed states to reprogram state funds that were \n     originally to fund Medicaid expansions, while the education \n     money was targeted for elementary, secondary and higher \n     education, which represents about one-third of state \n     spending. If Congress had not made these funds available, \n     state budget cuts and tax increases would have been much more \n     draconian and devastating to state governments, their \n     employees and citizens. Both the ARRA Medicaid and education \n     funds expire at the end of December 2010. States must plan \n     for the serious cliff in revenues they will face at that \n     time.\n       The Recovery Period--While there is still uncertainty \n     regarding the shape of the recovery, there seems to be a \n     growing consensus that it will be slow. Numerous studies \n     project that state revenues will likely not recover until \n     2014 or 2015. A recent forecast\n\n[[Page S11400]]\n\n     by Mark Zandi at Economy.com showed that the national \n     unemployment rate, which straddled 5.5 percent during the \n     2001-2007 period, will not attain that level again until \n     2014. Similarly Zandi's latest forecast indicated that state \n     revenues will not return to the 2008 level in real terms \n     until FY 2013. As mentioned above, until employment improves, \n     state revenues will continue to struggle. Work by the Nelson \n     A. Rockefeller Institute of Government similarly indicates \n     that per capita real revenues will not reach the 2007 level \n     until 2014. Making matters worse, economist Robert Kuttner \n     has indicated that the states' fiscal shortfalls will be \n     about $350 billion over the next several years.\n       Deferred Investments--Even when recovery begins in the \n     2014-2015 period, states will be faced with a huge ``over \n     hang'' in needs and will have to accelerate payments into \n     their retiree pension and health care trust funds, as well as \n     fund deferred maintenance and technology and infrastructure \n     investments. They will also have to rebuild contingency or \n     rainy day funds. All of these needs were postponed or \n     deferred during the 2009-2011 period and will have to be made \n     up toward the end of the decade. According to a 2007 Pew \n     Center on the States report, states have an outstanding \n     liability of about $2.73 trillion in employee retirement, \n     health and other benefits coming due over the next several \n     decades, of which more than $731 billion is unfunded.\n       The bottom line is that states will continue to struggle \n     over the next decade because of the combination of the length \n     and depth of this economic downturn and the projected slow \n     recovery. Even after states begin to see the light, they will \n     face the ``over-hang'' of unmet needs accumulated during the \n     downturn. The fact is that the biggest impact on states is \n     the one to two years after the recession is over. With states \n     having entered the recession in 2008, revenue shortfalls \n     persisting into 2014 and a need to backfill deferred \n     investments into core state functions, it will take states \n     nearly a decade to fully emerge from the current recession.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, thank you. I rise today to also speak \nabout health care. I will tell my colleagues when the Senator from \nTennessee was talking about Medicaid, we former Governors can relate to \nwhat he was saying. I had the opportunity, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, to be Governor of Nebraska for 6 years, and Medicaid was an \nenormous challenge. It is eating up State budgets. States are \nstruggling. My own State, which has done better than just about every \nother State in the country, is in special session today trying to \nfigure out how to find cuts of about $330 billion, which is a lot of \nmoney in our State. Plus, there are these tremendous access problems, \nhow to get people into Medicaid. So I wish to associate myself with his \ncomments.\n  I wish to speak today, if I could, about some townhall meetings I had \nback home in Nebraska this last week. As soon as we recessed, I headed \nhome. In about 48 hours we had four townhall meetings. Boy, if I were \nto give some advice, I would say whenever this bill comes out we should \ncall a recess for a week. We should all agree upon it in a bipartisan \nway, and we should go home, and we should listen to the people. I got \nso much good prairie wisdom, as I call it, from the folks back home. I \nwish to talk about that today.\n  One of the things I talked about as I was making my presentation is \nthe proposed Medicare cuts and the impact it has on Nebraskans, real \npeople. The impact on the current Nebraska health care delivery system \ncannot be denied. DISH hospitals we estimate today--and again we will \nsee the final bill and we will figure out what the exact numbers are--\nbut the estimate is there will be $142 million in cuts to those \nhospitals. Our nursing homes across the State that do such a great job \nwith our senior population estimate cuts of about $93.2 million. Home \nhealth is a program I have always respected and what they do. The idea \nis, if we can keep people in their home longer versus a nursing home, \nthat saves money. So I promoted it as a Governor and I promote it now. \nThey are projecting $126 million in cuts. By 2016, it is estimated that \n66 percent of Nebraska home health agencies will be operating in the \nred. Then, hospice estimates they will have a 12-percent payment \nreduction. That is a real impact on services because in our hospice \nsystems, oftentimes people are driving long distances to provide that \nservice. Then Medicare Advantage, which is a popular program back home, \nespecially with poor citizens in rural areas--about 35,000 Nebraskans \ncurrently have plans, and as my colleagues know, that has a big bull's-\neye on it for cuts. Some say that wasn't a very good program, but I \nwill tell my colleagues the people who have that program like it.\n  Citizens came to me and they shared concerns about access to care. \nThey shared concerns such as: Is this going to bring down the cost of \nhealth care? Those are promises that have been made as this health care \ndebate has unfolded. Our President has made those promises. Questions \nwere raised such as: How about Medicare? What impact will it have? Are \nthere going to be negative impacts? Today, as I did during the \ntownhalls, I wish to try to address these questions.\n  In fact, I wrapped up my townhalls on Friday in Lincoln, NE, and then \nthe experts over at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nactually answered these questions for us. On Saturday, the following \nday, the chief actuary of the Obama administration's CMS released a \nreport that analyzed the recently passed House legislation. Why is that \nimportant? It is important because the House has finished its work for \nnow and, ultimately, if the Senate were to pass a bill, it is the House \nbill and the Senate bill that will be conferenced. It concluded this: \nThere are decreases in access to health care services. Medicare \npayments to hospitals and nursing homes are reduced over time based on \ncertain productivity targets.\n  The idea is that by paying institutions less money, they will be \nforced to become more productive. I will tell my colleagues that in \nNebraska, if you have a critical access hospital in a rural area and it \nis serving 25 patients, today they are as productive as they can \npossibly get. If you have a nursing home in a small community and your \nidea as the Governor or as the family is that a loved one can stay \nclose to home, they are about as productive as they can get.\n  Congress could intervene and say, well, we are not going to make \nthose cuts in the years to come, but the actuary said, and I am \nquoting: ``So doing would likely result in significantly smaller actual \nsavings.''\n  So there we have it. We have experience in this area where every year \nCongress doesn't take the action, And it doesn't bend the cost curve, \naccording to this expert.\n  Earlier this year the President said--and I am quoting--that this \n``will slow the growth of health care costs for our families, our \nbusinesses, and our government.''\n  Yet CMS forecasts an actual increase in total health care spending of \nmore than $289 billion over the next 10 years. I am quoting here again \nfrom that report:\n\n       With the exception of the proposed reductions in Medicare \n     payment updates for institutional providers, the provisions \n     of H.R. 3962 would not have a significant impact on future \n     health care cost growth rates. In addition, the longer-term \n     viability of the Medicare update reductions is doubtful.\n\n  In other words, Health and Human Service experts don't believe it is \neven viable to make the kinds of cuts that are proposed long term. Even \nif Congress has the will to make the cuts, health care costs are going \nup, not down. Let me repeat this. This bill drives up the cost of \nhealth care, not down. Astounding, absolutely astounding.\n  It doesn't allow you to keep the plan if you like it. How many times \nwas that promise made? By 2014, Medicare Advantage enrollment would \ndrop 64 percent from 13.2 million to 4.7 million because benefits would \nbe cut. Every single advocacy group for senior citizens should be on \nthe phone today calling Senators to say, Don't go there. This hurts \nseniors. Also, insurance plans will have to be government approved. In \nour State, I saw an estimate that said 61 percent of our plans are not \ngoing to be in compliance and would have to be changed.\n  When it comes to health care, it is often suggested to get a second \nopinion. Well, I think here in the Senate we should follow this advice. \nBefore we perform major surgery, very high-risk surgery on the Nation's \nhealth care system--16 percent of our economy--we should get a second \nopinion. That is why I sent a letter to the majority leader last \nThursday and I asked for a CMS actuary to analyze the Senate bill \nbefore it is voted on so we can determine if the legislation bends the \ncost\n\n[[Page S11401]]\n\ncurve, and I am proud to report today that already I have 24 colleagues \njoining me in signing that letter. All we are doing is asking the \nmajority leader: Please get a second opinion before you perform this \nhigh-risk surgery on our health care system.\n  I will tell one last story from a townhall meeting that occurred in \nGrand Island, NE. This will be my last thought. A young man gets up and \nhe says this, and I am quoting:\n\n       What will you do to me and my generation, to me and my \n     child? Will you ransom my future for your own?\n\n  Our best intentions might end up destroying his American dream and \nthe dream of his child. This is high risk, what we are doing here. \nLet's get the best opinions we can before we act.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 9 minutes 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to say to my colleague from \nNebraska, former Governor and now Senator from that State, that I am \none of the signatories on the letter he has sent requesting we get cost \ndata before we move forward with this and what the impact is going to \nbe, because that is the issue.\n  I have listened to some of the discussion that has occurred on the \nfloor this morning. The Senator from Illinois was down here earlier, \nMr. Durbin, saying that the Republicans are attacking the House bill. \nWhy are they attacking the House bill? Why aren't they talking about \nthe Senate bill? Well, it is very simple. There is no Senate bill. It \nis being written behind closed doors. We have not been included in any \nof that. We have not been privy to any of the discussions that are \noccurring behind closed doors. So when we come down here and talk about \nhealth care reform, we are confined to talking about the House-passed \nbill because there isn't a Senate bill.\n  There are two Senate versions that have passed Senate committees. The \nFinance Committee has passed a bill. The Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee has passed a bill. But the merger of those bills is \noccurring behind closed doors in direct contradiction of what was \npromised earlier about health care reform. President Obama said when we \ndo health care reform, it is going to be an open, transparent process. \nThe American people are going to be able to observe this. In fact, it \nis going to be done on C-SPAN. Well, nothing could be further from the \ntruth, because it is all happening behind closed doors.\n  So when we come out here and talk about health care reform, we are \nleft with talking about a House bill because there is no Senate bill. \nWe are told that this week we are going to see it, and I hope that is \nthe case, because we would love to be able to react to the Senate bill \nand we would love to know what it is going to cost, and the American \npeople would love to know what it is going to cost. We would also love \nto have some time to look at it before we start voting on it in the \nSenate.\n  My understanding is this is going to be a compressed schedule. They \nare going to try to get a vote this week on a motion to proceed to this \nbill, and come back after Thanksgiving and try to rush this through the \nSenate before the Christmas holiday, a bill that represents one-sixth \nof the American economy. The House bill was 2,200 pages long and the \nRepublicans were allowed 1 amendment, 1 amendment in the House. I think \nwe are going to have to make sure, in the Senate, this gets done right. \nThat will take some time.\n\n  When the No Child Left Behind legislation was debated in the Senate, \nit took 7 weeks on the floor. We had a comprehensive energy bill a few \nyears ago that took 8 weeks on the floor of the Senate. The farm bill \nthat passed in the last session took 4 weeks on the floor of the \nSenate. We need to make sure this gets done in the right way for the \nAmerican people. We don't even have a bill yet. That is why we are down \nhere talking about the bills that were so far out there.\n  The Senator from Illinois also said the main concern the American \npeople have is cost--costs keep going up. I had a roundtable in my \nState, in Sioux Falls, last week. The Governor, Governor Rounds, \nparticipated, as did several small business owners, including a \nrestaurant owner, a retail pharmacy, a chain drugstore manager, and a \nsmall business owner who manufactures wood products.\n  They were all concerned about the same thing--costs. They said: How \nare we going to provide good coverage to our employees? What are we \ngoing to do if this massive expansion of the Federal Government--$3 \ntrillion, when it is fully implemented--passes and when all the costs \nare going to be passed on to business? How are we going to be able to \ncontinue to cover our employees? What will that mean for people in \nterms of coverage?\n  I agree with the Senator from Illinois, who said cost is the issue. \nThat is what I care about, and that is what the people in South Dakota \ncare about. How do we get the cost for health care and health care \ncoverage down?\n  The ironic thing we have seen about all these bills so far is none of \nthem does anything to get costs down. All of them increase costs. So \nthe so-called curve we talk about--bending the cost curve down--isn't \nhappening under any of these bills. We have not seen the Senate bill \nbecause it is still being written behind closed doors. The House-passed \nbill--the 2,200-page monstrosity that passed the House of \nRepresentatives earlier--and the Senate bills we have seen so far that \nhave been produced by committees all have the same basic \ncharacteristics about them. The first one is, they raise taxes \nsubstantially. They raise taxes--in a contradiction of promises made by \nthe President--on people making less than $200,000 and those making \nless than $100,000. In fact, because of the individual mandate in the \nHouse-passed bill, people making $22,800 a year and up to $68,400 a \nyear will see a huge tax increase that will hit them. Small businesses, \nbecause of the pay-or-play mandate, which under the House bill \nsupposedly raises $135 billion, are going to see their taxes go up. The \nhigh-income earners making $500,000 and above will see their taxes go \nup because there will be a surtax applied to the high-income earners.\n  The problem with that is, this doesn't just hit high-income earners, \nit hits small businesses because of the way they are organized, as \nsubchapter S corporations or LLCs, to file on their individual tax \nreturns. CBO has said one-third of the tax increases targeted at the \nso-called rich will hit small businesses, which are the job creators in \nour economy, the engine of economic recovery in America. They say \nthree-quarters to two-thirds of our jobs are created by small \nbusinesses. We are going to raise taxes on them. In fact, the highest \nmarginal income tax rate, if this passes, next year, with the \nexpiration of tax cuts that were enacted in 2001 and 2003, will go from \n35 percent to 46.4 percent. That is the highest marginal income tax \nrate we have seen in 25 years. It is going to hit squarely small \nbusinesses that we are relying on to try to get us out of this \nrecession and create jobs. This health care reform is all financed with \nhigher taxes, with Medicare cuts.\n  I talked about the characteristics consistent with regard to all \nthese proposals: You have higher taxes, and you have Medicare cuts to \nthe tune of one-half trillion dollars a year, which, as my colleagues \nalready pointed out this morning, are going to hit not only providers \nbut also seniors. Medicare Advantage Program seniors will see benefits \ncut. So you have the individuals impacted, the providers impacted, and, \nof course, you have most Americans impacted in one way or another by \nthe tax increases.\n  The final point is the most important; that is, the other \ncharacteristics these plans have in common, in addition to higher taxes \nand Medicare cuts, are higher health care costs and higher premiums. \nThe CMS actuary came out last week with a report describing the House-\npassed bill, and it says it is going to increase the cost of health \ncare in this country by $289 billion. We spend 17 percent of our GDP on \nhealth care today. Under that bill, it would go up to 21.1 percent, if \nwe did nothing. We would be better off in terms of the costs that will \nbe passed on to people in the form of higher health care expenses. It \nsaid we are going to see increased costs and that we are going to\n\n[[Page S11402]]\n\nsee, the chief actuary concluded, 12 million people lose their \nemployer-sponsored coverage because small employers would be inclined \nto terminate coverage so workers would qualify for heavy subsidies \nthrough the exchange.\n  The biggest number of people who will be covered will be those who \nare pushed into Medicaid, which, under this proposal, does expand \nsignificantly. The problem with that is, it passes on enormous costs to \nthe States. You heard the former Governor of Nebraska and the former \nGovernor of Tennessee talk about that. My Governor, Governor Rounds, in \nSouth Dakota, said we are going to be faced with $134 million in \nincreased costs to the States to pay for this because Medicare is a \npartnership between the States and the Federal Government. So any \nbenefit we get--about 60 percent of the people who will get coverage \nbecause of the bill will get it through Medicaid at an enormous \nadditional cost to the States, which will be passed on to the taxpayers \nin the individual States.\n  So you will have higher taxes on small businesses, higher taxes on \nindividuals, and you will have Medicare cuts that will impact seniors \nand providers. The amazing thing about all this is you are going to \nhave higher health care costs when it is all said and done. It is \nremarkable that anything could be called health care reform that raises \ncosts the way these proposals would do.\n  Finally, in response to what the other side has said, which is that \nRepublicans don't have alternatives, that is wrong again. Republicans \nhave proposed step-by-step solutions that would do this right, so it \nwould drive down the costs, such as interstate competition, allowing \npeople to buy insurance across State lines; small business group health \nplans, which would give businesses the advantage of group purchasing \npower, tort reform. We have a range of things we hope we have an \nopportunity to get to. We have to defeat this $3 trillion monstrosity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, during the course of the day today--and I \nfeel I can do this since it is my birthday--I had five different \nsubjects I wish to cover. I will make one comment about the talk just \ngiven--the eloquent speech just given by the Senator from South Dakota.\n  I think the thing that surprises most people is, we will have \nmeetings and people will say: Wait a minute, you don't even know what \nis in the Senate bill being written up behind closed doors. The \ncomments we are making--most of them--refer to the bill passed in the \nHouse. The reason for that is, that is the only thing we have to talk \nabout.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized until such time as we \nmove on, and I understand that is 11:20.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/17/senate-section/article/S11402-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, right after the conference luncheon, we are \ngoing to have my amendment having to do with Gitmo. This is a very \nsimple one-page amendment that states that none of the funds \nappropriated, or otherwise made available by this act--on MILCON--or \nany prior act may be used to construct or modify a facility or \nfacilities in the United States or its territories, to permanently or \ntemporarily hold any individual who is detained as of October 1 of 2009 \nat Gitmo.\n  You might wonder, we have been talking about this, and I have \nactually had pass two amendments that do almost the same thing. We \npassed an amendment to the 2007 resolution 94 to 3--a bipartisan \namendment to the war supplemental offered by me and Senator Inouye from \nHawaii. It passed 90 to 6 in the current Senate Defense appropriations \nbill. It is in conference. My concern is, in conference, it may be \nremoved. Keep in mind, we sent this language to conference once before, \nand it came back and merely said that if the President announces a plan \nof what to do with those individuals who are incarcerated at Gitmo, we \nwould have 45 days to discuss that. It doesn't say we have to agree \nwith the plan he gives.\n  Consequently, there are no teeth in that. This may be our only \nchance. This is an issue that has always passed by over 90 votes. So I \nwill have that amendment. I hope people will understand the whole \ncountry was upset when they found out on Friday the 13th--and that was \nkind of an interesting day for this--when Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, as \nannounced by the President, was going to be tried in New York City, and \nthey were going to move five terrorists into the New York City area. I \nwill not debate this thing. It has been worn out in the press.\n  People realize that if we are going to bring these terrorists to the \nUnited States, they will become targets for terrorist activities. \nBesides that, you cannot try someone under our court system who should \nbe tried under a tribunal. The rules of evidence are different, and we \nhave a perfect place for that down in Gitmo. Again, I will be offering \nthat amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/17/senate-section/article/S11402-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PRESIDENTIAL TRIP TO CHINA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the President's trip \nto China. It appears evident--which we have known all along--that we \nare not going to be passing anything in this country on cap and trade. \nWe have the bill that is up right now by Senators Kerry and Boxer, who \nhave talked about this now for 8 years. Every time they talk about it, \nthere is more and more opposition to it. Right now, the interesting \nthing is that the most recent polling shows that only 4 percent of the \nAmerican people think this is a problem. Four percent are wrong and the \n96 percent are right.\n  Nonetheless, in China, keep in mind, their output of CO2 \nemissions could amount to twice the combined emissions of the world's \nrichest nations, including the United States, the European Union, and \nJapan. Consequently, the problem there is China, India, Mexico, and the \ndeveloping countries. We all know nothing will pass this body that \ndoesn't treat the developing countries as developed nations.\n  I will not dwell on this. At a later time, I will. I plan to make a \nvery long--well over an hour--talk. I am trying to get some time now to \ndo that. This will be the fifth time I have done this in the last 6 \nyears concerning this particular subject, which is the alleged global \nwarming attached to the CO2 emissions.\n  I will say this: As far as what is going on right now in China, the \nChinese are not going to line up and agree, in Copenhagen or anyplace, \nto start reducing their own emissions. Frankly, they are the ones who \nare the big beneficiaries. This is kind of interesting, because even if \nwe did it and the developed nations did it, it still wouldn't have any \nmaterial reduction in CO2. Even if you believed \nCO2 or anthropogenic gases caused global warming or climate \nchange, it is still not going to work, as Tom Quigley said it would \nback when Senator Gore--Vice President Gore at that time--tried to do a \nstudy to determine what wonderful things would happen if we joined the \nKyoto treaty. The question was, to his own scientists: If all nations, \nall developed nations, including the United States, the European Union, \nand all of them, were to sign the Kyoto treaty and live by its emission \nrequirements, how much would it reduce the temperature? Tom Quigley, a \nrenowned scientist, came out with this report and said it would reduce \nit by less than seven one-hundredths of 1 degree Celsius by 2050. So \nall of the pain, all of the taxes, the largest tax increase in the \nhistory of America, and it does not reduce anything. Consequently, I \ndon't think it is necessary to belabor that. China is not going to do \nit, no matter what the President does on his trip to China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/17/senate-section/article/S11402-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11402-S11403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HAMILTON NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. As I am rounding third and heading home, I am concerned \nthat we are going to be voting this afternoon on the nomination of \nDavid Hamilton to be a judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. I \nthink Hamilton is, without question, a liberal activist judge. He \nbelieves judges do not simply interpret the Constitution of the United \nStates but that judges have the power to actually change the \nConstitution when deciding cases, stating that--this is his quote, Mr. \nPresident--``part of our job here as judges is to\n\n[[Page S11403]]\n\nwrite a series of footnotes to the Constitution.'' This is exactly what \nour Founding Fathers did not want us to do. Judges are supposed to \ninterpret what we do in this Chamber.\n  When he was nominated to the district court in 1994, the American Bar \nAssociation rated him as not qualified. I voted against him for a \nnumber of reasons back in 1994. I don't very often agree with Vice \nPresident Biden, but I have to say this. Vice President Biden made a \nstatement some time ago with which I do agree. That is, if you are in \nthe Senate and you have a judge who is coming up for confirmation by \nthe Senate, and if you oppose that judge when he comes up to be a \nFederal judge, then later on when he wants to become a circuit judge or \neven a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, if you opposed him at a lower \nposition, you have to oppose him at the next position because the bar \nnecessarily goes up. For that reason and many other reasons, I will be \nopposing him.\n  I think it is important that in 2003, in A Woman's Choice v. Newman, \nHamilton issued an injunction against an Indiana law that required \nabortion clinics to give women information about alternatives to \nabortions in the presence of a physician, nurse, or somebody else--just \nto have that information. This is inconceivable to me this could \nhappen.\n  Let's keep in mind also this is the same judge who had a ruling--\nperhaps the most infamous because of his 2005 decision while presiding \nover the case of Hinrichs v. Bosma in which he enjoined the Speaker of \nIndiana's House of Representatives from permitting sectarian prayers to \nbe offered as a part of that body's official proceedings, meaning that \nthe chaplain or whoever opened the proceedings with a prayer could not \ninvoke the name of Jesus Christ in his prayer.\n  In his conclusion, Hamilton wrote:\n\n       If the Speaker chooses to continue any form of legislative \n     prayer, he should advise persons offering such a prayer (a) \n     that it must be nonsectarian and must not be used to \n     proselytize or advance any one faith over another. This is \n     the first time and only time I believe this has happened in a \n     nomination. This will be coming up for confirmation. I hope \n     all of America will be aware of the fact this is happening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/17/senate-section/article/S11403-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 UGANDA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I understand my colleagues are getting \nvery close. I want a couple more minutes and that is to mention \nsomething that is happening today in the Foreign Relations Committee. \nSenator Feingold has an amendment with which I wholeheartedly agree. It \nis actually not an amendment. It is a bill having to do with the LRA. \nLet me explain quickly what that is.\n  The LRA, the Lord's Resistance Army, has for about 25 years, led by a \nguy named Joseph Kony in the northern part of Uganda, been mutilating \nkids. We have heard of the Child's Army. They go into the villages and \nkidnap these kids, take them out, teach them how to be warriors, and \nonce they join up, they send them back to the village to murder their \nown parents, their own family.\n  This has been going on for a long period of time. This bill is \nsomething about which I am very excited. Finally, we have the attention \nof the people in the United States, and that is to join in and go after \nthis animal named Joseph Kony.\n  In the last 18 years, the LRA has captured over 20,000 kids. I have \nbeen to northern Uganda. I have been up Guru. I have watched these kids \nafter they have been dismembered, after they cut their lips off, cut \ntheir ears off, and all of this.\n  When this bill first came out, I was opposed to it because Senator \nFeingold had to pay for this bill with a reduction in some of the funds \nthat would otherwise go to the U.S. Air Force. That has been taken out. \nSo I join him now in saying this is something that has to take place. \nThis is the first time we have actually had the opportunity to bring up \nthis issue, to let it surface.\n  I personally talked with President Museveni in Uganda, President \nKagame of Rwanda, and President of the eastern part of Congo. I have \nbeen to Goma where Joseph Kony has kidnaped these kids, murdered these \nkids, mutilated these kids. I can tell from personal experience this is \nsomething we need to get involved in, and we are doing it by virtue of \nthis bill.\n  I have gone 1 minute past. I apologize to the managers of the bill. I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/17/senate-section/article/S11403-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to report that we are \ngetting into the home stretch for the MILCON-VA appropriations bill. We \nhave been on this bill 6 days now--I believe a record for the MILCON/VA \nbill. I thank my ranking member, Senator Hutchison, for her help in \nclearing amendments last evening which has put us within striking \ndistance of completing this bill today.\n  The first amendment we are scheduled to vote on today is an amendment \nI have offered that will provide $50 million for the VA to renovate and \nuse empty buildings sitting on VA medical campuses to provide housing \nwith supportive services for our homeless vets.\n  The VA Secretary and the President have made eliminating homelessness \namong vets a top priority. The amendment is fully offset by redirecting \n$50 million over the President's budget request provided in this bill \nfor DOD's Homeowners Assistance Program which the Pentagon has \ndetermined is not currently required.\n  This amendment is supported by 16 vets and homeless service \norganizations, including the VFW, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and \nIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have letters in support of my amendment \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                November 13, 2009.\n     Senator Tim Johnson,\n     Chairman, Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military \n         Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Senator Johnson: As organizations working to end \n     homelessness among veterans in America, we are writing to \n     express our strong support and gratitude for your Amendment \n     (SA 2733) to the Fiscal Year 2010 Military Construction, \n     Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The \n     amendment would shift $50 million to renovate and convert \n     Department of Veterans\n\n[[Page S11404]]\n\n     Affairs' buildings into housing with supportive services for \n     homeless veterans. We believe this proposed allocation is \n     greatly needed, will be well spent, and ultimately will help \n     save the lives of many brave veterans who have fallen upon \n     hard times.\n       Far too many veterans are homeless in America: \n     approximately 131,000 on any given night, which represents \n     between one-fourth and one-fifth of all homeless people. \n     Convergent sources estimate that between 23 and 40 percent of \n     homeless adults are veterans. The U.S. Department of Veterans \n     Affairs estimates that over the course of the year, 336,627 \n     veterans experience homelessness.\n       Community organizations around the country are eager to \n     assist homeless veterans achieve stability, but a shortage of \n     capital, operating and supportive services funding restricts \n     the amount of good work they can do. The allocation provided \n     in your amendment will help provide critical capital funding \n     for housing homeless veterans on VA campuses. We also commend \n     the Committee's proposed funding for the HUD-VASH program, \n     the Grant and Per Diem program and for homeless prevention. \n     Combined, these investments will allow the Department to \n     increase its efforts to ensure every veteran has a safe place \n     to sleep and call home.\n       We are heartened by the Administration's stated commitment \n     to zero tolerance for veterans' homelessness and strong \n     Congressional support for programs that will help accomplish \n     this goal. While the funding allocated by your amendment is \n     an important contribution to fight against homelessness, we \n     encourage your leadership in doing even more to provide safe \n     and affordable housing for all the men and women who wore the \n     uniform.\n           Sincerely,\n       Corporation for Supportive Housing.\n       AMVETS.\n       Common Ground.\n       Disabled American Veterans.\n       Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.\n       Jewish War Veterans of the USA.\n       National Alliance to End Homelessness.\n       National Association of Black Veterans.\n       National Coalition for Homeless Veterans.\n       National Health Care for the Homeless Council.\n       National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty.\n       National Leased Housing Association.\n       National Policy and Advocacy Council on Homelessness.\n       Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n       Vietnam Veterans of America.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 13, 2009.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Johnson: On behalf of the 2.2 million \n     members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States \n     and our Auxiliaries, I would like to offer our support for SA \n     2733, the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related \n     Appropriations Act.\n       Your important amendment would provide $50,000,000 to VA \n     for the construction of housing with supportive services for \n     homeless veterans. This construction would take unused VA \n     buildings and convert them into housing for our homeless \n     veterans.\n       Your important amendment provides housing and supportive \n     services, two crucial things that our homeless veterans \n     desperately need. A man or woman who has selflessly served in \n     the armed forces should never have to sleep on the streets of \n     the country they fought for. Your legislation looks to \n     address this tragedy in our country and we applaud your \n     efforts.\n       We thank you for introducing this valuable legislation that \n     would greatly assist our nation's heroes. We look forward to \n     working with you to help pass this legislation into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Eric A. Hilleman,\n                           Director, National Legislative Service.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, according to the VA, there are 131,000 \nhomeless vets on any given night. This is shameful. This amendment will \nallow the VA to put to good use buildings on VHA campuses currently \nsitting empty. It would allow private and nonprivate groups to operate \nhomeless vet shelters in close proximity to the medical and mental \nhealth services these vets need in order to rebuild their lives.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield to Senator Hutchison for any remarks she has.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Johnson.\n  We have worked very well to accommodate the requests of our \ncolleagues to the extent we could. We will have the first vote on his \namendment. I am going to support Senator Johnson's amendment on \nhomeless veterans. Secretary Gates and Secretary Shinseki are at this \nvery moment practically working on a way to better accommodate veterans \nwho are homeless. It is not right for there ever to be a homeless \nveteran in our country because every one of them has done so much to \nprotect our freedom.\n  We do have $500 million in the bill. This would take $50 million that \nthe Department says they do not need for other housing assistance for \nveterans and put it into the homeless sector so there can be a \nconcerted effort to build facilities that would give care, as well as \nshelter, to these veterans. I support that.\n  I hope in conference we will be able to consolidate all of this into \na program that will meet the needs of our veterans.\n  It has been great working on this bill. I am very pleased we could do \nit today rather than last week when so many of us in the Senate were at \nFort Hood trying to show the great respect and sympathy for the \ncommunity at Fort Hood and for all of our armed services, which meant \nwe had to delay the bill from last Tuesday to this Tuesday. I think \nthat was the right thing to do. I thank my colleague.\n  I thank our great staffs who worked all this week to clear \namendments. To the extent we could, I think we have certainly \naccommodated our other colleagues in the Senate for their priorities.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \nsequence prior to the caucus recess period, with respect to amendments \nremaining in order to H.R. 3082, be as follows: Johnson amendment No. \n2733; Feingold amendment No. 2748; Cochran amendment No. 2763; that the \nInouye amendment No. 2754 be modified with changes at the desk, and \nonce modified, the McCain amendment No. 2776 be withdrawn, the Inouye \namendment, as modified, be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; further, that an Inouye-Levin colloquy be inserted \nin the Record upon the adoption of the amendment; that after the first \nvote in any sequence of votes today, the remaining votes be 10 minutes \nin duration; and that prior to the vote on passage of H.R. 3082, each \nmanager control 2 minutes; provided further, that the other provisions \nof the November 16 order remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to ask the Senator if we could \nvoice vote Senator Cochran before we take up the record vote we will \ntake on Senator Johnson's amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. That would be very good.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. With that qualification, without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2754), as modified, is as follows:\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2754, As Modified\n\n       On page 27, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       Sec. 128. (a)(1) The amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this title under the heading ``Military \n     Construction, Defense-Wide'' is hereby increased by \n     $68,500,000, with the amount of such increase to remain \n     available until September 30, 2014.\n       (2) Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this title under the heading ``Military Construction, \n     Defense-Wide'', as increased by paragraph (1), $68,500,000 \n     shall be available for the construction of an Aegis Ashore \n     Test Facility at the Pacific Missile Range Facility, Hawaii.\n       (b) Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by title I of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \n     Appropriations Act, 2009 (division E of Public Law 110-329; \n     122 Stat. 3692) under the heading ``Military Construction, \n     Defense-Wide'' and available for the purpose of European \n     Ballistic Missile Defense program construction, $69,500,000 \n     is hereby rescinded.\n\n  The amendment (No. 2754), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                        European Missile Defense\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with \nSenator Levin, chairman of the Armed Services Committee to discuss \namendment No. 2754, which has been cosponsored by Senators Johnson and \nCochran, to reallocate unobligated fiscal year 2009 military \nconstruction funding to support President Obama's new European missile \ndefense plan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be pleased to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n\n[[Page S11405]]\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the chairman. Funding was appropriated in last \nyear's MILCON/VA appropriations bill for the European missile defense \nsites but now can no longer be spent. This amendment will enable the \nMissile Defense Agency to meet the President's timelines for defending \nEurope and the United States sooner against Iranian missiles. In order \nto meet the timelines set out by the President to deploy a capability \nin Europe in the 2015 timeframe, General O'Reilly, Director of the \nMissile Defense Agency, MDA, has requested the Congress support the use \nof $68.5 million to construct an AEGIS Ashore Test Facility at the \nPacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii. The funding would come from \nthe now unneeded funds for the two sites in Europe.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want the chairman to know that I am also fully \nsupportive of the administration's new approach to defending Europe \nfrom the threat of shorter range Iranian missiles based on the standard \nmissile-3 both on ships and ashore, as well as the use of fiscal year \n2009 funding that is no longer required for this purpose.\n  Mr. INOUYE. This amendment responds to that request from MDA, but was \noriginally offered with some reservation because it would circumvent \nthe normal order of business in the Senate. Under ordinary \ncircumstances this project should have been authorized in the fiscal \nyear 2010 National Defense Authorization Act and then appropriated in \nthe Military Construction bill. But, President Obama only publicly \nannounced his European missile defense strategy on September 17 of this \nyear. This announcement came well after the House and Senate Armed \nServices Committees began the conference negotiation process. In order \nto implement the President's new plan, General O'Reilly made the \nrequest to Congress for an AEGIS Ashore Test Facility on October 7, the \nsame day that the House and Senate completed the conference agreement \non the Defense authorization bill. The conferees were not able to \nconsider this late request from the administration. Thus, an amendment \non the fiscal year 2010 Military Construction appropriations bill was \nthe best path to get the facility started in order to meet the \nadministration's timelines.\n  Mr. LEVIN. While I agree that the funding previously authorized and \nappropriated for the European sites in fiscal year 2009 should be the \nsource of funding for this project, I also feel that the project should \nbe vetted in a manner similar to any other MILCON request. I believe we \nalso have the time to authorize the project. As I understand the \ncurrent timeline the Missile Defense Agency has sufficient planning and \ndesign funding to initiate design of the project and also has \nsufficient funding to begin the required environmental work. It is also \nmy understanding that construction won't actually begin until late \nsummer of 2010. I would expect that the preliminary nature of the \ncurrent funding request would mature in time to support a timely \nauthorization.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I understand that the chairman intends to introduce a \nseparate authorization bill for this project that will precede the \nnormal fiscal year 2011 national Defense authorization bill process.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct. I will introduce a separate bill today \nalong with Senator McCain. The committee will expedite consideration of \nthis bill provided that we can get the normal assurances that the \nproject is supported by the Secretary of Defense and that the proposed \nconstruction costs and timelines are accurate and up to the standards \nwe would normally expect in a similar MILCON project request.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2763 to Amendment No. 2730\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I understand there is no objection to the \nCochran amendment No. 2763. Therefore, on behalf of Senator Cochran, I \ncall up his amendment and ask that the amendment be considered and \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson], for Mr. \n     Cochran, proposes an amendment numbered 2763 to amendment No. \n     2730.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2763\n\n     (Purpose: To provide for the modification of a restriction of \n     alienation of certain real property in Gulfport, Mississippi)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n       Sec. 229.

Without objection, the amendment is agreed to \nand the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.\n  The amendment (No. 2763) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2733\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, I note that the second vote has been \nvoiced, and so Members are free to leave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we are working on the managers' \npackage, and probably in the next 15 minutes we will clear what has \nbeen cleared for the managers' package. There are a couple of people \nworking with objections.

The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  The Inhofe amendment would actually make us less secure by \nrestricting our ability to improve security at facilities that house \ndetainees who have been transferred from Guantanamo to the United \nStates for their trials. Our communities will be less safe because \nmoney cannot be spent to make more secure the places where these \ndetainees are being kept. It seems to me this is kind of a ``cutting \noff your nose to spite your face'' approach. Regardless of how people \nvoted on whether we should have trials in the United States, the \ndecision has been made that there are going to be trials in the United \nStates. There already have been trials in the United States. There are \ndetainees who are awaiting trial in the United States. It would seem to \nme it is in everybody's interest that the places where these detainees \nare being kept should be as secure as possible. It makes no sense, \nregardless of what one's position is on the question of where the trial \nshould be held, not to have them kept in the most secure possible \nfacilities.\n  I hope the Inhofe amendment is defeated. It is counterproductive, no \nmatter what position one takes on the location of trials.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the amendment sponsored by Senator Inhofe \nis one of a series of amendments that have recently been offered in the \nSenate that would put political interests ahead of our national \ninterests. This amendment would prohibit any funds from being used to \nconstruct or modify any facility in the United States to hold any \nindividual who is currently being held at the Guantanamo Bay detention \nfacility.\n  This goal of this amendment is to ensure that the detainees being \nheld at Guantanamo Bay, some for years without charge, cannot be tried \nin our Federal courts and that the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay \ncannot close. This is harmful to our national security and devastating \nto our reputation as a model justice system throughout the world. As a \nformer prosecutor, I find it deeply troubling that the Senate would be \nasked to prohibit the administration from trying even dangerous \nterrorists in our Federal courts. As a Senator, I find it shameful that \nCongress is being asked to help keep open a facility that has been a \nstain on our reputation throughout the world and has given ammunition \nto our enemies. GEN Colin Powell was correct when he said, ``Guantanamo \nhas become a major problem for America's perception as it's seen; the \nway the world perceives America.''\n  President Obama addressed that problem in the first days of his \nPresidency by announcing that he would close Guantanamo Bay, and he has \naffirmed that commitment by announcing that the administration will \nhave a preference for trying detainees in our proven Federal courts. \nJust last week, the Attorney General announced that, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Government will begin to move \ntoward federal criminal trials against five of these detainees, \nincluding Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. I have supported President Obama and \nthe Attorney General in these steps, and I will continue to do so. That \nis why I have voted against amendments that would withhold funding to \nclose the Guantanamo detention facility and prohibit any Guantanamo \ndetainees from being brought to the United States. These amendments \nundermine the good work the President is doing, and they make us less \nsafe, not safer.\n  Two weeks ago, the Senate defeated another amendment that would have \nrestricted the authority and the options of our military and law \nenforcement. Secretary Gates and Attorney General Holder sent us a \njoint letter opposing that amendment. They reminded us that we should \nnot prohibit the Government from being able to ``use every lawful \ninstrument of national power . . . to ensure that terrorists are \nbrought to justice and can no longer threaten American lives.'' That is \nexactly what this amendment would do by tying the administration's \nhands in the event that they need to upgrade any facility in order to \nsecurely house these detainees. I will ask that a copy of the \nadministration's letter be printed in the Record.\n  Again, this week, joined by Secretary Napolitano, Attorney General \nHolder and Secretary Gates wrote to the Senate in opposition, this time \nto the Inhofe amendment we consider today. I will ask that the \nadministration's letter be printed in the Record.\n  Instead of closing Guantanamo and moving toward a lawful and \neffective national security policy, this amendment would say to the \nworld that we refuse to face what we did at Guantanamo and instead \nwould continue the legacy of a place that was created in an effort to \nlock people up for years without charge and not face the consequences. \nThis amendment would say to the world that we are not strong enough, \nthat our over 200-year-old superior legal tradition is not flexible \nenough, to allow us to deal with those who attack us. Refusing to close \nGuantanamo also means we lose our ability to respond with moral \nauthority if other countries should mistreat American soldiers or \ncivilians.\n  Much debate has focused on keeping Guantanamo detainees out of the \nUnited States. In this debate, political rhetoric has entirely drowned \nout reason and reality. Our criminal justice system handles extremely \ndangerous criminals, and more than a few terrorists, and it does so \nsafely and effectively. We try very dangerous people in our courts and \nhold very dangerous people in our jails throughout the country. I know; \nI put some of them there. We do it every day in ways that keep the \nAmerican people safe and secure, and I have absolute confidence that we \ncan do it for even the most dangerous terrorism suspects.\n  The facts speak for themselves. The Judiciary Committee has held \nseveral hearings on the issue of how to best handle detainees, and \nexperts and judges from across the political spectrum have agreed that \nour courts and our criminal justice system can handle this challenge \nand indeed has handled it many times already. Since January of this \nyear alone over 30 terrorism cases have been either successfully tried \nor sentenced using our Federal courts. No one has ever escaped from a \nSupermax facility. In fact terrorists are routinely and securely held \nat our prisons, including Zacharias Moussaoi, one of the plotters \nbehind the September 11 attacks and Ramzi Yousef, the World Trade \nCenter bomber.\n  Why would the Senate pass an amendment that suggests that our country \nand the brave men and women who staff these prisons cannot handle these \nprisoners, or that they are not up to the task? And why would we pass \nan amendment that simultaneously makes it harder for the government to \nsecurely detain terrorism suspects in our prisons by making any \nnecessary adjustments to hold them? This amendment would ironically\n\n[[Page S11408]]\n\nmake us less safe by making our prisons less secure. This is playing \ngames with national security.\n  It is not only President Obama who believes that closing Guantanamo \nwill make us a more secure and honorable nation. I agree with the \nconviction expressed by Senator Graham and Senator McCain who said, \n``[w]e support President Obama's decision to close the prison at \nGuantanamo, reaffirm America's adherence to the Geneva Conventions, and \nbegin a process that will, we hope, lead to the resolution of all cases \nof Guantanamo detainees.''\n  It is time to act on our principles and our constitutional system. It \nis time to close Guantanamo and try and convict those who seek to do us \nharm. Where the administration decides to try them in Federal courts, \nour courts and our prisons are more than up to the task.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of the administration's letter to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 30, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We write to oppose the \n     amendment proposed by Senator Graham (on behalf of himself \n     and Senators McCain and Lieberman) to H.R. 2847, the \n     Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act of 2010. This amendment would prohibit the \n     use of Department of Justice funds ``to commence or continue \n     the prosecution in an Article III court of the United States \n     of an individual suspected of planning, authorizing, \n     organizing, committing, or aiding the attacks on the United \n     States and its citizens that occurred on September 11, \n     2001.''\n       As you know, both the Department of Justice (in Article III \n     courts) and the Department of Defense (in military \n     commissions, reformed under the 2010 National Defense \n     Authorization Act) have responsibility for prosecuting \n     alleged terrorists. Pursuant to a joint prosecution protocol, \n     our departments are currently engaged in a careful case-by-\n     case evaluation of the cases of Guantanamo detainees who have \n     been referred for possible prosecution, to determine whether \n     they should be prosecuted in an Article III court or by \n     military commission. We are confident that the forum \n     selection decisions that are made pursuant to this process \n     will best serve our national security interests.\n       We believe that it would be unwise, and would set a \n     dangerous precedent, for Congress to restrict the discretion \n     of either department to fund particular prosecutions. The \n     exercise of prosecutorial discretion has always been and \n     should remain an Executive Branch function. We must be in a \n     position to use every lawful instrument of national power--\n     including both courts and military commissions--to ensure \n     that terrorists are brought to justice and can no longer \n     threaten American lives.\n       For these reasons, we respectfully request that you oppose \n     this amendment.\n     Robert M. Gates,\n       Secretary of Defense.\n     Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n       Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                November 17, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We write to oppose \n     Senator Inhofe's amendment (No. 2774) to H.R. 3082, the \n     Military Construction, Department of Veterans Affairs, and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010. \n     This amendment would prohibit the use of funds appropriated \n     or otherwise made available in H.R. 3082 to ``construct or \n     modify a facility or facilities in the United States or its \n     territories to permanently or temporarily hold any individual \n     who was detained as of October 1, 2009, at Naval Station, \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.''\n       Like the President and numerous others, both Republicans \n     and Democrats, we are convinced that closing the Guantanamo \n     Bay detention center is in the national security interests of \n     the United States. Al Qaeda has repeatedly used the existence \n     of the facility as a recruitment tool. We are convinced that \n     as long as the Guantanamo Bay detention center remains open, \n     our enemies will continue to exploit its existence for this \n     purpose.\n       We acknowledge that closing Guantanamo has proven \n     difficult, but that is not a reason for the Congress to \n     preclude this important national security objective. At \n     present, we are making progress toward this goal. An \n     interagency team is assessing the suitability of a maximum \n     security prison in Thomson, Illinois, to serve as a detention \n     center for certain Guantanamo Bay detainees who may be \n     transferred to the United States. On Friday, the Department \n     of Justice announced that it will prosecute the alleged 9/11 \n     conspirators in federal court, while the Department of \n     Defense will resume other cases against those allegedly \n     responsible for the USS Cole bombing and other acts of \n     terrorism in military commissions, which have been reformed \n     as a result of the bipartisan passage of the Military \n     Commissions Act of 2009.\n       We need to get on with the work of enhancing our national \n     security by finally closing the Guantanamo Bay detention \n     center. The Inhofe amendment would have the opposite effect \n     and would likely prevent further progress on this important \n     issue. We ask that you join us in opposing the Inhofe \n     amendment.\n     Eric H. Holder, Jr.\n     Robert M. Gates.\n     Janet Napolitano.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nOklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, inquiry. Is this the final argument before \nthe vote on the Inhofe amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes; the Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this amendment has been here three times \nbefore. In fact, this amendment has been supported with over 90 votes \neach time it came through. Unfortunately, once one of the bills went \ninto conference, it was taken out. They replaced it with a 45-day \nprovision.\n  What this does--it is a one-sentence amendment, very easy to \nunderstand. It says:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be used to construct or modify a facility or \n     facilities in the United States [to house terrorists].\n\n  If you want terrorists here, then vote against this amendment. This \nmay be the last shot you have at it. We have the Inouye-Inhofe \namendment already passed in the Defense authorization bill, but it is \nin conference. We do not know whether it will come out. This is the \nsecond shot we have to try to keep terrorists from coming into the \nUnited States.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nVirginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to speak quickly in opposition \nto this amendment.\n  It has been my strong belief--\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Is the Senator from Virginia speaking on the 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes of the majority?\n  Mr. WEBB. That is correct. It has been my strong belief that \nindividuals who were charged with international terrorism should be \nclassified as enemy combatants, and I stated many times I do not \nbelieve they belong in our country. They don't belong in our courts. \nThey don't belong in our prisons. At the same time, I recognize that \nthe President retains the constitutional authority to bring charges \nagainst these individuals in article III courts. The Graham amendment \ndid resolve that issue in terms of their transfer to U.S. soil.\n  This amendment, unfortunately, would not address that issue. It \nprohibits appropriation of funds to modify facilities in the United \nStates in order to hold such individuals. I believe that would prevent \nlaw enforcement officials from taking the steps that are necessary to \nimprove security in our local communities and that it would put our \nsecurity at risk. It is for this reason I oppose the amendment and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 9 minutes 30 seconds \nremaining, the majority has about 25 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me repeat. We have voted on this amendment before. We \nvoted three different times. This was actually structured as the \nInouye-Inhofe amendment once and the Inhofe-Inouye amendment once. It \nhas passed overwhelmingly. This is the only way we can see that we can \nassure we are not going to have those individuals who are now at Gitmo \nin the United States. I think we have discussed this several times. I \nstrongly support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 56 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to speak in favor of the \namendment. I do not think these prisoners from Guantanamo Bay should be \nin our country. I think we should stand firm, we should stand clear \nthat this Senate, as we have voted before, does not want prisoners from \nGuantanamo Bay transferred to American soil. It will be a security risk \nto America. We do not need\n\n[[Page S11409]]\n\nto do it. This would be a way to stop this and do what is right for our \ncountry; that is, keep these prisoners where they are secure, away from \nany ability to harm America. I urge a vote for the Inhofe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 23 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Neither the Senator from Oklahoma nor the Senator from \nTexas has addressed the amendment before us. This is not an amendment \nabout transferring from Guantanamo to the United States. It is about \nwhether we will spend the money to make sure, when these detainees are \nunder trial in the United States, which they can be legally, they will \nbe held safely. The Inhofe amendment precludes the expenditure of funds \nto improve the security of law enforcement facilities to contain these \nGuantanamo detainees.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if we don't want to house those \nprisoners here, we should not try them here. That is the answer for \nthis. Vote for the Inhofe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I move to table the amendment. I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 57, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 347 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Pryor\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted against the amendment offered by \nSenator Inhofe, No. 2774. It is time for Congress to allow the \nadministration to work toward the goal that so many of us support: \nclosing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay once and for all. The \nadministration has provided its plan to Congress, and has provided \nindividualized reports on each detainee before any transfer occurs. \nWhile closing Guantanamo may not be easy, it is vital to our national \nsecurity that we close this prison, which is a recruiting tool for our \nenemies. In particular, I oppose this amendment because it would \nprohibit the executive branch from spending money to upgrade security \nat U.S. detention facilities where Guantanamo detainees might be held, \nthereby making the American people less safe.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2743\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to speak to amendment No. 2743 which \nwould reallocate $750,000 from the general operating expense account to \nfund programs to end veterans' homelessness, including the Department \nof Veterans Affairs' Homeless Provider Grant and Per Diem Program, and \nVA's Supportive Services Grants Program.\n  This money will help more than 131,000 veterans who are homeless on \nany given night including the estimated 1,659 homeless veterans in my \nhome state. Many veterans are considered homeless or at risk due to \ntheir poverty, lack of support systems, and poor living conditions.\n  Homeless veterans are comprised of middle-age and elderly veterans, \nas well as younger veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The VA \nhas identified 1,500 homeless veterans who fought during the current \nwars and of those, only 400 have participated in programs specifically \ntargeting homelessness.\n  Sadly, homelessness among the ranks of recently separated combat \nveterans is not a new phenomenon, and their plight for the Nation's \ncompassionate assistance is just as strong today as it was centuries \nago. According to Todd DePastino, a historian at Penn State, homeless \nveterans of the post-Civil War era sang old Army songs to dramatize \ntheir need for work.\n  After World War I, thousands of veterans marched and camped in the \nNation's Capital to express their frustration over bonus money. Many of \nthese veterans were either homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.\n  After the Vietnam war, returning veterans were faced with serious \nphysical, mental, and socio-economic problems that put them at serious \nrisk of becoming homeless. According to VA the number of homeless male \nand female Vietnam era veterans is greater than the number of \nservicemembers who died during the Vietnam war.\n  It is important that Congress and VA remember the lessons learned \nfrom previous wars. We must work together to prevent homelessness \nbefore it begins with the goal of eliminating homelessness. Much \nprogress has been made, but we can do better.\n  My amendment targets two specific areas within VA's medical care \nbudget for more funding. The Homeless Provider Grant and Per Diem \nProgram offers funding to community agencies that provide services to \nhomeless veterans. The purpose of the program is to promote the \ndevelopment and provision of supportive housing and/or supportive \nservices with the goal of helping veterans achieve and maintain \nresidential stability.\n  The supportive services programs allow veterans who are at risk or \nwho are reentering the workforce to receive services that will reduce \ntheir likelihood of becoming homeless. Supportive services include \nhealth care services; daily living services, personal financial \nplanning; transportation services; income support services; fiduciary \nand representative payee services; legal services; child care; housing \ncounseling; and other services necessary for maintaining independent \nliving.\n  In short, these programs are comprehensive and they work.\n  My original intention was to offer an amendment that would reallocate \n$43,387,240, on top of the money in this amendment, for homeless \nprograms. Ten years ago that money was originally appropriated for the \nMultifamily Transitional Housing Loan Guarantee Program. Since that \nprogram has been suspended, I believe this money could be put to a \nbetter use. However, the Congressional Budget Office tells me that \nrescinding the $43 million and spending it on this bill would run afoul \nof our budget rules. I will therefore look for another opportunity to \nput this unused money to a better use in the near future. In the \nmeantime, CBO has informed me that the amendment is compliant. I thank \nmy colleagues for their support of my amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so pleased that today the Senate will \npass the fiscal year 2010 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Act. This legislation provides \n$133.9 billion in critical funding to ensure that our Nation's veterans \nhave the care and services that they have earned and deserve. \nSpecifically, it includes for the first time advance appropriations for \nveterans medical services--ensuring that the Department of Veterans \nAffairs receives funds in a timely and predictable manner. It also \nprovides $45 billion for veterans' health care, including $4.6 billion \nfor mental health treatment and programs.\n  In addition, the bill includes $23.2 billion for military \nconstruction and family housing, including $9.9 million to replace the \n144th Squadron's current operations facilities at Fresno-Yosemite \nInternational Air National Guard Base. The squadron currently operates \nacross several outdated facilities that are not sufficient for modern \nday operations. The facility will ultimately be\n\n[[Page S11410]]\n\nused to house F-15C Eagle aircraft squadron operations. F-15Cs are \nexpected to arrive at the base in 2012 to replace the aging F-16C \nfleet. The 144th Fighter Wing provides air defense for California from \nOregon to the Mexican border and is vital to the Nation's security.\n  The Senate voted on a number of amendments to this bill that have \nimportant consequences and I want to provide some additional \ninformation on two of my votes.\n  Last night, the Senate rejected a motion to send this bill back to \nthe Appropriations Committee. I joined 68 of my colleagues in voting \nagainst this motion because I believe that this is a strong, bipartisan \nbill. By sending this bill back to committee, we would be unfairly \nasking our Nation's veterans to wait even longer for care. The men and \nwomen who have served our country so honorably should not be forced to \nwait for critical services.\n  And today, the Senate voted to reject an amendment that would \nprohibit the use of funds in this bill to build or make security \nimprovements to a facility in the United States to hold a detainee who \nis transferred here from Guantanamo Bay. What it would have done is \nprevent the administration from making vital security improvements to \nour detention facilities. Ensuring that detention facilities have the \nhighest possible security is critical to our national security and this \namendment would have restricted that ability unnecessarily.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, this Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs Appropriations Act for 2010 rightfully prioritizes the health \ncare of the Nation's wounded warriors by substantially increasing \ndiscretionary health care spending for fiscal year 2010. This bill \nincludes a $45.1 billion appropriation for the Veterans Health \nAdministration that will enable VA to treat an estimated 6.1 million \npatients in 2010, including $533 million to support the enrollment of \n266,000 nondisabled, modest-income veterans. This funding furthers the \nAdministration's goal of enrolling more than 500,000 of these \npreviously ineligible veterans by 2013. In addition to enrolling more \nveterans of modest means, this bill provides for $440 million to \nimprove the health of rural veterans.\n  The 2010 Milcon-VA Appropriations Act includes a total of $34.7 \nbillion for medical services, $4.8 billion for construction, and $580 \nmillion for medical and prosthetic research. Total discretionary \nspending will be increased over $3.9 billion above the fiscal year 2009 \nenacted level.\n  I am delighted that for the first time VA will receive advance \nappropriations--an additional $48.2 billion in for fiscal year 2011--\nfor three VA medical care accounts. This coincides with the landmark \nlegislation, Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of \n2009, which was signed into law as Public Law 111-81 by the President \non October 22, 2009. Funding VA health care in advance will go a long \nway toward rectifying the chronic underfunding of VA health care, which \nhas left so many of the Nation's veterans with unmet health care needs.\n  This bill fully funds VA's research programs. The $580 million \nappropriation for VHA research represents a $70 million increase from \nthe fiscal year 2009 enacted level and an amount equal to the budget \nrequest. Through these funds, VA will be able to pursue targeted \nresearch goals like developing better prosthetic devices for the \nyounger veterans returning from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. VA can \ncontinue research into conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder, \ntraumatic brain injury, and gulf war Illness. In addition, VA can \ncontinue to recruit and retain quality health care providers, as over \nthree-quarters of VA's researchers also provide direct patient care.\n  I am pleased that this bill contains an amendment I offered that will \nextend VA's authority to operate the Manila VA Regional Office.\n  Earlier this year, over 60 years after the end of the World War II, \nsurviving Filipino World War II veterans finally received a measure of \ncompensation for their service in the form of a one-time lump sum \npayment. These past months have demonstrated that dispersing these \npayments has been an enormous challenge, with multiple steps to \nauthenticate the service of these World War II veterans.\n  Unfortunately, VA's authority to operate the Manila VA Regional \nOffice will expire on December 31, 2009. There remains much work to be \ndone in order to continue processing claims and ensuring these veterans \nare awarded benefits they have waited six long decades to receive. For \nthis and other purposes, the operational authority of the Manila \nRegional Office must be extended.\n  The Manila Regional Office currently administers compensation, \npension, vocational rehabilitation and employment, and education \nbenefits to over 18,000 beneficiaries. In addition, VA also administers \nSocial Security in the Philippines. Keeping this facility fully \nfunctioning is necessary for these deserving individuals to receive \ncritical veterans' benefits as well to carry out an integral part of \nthe U.S. mission to the Republic of the Philippines.\n  I extend my deepest thanks to the staff of the Manila Regional Office \nwho have continued to demonstrate unwavering dedication to their duty \nto assist Filipino World War II veterans and indeed all veterans who \napply for benefits from VA.\n  Finally, I mention Senator Burr's amendment, included in the \nunderlying bill, that would directly support efforts to address \nhomelessness among our Nation's veterans. His provisions, of which I am \na cosponsor, are offset by funds currently allocated for administrative \ncosts for an existing homeless program that is essentially defunct--the \nMultifamily Transitional Housing Loan Guarantee Program.\n  I will be working with Senator Burr in the future to ensure that the \nunspent money for this program--$43 million--can be used for more \nactive homeless programs, such as the Grant and Per Diem Program.\n  In closing, I thank Senators Johnson and Hutchison, the chair and \nranking member of the Subcommittee on Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs; Senators Inouye and Cochran, the chair and ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee; and their staffs for their hard \nwork in putting this bill together and for working to incorporate \nimportant veterans-related provisions in the package. Additionally, I \nthank the Members who filed VA-related amendments who worked with the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee to come to agreement on issues that could \nbe addressed in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The substitute, as \namended, is agreed to.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendments and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate insists \non its amendment, requests a conference with the House, and the Chair \nappoints the following conferees.\n  The Presiding Officer appointed Mr. Johnson, Mr. Inouye, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Byrd, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. \nPryor, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Brownback, Mr. McConnell, Ms. \nCollins, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. Cochran.\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues for their \nhelp in getting this bill completed. It was a long and slow process, \nbut I am thankful we were able to dispose of a majority of the \namendments that were offered.\n  This is a good bill. It is truly a bipartisan bill and contains some \ngood programs that will help out military men and women and our \nNation's vets. The bill provides investments in infrastructure for our \nmilitary, including barracks and family housing, training and \noperational facilities, and childcare and family support centers. In \naddition, it fulfills the Nation's promise to our vets by providing the \nresources needed for the medical care and benefits that our vets have \nearned through their service.\n  As I have mentioned, for the first time the bill contains advance \nfunding for vets' medical care for fiscal year 2011. This funding will \nensure that the VA has a predictable stream of funding and that medical \nservices will not be adversely affected should another stopgap funding \nmeasure be needed in the future.\n  I wish to thank my ranking member, Senator Hutchison, for her work on \nthis bill. She was critical in getting the amendments cleared on her \nside of the aisle. I wish to thank her staff, Dennis Balkham and Ben \nHammond, for their hard work. I also wish to thank the majority staff, \nChad Schulken and Andy Vanlandingham, for their hard work on this \nimportant bill. I would especially like to thank the subcommittee \nclerk, Christina Evans, for her hard work and leadership on this \nsubcommittee.\n  I also wish to acknowledge the hard work of the floor staff and the \ncloakroom staffs. Thank you, Dave and Lula, for helping us get to this \npoint.\n  Mr. President, let me again thank my colleagues. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HAMILTON TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR \n                      THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of David F. \nHamilton, of Indiana, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Seventh \nCircuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 60 \nminutes of debate divided between the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, \nand the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking our colleague, \nChairman Leahy, for his leadership in this area. He has been a model of \ndecorum and patience, and I am personally grateful for his leadership.\n  My father, as my colleagues may recall, served for 18 years on the \nJudiciary Committee. I lack his patience and therefore never have, but \nI admire very much Senator Leahy and those who help shepherd these \njudicial nominations, which, unfortunately, are all too frequently \nunnecessarily contentious.\n  Secondly, I note the presence--I am sure he will be speaking \nshortly--of our colleague, Senator Sessions. Although Senator Sessions \nand I have a disagreement over this nomination, we have worked well in \nmany areas, and I look forward to collaborating with him in the future \nin those many areas where we do find ourselves in agreement.\n  Today, I find myself in agreement with my friend and colleague from \nmy home State of Indiana, Senator Lugar, who yesterday on this floor \nissued a compelling statement in support of the nomination of David \nHamilton for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. For all those \nMembers of this body or those viewing us from afar who have questions \nabout Judge Hamilton, I strongly recommend they read Senator Lugar's \nvery eloquent statement in his behalf. He went through every suggested \ncontroversy point by point, debunking those who raised concerns about \nJudge Hamilton, and ended up by noting his 40 years of acquaintance \nwith both the nominee and his family and his strong support for Judge \nHamilton's nomination.\n  I rise today to speak in favor of the nomination of Judge David \nHamilton. I join with Senator Lugar to recommend Judge Hamilton because \nI know firsthand that he is a highly capable lawyer who understands the \nlimited role of the Federal judiciary.\n  In recent days, some of Judge Hamilton's critics have unfairly \ncharacterized his record and even suggested that his nomination should \nbe filibustered. I rise today to set the record straight and hope my \ncolleagues will join Senator Lugar and me in supporting this superbly \nqualified nominee.\n  Before I speak to Judge Hamilton's qualifications, I wish to briefly \ncomment on the state of the judicial confirmation process generally. In \nmy view, this process has too often become consumed by ideological \nconflict and partisan acrimony. I believe this is not how the Framers \nintended us to exercise our responsibility to advise and consent.\n  During the last Congress, I was proud to work with Senator Lugar to \nrecommend Judge John Tinder as a bipartisan, consensus nominee for the \nSeventh Circuit. Judge Tinder was nominated by President Bush and \nunanimously confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 93 to 0.\n  It was my fervent hope Judge Tinder's confirmation would serve as an \nexample of what could happen when two Senators from different parties \nwork together to recommend qualified, nonideological jurists to the \nFederal bench.\n  I know President Obama agrees with this approach. His decision to \nmake Judge Hamilton his first judicial nominee was proof that he wanted \nto change the tone and follow the ``Hoosier approach'' of working \nacross party lines to select consensus nominees.\n  On the merits, Judge Hamilton is an accomplished jurist who is well \nqualified to be elevated to the appellate bench. He has served with \ndistinction as a U.S. district judge for over 15 years, presiding over \napproximately 8,000 cases. He is now the chief judge of the Southern \nDistrict of Indiana, where he has been widely praised for his effective \nleadership. Throughout his career, Judge Hamilton has demonstrated the \nhighest ethical standards and a firm commitment to applying our \ncountry's laws fairly and faithfully.\n  In recommending Judge Hamilton, I have the benefit of being able to \nspeak from personal experience, because he was my legal counsel when I \nhad the privilege of serving as Indiana's Governor.\n  If you ask Hoosiers about my 8 years as Governor, you will find \nwidespread agreement that we charted a moderate, practical, and \nbipartisan course. As my\n\n[[Page S11412]]\n\ncounsel, David Hamilton helped me craft bipartisan solutions to some of \nthe most pressing problems facing our State.\n  He helped resolve several major lawsuits that threatened our State's \nfinancial condition. He wrote a tough new ethics policy to ensure that \nour State government was operating openly and honestly.\n  In addition to his insightful legal analysis, I could always count on \nDavid Hamilton for his sound judgment and the commonsense Hoosier \nvalues he learned growing up in southern Indiana. Like most Hoosiers, \nDavid Hamilton is not an ideologue.\n  During his service in State government, he also developed a deep \nappreciation for the separation of powers and the appropriate role of \nthe different branches of government. If confirmed, he will bring to \nthe seventh circuit a unique understanding of the important role of the \nStates in our Federal system and will be ever mindful of the \nappropriate role of the Federal judiciary. He understands the \nappropriate role for a judge is to interpret our laws, not to write \nthem.\n  Despite Judge Hamilton's long record as a thoughtful, nonideological \njurist, his critics have sought to portray him as an ``activist'' judge \nhostile to religion. I have no doubt these attacks come as a surprise \nto his father, the Reverend Richard Hamilton, who is the former pastor \nof St. Luke's United Methodist Church in Indianapolis.\n  It is only in the upside-down, bipartisan world of Washington, DC, \nthat the humble son of an Indiana pastor can be turned into a partisan \nzealot hostile to religion, which David Hamilton is not. To my mind, \nsuch outrageous attacks say more about the sad status of our judicial \nconfirmation process than they do about Judge Hamilton.\n  Some of Judge Hamilton's critics have even suggested his nomination \nreaches the level of ``extraordinary circumstances'' justifying a \nfilibuster. This is a nominee jointly recommended to the President by a \nmoderate Democrat and the Senate's senior Republican. If this \nnomination constitutes ``extraordinary circumstances,'' then that \nphrase has ceased to have any meaning whatsoever. I sincerely hope that \nall involved will agree to give Judge Hamilton the up-or-down vote he \nso clearly deserves. If not, I fear that filibusters will become \nroutine regarding judicial nominees. That is not the way our Framers \nintended us to operate, nor the way that we should.\n  On a personal note, I have known Judge David Hamilton for over 20 \nyears. I know him to be a devoted husband to his wife Inge, and a \nloving father to his two daughters, Janet and Devney. He is the nephew \nof former Congressman Lee Hamilton, a man whose integrity is beyond \nreproach.\n  As someone who personally knows and trusts Judge Hamilton, I say to \nmy colleagues he is the embodiment of good judicial temperament, \nintellect, and evenhandedness. If confirmed, he will be a superb \naddition to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Lugar in supporting this \nextremely well-qualified and deserving nominee.\n  Before I end, let me say a couple of additional things. David \nHamilton has been subjected to a number of unfounded attacks, probably \nthe most ludicrous of which is that he is anti-religion in general and \nhostile to Jesus Christ in particular. His father was a 40-year \nMethodist pastor. David Hamilton was baptized and married by his \nfather. Before he served as a Federal district court judge, he placed \nhis hand upon the Bible--the Old and New Testament alike--and pledged \nloyalty to our Nation and devotion to our laws. He is not hostile to \nreligion or to Jesus Christ. That charge is unfounded.\n  Likewise, it has been suggested that he is, in some way, soft on \ncrime. A particular case has been cited involving child pornography. I \nfind this to be ironic since he sentenced the accused to the maximum \nsentence allowed by law--the maximum sentence allowed by law, not 1 day \nless. Judge Hamilton has had the responsibility of handing down 700 \ncriminal sentences in his time on the bench. The Justice Department has \nappealed two--a mere fraction of 1 percent. Judge Hamilton is not soft \non crime.\n  Finally, it has been suggested that Judge Hamilton is a judicial \nactivist. A case in our State involving abortion rights has been cited \nin that regard. I find that to be ironic, as well, because the \npresident of the Indiana Federalist Society, an organization not known \nfor embracing activist judges, strongly endorsed Judge Hamilton's \nnomination, saying:\n\n       I regard Judge Hamilton as an excellent jurist with a \n     first-rate intellect. He is unfailingly polite to lawyers and \n     asks tough questions to both sides, and he is very smart--to \n     the left of center, but well within the mainstream.\n\n  That is the position of Geoffrey Slaughter, president of the Indiana \nFederalist Society.\n  I find this set of circumstances to be most unfortunate. David \nHamilton is superbly qualified. I think this is, more than anything \nelse, a comment on the sad state of our judicial nominating process, \nwhere this individual has been caricatured as out of sorts with \nreality, and if extraordinary circumstances are found with regard to \nDavid Hamilton, I am afraid that filibusters of judicial nominations \nwill become routine on the floor of the Senate. That would not be good \nfor this body or our country. I hope we don't go there today.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to join with me and Senator Lugar in \nstrongly invoking cloture on this nomination and voting to confirm him \nto the court of appeals.\n  I am glad to see Senator Sessions. I noted our many areas of \nagreement and it has been my pleasure working with the Senator from \nAlabama in the past--even as we have a difference of opinion about this \nnomination today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time for any quorum calls be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAYH. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Bayh for his comments and admire his \nsupport for a friend, the nominee under consideration today. He is an \nexcellent Senator who continues to strive for fairness and good policy \nin the Senate.\n  Certainly, no one likes to oppose a nominee for the Federal bench. It \nis not a very pleasant thing to do. Having seen that process from both \nsides, I particularly don't relish the thought. But judges are seeking \nlifetime appointments to the Federal bench, and they would hold their \noffice for life, without the ability of the public to review, even if \nthe judge conducts himself in a way that is not appropriate. The \nAmerican people may vote us out of office, and they do from time to \ntime. They can vote their Governors out, as well as others. But Federal \njudges are not subject to that. Therefore, I think it is critically \nimportant that before we bestow that lifetime appointment, that power \nto define the meaning of words in our laws and our Constitution, we be \ncertain that the nominee is a person who is committed, as the oath \nsays, to serving under the Constitution and the laws and not above \nthem.\n  This nominee has some problems. Unfortunately, it is not totally an \nisolated matter. There is indeed a philosophy prevalent among many \njudges in law schools that has led to, I think, an abuse of office by \ncertain judges. In recent years, they have developed an idea that the \nConstitution is not a changeless contract with the American people, but \na ``living document,'' they say--in other words, a malleable instrument \nthat they are free to massage, so that it is made to read as they would \nlike it to read, or as they wish it had been written rather than doing \ntheir duty, which is to follow the document as it was in fact written.\n  I believe this disrespects the Constitution, weakens the \nConstitution. If it is not respected by this judge today, what would \nprohibit a judge tomorrow with a different philosophy from violating it \nat that point? I think it is indeed a dangerous philosophy, one that \nJudge Hamilton has bought into. That is part of his approach to law.\n  I do think judges must be committed to their oath and to the \nConstitution, and that they are not empowered to amend the \nConstitution, or write footnotes to it. Judge Hamilton has been \nnominated by the President for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSeventh Circuit. He is now a Federal district judge. In that capacity, \nhe is one step\n\n[[Page S11413]]\n\nbelow the Supreme Court, and he would have considerably more power to \ndefine words in our laws and Constitution than he does as a district \njudge. During his campaign, the President promised to seek a bipartisan \nadministration, but we have had a number of candidates, I think, for \nthe judiciary, and efforts on matters such as health care, that \ndemonstrate otherwise. Some time ago, a number of us--I think all 40 \nRepublicans--wrote and suggested that he re-nominate some outstanding \ncandidates for the circuit court, who President Bush had submitted and \nwere not confirmed, just as President Bush re-nominated some of \nPresident Clinton's nominees when he took office. We suggested it would \nbe a good first step in showing that kind of commitment to openness. \nBut the White House never even acknowledged that letter.\n  With Judge Hamilton, his first judicial nominee, I think we have a \nproblem. According to some press reports, Judge Hamilton's nomination \nwas intended to send a pacifying signal to the Republicans, and they \nindicated--some of the Administration's spokesmen--that future nominees \nwould be more ideologically provocative. I am at a loss to think that \nwe would have someone with greater ideological commitment than Judge \nHamilton. Perhaps we will see that in the future. I don't think we have \nseen that to date. I have voted for most of the President's nominees, \nbut some I have not supported.\n  To begin with, Mr. Hamilton was a board member and vice president of \nthe ACLU chapter of Indiana. They take some very strong positions on \nconstitutional questions that I think are unjustified. He signed onto \nthat organization fully knowing what they stood for. He previously \nworked for and has been associated with ACORN, which is certainly not a \nmainstream organization but a real left-wing group. Investigations and \nreports of their activities have not made us feel good about ACORN, \nthat is for sure.\n  There is a theory that Judge Hamilton's views are outside the \nmainstream of President Obama's other nominees, the vast majority of \nwhom have openly rejected the President's so-called empathy standard, \nand have stated that empathy should not play a role in a judge's \nconsideration of a case. Associate Justice Sotomayor rejected this \nnotion explicitly at her confirmation.\n  However, instead of embracing the constitutional historic standard of \njurisprudence that Justice Sotomayor said she believed in, one that \nsays judges must faithfully adhere to the rule of law as written, Judge \nHamilton has embraced openly the empathy standard which, I submit, is \nno standard at all. It is not a legal standard.\n  In response to a follow-up question after his hearing, Judge Hamilton \nsaid empathy was ``important in fulfilling judicial oaths.'' He further \nstated, and this was in answer to a question, I believe, by Senator \nHatch--he further stated:\n\n       A judge needs to empathize with parties in the case, \n     plaintiff and defendant, crime victim and accused defendant, \n     so that the judge can better understand how the parties came \n     to be before the court and how rules affect those parties and \n     others in similar situations.\n\n  I disagree with that. It is a pretty significant disagreement, \nactually. Whenever a judge empathizes with a party, whenever a judge \nuses or allows his personal beliefs, biases, or experiences to inform \nor influence a decision in favor of one party, he would then \nnecessarily disfavor the other party. Empathy directly conflicts with \nthe judicial oath which requires judges to faithfully and impartially \n``administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to \nthe poor and the rich . . . under the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States.''\n  Judge Hamilton has said he believes a judge will ``reach different \ndecisions from time to time . . . taking into account what happened and \nits effect on both parties, what are the practical consequences.''\n  But this is an outcome-determinative philosophy of law, and outcomes \nare to be considered by the legislative branch, the policymaking \nbranch, when they pass the law. We pass laws and we do our best to \nfigure out what impact they will have and how they should be enforced, \nand we draw the lines at this and that. It goes to a judge. Then a \njudge now is empowered to say: I know they wrote this, but I don't like \nthe effect it is going to have on party A, so I am not going to enforce \nit. I don't want to be harsh. I don't want to be a strict \nconstructionist. I believe I have the ability to empathize with the \nparties. The way I feel today I empathize with this party and not that \nparty.\n  You see, that is not law. It is not law in the great American \ntradition of law. It is more akin to politics. Judges put on robes, \nthey take oaths, they conduct themselves--the judges I have known over \nthe years--in every way possible to send a message that they follow \ntheir oath and they do their duty and they treat people fairly, without \nbias or prejudice or empathy. Is empathy not a form of prejudice for \none party or another?\n  I think this is a big deal. These are big issues, and I think Judge \nHamilton's position is incorrect. He is a good person; I do not dispute \nthat. But we are talking about whether he should be empowered to be an \nappellate judge, one step below the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  His view of the role of a judge troubles me. In a 2003 speech he said \nthe role of a judge includes ``writing a series of footnotes to the \nConstitution.''\n  In explaining this answer to a question Senator Hatch submitted to \nhim after the hearing, he wrote that he believes the Framers intended \nfor judges to be able to amend the Constitution through evolving case \nlaw, in effect saying:\n\n       Both the process of case-by-case adjudication and the \n     Article V amendment processes are constitutionally \n     legitimate, and were both, in my view, expected by the \n     Framers, provided that case-by-case interpretation follows \n     the usual methods of legal reasoning and interpretation.\n\n  I think that is a pretty strong statement. He says the process of \ncase-by-case adjudication and Article V amendment processes are \nconstitutionally legitimate--in effect, constitutionally legitimate \nways to alter the document.\n  Article V is the amendment process. That is how we amend the \nConstitution. I am troubled by his statements. That was just recently \nwhen he submitted a written answer to questions. That is not a sound \nview of judging, in my opinion.\n  I would say, indeed, it is the essence of an activist judicial \nphilosophy. That philosophy has impacted a number of his rulings as a \nFederal district court judge. His rulings show a lack of appreciation \nfor the popular will of the people, of the State and Federal \nGovernment, and the elected branches. In more than a few instances he \nhas used his position to drive a political agenda, it seems clear to \nme. Some can say it is not. We all make our best judgment about those \nmatters. I think in this case he has a political agenda that is guided \nby personal beliefs and not the rule of law.\n  He has been reversed quite a number of times by the Seventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, the very court for which he has now been nominated.\n  I would like to next look at the Hinrichs v Bosma case. I do not \ncontend, and it is not right to say, Judge Hamilton is hostile to \nreligion. It does appear he is hostile to the free expression of \nreligion in certain circumstances and has been reversed as a result of \nit.\n  I want to be fair to him. In the Hinrichs case, he enjoined or issued \nan order to the speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives, \ntelling the speaker that he cannot allow sectarian prayers, ruling that \nthe prayers being said violated the Establishment Clause of the \nConstitution because many of the prayers expressly mentioned Jesus \nChrist. Yet in a post-judgment motion, Judge Hamilton permitted the use \nof Allah by a Muslim imam who was invited to pray at the legislature \nbecause he found there was ``little risk'' that such prayers ``would \nadvance a particular religion or disparage others.''\n  I don't think that is a sound legal approach. But that is exactly \nwhat he said. People can say he did not mean that. But that is what \nhappened. Judge Hamilton concluded in that case:\n\n       When government prayers are expressly and consistently \n     sectarian, i.e., when they express faith of a particular \n     religion, then the opportunity for prayers is being used to \n     advance a particular religion contrary to the mandate of the \n     Establishment Clause.\n\n  I don't think that is accurate because the law is, indeed, difficult \nin this area. But this is one of the more dramatic rulings I have seen \nin this area of the law.\n  In addition to prohibiting such sectarian prayers, as he defined it, \nJudge\n\n[[Page S11414]]\n\nHamilton held that the speaker of the house must advise any officiant \nwho opens the legislature with a prayer that a prayer must be \nnonsectarian, must not advance any one faith, or disparage another, and \nmust not use ``Christ's name or any other denominational appeal.''\n  The Seventh Circuit initially denied the speaker's request for a stay \nof that injunction, finding that the ruling was supported by some \nprecedent. However, after full briefing and oral argument, they \nreversed and remanded with instructions to dismiss, finding that the \nplaintiffs lacked standing.\n  I would just note for my colleagues that every day this Senate opens \nwith a prayer. We have a Chaplain on the payroll of the U.S. Government \nwho walks up those steps and stands behind the Speaker's chair and \nopens the session with a prayer and periodically mentions Jesus's name \nin that process. So I don't know how we get to this. Nobody, I assume, \nwould challenge what we do here--at least they have not done so \neffectively yet.\n  In Grossbaum v Indianapolis-Marion County Building Authority, Judge \nHamilton denied a rabbi's plea to allow a menorah to be part of a \nmunicipal building's holiday display. The Seventh Circuit unanimously \nreversed that erroneous opinion, finding that Judge Hamilton failed to \nacknowledge the rabbi's right to display the menorah as symbolic \nreligious speech protected by the Constitution.\n  As we know, in the Constitution's first amendment it says Congress--\nus--Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of a \nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. That is all the \nConstitution says about religion. It just as strongly prohibits \nlimitations on free exercise of religion as it clearly prohibits the \ngovernment from establishing a church and making it preferable over \nothers.\n  It is interesting. The results reached in these decisions are \nstrikingly similar to the positions consistently advocated by the ACLU, \nthe organization with which Judge Hamilton has been associated prior to \nbecoming a judge.\n  Judge Hamilton's problematic rulings are not limited to cases \ninvolving religion. Lawyers quoted in the Almanac of the Federal \nJudiciary describe him as one of the most lenient judges in his \ndistrict in criminal matters. His rulings on the bench have lived up to \nthat reputation.\n  In the Rinehart case, Judge Hamilton, I think inappropriately, acted \nand used his opinion in the case to request clemency--that is either \nelimination of the penalty he imposed pursuant to the mandatory Federal \nguidelines, at least within that range--for a police officer who had \npled guilty to two counts, not of seeing pornography or possessing \npornography but producing child pornography. A 32-year-old officer had \nengaged in ``consensual''--consensual sex with two teenagers and \nvideotaped the activity.\n  In United States v Woolsey, the Seventh Circuit faulted Judge \nHamilton for disregarding an earlier felony drug conviction in order to \navoid imposing a life sentence on a repeat offender. He didn't want to \ndo that so he ignored the prior conviction that would have called for \nthat.\n  In reversing his decision, the Seventh Circuit reminded Judge \nHamilton that he was not free to ignore prior convictions, regardless \nof whether he deemed the penalty for recidivists to be appropriate.\n  Judge Hamilton's most activist decision may be a series of rulings in \nA Woman's Choice v. Newman. Through the rulings in this case, Judge \nHamilton succeeded in blocking the enforcement of an Indiana informed \nconsent law for 7 years. In reversing, the Seventh Circuit court noted \nthat Judge Hamilton had abused his discretion. This is how they \ndescribed it.\n  This is a strong condemnation, from my experience, as to how \nappellate judges deal with lower court judges who make errors. They \nknow judges make errors from time to time. They just reverse it and try \nnot to be too critical. But this is what they said in this case:\n\n       For seven years Indiana has been prevented from enforcing a \n     statute materially identical to a law held valid by the \n     Supreme Court in Casey, by this court in Karlin, and by the \n     Fifth Circuit in Barnes. No court anywhere in the country \n     (other than one district judge in Indiana) has held any \n     similar law invalid in the years since Casey . . . Indiana \n     (like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) is entitled to put its law \n     into effect and have that law judged by its own consequences.\n\n  They were referring to Judge Hamilton. In other words, if the judge \ndidn't like the consequences of it and if his empathy made him believe \nthis was not a good policy, he is not empowered to do that. The \nlegislature passed a constitutional statute that simply said: Before a \nperson has an abortion, they must be given notice of what the \nramifications are so they can be informed when they make their \ndecision. Apparently, he didn't like that. For 7 years, through a \nseries of rulings, he kept it from being enforced. This case is a \nblatant example of him allowing his personal views to frustrate the \nwill of the people and the popularly elected representatives of the \ngovernment of Indiana. The people of Indiana went through a lot as a \nresult. There were multiple appeals and lawsuits and attorneys. They \nwere forced to expend great sums of money to overcome what appeared to \nme to be obstructionism.\n  Chief Justice Roberts said it best when he said judges should be \nneutral umpires, calling balls and strikes based on the law and the \nevidence. Unfortunately, Judge Hamilton disagrees with the idea that a \njudge should be a neutral umpire. This is what he said:\n\n       Judges reach different decisions from time to time. In that \n     sense, the call is not was that a ball or a strike. But \n     taking into account what happened and its effects on both \n     parties, what are the practical consequences.\n\n  We don't want a baseball umpire who says: If I call this a strike, \nthat will be the third out and the game will be over. I believe, with \nall sincerity, these views represent a results-oriented, activist \nphilosophy that is hostile to the great American role of a judge in our \nconstitutional system. I believe it disqualifies him for elevation to \nthe court of appeals.\n  This is one of those extraordinary circumstances where the President \nshould be informed of that fact by a vote of the Senate. That is why I \nwill not be able to support cloture.\n  It will be the first time I have voted against cloture in a matter of \nthis kind. I take this seriously. I talked about it some yesterday. If \nwe could reach an agreement with my colleagues, Senator Leahy and \nothers, to not follow the filibuster rule, I think the Senate would \nprobably be better. But under President Bush, some 30 filibusters \nagainst his nominees were effected. Eventually, we had a political \nbrouhaha here for several years that culminated in a decision that the \nfilibuster would be acceptable if you believed there were extraordinary \ncircumstances justifying that against a nominee. This judge's history \nand background reach that level. That is why I will not be voting for \nhim.\n  I don't think we should abuse this policy. I think we would be better \noff if we did not. But that is what the Senate basically decided when \nthe Gang of 14 reached their agreement in the midst of a debate, for \nthose who said you shouldn't filibuster and for those who said you can, \nand they reached that agreement. I think that is probably the state of \nthe situation in the Senate. Based on that standard, I will oppose \ncloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate takes up the nomination of \nDavid Hamilton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. \nThis controversial nominee's record including his decisions, speeches, \nand testimony before the Judiciary Committee reflects an activist \njudicial philosophy that is inconsistent with the proper role of judges \nin our system of government. As a result, while I voted for cloture, I \nwill vote against confirmation.\n  Even with control of both the White House and Senate, and with the \nlargest Senate majority in 30 years, Democrats are still complaining \nabout the slow judicial appointment pace. But we have nominees for only \n19 of the current 99 judicial vacancies. Twenty-four of the 80 current \nvacancies for which there are no nominees are more than 1 year old. And \nyet one of the nominees we have received and who will have a hearing \ntomorrow would fill a seat on the U.S. district court that is not \nvacant at all.\n  At this point in 2001, President George W. Bush had sent nearly twice \nas many judicial nominees to the Senate despite dealing with the \naftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and a Senate controlled by the \nother political\n\n[[Page S11415]]\n\nparty. And nominees to the U.S. district court this year have been \nconfirmed nearly 15 percent faster than President Bush's district court \nnominees during the 107th Congress.\n  Democrats have nonetheless accused the minority of engaging in \nfilibusters. If the word ``filibuster'' is used anytime the Senate does \nnot blindly and immediately rubberstamp nominees, then the word no \nlonger means anything at all. Democrats have circulated their talking \npoints to reporters and commentators, who in some cases repeat outright \nfalsehoods. Last week, the Judiciary Committee chairman placed in the \nRecord a commentary by a law professor claiming that there had already \nbeen cloture votes on three judicial nominees. The Congressional Record \nis supposed to be a nonfiction work.\n  On the one hand, Democrats claim the Senate is not confirming \nnominees and then, on the other hand, complain that Senators actually \nmust vote on them. This no doubt baffles many Americans, who probably \nthink that voting is one of the things Senators come here to do. But \nthe practice of using a rollcall vote to confirm norcontroversial \njudicial nominees was already firmly established, and not by \nRepublicans. The percentage of district court nominees confirmed by \nrollcall vote during the administration of George W. Bush was 26 times \nhigher than during the previous 50 years. You heard that right, 26 \ntimes higher. And the percentage of those rollcall votes without any \nopposition skyrocketed as well. The majority today has no one to blame \nbut themselves for forcing such changes in confirmation tradition and \npractice.\n  If Republicans really wanted to obstruct President Obama's nominees, \nI suppose we could have followed the Democrats' example from 2001. \nUnder Senate rules, pending nominations expire and return to the \nPresident when the Senate adjourns or recesses for more than 30 days. \nWe routinely waive that rule to carry pending nominations over the \nAugust recess. But on August 3, 2001, Democrats objected to that \ntraditional practice in order to send 45 judicial nominees back to the \nPresident. Some had been nominated literally the day before. Some had \nbeen nominated to life-tenured Federal courts, but others to term-\nlimited courts such as the U.S. Court of Claims or the District of \nColumbia Superior Court. It did not matter to my Democratic friends, \nthey did anything and everything they could to keep nominees from any \nconsideration at all, including inventing entirely new forms of \nobstruction.\n\n  And then, of course, there were the first filibusters in American \nhistory used to defeat majority-supported judicial nominees. My \nDemocratic friends invented that one too during the previous \nadministration. Their scorched-earth campaign changed many long-\nestablished confirmation traditions and practices. So it is little \nwonder that today, with such a controversial nominee before us, many on \nthis side of the aisle feel justified in following the Democrats' \nplaybook. I do not blame them for that. I voted for cloture today \nbecause I continue to believe that the Constitution's assignment of \nroles in the judicial selection process counsels against using the \nfilibuster to defeat majority-supported nominees. Democrats should not \nhave dragged the Senate across that line, and I fear that doing so may \nhave unalterably changed how this body fulfills its role in the \njudicial selection process. Yet, for now at least, I still believe that \nthe Senate fulfills its advice and consent role best by voting up or \ndown on nominees that have been reported to the floor. That is why I \nvoted for cloture on this nomination.\n  That said, I must vote against confirmation of this controversial \nnominee. Qualifications for judicial office include not only legal \nexperience but also judicial philosophy. I define judicial philosophy \nas an understanding of the power and proper role of judges in our \nsystem of government. Judge Hamilton's activist record fails that \nstandard.\n  Turning to that record, Judge Hamilton has rendered a pattern of \ndecisions that evidence a willful assertion of personal views over the \nrequirements of the law. Now I know we will hear that only a fraction \nof Judge Hamilton's decisions as a U.S. district judge are \ncontroversial. Most of any judge's decisions make no waves and raise no \nflags. When he served in this body, President Obama himself said that \nonly 5 percent of the Supreme Court's decisions are truly the hard \ncases, and this percentage may shrink with each step down the judicial \npyramid. I need not recount the few cases that my friends on the other \nside found more than sufficient to oppose so many nominees in the past. \nThe cases that matter are the ones that tell us what we need to know \nabout a judge and his judicial philosophy. I know other Senators will \nbe speaking about a number of these and I want to highlight two of \nthem.\n\n  In one notorious case, Judge Hamilton for 7 years blocked enforcement \nof Indiana's law requiring informed consent before a woman can obtain \nan abortion. The Supreme Court had 5 years earlier upheld a \nPennsylvania informed consent law that the seventh circuit would later \ndescribe as ``materially identical'' to the one before Judge Hamilton. \nThat was the precedent he should have followed. Instead, he turned a \nminor factual distinction into a constitutional difference and issued a \npreliminary injunction in 1995. Following the Supreme Court, the \nSeventh Circuit upheld a virtually identical Wisconsin statute in 1999, \nbut Judge Hamilton also ignored that precedent and issued a permanent \ninjunction in 2001 against the Indiana law. I do not see any way to \nexplain his decisions in this case except as a willful assertion of his \nown opinion over what the law required. When the Seventh Circuit \nfinally reversed him in 2002, it said that no court anywhere in America \nhad done what Judge Hamilton had done.\n  In another case, Judge Hamilton chose to ignore one of a defendant's \nprior drug convictions so that he did not have to impose a life \nsentence. In Judge Hamilton's personal opinion, a court in another \nstate--where Judge Hamilton, of course, had no jurisdiction whatsoever \nshould have set aside that earlier conviction and so he was simply \ngoing to ignore it. Mind you, even the defendant himself had not denied \nthe earlier conviction, but Judge Hamilton was still going to \nsubstitute his own judgment. In one of the most stunning statements I \nhave ever read in a judicial opinion, Judge Hamilton wrote that he \n``ought to treat as having been done what should have been done.'' In \nother words, he would not let the law, the facts, rulings of other \ncourts with proper jurisdiction, or anything else stand in the way of \nhow he wanted things to be. That is perhaps the ultimate mark of the \nactivist judge, driven by results and finding whatever means necessary \nto get there. When the Seventh Circuit reversed Judge Hamilton, it \ncited its own precedents that Judge Hamilton should have followed and \nconcluded: ``Furthermore, we have admonished district courts that the \nstatutory penalties . . . are not optional, even if the court deems \nthem unwise or an inappropriate response to repeat drug offenders.''\n  A judge should not have to be told that statutory requirements are \nnot optional. A judge should not have to be told that he must decide \ncases based on the law rather than on his personal sense of justice or \nhis belief about what should have been done at other times by other \ncourts. A judge who must be told that he has an activist approach to \njudging that, in my opinion, should not be rewarded with promotion to \nthe federal appeals court.\n\n  Those are just two of Judge Hamilton's decisions which I found fit a \ndisturbing pattern of deciding cases based on his own views rather than \nthe law. I also found that the rest of Judge Hamilton's record \nreflected the same activist view of judicial power. In speeches, for \nexample, Judge Hamilton has endorsed the view that ``part of our job \nhere as judges is to write a series of footnotes to the Constitution.'' \nHe has said that those supporters to the equal rights amendment to the \nConstitution ``lost the battle but have won the war'' because the \nSupreme Court changed the Constitution in substantially the same way \nthat the ERA would have.\n  This latter view that judges may amend the Constitution through their \ndecisions is particularly troubling. I asked Judge Hamilton about this \nstatement in written questions following his hearing. Judge Hamilton \nstated that both the process of case-by-case adjudication and the \narticle V amendment\n\n[[Page S11416]]\n\nprocess are constitutionally legitimate means of changing the \nConstitution and both were expected by America's Founders. He is wrong \non both counts. If judges may change the Constitution through their \ndecisions, they literally can make the law they use to decide cases. \nThe Constitution cannot control judges if judges control the \nConstitution.\n  America's Founders flatly and explicitly rejected that view. In his \nfarewell address, President George Washington said that if the \nConstitution must be changed, ``let it be corrected by an amendment in \nthe way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change \nby usurpation.'' By his own words, the Father of our Country disputed \nJudge Hamilton's assertion about the judiciary's proper role. In \nMarbury v. Madison, Chief Justice Marshall wrote that America's \nFounders intended the Constitution to govern courts as well as \nlegislatures. This notion that constitutional amendments by judges are \nas legitimate as those by the people is completely inconsistent with \nthe proper role of judges in our system of government but completely \nconsistent with the activist approach evidenced by Judge Hamilton's \ndecisions.\n  Well, I have said enough here to indicate the basis for my opposition \nto this controversial judicial nominee. I regret that President Obama \nchose someone with such an activist judicial philosophy as his first \njudicial nominee. I had hoped that he would take a more balanced \napproach to judicial selection, choosing consensus nominees that most \nSenators could support. I hope the nominee before us today does not set \na pattern to be followed in the future and I will vote against his \nconfirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to respond to some of the things the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama has said. To call this the first \nfilibuster of a judicial matter this year is not totally accurate. We \nhave people who are confirmed unanimously after being blocked for month \nafter month by the Republican side, who then says: But we didn't \nfilibuster.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator cite a single vote prior to this where \nthis Senator has voted against cloture?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is not what I said. I am saying we have had several \nnominees who were approved, not only judicial but others, \noverwhelmingly--80, 90, 100 votes. They had to wait month after month \nbecause the Republican side would not allow us to even proceed to them \nby filibustering or threatening a filibuster. You have de facto de jure \nfilibusters. During President Clinton's time, the Republicans pocket-\nfilibustered 60 of President Clinton's nominees.\n  I yield up to 5 minutes to the distinguished senior Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nfavor of the nomination. Speaking candidly, perhaps bluntly, Judge \nHamilton is a pawn in partisan political warfare. That is the long and \nshort of it. This is the 90th filibuster in the past several months. \nThis follows a pattern, regrettably, that goes back almost two decades, \nwhen both sides, Democrats and Republicans at various times, have \nengaged in filibusters against judicial nominees where there was no \njustification to do so. It occurred extensively during the Clinton \nadministration. At that time, on the other side of the aisle, I \nsupported many of President Clinton's nominees. It occurred during the \nBush administration, when I chaired the Judiciary Committee, and there \nwere repeated filibusters by Democrats against President Bush's \nnominees.\n  At that time, this Chamber was almost torn apart with the ferocity \nand intensity of the partisanship, with serious consideration being \ngiven to what was called the nuclear or constitutional option, when \nthere was serious consideration given to altering the traditional \nrequirement of 60 votes to end a filibuster. There was a tactic devised \nto challenge the ruling of the Chair, which could be overruled by or \nupheld by only 51 votes, and thereby move the judicial nominees without \nthe traditional 60 votes. Fortunately, sanity and tradition prevailed \nand we worked out a compromise with the so-called Gang of 14 to confirm \nsome and to reject others. Now we find the pattern continues.\n  It is my hope that at some point we can declare a truce, an \narmistice, and stop the partisan political warfare. The nomination of \nJudge Hamilton would be a good occasion to do that.\n  Senator Lugar, in his mild manner, in a floor statement in support of \nthe nomination, has said:\n\n       The confirmation process is often accompanied by the same \n     oversimplification and distortions that are disturbing even \n     in campaigns for offices that are, in fact, political.\n\n  Having worked with Senator Lugar in this Chamber for the better part \nof three decades, I have observed his modesty, his circumspection, and \nhis understatement. But those soft words about oversimplification and \ndistortions give a clue to what is going on today.\n  Regrettably, this is part of a broader picture, a broader picture of \npartisan political warfare. On the major issues of the day, the \nstimulus package, not one Member of 170-plus in the House of \nRepresentatives, not one Republican Member was for the stimulus \npackage. Only three Republicans in this Chamber would even talk to \nDemocrats. In the House of Representatives, on comprehensive health \ncare reform, only one Republican out of 170-plus stood in favor of the \nbill. He became a hero or, perhaps more accurately, an oddity. In the \nSenate, only one Republican in the Finance Committee would stand and \nvote in favor of reform. Is it any wonder why the Congress of the \nUnited States is held in such low esteem by the American public? Is it \nany wonder why approval ratings across the board are dropping in \npractically free-fall, with a dull thud, because the American people \nsee what is going on in this Chamber and in the Chamber across the \nRotunda and are, frankly, disgusted with it. They are sick and tired of \nseeing the partisan politics at play.\n  A great deal has been said about the qualifications of David \nHamilton. Beyond any doubt, he is well qualified for the job. During my \ntenure on the Judiciary Committee, some three decades, part of which I \nserved as chairman, I have seldom seen a better qualified candidate. I \nam reminded of the objections raised by Democrats to Judge Southwick, \npicking a couple lines from a couple opinions. Fortunately, sanity \nprevailed and Judge Southwick was confirmed. This is an outstanding \nman.\n  One additional note. His uncle is Lee Hamilton, the very \ndistinguished former Member of the House of Representatives.\n  I address all my colleagues: Let's call a truce. Let's end the \npartisan political warfare. Let's start with the confirmation of Judge \nHamilton.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  I yield up to 4 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, not only for his commitment but his patience as he has had \nto labor through objection after objection, stalling tactic after \nstalling tactic, to fill these critical judgeships. On March 17, \nPresident Obama nominated his first judge to the Federal bench, David \nHamilton, whose nomination the Republicans are now filibustering. He \nnominated him on March 17. Judge Hamilton is not a partisan judge. He \nhas an excellent record. He has upheld the law. He has been an \nimpartial umpire of cases before him. For 15 years, he has served with \ndistinction on the Federal district court, and he has the strong \nsupport of his two home State Senators, a distinguished Republican and \na distinguished Democrat. He has the highest rating from the American \nBar Association. Yet the Republicans are still stalling his \nconfirmation vote. Again, he was nominated on March 17.\n  This fair and impartial judge is being blocked for no other reason \nthan to stop us from filling a critical seat on the appeals court with \nPresident Obama's nominee.\n  As we know, and as the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania spoke \nabout a moment ago, this is not a first.\n\n[[Page S11417]]\n\nIn fact, 90 times so far this year--I am going to have to get a bigger \nchart soon--90 times we have seen Republicans come to the floor and \nobject in some manner to moving our country forward, to moving the \npeople's agenda forward.\n  Over and over again, we are seeing tactics to simply slow the Senate \ndown, and a majority of these objections, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, have ended actually in unanimous votes once we have actually \ngotten through all of the process, all of the strategies, and actually \ngotten to a vote. Almost in every case, people have been confirmed \noverwhelmingly, if not unanimously, and the same is true with \nlegislation.\n  We are at a point where the stalling has to stop. We have two wars \nhappening. We have the highest unemployment in a generation. We have an \neconomy to worry about, financial reform to worry about, and certainly \nhealth care, which is about jobs, which is in front of us now.\n  The time is now to stop. Every Senator has the right to vote yes or \nno on a nominee or on legislation. But 90 times--and counting--we have \nsimply seen objections and stalling tactics to slow down the business \nof this country. I hope we are going to see that stop in the interest \nof everything we need to get done.\n  I strongly support this nominee.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Presiding Officer \nto notify me when I have 3 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate finally turns to the \nRepublican filibuster against the nomination of Judge David Hamilton of \nIndiana to the Seventh Circuit. Republican Senators who, just a few \nyears ago, protested that such filibusters were unconstitutional. \nRepublican Senators who joined in a bipartisan memorandum of \nunderstanding to head off the ``nuclear option'' that the Republican \nSenate leadership was intent on activating. Republican Senators who \nagreed that nominees should only be filibustered under ``extraordinary \ncircumstances.'' Those same Republican Senators are now abandoning all \nthat they said they stood for, and are instead joining together in an \neffort to prevent an up-or-down vote on the nomination of a good man \nand a good judge, David Hamilton of Indiana.\n  The American people should see this for what it is: more of the \npartisan, narrow, ideological tactics that Senate Republicans have been \nengaging in for decades as they try to pack the courts with \nultraconservative judges. What is at stake for the American people are \ntheir rights, their access to the courts, their ability to seek redress \nfor wrongdoing.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan for pointing out \nthese 90 delays just in this year alone. In evaluating this nomination, \nthe nonpartisan American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary unanimously rated Judge Hamilton ``well qualified,'' \nthe highest rating possible. He has served as a Federal district Judge \nfor 15 years and is now the chief judge in his district. His nomination \nis supported by the senior Republican in the Senate, his senior home \nState Senator, Senator Lugar, and by Senator Bayh. That is correct: \nJudge Hamilton has the support of both of his home state Senators, the \nlongest-serving Republican in the Senate, and a well-respected moderate \nDemocrat.\n  Unlike his predecessor, President Obama has reached across the aisle \nto work with Republican Senators in making judicial nominations. The \nnomination of Judge Hamilton is an example of that consultation. Other \nexamples are the recently confirmed nominees to vacancies in South \nDakota, who were supported by Senator Thune, and the nominee confirmed \nto a vacancy in Florida, supported by Senators Martinez and LeMieux. \nStill others are the President's nomination to the Eleventh Circuit \nfrom Georgia, supported by Senators Isakson and Chambliss, his recent \nnominations to the Fourth Circuit from North Carolina, which I expect \nwill be supported by Senator Burr, and the recent nomination to a \nvacancy in Alabama supported by Senators Shelby and Sessions on which \nthe Judiciary Committee held a hearing 2 weeks ago.\n  I remind those Republican Senators who endorsed the Memorandum of \nUnderstanding on Judicial Nominations in 2005 of what they wrote when \nthere was a Republican President in the White House. How quickly they \nseem to forget. They said:\n\n       We believe that, under Article II, Section 2, of the United \n     States Constitution, the word ``Advice'' speaks to \n     consultation between the Senate and the President with regard \n     to the use of the President's power to make nominations. We \n     encourage the Executive branch of government to consult with \n     members of the Senate, both Democratic and Republican, prior \n     to submitting a judicial nomination to the Senate for \n     consideration.\n       Such a return to the early practices of our government may \n     well serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately \n     accompanies the advice and consent process in the Senate.\n       We firmly believe this agreement is consistent with the \n     traditions of the United States Senate that we as Senators \n     seek to uphold.\n\n  How easy it was for them to say at a time when we had a Republican \nPresident. Now we have a Democratic President who has done exactly what \nthese Republican Senators recommended. He has consulted with home state \nSenators from both sides of the aisle regarding his judicial nominees. \nAnd yet Republican Senators still say: Whoops, no. We are going to \nstall. We are going to filibuster. We are going to make you wait 6 \nmonths to get a nominee through, in one instance, who then got a \nunanimous vote.\n  In the last administration, with a Republican President, they \ncondemned filibusters of judicial nominations as ``unconstitutional,'' \n``obstructionist,'' and ``offensive.'' They issued a threat, though, to \nfilibuster before President Obama made a single nomination. They wrote \nin a March 2 letter to the President:\n\n       If we are not consulted on, and approve of, a nominee from \n     our states, the Republican Conference will be unable to \n     support moving forward on that nominee.\n\n  Well, of course, they were consulted. The President, in his first \nnomination, went to the senior most member of the Republican Party, \nSenator Lugar, for his approval and his support. He ended up doing \nevery single thing the Republicans demanded that he do, and their \nresponse was: Whoops, never thought you would do what we asked for. We \nare still going to filibuster.\n  The American people and the Senate need to understand that Judge \nHamilton was nominated with the support and strong endorsement of \nSenator Lugar, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate. At Judge \nHamilton's hearing over 7 months ago Senator Lugar described Judge \nHamilton as ``an exceptionally talented jurist'' and ``the type of \nlawyer and the type of person one wants to see on the Federal bench.'' \nHe knows David Hamilton and said of him at his hearing:\n\n       I have known David since his childhood. His father, \n     Reverend Richard Hamilton, was our family's pastor at St. \n     Luke's United Methodist Church in Indianapolis, where his \n     mother was the soloist in the choir. Knowing first-hand his \n     family's character and commitment to service, it has been no \n     surprise to me that David's life has borne witness to the \n     values learned in his youth.\n\n  Senator Lugar gave a brilliant speech on the Senate floor just \nyesterday, speaking in favor of Judge Hamilton. I encourage every \nmember of the Senate to review his well-considered statement in which \nhe rebuts the thin, partisan attacks on Judge Hamilton and his record. \nAs Senator Lugar said, a fair review of his judicial record ``will \nreveal that Judge Hamilton has not been a judicial activist and has \nruled objectively and within the judicial mainstream.''\n  Senator Lugar is one of the finest Senators to have ever served in \nthe Senate. First elected in 1976, he is the longest serving U.S. \nSenator in Indiana history. He is a strong man with strong views, a \nconservative Republican. He is no one's shill.\n\n  Instead of praising the President for consulting with the senior \nRepublican in the Senate, the Republican leadership has doubled back on \ntheir demands when a Republican was in the White House. No more do they \ntalk about each nominee being entitled to an up-or-down vote. That \nposition is abandoned and forgotten. Instead, they now seek to \nfilibuster this judicial nomination and engage is the very act that \nRepublican leaders used to contend that they never do. They have also \nabandoned the new position they\n\n[[Page S11418]]\n\ntook only months ago when they threatened to filibuster if not \nconsulted. We are forced to overcome a filibuster of this nomination \ndespite the President's bipartisan consultation with Senator Lugar.\n  When President Bush worked with Senators across the aisle, I praised \nhim and expedited consideration of his nominees. When President Obama \nreaches across the aisle, the Senate Republican leadership delays and \nobstructs his qualified nominees.\n  Today is November 17. By November 17 of the first year of George W. \nBush's Presidency, the Senate had confirmed 18 district and circuit \ncourt judges. By contrast, once cloture is invoked and the Republican \nfilibuster ended, Judge Hamilton will be just the seventh lower court \nnomination the Senate has considered all year. We achieved those \nresults in 2001 with a controversial and confrontational Republican \nPresident after a mid-year change to a Democratic majority in the \nSenate. We did so in spite of the attacks of September 11; despite the \nanthrax-laced letters sent to the Senate that closed our offices; and \nwhile working virtually around the clock on the USA PATRIOT Act for six \nweeks. By comparison, the Republican minority this year has allowed \naction on only one-third that many judicial nominations to the Federal \ncircuit and district courts as were confirmed by this date in 2001.\n  Charlie Savage made this point in The New York Times this past Sunday \nwhen he wrote:\n\n       By this point in 2001, the Senate had confirmed five of Mr. \n     Bush's appellate judges . . . and 13 of his district judges. \n     Mr. Obama has received Senate approval of just two appellate \n     and four district judges.\n\n  David Savage of the Los Angeles Times wrote if even starker terms \nyesterday:\n\n       So far, only six of Obama's nominees to the lower federal \n     courts have won approval. By comparison, President George W. \n     Bush had 28 judges confirmed in his first year in office, \n     even though Democrats held a narrow majority for much of the \n     year.\n\n  This is not for lack of qualified nominees. There are eight judicial \nnominees, including Judge Hamilton who have been reported by the \nJudiciary Committee on the Senate Executive Calendar. Had those \nnominations been considered in the normal course, we would be on the \npace Senate Democrats set in 2001 when fairly considering the \nnominations of our last Republican President.\n  Another aspect of the Republican obstruction is its refusal to \nconsider the nomination of Professor Christopher Schroeder to serve as \nthe Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Policy at the \nJustice Department. Professor Schroeder has been stalled on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar by Republican objection since July 28 since it was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee without a single dissenting vote. \nProfessor Schroeder is a distinguished scholar and public servant who \nhas served with distinction on the staff of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and in the Justice Department. He has support across the \npolitical spectrum.\n  I can only imagine that the reason his confirmation is being delayed \nis part of the partisan effort to slow progress on judicial nominees. \nThe Office of Legal Policy is traditionally involved in the vetting of \nthose nominees. So when Republican Senators excuse their obstruction by \nsuggesting that the President has not sent the Senate enough nominees, \nthey are wrong on at least two counts. They have not allowed the Senate \nto act on the nominees he has sent, and they are delaying appointment \nof the Assistant Attorney General who contributes to that process.\n  President Bush's first nominee to head that division, Viet Dinh, was \nconfirmed 96 to 1 only 1 month after he was nominated, and only a week \nafter he his nomination was reported by the committee. The three \nnominees to that office that succeeded Mr. Dinh--Daniel Bryant, Rachel \nBrand, and Elisebeth Cook--were each confirmed by voice vote in a \nshorter time than Professor Schroeder's nomination has been pending. As \nCharlie Savage wrote in The New York Times this weekend:\n\n       In addition, no one has been confirmed as head of the \n     Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy, which helps vet \n     judges; Mr. Obama's nomination of Christopher Schroeder for \n     the position remains stalled in the Senate.\n\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I treated President Bush's \nnominees better than the Republicans had treated President Clinton's. \nThat effort has made no difference; Senate Republicans are now treating \nthis President's nominees worse still. During the 17 months I chaired \nthe Judiciary Committee in President Bush's first term, we confirmed \n100 of his judicial nominees. At the end of his Presidency, although \nRepublicans had run the Judiciary Committee for more than half his \ntenure, more of his judicial nominees were confirmed when I was the \nchairman than in the more than 4 years when Republicans were in charge.\n  Last year, with a Democratic majority, the Senate reduced circuit \ncourt vacancies to as low as 9 and judicial vacancies overall to as low \nas 34, even though it was the last year of President Bush's second term \nand a Presidential election year. That was the lowest number of circuit \ncourt vacancies in decades, since before Senate Republicans began \nstalling Clinton nominees and grinding confirmations to a halt. In the \n1996 session, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed only 17 \njudges, and not a single circuit court nominee. Because of those delays \nand pocket filibusters, judicial vacancies grew to over 100, and \ncircuit vacancies rose into the mid-thirties.\n  Rather than continued progress, we see Senate Republicans resorting \nto their bag of procedural tricks to delay and obstruct. They have \nratcheted up the partisanship and seek to impose ideological litmus \ntests. If partisan, ideological Republicans will filibuster David \nHamilton's nomination, the nomination of a distinguished judge \nsupported by his respected home State Republican Senator, they will \nfilibuster anybody. This is partisanship gone rampant.\n  Senate Republicans are intent on turning back the clock to the abuses \nthey engaged in during their years of resistance to President Clinton's \nmoderate and mainstream judicial nominations. The delays and inaction \nwe are seeing now from Republican Senators in considering the nominees \nof another Democratic President are regrettably familiar. Their tactics \nhave resulted in a sorry record of judicial confirmations this year. \nThere are more judicial nominees recommended to the Senate and sitting \non the Executive Calendar awaiting consideration than the Senate has \nconfirmed all year.\n  Last week, the Senate was finally allowed to consider the nomination \nof Judge Charlene Honeywell of Florida, but only after 4 weeks of \nunexplained delays. She was confirmed without a single negative vote, \n88-0. The week before, the Senate was finally allowed to consider the \nnomination of Irene Berger, who has now been confirmed as the first \nAfrican-American Federal judge in the history of West Virginia. The \nRepublican minority delayed consideration of her nomination for more \nthan 3 weeks after it was reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee. When her nomination finally came to a vote, it was approved \nwithout a single negative vote, 97-0. The week before that the Senate \nwas finally allowed to consider the nomination of Roberto A. Lange to \nthe District of South Dakota. The Republican minority required 3 weeks \nbefore allowing consideration of that nomination after it was \nunanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate. They \nalso required 2 hours of debate before allowing the Senate to vote on \nthat nomination. They, in fact, used less than 5 minutes of the time \nthey demanded to discuss that nomination and that came when the ranking \nRepublican on the Judiciary Committee spoke to endorse the nominee. \nThat nomination had the support of both Senator Johnson and Senator \nThune, a member of the Senate Republican leadership. Ultimately, Judge \nLange's nomination was confirmed 100-0. That follows the pattern that \nRepublicans have followed all year with respect to President Obama's \nnominations.\n  Last week, the Senate finally debated the nomination of Judge Andre \nDavis of Maryland to a seat on the Fourth Circuit. He was confirmed 72-\n16. Sixteen Republican Senators voted in favor of the nomination and 16 \nwere opposed. As Senators, they may vote as they see fit. What was \nwrong was that they delayed Senate consideration of that nomination for \n5 months.\n\n[[Page S11419]]\n\n  The obstruction and delays in considering President Obama's judicial \nnominations is especially disappointing given the extensive efforts by \nPresident Obama to turn away from the divisive approach taken by the \nprevious administration and to reach out to Senators from both parties \nas he selects mainstream, well-qualified nominees. The President has \ndone an admirable job of working with Senators from both sides of the \naisle, Democrats and Republicans.\n  Professor Carl Tobias wrote about President Obama's approach recently \nin a column that appeared in McClatchy newspapers across the country on \nOctober 30. He wrote:\n\n       Obama has emphasized bipartisan outreach, particularly by \n     soliciting the advice of Democratic and Republican Judiciary \n     Committee members, and of high-level party officials from the \n     states where vacancies arise, and by doing so before final \n     nominations.\n\n  He had it right when he wrote that the real problem lies not with \nPresident Obama or with his nominations but with the Republican Senate \nminority. They are the principle cause of the current, sorry record \nregarding Senate confirmation of this President's outstanding nominees.\n  Federal judicial vacancies, which had been cut in half while George \nW. Bush was President, have already more than doubled since last year. \nThere are now 98 vacancies on our Federal circuit and district courts, \nincluding 22 circuit court vacancies. There are another 23 future \njudicial vacancies already announced. Justice should not be delayed or \ndenied to any American because of overburdened courts, but that is the \nlikely result of the stalling and obstruction.\n  Despite the fact that Senate Republicans had pocket filibustered \nPresident Clinton's circuit court nominees, Senate Democrats opposed \nonly the most extreme of President Bush's ideological nominees and \nworked to reduce judicial vacancies. This is not an extreme nominee. \nThis is a nominee in the mold of Judge John Tinder, President Bush's \nnominee to the Seventh Circuit, also a well-respected district court \njudge in Indiana who was unanimously rated ``well-qualified'' by the \nAmerican Bar Association. His nomination was supported by both Senator \nLugar and Senator Bayh and was confirmed 93-0 just 84 days after the \nJudiciary Committee held a hearing on his nomination.\n  When he testified in support of Judge Hamilton, Senator Lugar thanked \nSenator Bayh for ``the thoughtful, cooperative, merit-driven attitude \nthat has marked his own approach to recommending prospective judicial \nnominees'' and his ``strong support for President Bush's nominations of \nJudge Tinder for the Seventh Circuit and of Judge William Lawrence for \nthe Southern District of Indiana.'' I supported both of those nominees \nwith the endorsement of both of Indiana's Senators and both were easily \nconfirmed. This nomination should be no different.\n  I hope that Senators now considering whether to even allow this \nnomination to be considered by the full Senate heed the advice of \nSenator Lugar, which he reiterated yesterday when he said:\n\n       [I] believe our confirmation decisions should not be based \n     on partisan considerations, much less on how we hope or \n     predict a given judicial nominee will rule on particular \n     issues of public moment or controversy. I have instead tried \n     to evaluate judicial candidates on whether they have the \n     requisite intellect, experience, character and temperament \n     that Americans deserve from their judges, and also on whether \n     they indeed appreciate the vital, and yet vitally limited, \n     role of the Federal judiciary faithfully to interpret and \n     apply our laws, rather than seeking to impose their own \n     policy views.\n\n  As other editorial pages across the country have already done, the \nWashington Post today urges Senate Republicans to reject the \ndistortions of Judge Hamilton's record, and to heed Senator Lugar's \n``words of praise for Judge Hamilton's record, intellect and character \nand allow a vote, and then vote in favor of confirmation.'' I could not \nagree more.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of today's \neditorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From The Washington Post, Nov. 17, 2009]\n\n                      Giving Hypocrisy a Bad Name\n\n       During the Bush administration, Republicans decried \n     Democratic attempts to filibuster judicial nominees. Some \n     went so far as to label such filibuster attempts \n     unconstitutional and threatened to exercise the ``nuclear \n     option'' to ban the procedural tool in nomination matters.\n       Yet now Republicans are threatening to filibuster in an \n     attempt to thwart confirmation of President Obama's first \n     judicial nominee, Indiana federal Judge David F. Hamilton. \n     The Senate is scheduled to vote on cloture Tuesday on Judge \n     Hamilton's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     7th Circuit. The prospect of a filibuster is made all the \n     more ridiculous because Judge Hamilton has been rated ``well-\n     qualified'' by the American Bar Association, enjoys the \n     support of both home state senators, including Republican \n     Richard G. Lugar, and even wins praise from the conservative \n     Federalist Society of Indiana.\n       Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, ranking Republican on the \n     Judiciary Committee, has distorted Judge Hamilton's record on \n     the trial court in an effort to rally the GOP caucus. For \n     example, Mr. Sessions, arguing that Judge Hamilton is too \n     liberal, cites a case in which Judge Hamilton struck down as \n     unconstitutional sectarian Christian prayers in the Indiana \n     state house but allowed those that referred to Allah. Mr. \n     Sessions points out that the decision was overturned by the \n     court of appeals that Judge Hamilton now hopes to join.\n       But the senator fails to explain that Judge Hamilton \n     documented that 41 of the 53 invocations during the 2005 \n     session of the Indiana House were given by Christian clergy; \n     nine were delivered by elected officials; one each was said \n     by a Muslim imam, a Jewish rabbi and a layperson. Such a \n     lopsided tally, Judge Hamilton reasoned, could leave the \n     constitutionally unacceptable impression that Indiana \n     lawmakers favored one religion above all others. Judge \n     Hamilton explained in his written opinion that the ruling did \n     not ``prohibit the House from opening its session with \n     prayers if it chooses to do so, but will require that any \n     official prayers be inclusive and non-sectarian, and not \n     advance one particular religion.'' Mr. Sessions also fails to \n     note that the 7th Circuit reversed Judge Hamilton on \n     procedural grounds and not because it disagreed.\n       There are probably not the 40 votes needed to block Judge \n     Hamilton's nomination from reaching the floor. We hope that \n     Republicans in large numbers heed Mr. Lugar's words of praise \n     for Judge Hamilton's record, intellect and character and \n     allow a vote--and then vote in favor of confirmation. In this \n     instance, a vote for Judge Hamilton will be a vote to restore \n     much needed comity and integrity to the process--qualities \n     that the next Republican president will greatly appreciate \n     when his nominees are considered.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Senator Lugar believes Judge Hamilton ``is superbly \nqualified under both sets of criteria.'' I agree. I urge the Senate to \nreject these efforts and end this filibuster with a bipartisan vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a minute and a half remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right. I will briefly say that for the first time, \nI believe, in the history of the Senate, a number of President Bush's \nnominees were systematically filibustered. At 30 different times, \ncloture votes were required, and some failed, so the nominee did not go \nforward. That was unprecedented in the history of the Senate.\n  Now my colleagues say the dispute over that eventually got settled by \nthe fact that a group of 14 Senators said: We need a compromise, and \nthis is the compromise. You should not filibuster a Presidential \njudicial nomination unless there are extraordinary circumstances.\n  I opposed that. I have opposed filibusters before. But I do think \nsince we have had no debate on this nominee to date, and this nominee \nhas extraordinary statements in cases, and a record that indicates to \nme a lack of commitment to following the law--even though he is a \nperson with whom I have no problem as to character and intelligence and \nability, but I do not agree with his judicial philosophy--therefore, I \nbelieve this side cannot acquiesce to a precedent that says Democratic \nPresidents can get their judges confirmed with 51 votes; but if a \nRepublican President nominates a nominee, he has to have 60 votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is expired.\n\n[[Page S11420]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So I think we have changed the rule, unfortunately. I \nthink based on this situation, I will ask my colleagues not to support \ncloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to use some leader time now to \nspeak on a matter that will shortly be before the Senate.\n  As I indicated to you, the Chair, we will vote on advancing the \nnomination of a man named David Hamilton, a supremely qualified \nindividual who is already a district court judge from the State of \nIndiana. He has been an outstanding trial court judge, and he has been \nnominated by President Obama to be a judge in the Seventh Circuit. But, \nas many have heard here over this last hour or so--and you might have \nguessed simply if you have followed the Senate over the last 2 years--\nRepublicans would rather we didn't vote on this man, ever. They would \nrather that a critical seat such as this remain empty, but not because \nof who was nominated to fill that seat; Judge Hamilton's professional \nperformance has been exceptional. His qualifications are stupendous. He \nis widely admired on all sides because of his stellar judicial \nperformance and his fair judicial philosophy. Senators from that State, \nDemocrat Evan Bayh and the Republican, the long-serving Senator Richard \nLugar, strongly urge confirmation. He is a man who is respected.\n  It is unusual that we would have the Republicans focus on one opinion \nhe wrote dealing with religion. No one should ever second-guess this \nman's religious capacity.\n  He served as the attorney for Gov. Evan Bayh. His father is a 40-year \nminister of a large Methodist Church in Indianapolis in which Judge \nHamilton was baptized. Senator Lugar, the Republican senior Senator \nfrom Indiana, has called Judge Hamilton exactly the kind of person one \nwould want to see on the Federal bench. He has called him brilliant, \nfair, and committed to the law. I agree.\n  I have had the good fortune to serve in Congress with his uncle, Lee \nHamilton, a longtime-serving Member of the House of Representatives \nfrom Indiana, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee--really a \ngood person. Being a good person and being involved in public service \nruns in that family, obviously, because of Judge Hamilton and Chairman \nLee Hamilton.\n  The Federalist Society of Indiana, a strongly conservative \ninstitution--and that is an understatement--acknowledges that Judge \nHamilton is well within the mainstream of the law. The American Bar \nAssociation has rated him as high as anyone can be rated.\n  The solitary decision of his, that is, Judge Hamilton, with which the \nRepublicans claim to find fault is one in which Judge Hamilton stood \nfor the separation of church and state, a principle protected by the \nfirst words of our Constitution's first amendment.\n  The reason most Republicans object to advancing his nomination has \nnothing to do with Judge Hamilton himself and everything to do with \npure partisanship. Such shortsightedness is the reason why, even though \nthe Judiciary Committee approved Judge Hamilton back in early June--he \nwas nominated in April--he has had to wait 166 days for this procedural \nvote and it has had to be forced upon the Senate. We have a lot of \nthings to do here in this body. It is very unfortunate we had to file \ncloture on a judge.\n  Judge Hamilton is far from the first victim of this partisan strategy \nto slow and stall the Senate. We have had that happen over 90 times \nalready this year. In fact, Republican Senators have made a habit of \nobjecting to the least objectionable nominees of President Obama's. The \nSenate has so far confirmed six judges for the court of appeals and the \ndistrict court. Five of them were reported out of committee by voice \nvote. That means they were so obviously qualified that the committee \ndidn't even feel the need to have a rollcall vote. When they reached \nthe Senate floor, four of those five passed unanimously by votes of 88 \nto 0, 97 to 0, 99 to 0, and 100 to 0. Yet Republicans forced us to \nwait, wait, and wait for all of those votes in the first place. They \ndid so for no other reason than to waste the American people's time.\n  I was stunned to hear my friend from Alabama say we haven't had \nenough time to debate this man. We have offered consent agreements, we \nhave talked to everyone: How much time do you want? You can have it. We \nhaven't had a debate on this nominee because we had to file cloture. \nThe Republicans didn't want a debate on it. This is how the Republicans \nhave forced the Senate to operate. It is not how it always works or how \nit should work. When President Bush was in office, as we have heard the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee say on many occasions, the \nDemocratic majority in the Senate confirmed three times as many \nnominees as we have been able to confirm in the same amount of time \nunder President Obama.\n  Let's be clear. We are not yet voting on whether to confirm Judge \nHamilton for this important position. Our votes today simply indicate \nwhether we believe the judge, Judge Hamilton, deserves an up-or-down \nvote before the full Senate.\n  The votes of each Senator today will demonstrate whether he or she \nbelieves in the Senate's power as outlined in our Constitution to \nadvise and give its consent to the President's nominations to the \nFederal bench.\n  Going to law school was a very good experience for me. It was not \nlike undergraduate school. It wasn't how much you could memorize. For \nthose of us who endured law school, we did more than learn about \nobscure facts and learn rigid legal rules; we analyzed the abstract \nthinking behind our laws and the logic out of which our great judicial \nsystem grew. That is what law school is all about. That is what lawyers \ntrain to do--think abstractly lots of times.\n  One of the very first principles I learned in law school--and I still \nhave it in my mind--was following precedent. I believe in what we call \nstare decisis. It is how we maintain consistency in our court rulings, \nand it is a cornerstone of the common law we brought over from Great \nBritain when we became a country. Precedent is a simple notion: Once a \nrule has been established, we must apply that standard to all future \ncases in which the facts are similar to the first. This concept \npredates our courts, our Constitution, and even our country. Every \naspiring lawyer studied it and every judge considers it when deciding a \ncase.\n  The future of that same legal system rests before the Senate today. \nIn the Senate, as in the law, what we say in this Chamber and in the \npublic record should set the precedent for our own actions. That is why \nthe Parliamentarians who serve us so well understand the precedents. We \nask them a question, and they follow the precedent.\n  Here is what has been decided in the Senate previously. The record is \nreplete with my Republican colleagues--including Members of the \nRepublican leadership today and the Judiciary Committee--speaking about \nthe solemn responsibility of the Senate to confirm judges. In other \nwords, the record is replete with precedent.\n  For example, my counterpart, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, \nthe Republican leader, has argued strongly that the present judicial \nnomination deserves a simple up-or-down vote. He reminded the Senate of \nthat not long ago; in fact, it was May of 2005. He said that our job is \nto give our advice and consent and not, as he put it in May 2005, and I \nquote, ``advise and obstruct.'' I agree. Two years earlier, my \ndistinguished counterpart said that filibustering judges--which is \nexactly what is happening right now at a record pace--is ``a terrible \nprecedent.'' I sincerely hope the Republican leader heeds his own words \nand doesn't repeat the very obstruction he condemned in the past.\n\n  The ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the junior Senator \nfrom Alabama, has also rightly called the filibustering of judicial \nnominations ``obstructionism,'' and that is his word. He has said it is \n``very painful,'' and he has described it as ``a very, very grim \nthing.'' He is right.\n\n[[Page S11421]]\n\n  The Senator from Alabama went further to say the following:\n\n       We ought to be pleased that a nominee has cared enough \n     about his or her country to speak out about issues that come \n     before the country.\n\n  I agree. I share the belief that those who have chosen to serve our \nNation must be able to get to work without delay. I hope the gratitude \nof the Senator from Alabama will be reflected in his vote this \nafternoon.\n  The Republican whip, the junior Senator from Arizona, has expressed \nsimilar disgust with judicial filibusters such as the one we are seeing \ntoday. In November of 2003, he said:\n\n       It is time to take politics out of the confirmation \n     process, give nominees the up-or-down vote they deserve, and \n     move the orderly process of justice forward.\n\n  He, too, is right. I hope the Senator from Arizona will consider that \norderly process when he votes on advancing Judge Hamilton's nomination \na few minutes from now.\n  The senior Republican Senator from Utah, who has served as chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee three separate times and still sits on that \ndistinguished panel, also spoke out strongly against filibustering \njudges. He said in 2005 that doing so ``undermines democracy, the \njudiciary, the Senate, and the Constitution.'' And it does. I hope the \nSenator from Utah doesn't contribute to such affronts by voting no \ntoday.\n  Another Republican Senator, the senior Senator from Iowa, who also \nserves on the Judiciary Committee, warned in 2003 that filibustering \njudges would lead to ``a constitutional crisis.'' I agree with him. I \nhope he helps us avert a filibuster and avoids a crisis by voting yes \ntoday for Judge Hamilton.\n\n  Another Republican Senator, the junior Senator from Texas, who served \non the Judiciary Committee and was a supreme court justice in Texas, \nsaid in 2006 he hopes the filibuster of judicial nominees ``should \nnever happen again, and that all nominees of a President are entitled \nto an up-or-down vote.'' That was a few years ago. He called what \nRepublicans are doing today ``an abomination'' and ``the most virulent \nform of unnecessary delay one can imagine.'' The same Senator also said \non the Senate floor that he finds it ``simply baffling that a Senator \nwould vote against even voting on a judicial nomination.'' I find it \nbaffling, also. I sincerely hope the Senator from Texas will not delay \nus unnecessarily by supporting his party's filibuster. I could go on \nwith a lot more quotes. It was interesting this morning. I listen to \nNational Public Radio. There was a nice piece on there talking about \nwhat the Republicans are doing here, and it had the actual voices of \nthe Senators. I cannot give the voices, but that was done on public \nradio, where they had the voices of the Senators saying things such as \nI have read today.\n  I could go on and on. For example, another Republican Senator, the \nsenior Senator from Kansas, has said that forcing supermajorities to \nconfirm nominees--which is what a filibuster does--is inappropriate.\n  Another Republican Senator, the senior Senator from Idaho--and by the \nway, his brother was a law school professor at Brigham Young \nUniversity, where my son-in-law went to law school. My son-in-law has a \nwonderful mind, and he said he was the best professor he ever had and \nthe smartest he ever had. Unfortunately, he died as a very young man. \nThe senior Senator from Idaho said: ``It turns the Constitution on its \nhead and begins a very dangerous precedent with regard to how the \nnominees for the judicial branch are treated by the Senate.''\n  He talked about what a filibuster does. Again, my Republican friends \nare right. I hope the Senators from Idaho and Kansas will make sure \nfilibusters still have no place in the confirmation process, and I hope \nthey don't make such a practice precedent. They can do so by voting yes \ntoday.\n  Every single Senator may vote either for or against the nomination as \nhe or she sees fit. That right will never be in jeopardy. But that is \nnot the issue before us today. The question before us is whether the \nPresident of the United States deserves to have his nominees reviewed \nby the Senate, as the Constitution demands he does.\n  I feel so strongly about what took place a few years ago. We could go \nback and debate whether President Bush's nominations--whether he should \nhave gotten more than what he did. We know he got hundreds of them. As \nI said on the floor, the point is, what the Republicans were going to \ndo--a very slight majority--is they were going to do away with \nprecedent, with filibusters in the Senate. I said at that time, if they \ndid that and I ever came into a position of authority, I would never \nreverse it. I felt that strongly about it. If the Republicans would \nmake us do what I think is wrong--that is, vote on cloture on all these \nnominations--it will take a lot of time and it is not fair. We should \nnot do that.\n  I only say to my friends that very few judges were held up by the \nDemocrats when we were in the minority. Some were held up. Regardless, \nwhen I took this job in 1998--when I was elected to a leadership \nposition--I said we should treat the Republicans as we would like to be \ntreated, which is the Golden Rule. When we got the majority, I said the \nsame thing. That is how I feel about it. Let's go by the Golden Rule in \nthe Senate. Let's treat judicial nominees the way they would want them \ntreated if the roles were reversed. I hope we can do that.\n  That is not the issue before us today. The issue today is whether the \nPresident of the United States deserves to have his nominees get a vote \nup or down. The question before us is whether the President deserves to \nhave his nominees reviewed by the Senate, as the Constitution demands \nhe does.\n  The question before the Senate is whether the nominees themselves \ndeserve to be confirmed or rejected based on their judicial philosophy, \ntheir experience, moral turpitude, and whatever else people decide they \ndon't like--their looks or they are too old or too young, whatever. But \nit should be on that person's qualifications as seen by the individual \nSenators.\n  The question is whether Senators who publicly demand up-or-down votes \nwhen it is politically convenient will follow the precedents they set \nfor themselves, even when it is not. The vote we are about to hold will \ngive us that answer. I hope we will have a large vote on being able to \nproceed to this nomination, and I hope we don't get into this situation \nwhere, out of spite--because there has always been plenty of time to \ndebate this man--postcloture we have to wait 30 hours to confirm the \nnomination. That would not look good for this body, and I hope it is \nnot necessary.\n  Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, as I address this Chamber today, there is \na broad consensus across the country that our health care system is \nbroken. It simply doesn't work for Americans anymore. Everyone agrees \nthat we need real comprehensive health care reform. In order to \naccomplish this, I believe we must include a strong public option to \nrestore competition, cost savings, and accountability to the health \ncare insurance industry. In fact, I have stated before that I will not \nvote for any reform measure that fails to include a strong public \noption.\n  A few of my colleagues are still not convinced. Some have honest \nquestions. But there are others who are not interested in winning this \nargument on the merits. A few of my colleagues across the aisle are \ntrying to stop this Congress from passing any health care reform at \nall. Some of my distinguished Republican friends have said our \nproposals are simply too expensive. They say a trillion dollars is too \nhigh a price to pay for a better health care system.\n  I beg to differ. We already pay far too much for health care. Our \nreform bill would reduce costs over the long term. It would allow \nconsumers to hold insurance companies accountable for the first time in \nmany years. It would restore real competition to markets that are \ncurrently monopolized by a few big corporations. It would accomplish \nall of that without adding to the budget deficit. Yet my colleagues \ncontinue to insist that health care reform would be too expensive. \nDespite the number of Americans suffering under our broken system, they \nwant to talk about fiscal responsibility instead of health care reform. \nMy Republican friends have simply lost their credibility when it comes \nto this issue. They say they would not support reform that will save \nlives and improve health outcomes for millions because it costs too \nmuch. Yet under a Republican President, they were willing to write \nbigger and bigger checks to benefit the wealthy.\n  In 2001, when President Bush asked Congress to pass tax cuts that \nmostly helped the super rich, the total cost came to $1.35 trillion \nover 10 years. That is more than $300 billion more than our health care \nreform bill, and it provided significant benefits to far fewer \nAmericans.\n\n  More than half of the current Republican caucus was serving in the \nSenate at the time of this vote. Did they try to block the bill? Did \nthey stand up and say: $1.3 trillion for the super rich--that is \nwasteful, irresponsible, and far too costly? No, they did not.\n  When President Bush called, they answered. My Republican friends \nvoted in favor of this massive spending program, even though it added \nmore than $1 trillion to the deficit.\n  Many of the same people now want to put the brakes on a deficit-\nneutral health care reform bill designed to help millions of ordinary \nAmericans.\n  Later in 2003, just as this country began to spend hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to conduct two wars, President Bush asked for yet \nanother tax cut. This tax cut also benefited the richest of the rich \nand added $330 billion more to the deficit.\n  But did my distinguished Republican colleagues urge fiscal \nresponsibility? Did they demand that the President explain how he would \nfinance the wars or balance the budget before they voted on another \nmassive tax cut? No, they did not. Their vocal support for fiscal \nresponsibility was nowhere to be found. Once again, they voted \noverwhelmingly for the second round of tax cuts.\n  Yet as I address this Chamber today, a few of the same Senators are \ndoing everything they can to stop us from passing health care reform.\n  I would urge the American people to consult the record for \nthemselves. The same voices that now oppose extending health care \ncoverage actually supported spending significantly more money to pad \nthe bank accounts of the richest people in this country.\n  It is the same story for expensive programs such as Medicare Part D. \nMore than half of the Republicans still in the Senate voted for $400 \nbillion of new spending back in 2003. Almost all of these distinguished \nSenators voted time and again to fund the ongoing wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, which have cost the American taxpayers more than $1 \ntrillion and far too many American lives.\n  I do not mean to suggest every single one of these spending programs \nwas a bad idea. But I would like to point out that when my Republican \ncolleagues talk about ``fiscal responsibility,'' they are talking about \nan issue on which they have lost their credibility. They recklessly \nadded trillions of dollars to the deficit under a Republican President, \nbut today they oppose health care reform even though it will be paid \nfor by cost offsets. Their actions simply do not match their words. \nThey are placing cynical politics ahead of good policy.\n  So I have a question for my Republican friends who have been Members\n\n[[Page S11423]]\n\nof this Senate since 2001: If they supported almost $2 trillion of \ndeficit spending for tax relief for the rich, then, I ask them, exactly \nhow much are we allowed to spend for health care that will benefit \nmillions of people across this country?\n  Mr. President, 45,000 Americans die every single year because they do \nnot have insurance and cannot get the quality care they need. Without \ncompetition in the industry, insurance companies have raised premiums, \ndenied benefits, and refused coverage to millions. So I ask my \ncolleagues: How much is too much for this Congress to spend to save \nthese lives?\n  My colleagues like to talk about responsibility, so I put it to them \nthat the only responsible course of action is to pass this health care \nbill, and pass it now. That is the reaction we need.\n  Unfortunately, there are some in this Chamber who are not interested \nin addressing the issue of health care reform. There are some who do \nnot want to have an honest, open debate on the subject. They want to \nkick the can further down the road, as our predecessors have done time \nand time again for the last 100 years.\n  That would be the easy answer--to leave it to someone else to solve \nthe difficult problem of health care reform after the problem has \ngotten even worse, to settle for the status quo or put a band-aid on a \ngaping wound and hope that future legislators will muster the political \nwill that a century of lawmakers has lacked. There are some in this \nbody who would settle for this.\n  But I believe the American people deserve better. Especially in \ndifficult times, they demand better of their representatives in \nCongress. So I say to my colleagues, as great leaders have said to us \ntime and time again throughout our history: Let's seize this moment to \ndo what is right, not what is easy. Let's summon the will to succeed \nwhere others have failed.\n  It is time to deliver on meaningful health care reform. It is time \nfor competition, cost savings, and accountability in the insurance \nindustry. It is time to be honest with the American people.\n  Friends, colleagues--Republicans and Democrats--this is no time for \npartisan games and empty rhetoric. This is time for action. Millions of \nAmericans are counting on us to make health care reform a reality, and \nwe must not let them down. I will say that again. We must not let them \ndown.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of Judge David \nHamilton to be a Seventh Circuit Appeals Court judge. I have serious \nconcerns about this nomination and will be voting not to confirm him.\n  During his time as a Federal judge on the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of Indiana, Judge Hamilton has issued a number of \nhighly controversial rulings and, more importantly, has been reversed \nin some very prominent cases. In my opinion, these decisions strongly \nindicate that Judge Hamilton is an activist judge who will ignore the \nlaw in favor of his own personal ideology and beliefs.\n  For example, in one case, Judge Hamilton succeeded in blocking \nenforcement of an informed consent law for 7 years. In that case, \ncalled A Woman's Choice v. Newman, Judge Hamilton struck down an \nIndiana law requiring that certain medical information be given to a \nwoman in person before an abortion can be performed. The Seventh \nCircuit overruled Judge Hamilton's decision, stating:\n\n       For 7 years, Indiana law has been prevented from enforcing \n     a statute materially identical to a law held valid by the \n     Supreme Court in Casey, by this court in Karlin, and by the \n     Fifth Circuit in Barnes. No court anywhere in the country \n     (other than one district judge in Indiana) has held any \n     similar law invalid in the years since Casey . . . Indiana \n     (like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) is entitled to put its law \n     into effect and have that law judged by its own consequences.\n\n  That was the circuit court overturning Judge Hamilton. It seems to me \nthat Judge Hamilton went out of his way to make his finding and \nactually block the Indiana law. That is not the proper role of a judge.\n  In addition, Judge Hamilton has shown hostility against the \nexpression of religion in the public square. In two prominent cases, he \nruled against public prayer in the State legislature and religious \ndisplays in public buildings, and in both cases he was reversed. In the \ncase of Hinrichs v. Bosma, Judge Hamilton enjoined the speaker of the \nIndiana house of representatives from permitting sectarian prayer. \nJudge Hamilton ruled that the Indiana State legislature was prohibited \nfrom starting its session with prayers, specifically those that \nexpressly mentioned Jesus Christ, but that it would be permissible for \na prayer to mention Allah. The Seventh Circuit overturned Judge \nHamilton's decision in Hinrichs, and subsequently the Indiana house \npassed a resolution 85-to-0 opposing Judge Hamilton's ruling.\n  Then in Grossbaum v. Indianapolis-Marion County Building Authority, \nJudge Hamilton ruled that a county could prohibit the display of a \nmenorah in a nonpublic forum. The Seventh Circuit unanimously reversed \nJudge Hamilton, noting that the judge disregarded relevant Supreme \nCourt precedent to reach his ruling and that he failed to recognize a \nrabbi's first amendment right to display the menorah as symbolic \nreligious speech.\n  Judge Hamilton also ignored clear statutory mandate so he could \nimpose his own personal beliefs when sentencing criminal defendants. \nExample: In the 2008 case U.S. v. Woolsey, Judge Hamilton disregarded \nan earlier conviction in order to avoid imposing a life sentence on a \nrepeat drug offender. The Seventh Circuit reversed the decision, \nadmonishing Judge Hamilton, specifically stating that he was ``not free \nto ignore'' prior conviction because ``statutory penalties for \nrecidivism . . . are not optional, even if the court deems them unwise \nor an inappropriate response to repeat drug offenders.''\n  In another case, U.S. v. Rinehart, Judge Hamilton used his court \nopinion to request clemency for a police officer who pled guilty to two \ncounts of producing child pornography. In this case, the police officer \nhad engaged in and videotaped ``consensual'' sex with two teenagers.\n  In addition, in writings and speeches, Judge Hamilton has indicated \nthat he approves of the concept that judges should make policy from the \nbench. For example, he has embraced President Obama's empathy standard, \na standard so radical that even the new Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor \nhad to rebuke it at her confirmation hearings. In response to written \nquestions for his confirmation hearing, Judge Hamilton answered this \nway:\n\n       Federal judges take an oath to administer justice without \n     respect to persons, and to do equal right to the poor and to \n     the rich. Empathy--to be distinguished from sympathy--is \n     important in fulfilling that oath. Empathy is the ability to \n     understand the world from another person's point of view. A \n     judge needs to empathize with all parties in cases--plaintiff \n     and defendant, crime victims and accused defendant--so that \n     the judge can better understand how the parties came to be \n     before the court and how legal rules affect those parties and \n     others in similar situations.\n\n  To empathize with the parties is not the proper role of a judge. \nRather, the proper role of a judge is to apply the law to the facts in \nan impartial manner, and that is what we refer to as blind justice.\n  Further, in a 2003 speech, Judge Hamilton endorsed the idea that the \nrole of a judge includes ``writing footnotes to the Constitution'' \nthrough evolving case law. He said:\n\n       Judge S. Hugh Dillin of this court has said that part of \n     our job here as judges is to write a series of footnotes to \n     the Constitution. We all do that every year in cases large \n     and small.\n\n  Oddly enough, the last time I checked, it was the role of Congress to \nwrite laws, not the judicial branch. Judge Hamilton's personal bias has \nbeen noted by lawyers who practice before him. In fact, statements of \nlocal practitioners in the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary described \nJudge Hamilton as ``the most lenient of any judges in the district.'' \nAnother quote: ``One of the more liberal judges of the district.'' \nAnother quote: ``Goes out of his way to make the defendant \ncomfortable.'' Another quote: ``He is your\n\n[[Page S11424]]\n\nbest chance for downward departures.'' Lastly, ``in sentencing, he \ntends to be very empathetic to the downtrodden, or to those who commit \ncrimes due to poverty.''\n  Contrary to how the White House has tried to characterize Judge \nHamilton, I believe that the record amply demonstrates that Judge \nHamilton is an activist judge. He has taken radical positions, and a \nnumber of his rulings indicate that Judge Hamilton will impose his own \npersonal beliefs and values in cases. We should not promote an \nindividual whose track record clearly demonstrates that he will carry \nout an outside-of-the-mainstream personal agenda on the Federal appeals \ncourt. For these reasons, I will oppose the nomination of Judge \nHamilton to the Seventh Circuit. If he was going to serve on a circuit, \nas many times as he has been overruled, it would be more appropriate \nfor him to be on the Ninth Circuit, where a lot of those decisions on \nappeal are overturned by the Supreme Court--about 9 times out of 10.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             National Debt\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, the clock has struck 12 on a $12 trillion \ndebt. Like Cinderella when she was revealed when the clock struck 12, \nthis Congress is now revealed--revealed for the problem it has in \nspending more than we can afford. We are being a body and an \ninstitution that spends money without thinking about the future of this \ngreat country. It spends the money of our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  It took this country 193 years to spend a trillion dollars and to get \na trillion dollars into debt. We are now $12 trillion into debt as of \ntoday. That $12 trillion is the equivalent of $40,000 per person, \n$107,000 per household. This is what American families are now \nresponsible for, because unlike American families who sit around their \nkitchen tables and try to make ends meet, and unlike the States that \nhave to balance their budgets, this Congress spends more than it has. \nThere is no evaluation in this Congress about how much money is being \ntaken in versus how much money we spend.\n  Instead, we raised this year $1.4 trillion in debt, more debt in a \nsingle year than the past 4 years combined.\n  Outside this Chamber, outside the main entrance, is a clock, called \nthe Ohio Clock--the fabled clock that has been in this institution for \nmore than a hundred years. It stands there to tell the time. I suggest \nthat standing next to that clock should be the debt clock to remind the \nMembers of this Senate, and perhaps our friends in the House, that we \nare spending money we cannot afford to spend, and it is risking the \nfuture of our children and grandchildren.\n  As you know, I have three small boys, Max, Taylor, and Chase, 6, 4, \nand 2, and a baby on the way. We worry for their future--just like \nAmericans across this country and my fellow Floridians are worrying for \nthe future of their children. How can we afford this and continue to \nspend more than we have?\n  I have been coming to the floor weekly to talk about the various \nappropriation bills I have been voting on--and, frankly, voting \nagainst--because they spend more and more of the people's money and put \nthis country further into debt.\n  Today, we have marked this occasion with $12 trillion in debt--an \namount of money that is hard to fathom, an amount of money that is so \nlarge it is hard to comprehend. But we know that every family in \nAmerica is now responsible--every household--for $107,000. That debt \nnow rides upon their shoulders.\n  In a week--perhaps even this week--Democrats in the Chamber are going \nto introduce a health care reform bill that is estimated to spend \nanother $1 trillion. This bill will raise taxes, cut Medicare, and \nincrease premiums--another large governmental program, when we cannot \nafford the programs we have. We should focus on spending the money we \nhave, spending it more efficiently and effectively, before we go on to \ncreate a new program, a new bureaucracy, and more obligations than we \ncan afford.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the health care plan \nbeing brought forth by the Democrats in this Chamber will spend 24.5 \npercent of GDP, 19 percent in revenue only. So we have 19 percent in \nrevenue, but 24.5 percent of GDP, which is a huge unsustainable gap. It \nwas recently reported that the deficit for October alone is $176 \nbillion--$26 billion more than estimates by economists. In fact, the \ndebt increased by $40 billion just over this past weekend.\n  Our spending is out of control. The Federal Government does not \nrecognize it. This Congress cannot afford the programs it has, let \nalone the programs it wants. So I am here to sound the alarm. I could \nnot let this day pass as we hit this $12 trillion mark in national \ndebt.\n  I look forward to coming back to the floor to explain again and again \nto the American people that this is a problem that must be solved. We \ncannot continue to spend our children's and grandchildren's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        IN PRAISE OF ANN AZEVEDO\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise once more to honor an outstanding \nFederal employee.\n  Next week, American families will gather around dinner tables in \ncelebration of Thanksgiving.\n  Thanksgiving is a time for coming together. In earlier ages, members \nof an extended family usually resided in close proximity to one \nanother. Today, however, the typical American family is spread across \nthe country, with members far in distance even if close in spirit.\n  Americans of all backgrounds and from all walks of life will be \ntravelling long distances to be with their loved ones. It is no wonder \nthat Thanksgiving weekend is one of the busiest travel periods of the \nyear.\n  Tens of millions of us will be driving, flying, and taking trains or \nferries next week. For some it will be stressful, for others exciting. \nMost, though, will do it without even realizing how much work goes into \nkeeping American travelers safe.\n  The Department of Transportation employee whose story I will share \ntoday has been instrumental in ensuring the safety of those who travel. \nBut before I tell you about this outstanding public servant, I want to \nreflect on how important transportation is for America.\n  From its humble beginnings, ours has been a Nation on the move. In \nGeorge Washington's day, their mercantile spirit drove our founding \ngeneration to dig canals and clear roads across the Appalachians. \nSteamships and railroads fueled the expansion across the West and \nhelped close the frontier. Air travel in the last century brought every \ncorner of our 50 States ever closer and opened new opportunities for \nthe growth of business and tourism.\n  This march of progress in transportation technology has not been a \nsmooth ride. When the railroads were new, train wrecks were fairly \ncommon. In fact, President-Elect Franklin Pierce was en route to \nWashington for his inauguration when his train derailed, tragically \nkilling his 11-year-old son.\n  Travel by ferry or steamship on our rivers and lakes was far from \nsafe in those days. For pioneer families, roads were often impassible \nduring wintertime, and many lost their lives just trying to get to the \nWest. While air travel is the safest form of transportation in our day, \nit was not always the case.\n  Making sure that our Nation's ``planes, trains, and automobiles'' are \nsafe remains one of our highest priorities. My home State of Delaware, \nlike every other State--like Montana--depends on a top-notch \ntransportation infrastructure to facilitate economic activity, moving \npeople and goods across markets.\n  Travel can and should be a safe and fun experience. No one should \never have to worry that the vehicles on our roads, rails, rivers, or in \nour skies are unsafe. That is where the hardworking men and women of \nthe Department of\n\n[[Page S11425]]\n\nTransportation excel. They set and enforce regulations upholding the \nstrictest standards in transportation safety.\n  The great Federal employee I have chosen to recognize this week has \nbeen a leader on safety issues at the Transportation Department's \nFederal Aviation Administration for 12 years.\n  Ann Azevedo came to the department in 1997 with nearly two decades of \nexperience in the private sector. Working from the FAA facility in \nBurlington, MA, when she first started at the FAA, Ann served as the \nrisk analysis specialist for the Engine and Propeller Directorate.\n  In her current role as chief scientific and technical adviser for \naircraft safety analysis, Ann focuses on safety, risk management, and \nanalyzing accidents. From the data she gathers, Ann is able to develop \nsolutions to help prevent future incidents.\n  Regularly representing the FAA at national and international air \nsafety round-tables, Ann has become a respected voice among those \nengaged in risk management analysis. She helped write the training \nmanuals for turbofan and turboprop aircraft used across the industry, \nand she continues to teach risk analysis at the FAA Academy.\n  Ann holds a bachelor's degree in systems planning and management in \napplied mathematics and a master's of science in mechanical \nengineering. When she was once asked how she ended up in her chosen \ncareer field, Ann cited her love of math and an influential physics \nteacher in high school.\n  Ann was awarded the Arthur S. Flemming Award for public service in \n2002 for developing safety solutions that resulted in a 64 percent \ndecrease in the commercial aviation fatality rate between 1998 and \n2002. She also was honored as Distinguished Engineer of the Year by the \nAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineering in 1996.\n  Her work, and that of all her colleagues at the FAA and other \nTransportation Department agencies, helps ensure that travel in our \ncountry continues to be as safe as possible.\n  Most importantly, they facilitate the smiles of those arriving safely \nat a journey's end and seeing their loved ones for the first time after \nweeks, months, or even years apart.\n  That remains a central element of Thanksgiving, and I hope all \nAmericans will join me in thanking Ann Azevedo and all the men and \nwomen of the Department of Transportation for their hard work keeping \nAmerican travelers safe.\n  They keep us, whether on the road, on the rails, at sea, or in the \nsky, moving ever forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I wish to \nremember victims of the horrific shootings at Fort Hood. This was a \nsenseless attack on innocent people who were serving their country. To \nknow that these people, 12 servicemembers and 1 civilian, were taken \nfrom their families in this way is very difficult to accept. I join \nwith people across the country in mourning these tragic deaths. My \nthoughts are with each and every one of their families.\n  As a Senator from Wisconsin, I do feel a special duty to remember the \ntwo Wisconsinites who were killed. Both were extraordinary members of \nour Armed Forces, and their deaths are a terrible blow to all who knew \nthem, and to our State. Wisconsin takes so much pride in its long \ntraditon of military service, and in the Wisconsinites who serve so \nbravely in the Armed Forces today. Wisconsin has already lost so many \nservicemembers in recent years--90 in Operation Iraqi Freedom and 12 in \nOperation Enduring Freedom. We recently honored our veterans by \ncelebrating Veterans Day, and we are thinking of these men and women \nand the sacrifice they made, so to suffer these additional losses at \nthis time is simply tragic.\n  SSG Amy Krueger from Kiel, WI, and CPT Russell Seager from Mount \nPleasant, WI, were both outstanding servicemembers, and their families \nand communities are heartbroken by their deaths.\n  Staff Sergeant Krueger, who was just 29, joined the Army after the \n2001 terrorist attacks. She had deployed previously to Afghanistan in \n2003 and helped soldiers dealing with combat stress. Staff Sergeant \nKrueger arrived at Fort Hood on November 3 and was scheduled to be \nredeployed to Afghanistan in December. She graduated from Kiel High \nSchool in 1998 and was very proud to serve her country. About 500 \nfamily and friends gathered recently at the Veterans Memorial Park in \nKiel to remember and pay tribute to Sergeant Krueger.\n  CPT Russell Seager, 47, was a registered nurse and advanced practice \nnurse prescriber who was with the primary care mental health \nintegration program at Zablocki VA Medical Center in Milwaukee. He also \ntaught classes at Bryant and Stratton College in Milwaukee. As part of \nthe combat stress control unit, Seager was tasked with watching for \nwarning signs among soldiers on the front lines that could signal long-\nterm mental health problems. He is survived by his wife and adult son.\n  It is so tragic to think that these two people, who were trained to \nhelp fellow servicemembers cope with the stress of combat, were struck \ndown when their help is needed the most. These servicemembers are \nreally unsung heros of our military today--the men and women who help \nother servicemembers deal with post traumatic stress disorder, which \nhas skyrocketed since the start of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nBoth Staff Sergeant Krueger and Captain Seager were truly selfless \npeople who helped their fellow servicemembers through some very tough \ntimes. Both were part of the 467th Medical Detachment, which is based \nin Madison, WI. It is an outstanding unit doing much-needed work, and \nit is terrible that the unit suffered these losses.\n  I also want to say a few words about the four Wisconsinites who were \ninjured at Fort Hood. At the recent memorial at Fort Hood, which was \nsuch a moving tribute to those who were killed, I had the privilege of \nmeeting Specialist John Pagel, 28, of North Freedom, WI, who was also \nwith the 467th Medical Detachment. Specialist Pagel is married and has \ntwo children.\n  I also had the privilege of meeting SPC Grant Moxon, 23, of Lodi, WI, \nanother member of the 467th, who is a mental health specialist. \nSpecialist Moxon graduated from UW-La Crosse. He joined the military \njust last year and had arrived in Texas one day before the shooting \nincident.\n  Both Sergeant Pagel and Specialist Moxon were shot but are now both \ndoing well.\n  CPT Dorothy ``Dorrie'' Carskadon, 47, of Madison, WI, is also a \nmember of the 467th. Carskadon fought with the Army in Iraq during \nOperation Desert Storm and then enlisted in the Army Reserve 2 years \nago. She is a clinical social worker with the U.S. Army Reserve. She \nwas set to deploy to Iraq to counsel troops suffering from PTSD. She \nwas shot twice in the hip and underwent an all-night surgery. \nFortunately, she is expected to make a full recovery.\n  Army PFC Amber Bahr, 19, of Random Lake, WI, with the 187th medical \nbattalion, has been at Fort Hood for a year working as an Army \nnutritionist. She was scheduled to deploy for the first time in \nJanuary. In the midst of the shootings, Bahr was putting a tourniquet \nonto another soldier and helping him out of harm's way before she \ndiscovered that she was shot herself. She was released Friday night \nfrom the hospital.\n  I think the conduct of Private First Class Bahr, and everyone at the \nbase who responded to the attack with such heroism, says volumes about \nthe men and women who serve today. I am so proud of them, and so \nprofoundly saddened by this attack. As the nation grieves, we offer \nheartfelt thanks to all\n\n[[Page S11426]]\n\nthe brave servicemembers who so selflessly serve our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/17/senate-section/article/S11426-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTE EXPLANATIONS\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, I am pleased to have worked \nwith Senator Hatch, and my other colleagues in the Senate to \nunanimously pass the Feed America Day resolution.\n  Over the past several years, States, cities, and communities \nthroughout the country have declared the Thursday before Thanksgiving \nas Feed America Day. In observance of this day, citizens are encouraged \nto sacrifice two meals and donate the money they would have spent on \nfood to a local religious or charitable organization for the purpose of \nfeeding the hungry.\n  As the economic downturn has struck our nation, employment rates have \ndropped and more and more families have had to turn to food banks and \nother emergency food services to meet their day-to-day needs. Our \nemergency food providers are being stretched to their limits to try to \nmeet the current demand for assistance. Vicki Metheny, a constituent of \nmine who has run the food bank in San Juan County, NM for the last 18 \nyears, told my office earlier this week that this is the first time in \nher years of service that she has been really worried about whether the \nfood bank will be able to keep up with the unprecedented need in local \ncommunities. A similar message is coming from food pantries and \nemergency food providers across the country.\n  As we approach the Thanksgiving festivities, it is my hope that \nindividuals will take the time to think of those in their community who \nmay be struggling to keep food on the table. To miss a few meals and \nmake a modest donation to a local food pantry is a small thing, but if \nmany of us join together in this effort, we can have a large impact. \nAnd a large impact is what we must have if we are to keep our families \nand food pantries afloat this year.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, last year more than \n49 million Americans, including almost 17 million children, live in \nhouseholds with either ``low'' or ``very low'' food security, meaning \nthat these households cannot keep healthy food on the table without the \nassistance of Federal programs or local emergency food providers. In my \nhome State of New Mexico, food insecurity impacts over 14 percent of \nthe population.\n  There are many efforts underway at the Federal level and at the local \nlevel to build up the economy and create opportunities for families to \nbecome more financially stable. This resolution is just one reminder \nthat there is a need for assistance in each of our communities, and \nthat each of us can and should take steps to confront hunger locally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/17/senate-section/article/S11426-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    HONORING JERRY AND ANITA ZUCKER\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of a dedicated public servant and leader, Jerry \nZucker. I also ask that we pay tribute to Jerry's wife Anita. After a \nlifetime of unprecedented service to his State and Nation as a \nbusinessman and philanthropist, Mr. Zucker passed away in Charleston, \nSC, on April 12, 2008, at the age of 58. His death was a loss to \nCharleston and the Nation.\n  While he will be remembered by most as a successful businessman, I \nwill remember him as a larger-than-life figure who donated generously \nand quietly to many causes. Born in Tel-Aviv, Isreal, Mr. Zucker came \nto the United States with his family in 1952. He grew up in Charleston, \nSC, and Jacksonville, FL, and graduated from the University of Florida \nwith a triple major in mathematics, chemistry, and physics. He later \nreceived a masters in electrical engineering from Florida State \nUniversity in Tallahassee, FL. Zucker was a scientist and inventor \nbefore becoming a businessman. Over his lifetime he had more than 350 \ninventions and patents, including his development of the pacemaker.\n  In 1983, he founded the InterTech Group, a global conglomerate \nspecializing in fabrics and plastics for a range of uses. As founder, \nchairman, and chief executive officer of the company, he helped grow \nthe InterTech Group into one of the country's largest privately held \nbusinesses. Jerry was also CEO of Toronto-based Hudson's Bay Company, \nCanada's largest department store chain. He was the first American \ncitizen to lead the company. After his death, Anita took over as \nchairwoman and chief executive officer of Hudson's Bay Company. She \nbecame the first woman to hold the position in the company's 338-year \nhistory.\n  Jerry is greatly admired for what he did outside of the business \nworld. Jerry was a humble philanthropist. He gave millions of dollars \nto a wide range of charities, from his synagogue in Charleston to \ninternational medical missions. Anyone who reached out to him for help \nnever went away with an empty hand. And for every charitable check \nZucker wrote, he invested numerous behind-the-scene volunteer hours. He \nquietly and unassumingly delivered goodie baskets to holiday \nvolunteers, helped the local Boy Scouts of America's Coastal Carolina \nCouncil, and served as chairman of the South Carolina Aquarium. Because \nof his impact on the Charleston community, North Charleston recently \ndedicated their newest middle school to Zucker's memory, naming it the \nJerry Zucker Middle School of Science.\n  Together with his wife Anita, he is celebrated in South Carolina and \naround the Nation for his philanthropic and community endeavors, as \nwell as quiet leadership. His personal mission was ``repairing the \nworld,'' which he implied to be a work in progress. I am confident \nAnita will continue this mission. Through Anita and the Zucker Family \nFoundation, through his countless gifts of wisdom, ingenuity, dollars, \nand time, Jerry Zucker will continue to repair the world.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in commemorating Mr. Zucker's lifelong \ndedication to the service of our country and to the State of South \nCarolina. The best tribute we can give to Jerry is to continue his \nvision and follow in his humble footsteps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/17/senate-section/article/S11426-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11426-S11427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SIX BRAVE OKLAHOMANS\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the courageous actions of six brave Oklahomans. On August 25, \n2009, in the evening hours of the day, these six men, Daniel Richards, \nDavid Cox, Nick Niemann, Cody Click, Luck Tucker, and Casey Johnson, \nsaved a life. That evening a call came in about a man having severe \nchest pains and possibly a heart attack at a residence in a rural area \neast of the town of Roland, OK. Roland Fire Department first responders \nwere paged to respond, and upon their arrival they found a male subject \nlying on the ground not breathing. The six first responders immediately \nstarted CPR and hooked the individual up to an automated external \ndefibrillator and delivered a resuscitating shock from the AED. The \nfirst responders continued CPR and working with the patient for 12 \nminutes until an EMS unit arrived on scene. When the patient was placed \nin the ambulance he was breathing and had a pulse. The patient was \ntransported to Spark's Medical Center in Fort Smith, AR, where the\n\n[[Page S11427]]\n\nemergency room doctor stated that the ``firefighters saved this man's \nlife.'' The patient needed to have a stint placed in the main artery of \nthe heart and suffered some-short term memory loss, but he recovered \nand went home from the hospital in about 7 days. These men are true \nheroes. The town of Roland, the State of Oklahoma, and I are extremely \nthankful to them for their service and honored to have them serving one \nof Oklahoma's finest communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/17/senate-section/article/S11427-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROBERT ALTMAN\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I honor the life \nand service of SGT Robert Altman, United States Army. Sergeant Altman \nis a member of the greatest generation that selflessly served our \nNation during a time of perhaps the world's greatest turmoil.\n  He risked his life and endured almost unbearable pain and suffering \nas a prisoner of the Japanese during World War II.\n  He gave so much--so that all of us might be free.\n  Sergeant Altman was a crew member on a B-17 stationed at Clark Field \nin the Philippines. It was just 3 days after the attack on Pearl Harbor \nthat his bomber, commanded by another Floridian, CPT Colin P. Kelly, \nJr., loaded three 600-pound bombs and took off with orders to attack \nairfields on what is now Taiwan.\n  On the way, the crew spotted a large Japanese invasion force landing \non the north coast of Luzon in the Philippines.\n  Captain Kelly radioed Clark Field for permission to attack. But two \ncalls brought only a response to stand by. Kelly and the crew made two \npractice runs at 20,000 feet, and then the bombardier released the \nbombs in a line from the carrier's stern to its bow. According to \nSergeant Altman, two of the three bombs bracketed the ship; one was a \ndirect hit. The enemy boat began to sink and was scuttled by its \ncaptain.\n  On the way home to Clark Field, their lone B-17 was attacked and set \naflame by Japanese Zeros. Kelly stayed with the plane long enough to \nallow everyone else to bail out, before he went down within miles of \nthe airfield. Captain Kelly's body was found near the site.\n  Sergeant Altman suffered serious injuries and soon after was offered \na flight to safety. But he turned it down believing he could better \nserve his country by staying. He was subsequently captured and taken to \nJapan, where he was held as a POW for 40 months. During that time, he \nwas forced into slave labor for the Japanese until his release from \nOmori Prison, Tokyo Bay on August 29, 1945.\n  But it was the early report of his and his crew's heroism in that \nattack after Pearl Harbor that inspired a nation reeling in shock. \nAlone and far from friendly territory, Sergeant Altman and his fellow \nheroes served their country well.\n  Today, Bob is an avid Florida Gator fan and I will have the honor of \npresenting him this statement before the game on November 21. Captain \nKelly's younger sister, Emmy, and her children, Mary and Colin, will be \nthere, too.\n  I would hope Bob gets to see many more games. Today, I send best \nwishes from the U.S. Senate to SGT Robert Altman and his family and \nfriends, including the family of CPT Colin P.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to establish a small \nbusiness intermediary lending pilot program; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Small Business \nIntermediary Lending Pilot Program Act of 2009.\n  As a member of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee I \nhave been concerned about access to affordable financing for small \nbusinesses.\n  The need to help small businesses find flexible credit sources has \nbecome more urgent than ever during this economic and credit crisis. \nThe problem is serious. I have heard from numerous small businesses \nfrom across Michigan facing serious financial difficulties. Too many \ncreditworthy businesses are having trouble procuring a loan, getting \ntheir loans renewed, or are facing higher rates or are having their \nlines of credit withdrawn altogether. This is happening even when the \nbusiness never missed a payment.\n  The difficulty of finding bank financing is both a symptom and a \ncause of our economic troubles. The crisis that nearly toppled our \neconomy in late 2008 and early 2009 was largely the result of a \nshutdown in lending by banks worried that they would be overwhelmed by \nbad loans. And as the lack of available credit rippled through the \neconomy, it hit more businesses, cost them more customers, forced them \nto lay off more workers, and slowed economic activity even more, making \nbanks all the more reluctant to lend and setting off a downward spiral.\n  The search for solutions to these problems has been intense, and we \nhave taken some steps in Congress to alleviate them, including acting \nto reduce Small Business Administration lending fees, increasing the \ndollar amount of those loans the government would guarantee, and \noffering short-term loans to businesses facing immediate financial \nhardship. But it hasn't been enough.\n  In May, I told members of the Senate Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, on which I serve, of just one Michigan \nexample of the problem: A small manufacturer based in the Thumb. The \ncompany's longtime bank lender told the company it could not renew the \nfirm's 5-year loan, instead offering 90-day renewals at a much higher \ninterest rate. The company, with 77 workers and 150 customers, sought a \nloan elsewhere, but other banks--28 of them--rejected its application. \nThe company has an excellent payment history. That story can be \nrepeated 100 times throughout the state.\n  With the steep decline in the availability of credit from \nconventional financial institutions, demand is increasing for \ncommunity-based financial institutions, including Community Development \nCorporations, Microlenders, Community Development Financial \nInstitutions and other non-profit lenders to fill the gap created by \nthe reluctance of private financial institutions to provide capital to \nbusinesses. As demand on these non-profit institutions to fill the gap \nhas increased, these institutions' sources of capital are also drying \nup.\n  To address this problem, I am introducing legislation to help get \nfinancing to those small businesses that are not being served by the \nconventional loan programs currently available through the Small \nBusiness Administration.\n  The Small Business Intermediary Lending Program that I am introducing \ntoday is a three-year pilot program which authorizes the SBA in each of \nthe three years to make 20-year loans, on a competitive basis, to up to \n20 non-profit lending intermediaries around the country, with a maximum \namount of $3 million per loan. Under this proposal, intermediaries \nwould use these SBA loans to capitalize revolving loan funds through \nwhich loans of up to $200,000 would be made to small businesses in need \nof flexible debt financing. In addition, these intermediaries would \nassist borrowers in leveraging the SBA funds to obtain additional \ncapital from other sources. The intermediaries would also work closely \nwith the small business to provide technical assistance during the life \nof the loan.\n  The program would be structured along the lines of the SBA's \nMicroloan program and USDA's Intermediary Relending Program, both of \nwhich have demonstrated the success of using intermediary lenders to \nimprove the flow of credit to small businesses that are unable to \nsatisfy the underwriting requirements of a congenital bank.\n  The program is designed to fill the lending gap that exists between \nSBA's Microloan program that lends up to $35,000 and its 7(a) loan \nprogram that makes larger traditional loans to small businesses through \nparticipating banks. Many start-up and expanding small businesses may \nhave graduated from the Microloan Program and need larger loans but \ncannot get 7(a) loans because they lack adequate collateral necessary \nfor traditional loans. These small businesses may also still need \ntechnical assistance to help them succeed that would be provided by the \nintermediary lender under this bill.\n  Even before the severe economic downturn and resulting credit crunch, \n7(a) lenders were not making the sorts of midsize loans the \nIntermediary Lending Program seeks to make. In fact, several years ago \na representative for the National Association of Government Guaranteed \nLenders, the 7(a) lenders' trade association, told a Small Business and \nEntrepreneurial Committee roundtable that 7(a) lenders are not making \nthese midsized loans because they are not cost effective, and that the \nIntermediary Lending Program would fill an important niche not being \nfilled by any existing SBA program.\n  We have been taking some important steps to encourage banks to lend \nto businesses, with varying degrees of success. Clearly more needs to \nbe done to get credit into the hands of the small businesses that are \ngoing to create the jobs necessary to lead us out of this economic \ndownturn. The Intermediary Lending Program I am introducing today \nproposes a way to get financing into the hands of those viable \nbusinesses that conventional banks are currently not lending to so that \nthey can hire employees and grow their businesses. I urge its swift \nenactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Brown, \n        Mr. Cardin, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Burr, Mr. Gregg, \n        Mr. Thune, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 2781. A bill to change references in Federal law to mental \nretardation to references to an intellectual disability, and to change \nreferences to a mentally retarded individual to references to an \nindividual with an intellectual disability; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nthat I am calling ``Rosa's Law.'' It began by listening to the people \nin my own State. It began when a mother told me a compelling story \nabout her own daughter, her family's efforts to give her daughter an \nopportunity for an education and to be treated with respect and with \ndignity. And, at the same time, it began with the advocacy of not only \nshe and her husband but of her entire family, including her 14 year old \nson, Nick, who testified at the Maryland General Assembly.\n  As a result of their effort, I am introducing Rosa's Law. But I want \nto tell you about the family. I want to tell you about the \nMarcellinos--two determined parents with four children: Nick, age 14; \nMadeleine, age 12; Gigi, age 10; and Rosa, age 8. I wish you could have \nbeen with me in my office as I met with them, as I met with the parents \nand talked with the family.\n  Last year, at a roundtable on special education, I met Nina \nMarcellino. She told me about her daughter Rosa and the fact that Rosa \nhad been labeled at her school some years ago as ``mentally retarded'' \nand told me of the stigma, the pain, the anguish it caused both Nina \nand her husband, Rosa's brother and sisters as well as Rosa herself.\n  The mother and father reached out to the advocacy organization, the \nArc, to see what could be done to change the law. They then reached out \nto a member of the Maryland General Assembly in our own Maryland \nLegislature--a wonderful representative named Ted Sophocleus.\n  Mr. Sophocleus introduced legislation in the Maryland General \nAssembly that would change the words ``mentally retarded'' and \nsubstitute that with the phrase ``an individual with an intellectual \ndisability.''\n\n[[Page S11433]]\n\n  That is why I stand on the Senate floor today to introduce, at the \nrequest of this family, legislation on behalf of this little girl and \non behalf of all of the children of the United States of America who \nare labeled, stigmatized, and bear a burden the rest of their lives \nbecause of the language we use in the law books.\n  My law simply changes the phrase ``mentally retarded'' to an \n``individual with an intellectual disability.'' We do it in health, \neducation, and labor policy without in any way negatively impinging \nupon either the educational or other benefits to which these children \nare entitled.\n  When it came time to bring the bill before the General Assembly, the \nfamily was there. And who spoke up for Rosa? Well, her mom and dad had \nbeen speaking up for her. Her brother Nick and her sisters Madeleine \nand Gigi had been speaking up for her. This wonderful boy, Nick, at the \ntime 13 testified before the general assembly and said:\n\n       What you call people is how you treat them.\n\n  ``What you call people is how you treat them.'' What you call my \nsister is how you will treat her. If you believe she is ``retarded,'' \nit invites taunts, it invites stigmas, it invites bullying, and it also \ninvites the slammed doors of not being treated with respect and \ndignity.\n  Nick's words were far more eloquent that day than mine are today. I \nwant to salute Nick for standing up for his sister. But I think we need \nto stand up for all because in changing the language we believe it will \nbe the start of new attitudes toward people with intellectual \ndisabilities. Hopefully, people will associate these new words with the \nvery able and valuable people that go to school, work, play soccer, or \nlive next door.\n  Eunice Shriver believed in this when she created the Special \nOlympics. She knew special needs children need special attention, but \nthey can do very special things and look what she started.\n  This bill has gotten unanimous support in the Maryland legislative \nbody. It passed in Annapolis. A few weeks before this bill swept \nthrough the General Assembly, I had the opportunity to talk to Rosa's \nmom, Nina. I promised her then that if that bill passed the Maryland \nLegislature, I would bring it to the floor of the Senate. Well, it \npassed unanimously, Governor O'Malley has signed it, and today I stand \nbefore you introducing the legislation.\n  It makes nominal changes to policy. It gets into Federal education, \nhealth, and labor law. It simply substitutes ``intellectual \ndisability'' for ``mental retardation,'' ``individual with an \nintellectual disability'' for ``mentally retarded.''\n  This bill, as I can assure all who might be concerned, will not \nexpand nor diminish services, rights, or educational opportunities. We \nvetted it with legal counsel. We reached out to the very wonderful \nadvocacy groups in this field, and they concur that this legislation \nwould be acceptable.\n  The Senate has changed terminology for this population before. In the \n1960s, Congress passed legislation where we took--I am almost \nembarrassed to say our law once referred to boys and girls as ``feeble-\nminded.'' We thought we were being advanced when we changed it to \n``mentally retarded.'' Now, 40 years later, let's take another big step \nand change it to ``intellectual disability.''\n  This bill makes language used in the Federal Government consistent. \nThe President's Committee on Mental Retardation was changed by \nExecutive order so it is now the Committee on Individuals with \nIntellectual Disabilities. The CDC uses ``intellectual disability.'' \nThe World Health Organization uses ``intellectual disability.''\n  I have always said the best ideas come from the people. ``Rosa's \nLaw'' is a perfect example of effective citizen advocacy--a family that \npulled together for their own, and in pulling together they are pulling \nus all along to a new way of thinking.\n  I want to recognize the Marcellino family who is here with us in the \ngallery, and the namesake of the law, Rosa, whose picture is behind me, \nand she is also up there in the gallery today.\n  It was indeed an honor to represent this family. I believe in our \ncountry people have a right to be heard, and we listen. They have a \nright to be represented, which I have tried to do. Now let's try to \nchange the law.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues. It is a \npleasure to work with Senators Harkin and Enzi, the chair and ranking \nmember of the HELP Committee. I have their wholehearted support in \nworking together.\n  This is going to be a bipartisan bill. It is going to be a \nnonpartisan bill. We are going to check our party hats at the door and \nmove ahead and tip our hats to these boys and girls. This bill is \ndriven by passion for social justice and compassion for the human \ncondition. We have done a lot to come out of the dark ages of \ninstitutionalization and exclusion when it comes to people with \nintellectual disabilities.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in going a step further. Cosponsor \nthe legislation I offer on a bipartisan basis. Help me pass the law and \nknow that each and every one of us can make a difference. When we work \ntogether, we can make change. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in moving this bill forward in our legislative process.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to \njoin my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, in introducing \nRosa's law. I would like to thank her for her leadership and her \ncommitment on this issue. Simply put, this legislation will make an \nimportant change in the words we use to refer to those with \nintellectual disabilities. It is a much needed change in the law that \nis fully deserving of our support.\n  For far too long we have used words like ``mental retardation'' in \nour Federal statutes to refer to those with intellectual disabilities. \nThis has been unfortunate because when we use such a term we send a \nmessage throughout our society that someone ``is'' their disability, \ninstead of someone like us who is facing a challenge in their life. \nSuch a term creates the unwanted impression that growth is impossible \nand their disability will lock them into a certain lifestyle forever.\n  As an example, imagine a friend with cancer. When you refer to him or \nher you would probably say they have cancer, or are going through \ncancer treatment. You wouldn't say they ``are'' cancer like this term \nsays that someone ``is'' their disability. It's a distinction that \nmakes a big difference for anyone facing such a difficult period of \ntheir lives.\n  This is not a unique situation. Historically, this and other \nunfortunate terms have been used to refer to people with disabilities \nof all kinds for many years.\n  Prior to the 1960's, people who were viewed as having intellectual \nlimitations were shunned from society and placed in institutions. The \nAmerican dream of self-determination, independent living, and the \npursuit of freedom and happiness was thought to be impossible for them \nto achieve. We let the limitations we helped to create with our words \nand our attitudes slowly take away their hopes and dreams for a better \nlife and a brighter future.\n  We know now that words have meaning, sometimes far beyond what we \nintend. Therefore, we must be very careful about the way we describe \nthe people we see every day, including those with disabilities, or \nthose who are undergoing treatment for a variety of health issues. \nUnfortunately, the Federal Government has not dropped this term from \nour laws and it still appears in the regulations and statutes that come \nbefore our legislative bodies and our courts.\n  With this legislation we are taking a giant step forward, as we \nacknowledge that times have changed and we live in a much different \nworld. Clearly this term was not developed from malice. It came from a \nlack of understanding of what it was like to be labeled with such a \nterm and then left virtually alone in the effort to overcome it.\n  Over the years, Congress has made it known that community living, \neducational opportunities that lead to success in the workplace, and \nequal opportunity without discrimination will be available to people \nwho are living with intellectual limitations under appropriate Federal \nstatutes.\n  That was a good start. Unfortunately, several key Federal disability \nstatutes, including the Individuals\n\n[[Page S11434]]\n\nwith Disabilities Education Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the \nDevelopmental Disabilities Act, and the Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination Act, still use the outmoded term. It is time for \nCongress to be proactive and join the States of New Hampshire, \nMaryland, and my home State of Wyoming by ending the use of this \npejorative term and replacing it with a more carefully chosen word.\n  To paraphrase a quote I have heard about cancer, a disability is a \nword, not a sentence. We have put that philosophy into practice over \nthe years for other disabilities. It is time we adapted it to provide \nsupport to those living with intellectual disabilities as well.\n  Some will ask if we are being overly sensitive, or if we are just \ntrying to make a change to be politically correct. The answer to that \nquestion is clearly ``no.''\n  It is no secret. When we put a ``label'' like that on someone we \noften find ourselves dealing with the label as if it is not a \ndescription of the challenges someone faces in their lives but a \nreflection of who that person really is. That puts them in a group with \na label for a name and tells them that they are not worthy of being \ntreated as an individual, with individual needs and interests.\n  I have heard from people with intellectual disabilities over the \nyears. They have asked us to put an end to the use of that outdated \nterm. Self-advocacy groups such as Self-Advocates Becoming Empowered \nand local People First Organizations as well as organizations such as \nthe Arc of the United States, Special Olympics International, and \nothers have already stopped using this archaic terminology and dropped \nthe term from their agency names. The American Psychiatric Association, \nwhich publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders, has already voted to use the term ``Intellectual \nDisability'' in the next publication of their manual.\n  I have always believed that the law is a great teacher. That is why \nwe need to join in this effort and express our support for the efforts \nof those with disabilities of all kinds to live to their full \npotential. We can do that by eliminating the use of negative archaic \nterms to refer to those with intellectual limitations. Such an action \non our part starts with this bill that uses the term intellectual \ndisability in laws that are in the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee \non Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. This bill makes our intent \nclear throughout our Nation that this term will never again be used in \nCongress or in any Federal office.\n  When I came to the Senate 13 years ago, my staff and I met almost \nimmediately to work on our mission statement. When it was completed, \none of the most important clauses we had written was our commitment \nthat we would treat others not as we would wish to be treated, but as \nthey would wish to be treated. There is a difference.\n  Today, with the passage of this important legislation, we are \nreaching out to those with intellectual disabilities to assure them \nthat their government will treat them as they would wish to be treated. \nBy so doing, we will also be directing our staffs and the staffs of \nfederal offices throughout the U.S. that the best way for them to refer \nto those with disabilities or to anyone who comes into their office is \nby the term they have carried with them throughout their lives--their \nname.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 2786. A bill to amend titles 18 and 28 of the United States Code \nto provide incentives for the prompt payments of debts owed to the \nUnited States and the victims of crime by imposing late fees on unpaid \njudgments owed to the United States and to the victims of crime, to \nprovide for offsets on amounts collected by the Department of Justice \nfor Federal agencies, to increase the amount of special assessments \nimposed upon convicted persons, to establish an Enhanced Financial \nRecovery Fund to enhance, supplement, and improve the debt collection \nactivities of the Department of Justice, to amend title 5, United \nStates Code, to provide to assistant United States attorneys the same \nretirement benefits as are afforded to Federal law enforcement \nofficers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator \nHatch to introduce a bill that will take steps to enhance the \nretirement benefits granted to Assistant U.S. Attorneys who serve all \nAmericans in a critical law enforcement role. Representative Delahunt \nis introducing companion legislation in the House. I would like to \nacknowledge the significant efforts made by the National Association of \nAssistant United States Attorneys in developing this legislation.\n  There are approximately 5,500 Assistant U.S. Attorneys in 93 offices \nthroughout the U.S. all of whom are serving on the front lines to \nuphold the rule of law. Having served as a prosecutor for many years in \nVermont, I know well the integral role prosecutors play in the \nadministration of justice and keeping our communities safe. Federal \nprosecutors are a crucial component of our justice system, and this \nlegislation recognizes the important contributions these men and women \nmake in the enforcement of our Federal laws.\n  Probation officers, deputy marshals, corrections officers, and even \ncorrections employees not serving in a law enforcement role receive \nbenefits greater than those received by Assistant U.S. Attorneys. This \nis a disparity that should be remedied. By making the appropriate \nadjustments provided in this legislation, Congress would also help the \nFederal justice system retain experienced prosecutors. Of all the \nprosecutors who leave the government for the private sector, 60 to 70 \npercent do so with experience of between 6 and 15 years. With the \nDepartment of Justice's rapidly expanding role in combating terrorism, \nfinancial fraud, and other pressing national law enforcement \nchallenges, we cannot afford to lose the experienced men and women who \nserve in this vital position. And by enhancing the retirement benefits \nfor these prosecutors, we make service as an Assistant U.S Attorney a \nmore attractive path for talented young lawyers who are considering \npublic service.\n  This legislation also makes substantial efforts to defray the cost to \nthe Federal Government of providing enhanced retirement benefits to \nAssistant U.S. Attorneys and to make our justice system operate more \nefficiently. The bill includes important provisions that would assist \nthe Department of Justice in recovering money owed to the Federal \nGovernment as a result of judgments and other fines. By bolstering the \nDepartment's ability to collect the funds it is rightfully owed, \nresources would be made more available to provide the parity in \nretirement benefits sought by Assistant U.S. Attorneys. The result of \nthis innovative effort to fund these benefits in an alternative manner \nis that the Department of Justice will, through its duties as the \nNation's law enforcement agency, be able to provide the benefits its \nemployees deserve at little or no cost to the taxpayer.\n  With the introduction of this legislation, we signal that prosecutors \nin our society fulfill a critical and valuable role. By enacting it, \nCongress can send the message that the service of these prosecutors is \nan indispensable component of our Federal justice system. I hope all \nSenators will join us in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2786\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a scholarship program to encourage \noutstanding undergraduate and graduate students in mission-critical \nfields to pursue a career in the Federal Government; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, since arriving in the Senate in 1999, I \nhave made improving the Federal workforce a priority. In that time, I \nhave served as both chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nOversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the \nDistrict of Columbia, and have participated in many hearings to examine \nthe personnel needs of the Federal Government. In fact, I recently \nattended my 52nd hearing examining Federal human capital issues.\n  As my colleagues surely know, over the next several years the Federal \nworkforce will experience an unprecedented demographic transition. By \nDecember 2012, 250,000 Federal employees are expected to retire. To \nmaintain current staff levels amidst the impending wave of Baby Boomer \nretirements, and to cope with the increasing workload being placed on \ncivil servants by Congress and the administration, more than 600,000 \npositions will need to be filled over this time period.\n  This hiring challenge will be particularly significant for those \npositions designated by Federal agencies as ``mission-critical,'' or \nnecessary for carrying out basic agency responsibilities. In its \nrecently released survey of the coming hiring challenge, Where the Jobs \nAre, the Partnership for Public Service estimates that 273,000 new \npublic servants--from doctors to intelligence analysts, program \nmanagers to police officers--will need to be brought on board to \nmaintain current staffing levels, a 40 percent increase from the \nprevious 3-year period.\n  Successfully meeting this human capital challenge will require a \nsustained, multi-pronged effort addressing a host of issues. The \nFederal hiring process needs streamlining, improvements must continue \nin the processing of security clearances, and agencies will need to \napproach future hiring decisions in a strategic fashion rather than a \ntactical, reactive one.\n  No matter how effectively the Federal hiring process is planned for \nand managed, however, an effective workforce cannot be built in the \nabsence of talented individuals willing to pursue careers in public \nservice. The need for well-qualified young people with aspirations to \ncareers in public service is particularly important for mission-\n\n[[Page S11438]]\n\ncritical occupations, which tend to require highly specialized skill \nsets that too often are in short supply.\n  At the same time, the average debt load undergraduate and graduate \nstudents must bear to finance their education continues to increase. As \na result, many young Americans who would otherwise be eager to join the \ncivil service are prevented from doing so.\n  In an effort to help established a talent pipeline for such mission-\ncritical positions, today I join with the distinguished Senator from \nNew York, Senator Gillibrand, and the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware, Senator Kaufman, to introduce legislation aimed at \nencouraging and enabling young people with valuable, mission-critical \nskills to pursue careers in public service.\n  The Roosevelt Scholars Act of 2009 would establish a foundation named \nin honor of our 26th President and a principal architect of the modern \ncivil service, Theodore Roosevelt. The Theodore Roosevelt Scholarship \nFoundation would be charged with awarding scholarships to outstanding \nundergraduate and graduate students pursuing fields of study identified \nby Federal agencies as mission-critical. In return for tuition support \nand a small stipend, selected students--dubbed Roosevelt Scholars--\nwould be required to engage in 3 to 5 years of service with a Federal \nagency in need of an individual with a Roosevelt Scholar's unique skill \nset. Scholarships would be provided through the Theodore Roosevelt \nMemorial Scholarship Trust Fund, whose endowment would eventually \nprovide a self-sustaining funding mechanism for Roosevelt Scholarships.\n  I am pleased to be joined in offering this legislation by \nenthusiastic partners. Senator Gillibrand is a strong supporter of \nencouraging Americans to pursue careers in public service, and I am \nthankful for her diligent work in advancing this legislation. Likewise, \nSenator Kaufman has demonstrated his strong support of our Nation's \ncivil servants by his frequent appearances on the floor of this chamber \nto recognize the accomplishments of outstanding Federal employees. And \non the other side of the Capitol Rotunda, Representatives David Price \nand Michael Castle are already hard at work promoting this important \nlegislation.\n  The higher education community has been quick to see the promise \noffered by the Roosevelt Scholars Act. More than 100 public and private \nuniversities have endorsed this legislation, and the list continues to \ngrow.\n  I will be the first to tell my colleagues that problems as daunting \nas those facing the Federal workforce are not solved overnight. I have \nlearned from 18 years as a public executive--first as mayor of \nCleveland, then as Governor of Ohio--that progress on such challenges \nis made incrementally. Opportunities offered by legislation like the \nRoosevelt Scholars Act are important components in a larger strategy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in cosponsoring the Roosevelt Scholars \nAct, and look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and \nSenate to provide young people the opportunity to pursue a career in \npublic service as Roosevelt Scholars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/17/senate-section/article/S11438-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2784.
