Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 1 hour of debate, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees, with the Senator \nfrom Washington, Mrs. Murray, controlling the time of the majority.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \ntime allotted to Senator Murray, which I understand is 30 minutes of \nthe hour before the vote; is that true?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct. Without objection, \nthe Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, summer is ending and the school year is \ngoing to begin in a few weeks in many States. But as students prepare \nfor the school year, many wonder what the school and classroom will \nlook like. Parents are reading news reports about budget cuts and \nwonder how that will affect the schools their kids attend--whether art, \nmusic, foreign language offerings will be cut and whether some teachers \nwill be gone and how many students will be crowded into one classroom. \nThese worries are justified.\n  The recession we are now working our way through has crippled many \nlocal and State budgets. In Illinois, the fiscal year 2011 budget has a \n$13 billion deficit. As a result, the Governor has proposed serious \ncuts to public education. It has been projected that, in Illinois, come \nthis new school year, we will have as many as 17,000 fewer teachers. \nOur State is not alone.\n  States across the country, looking to balance their budgets, are \nfaced with these same hard choices. Through the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act, the stimulus package President Obama brought forward \nwhen he was elected, we acted to save schools, and our investment \nworked. The State fiscal stabilization fund helped save or create more \nthan 300,000 education jobs across the country. We bought a year, in \nthe hopes that this recession would have turned around. Well, it is \nmoving in the right direction, but we are still suffering from many \naspects of it.\n\n  Unfortunately, the funding of that bill is expiring and State \neconomies have not fully recovered and, according to recent \nprojections, nearly 150,000 educators have received or will receive \npink slips for the next school year.\n  More than 80 percent of school districts across America have had to \nlay off teachers. The measure we are considering today and will vote \nupon in a little more than 45 minutes would create a $10 billion \neducation jobs fund that will save more than 100,000 jobs in schools \nacross America.\n  The education jobs fund would save a projected 4,836 education jobs \nin my home State. That means, roughly, that we are going to save one \nout of four of the teachers who were going to lose their jobs. I wish \nit were more, but it is going to help. Adding thousands of workers to \nthe unemployment rolls would be bad for our economy in Illinois, bad \nfor the families of these teachers who lose their jobs, and bad for \nstudents. The negative effect will be felt by students for a long time.\n  Chicago's public schools currently face a $600 million deficit for \nthe next fiscal year. To close it, they are going to have to cut 2,700 \nteachers and 300 school-based staffers. Class sizes will be increased \nto 35 students a room. Nonvarsity sports will be eliminated. Magnet and \ngifted programs will be reduced. Full-day kindergarten programs will be \nreduced. Afterschool programs will be reduced. The budget for charter \nschools will be cut by 11 percent.\n  Similar hard choices are faced by school districts across Illinois \nand across the Nation. Elgin School District is planning to cut more \nthan 1,000 jobs, including 732 teachers. That district faces a $44 \nmillion deficit. The Neuqua Valley High School in Naperville may lose \nits music program. I wish to add that this is a music program that has \nwon two Grammys. It is such an outstanding program in Naperville. They \nrun the risk of closing.\n  So the students will be hurt and families will suffer. Teachers will \nlose their jobs. How do you make up for that year of education that has \nbeen shortchanged? We do it by voting to help. That is what this does.\n  The spending in this measure is fully offset and paid for totally. So \nany argument that is being made about this adding to the deficit, it \ndoesn't. It is a conscious decision to move resources from other parts \nof the budget, where they are not as high a priority, into the priority \nof keeping teachers in the classroom.\n  There is no reason to vote against this. I don't understand how my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle who have argued that they are \ndeficit hawks can ignore the obvious. We pay for this program. We pay \nto help these teachers. It doesn't add to the deficit. If it is your \nson or daughter or your grandson or granddaughter who is shortchanged \none school year, does it make a difference? Of course, it does. Being \nshortchanged one school year and then another could put a child in a \nspiral decline that could affect their lives and their futures \nimmeasurably.\n  Secretary Arne Duncan has urged Congress to act, saying we need to \n``keep our teachers teaching, our students learning, and keep our \neconomy growing.'' I agree with Secretary Duncan.\n  I urge my colleagues to put politics aside; don't try to focus on who \nis going to claim a victory when it is all over--Democratic or \nRepublican. The victories we want are for the kids in the classroom and \nfor teachers to stay on the job. That is nonpartisan. It has nothing to \ndo with political party and neither should this vote.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this effort. I particularly \nthank Senator Patty Murray from Washington who is leading our effort to \npass this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 23 minutes 54 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you. Mr. President, recently we have had the \nopportunity to consider several bills in the Senate to help ease the \nburdens for our middle-class families and small business owners that \nthey are facing in this recession.\n  In late June, we brought a bill to the floor that would provide key \ntargeted tax breaks, including a sales tax deductibility for families \nin my home State, as well as tax breaks to end our dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  In July, we introduced a Wall Street reform bill that included the \nstrongest protections for consumers ever enacted and a guarantee that \ntaxpayers would never be on the hook for bailing out Wall Street again.\n  A few short weeks ago, we worked to extend unemployment benefits to \nhelp stimulate economic growth and those who are in desperate need.\n  Last week, we introduced a bill that would have provided a new small \nbusiness lending fund to help the backbone\n\n[[Page S6679]]\n\nof our economy, our small businesses, grow and hire.\n  It would have jump-started community bank lending and small \nbusinesses, while saving taxpayers $1 billion.\n  All those bills had broad across-the-board support. In fact, outside \nthe Senate, they had a lot of support. The conservative-leaning \nNational Federation of Independent Business voiced their support for \nthe small business lending funds.\n  Hometown community bankers in my State stood to support Wall Street \nreform. Economists of all political stripes got behind the long-proven \nbenefits of extending unemployment, and so many others around the \ncountry found common cause with the benefits of those critical bills.\n  These bills would help create jobs, put money back in the pockets of \ntaxpayers and small business owners and ease the difficult choices \nstruggling Americans face every day.\n  But at every turn in the Senate, we have been opposed by those on the \nother side of the aisle who seem to have long ago made their own choice \nabout anything and everything that comes to the floor. It was a choice \nthat favored politics over people, Wall Street over Main Street, and \nthe status quo over the struggles our families are facing.\n  It was a choice to say no, no matter what, no matter when, no matter \nwho was hurt.\n  I go home to Washington State every weekend and I talk to the people \nI represent. I try to explain what we are working on.\n  To be honest, it is hard to understand why, when big banks and Wall \nStreet were on the brink of failure and threatening to blow up our \nentire economy, Republicans immediately came together to help us step \nback from the brink then. But now that Wall Street is fine and regular \nfamilies and communities are struggling, those same Republicans are \nnowhere to be found. I don't have an answer for our families. Quite \nhonestly, I don't understand it myself.\n  Today, as we prepare for a final week of votes before we go home to \nface our constituents, those on the other side of the aisle have one \nlast opportunity to show this is not just a political calculation and \nthat we in this Senate can put people first.\n  The amendment I have offered, and which we will soon vote on, saves \njobs and makes sure our kids are not paying the price for this \nrecession. It avoids painful cuts to critical services. And, very \nimportantly, it is fully paid for. For every dollar this amendment \ninvests in saving teacher jobs, reducing class sizes, and avoiding cuts \nto State programs, we have found targeted spending cuts.\n\n  This amendment includes help for our States in every corner of this \ncountry and will help make sure that our most precious resource--our \neducation system--is protected.\n  Every day brings more reports about the continuing wave of layoffs \naffecting our school districts across the country. According to recent \nestimates, over 130,000 teacher jobs will be lost this fall alone. In \nmy home State, there are nearly 3,000 at risk. That means 3,000 \nteachers in Washington State who are right now in limbo, who are \nspending this summer not knowing if they are going to be able to return \nto a classroom or face a pink slip in the fall.\n  We have to remember that every time we lose a teacher, it is not only \nthe teacher and economy that suffers, it is the kids in every one of \nour States.\n  I received a letter recently from a special education teacher named \nConnie Compton in Kent, WA, who told the story of recently having to \nsay goodbye to a young, talented, energetic music teacher because of \nbudget cutbacks. She told me how this was just one of six teachers in \nher school alone who have had to be let go.\n  In her letter she talked about how it is the kids who only get one \nshot at a music class or an afterschool program or arts or sports or \neven subjects such as social studies or history who lose out.\n  She also talked about whether it is through larger class sizes they \nare seeing, scaled down services, fewer subjects being offered, or even \nshortened school weeks in some of our communities, too often it is our \nmost vulnerable who are paying the price for this recession.\n  My amendment is a fiscally responsible way to make sure our States' \nschoolchildren and the hard-working teachers who get up every day to \nimprove their lives are not the victims of struggling State budgets.\n  My amendment provides $10 billion to school districts throughout the \ncountry to save the over 130,000 teacher jobs that are at risk, and it \ndoes so without adding to the deficit, and with a prohibition on the \nuse of this funding for general expenses.\n  It is a very targeted and responsible way to help make sure that as \nour kids head back to school, our teachers are not entering the ranks \nof the unemployed. It is also a way to make sure we are not paying a \nlot more in the long run for adults who have been failed by school \nsystems with too few teachers and too many cuts to services.\n  It is August. Our kids are about to go back to school. We cannot \nafford for them to go back to huge class sizes where they cannot learn, \nwith fewer subjects being taught, and we certainly cannot afford to \nwait to address this very immediate problem.\n  Another immediate problem facing States such as mine is the huge \nState budget hole left by Federal Medicaid payments promised to States \nbut never delivered. Without this critical Federal funding, these \nStates are now faced with the difficult decision of whether they slash \nthousands of jobs, raise people's taxes, or stall economic recovery.\n  The amendment we are about to vote on includes a fully offset $16.1 \nbillion investment to help our States avoid job losses and cuts to \nMedicaid and tax increases. In my own State, it will help avoid a \ncostly emergency session of our State legislature or across-the-board \ncuts to jobs and State services and health care for so many who have \nlost it when they lost their jobs. In fact, according to the Community \nHealth Care Network in my State, without this extension, health care \nservices for tens of thousands of people in my State will be under \nthreat.\n  Failure to adopt this amendment could also mean layoffs to \ncorrections officers, health care workers, cuts to end-of-life care for \nlow-income people, cuts to State-supported financial aid programs that \nwill deny up to 5,800 full-time students in my State alone an \nopportunity to go to college and universities next year. It will \nincrease the risk of a double-dip recession and result in reduced \nconsumer spending at a time we can least afford it.\n  Ultimately, failure to adopt this amendment will lead to more \nspending, not less, because of an increased demand for unemployment \nbenefits and subsidized health care and food stamps.\n  The bottom line is that without this amendment, much of the progress \nStates have been making to get back on the right economic track will be \nendangered. This is no time to risk our recovery by playing politics \nwith help for our hard-working families.\n  This amendment that we will vote on shortly is the last best chance \nfor teachers and the economic stability of so many of our States. Over \nthe last several weeks, we have tried to work with the other side on \nevery concern they have brought to the table, on every bill we have \nbrought to the floor. We have compromised and we compromised again and \nthen again. Today's amendment is another compromise. It may not include \nall we would have wanted on this side to save jobs and services in \nStates across our country, but it does include enough to avoid \njeopardizing our recovery. We have done all that we can.\n  Ultimately, this is about where our priorities lie. Are our \npriorities with hard-working families who every day have to grapple \nwith tough choices about how to afford the things they need? Are they \nwith our home States that are faced with laying off workers or raising \ntaxes? Are they with our teachers who have been left with no choice but \nto find a new job without this help? Are priorities based on political \nchoices--choices guided by polling or party doctrine, choices made long \nago to say no, no matter what?\n  This amendment, which is critically important, is focused on what we \ncan still do for our constituents and our States, not what we cannot or \nwill not. It is about solving the big problems that are still \nthreatening our recovery. And it is about showing the American\n\n[[Page S6680]]\n\npeople that when commonsense legislation does come before us, we can \nmake commonsense choices.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to put our families, to put our \ncommunities, and our States above partisan politics and work with us to \nadopt this critical amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire and I are going to engage in a discussion about the vote we \nare going to have at 10:40 a.m. But the Republican leader is on his way \nto the floor in a few minutes. When he comes, we are going to step \naside and let him make his remarks, and then we will resume.\n  The vote we are having at 10:40 a.m. has the following problems with \nit: No. 1, it is $10 billion for the State to pay for teachers. That \nsounds pretty good except that it ties the hands of the Governors and \nthe legislatures so they cannot change education funding levels if \ntheir State budgets are in trouble.\n  No. 2, there is $16 billion for States to pay for Medicaid. That \nsounds pretty good, too, except that it ties the hands of the States \nand the Governors so they cannot adjust their State Medicaid Program \nand continue to face a funding cliff.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Washington State talk about \ncollege students. The reason California students are facing a 32-\npercent increase in tuition is largely caused by California's expenses \nfor Medicaid, the State program that is funded also by the Federal \nGovernment that has so many Federal rules that it keeps going up in \ncost. And the money that would be going to the University of California \nor the University of Tennessee or the University of New Hampshire \ninstead goes for Medicaid. Then there is not money for the university, \nand then what happens? The tuition goes up.\n  Finally, part of the way this bill is paid for is by almost $10 \nbillion of permanent tax increases on multinational corporations that \nwould have the effect of driving jobs overseas--just one more action by \nthe Democratic majority and this administration in the middle of a \nrecession or a time of near 10-percent unemployment that makes it \nharder to create new jobs in the United States.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New \nHampshire and I may engage in a colloquy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask my friend from New Hampshire, the \nsenior member of the Budget Committee and a former Governor of his \nState, what about the idea of sending money to States and then \nrequiring them, in effect, to spend more money at a time when most \nStates are cutting State budgets so they can balance their budgets?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee, who is \nnot only a former Governor but also a former Secretary of Education. \nThe Senator has framed the question adequately and very accurately, and \nthat is this: Why should the Federal Government be saying to the \nStates: We are going to give you some money, but we are going to attach \nto this money a whole lot of strings? And the basic strings are these: \nUnless you spend a heck of a lot more money, you are not going to get \nthis money.\n  It does appear that it is focused on a special interest group, does \nit not, the teachers unions? It appears this is more or less a \ncommitment to take care of this constituency out there at the expense, \nironically, of a lot of people who are employed in those States.\n  We use the term ``multinational corporation'' around here as if that \nis some sort of evil empire. I have a few multinational corporations in \nNew Hampshire--I suspect the Senator does in Tennessee--and they employ \npeople. If you raise their taxes by $10 billion, they are going to \nemploy a lot less or they are going to send them overseas. We used to \nhear around here constantly about outsourcing--outsourcing jobs. This \nbill is a job outsourcer.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator is exactly right. The National Association \nof Manufacturers says there are 22 million Americans who are hired by \ncompanies that do business not only in the United States but overseas.\n  I say to the Senator from New Hampshire, I think we want companies \nthat are principally in the United States that do business overseas \nbecause what is the alternative? The alternative is they are in \nSingapore or they are in Great Britain or they are in other countries \naround the world and they are not in our country. They are not paying \ntaxes here, and they are not hiring people here.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Kentucky has arrived. The \nSenator from New Hampshire and I are in the midst of a fascinating \ndiscussion, but we think we will step down while he makes his remarks.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to the Senators, go ahead and \nfinish the fascinating discussion.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to get back to the essence of what \nthe Senator from Tennessee is saying. It goes to this point.\n  People look at this and say: Oh, my goodness, there is a whole bunch \nof money coming to this State. What is it coming for and who it is \npaying? This money does not grow on trees and gets picked up in the \nmorning by trucks that drive by and drop it off. This money is taken \nfrom somebody else to be used for this purpose. When you go to the \nessence of what this bill is about, it is to pay off education unions. \nThat is what this is about. Let's not be coy about what is happening \naround here. The education unions were the single biggest interest \ngroup represented at the Democratic National Convention. I think 26 \npercent of the delegates at the Democratic National Convention were \nteachers, members of teachers unions. They probably were not teachers; \nthey probably were administrators.\n  What is happening here? A lot of States are trying to reorganize \ntheir budgets because they are in hard times. Most States are not able \nto print money--none are--the way the Federal Government does. So they \nactually have to be fiscally disciplined.\n  What they are saying to all the different categories within their \nStates is: We are going to adjust here. They are actually going through \na very aggressive--I know it is happening in New Hampshire, I know it \nis happening in Tennessee, and I suspect it is happening in most \nStates--they are going through a very aggressive process of ordering \npriorities and making tough decisions so they can get their house in \norder relative to such things as the cost of education. But that has \nupset the teachers unions.\n  Now we get a bill on the floor of the Senate to basically put the \nStates in a position where they will have to maintain the teachers \nunion status relative to employees and actually add to it at the \nexpense of the employers in those States and the people who go to work \nin those States, at the expense of the companies that are deemed \n``multinationals.''\n  In New Hampshire, we have a lot of companies that are multinational. \nWe are quite proud of that. We are proud of the fact we are an export-\noriented State, that a lot of our major employers--in fact, I suspect \nour top five major employers are all deemed multinationals. They are \nnot going to be able to hire as many people in New Hampshire because of \nthe fact that they are going to get hit with this huge tax bill, the \npurpose of which is not actually to improve the situation--the States \nare working on that--the purpose of which is to take care of a \nconstituency group that happens to have a significant amount of \ninfluence. It is called a special interest, unless it happens to be a \nliberal group and then they are called concerned citizens or \nsomething. But in this case it is a special interest group, and this \nbill is nothing more than a payoff to a special interest group at the \nexpense of another group who happens to employ people and have workers \nin New Hampshire.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator has been talking about education. There is \nanother important part of the bill--$16 billion to Medicaid. This is \nthe Federal program to which, now with the new health care law, more \nthan 70 million people will belong in 2014. But here is what the bill \nalso does. According to a Wall Street Journal article on May 20, \nbecause of this bill--and as a result of this bill, if it should pass--\nStates will be limited in their ability to make changes in the Medicaid \nProgram to save money.\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\n  So what does that mean?\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for a question, is the Senator \nsaying the Federal Government is going to say: If you want this money, \nyou can't improve the program?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It is not just me saying it. The Lieutenant Governor \nof New York, Richard Ravitch, wrote an article in the Wall Street \nJournal on June 7 where he said he greatly appreciated the stimulus \nmoney--and this is the same problem--but because of these requirements \nthat prohibit Governors and legislatures from making changes in the law \nto save money, he says the net result is the Federal stimulus--and this \nbill is just the son of stimulus or the daughter of stimulus--has led \nStates to increase overall spending in these core areas, to increase \nspending.\n  So the point of what we are doing is to cause States to increase \nspending, said the Lieutenant Governor of New York, which in effect has \nonly raised the height of the cliff from which State spending will fall \nif stimulus funds evaporate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator from Tennessee yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was not here for the beginning of the discussion \nbetween the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Tennessee, \nbut I recently had an opportunity to speak to the National State \nLegislators convention, which happened to have been in my hometown of \nLouisville. Speaker Pelosi was there as well. My staff, in doing \nresearch and putting together my remarks, discovered that currently the \nsingle biggest source of revenue for State governments is to borrow \nmoney that is coming down from Washington. They are getting more from \nus than their sales taxes, their income taxes, and their property \ntaxes. The States are simply becoming completely dependent upon us.\n  As I have heard both of my colleagues point out, we are sending this \nborrowed money down essentially so they do not have to make the tough \ndecisions they would otherwise have to make. So I would ask my friends: \nWhen does it end? When does this dependency come to an end? I thought \nlast year it was supposed to be timely, temporary, and targeted.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator's point is very important because 41 cents of \nevery dollar we are sending back to the States--and as the Senator \nsays, the majority of State money is now Federal money that we are \nsending down, as the Senator outlined--is borrowed from China or from \nthe Middle East. Our people are going to have to pay all this back. We \ndon't have that money to be sending to the States.\n  In this bill, at least there is an attempt to pay for it. But the way \nthey pay for it is by penalizing job creators and forcing people to \noutsource jobs which, again, comes back to harm us for no purpose that \nseems to be practical other than to have the Federal Government step in \nand try to control the manner in which these various programs are run \nin the States and to reward constituencies who happen to be very \nsupportive of the other party.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I may say in response to the question and comment \nfrom the Senator from Kentucky, this country was created by States, and \nnow has created a central government of limited powers. The central \ngovernment makes the States the wards of the central government.\n  In the State of Tennessee this year--I believe for the first time--\nmore than half the dollars in the State budget come from the Federal \nGovernment. In addition to the dollars coming from Washington, the \nrules are coming from Washington. So the Governor of Kentucky or New \nHampshire or Tennessee is trying to say: Medicaid spending is out of \ncontrol. It is ruining our public colleges and universities because we \nhave no money left for them, so we want to change the eligibility.\n  That has been the case during the last 10 years. We have had Medicaid \nspending going up in the States by 70 or 80 percent over a 7- or 8-year \nperiod of time, and funding for public universities at a low level with \ntuitions, therefore, going way up. So the Governor is saying: Whoa, \nlet's do something about Medicaid. Then we passed a bill and said to \nthe Governors: Don't you change Medicaid. You are not allowed, if you \ntake this money, to save any money in Medicaid.\n  So spending for Medicaid goes up because we require it to go up, and \nthat means tuitions in Kentucky, New Hampshire, Tennessee, California, \nand all across this country are going to be higher because of \nlegislation like we are considering today.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friends from Tennessee and \nNew Hampshire. I was going to make some opening comments, but I would \nalso add that my opening comments are somewhat related to the colloquy \nmy colleagues were just having about the bill we will be voting on \nshortly.\n  We also heard an expression from the voters of Missouri yesterday who \nvoted on a referendum on the issue of whether it is a good idea for the \nFederal Government to require individuals to retain health insurance, \nand 70 percent in Missouri, just yesterday, expressed their opposition \nto the notion. I know that is in court being litigated right now, as to \nwhether it is appropriate for the Federal Government or constitutional \nfor the Federal Government to require everyone to have a government-\nprescribed health care policy, but we had an expression of the people \nfrom Missouri yesterday as well on that aspect of what the Federal \nGovernment has been doing in the last year and a half. I thank my \ncolleagues for their enlightened comments.\n  As I was just indicating, this morning's paper carried an important \nmessage for us in Washington--a message that many of us have been \ntrying to get across for more than a year. If there was any doubt that \nAmericans are tired of being told their views are irrelevant by the \npeople they elected to represent them in Washington, last night's vote \nin Missouri should dispel it.\n  All throughout the health care debate, Democratic leaders in \nWashington told themselves they could do what they wanted and then \npersuade Americans after the fact that it was OK. Last night, the \nvoters in Missouri overwhelmingly rejected that notion. The people of \nMissouri have sent a message to Washington: Enough is enough.\n  They rejected the apparent belief by the current administration and \nDemocratic leaders in Congress that they know best--that distant \nbureaucrats and lawmakers inside the beltway have a better grasp of \nwhat ails people in places such as St. Louis than they do, and that \nlawmakers here have a right to impose their prescriptions on the people \nout there whether those people like it or not.\n  More specifically, the voters of Missouri sent a clear message that \nthe Federal Government has no business forcing people to buy health \ninsurance against their will. I applaud them for it. Throughout the \nhealth care debate, Republicans heard the concerns of our constituents \nand insisted on the kind of commonsense solutions they were asking \nfor--solutions that would actually do something to lower the cost of \ncare. Democrats preferred to do their own thing.\n  They said: Let's raise taxes and cut Medicare to expand government \nand then try to convince people it is in their best interest.\n  Well, the voters of Missouri showed us last night that Americans will \nnot allow this blatant power grab to stand without a fight. They don't \nthink bureaucrats in Washington have a right to force them to buy \ngovernment-designed health insurance, and they don't think States \nshould be forced to put millions of new people into Medicaid--as our \ncolleagues from New Hampshire and Tennessee were just discussing--any \nmore than they think we should bail out the States again this week with \nbillions more in spending at a time when neither we nor the States can \nafford it.\n  Washington needs to take care of its own fiscal mess, not deepen it \nby bailing out the States. We need to start listening to the concerns \nof the American people rather than trying to force them to go along \nwith far-reaching laws they do not want, either through unpopular \nlegislation or misleading PR campaigns like the one we saw earlier this \nweek in which the administration sought to convince seniors their \nhealth care plan wouldn't do what we all know it will do.\n\n  Americans weren't kidding when they said they opposed the health care \nbill, and they are not going away. This\n\n[[Page S6682]]\n\nis just the beginning. Some of us have been saying it for more than a \nyear. The American people will be heard. Whether it is the failed \nstimulus, the health care bill, or the financial regulatory bill, \nAmericans are more intent than ever on reversing the trend of \ncentralizing more and more power in Washington. They are alarmed at the \nfact the Federal Government is now, for the first time in our history, \nthe single largest source of revenue for the States. For the first time \nin our history, the Federal Government is the single largest source of \nrevenue for the States. They know that with more power in Washington \ncomes less accountability, and they are fighting back.\n  The lesson is clear: Americans expect the people they elect to put \ntheir interests and the interests of the country first. It is time to \nfollow through on the kinds of changes Americans actually want to see. \nIt is about solving the crisis in front of us instead of using them to \nforce a vision of America that Americans don't share.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the Senator from Washington ready? May I go forward on \na point of order?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is not in a quorum call.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thought I put us into a quorum call.\n  Mr. President, at this time I intend to make a point of order. \nActually, there are two points of order pending against this bill \ndealing with the budget. The budget is violated. It is not my budget--I \ndidn't vote for the budget. The Democratic budget is violated two times \nby this bill.\n  I am not going to make both because it would be redundant to have a \nvote on both. It wouldn't be redundant, actually. There are two \ndifferent points of order, and they are both fairly significant. So I \nwill just make one because I do think we should be on record.\n  If this Congress is going to pass a budget, which it did in the last \nsession--it has not done one in this session; it should--we should \nmaintain the discipline of that budget. That is why we did the budget. \nAnd it is not my budget; it is your budget. So I am just suggesting \nthat you follow your budget, if you are Members of the Democratic \nParty.\n  So with that point, I would make a point of order that section 404(a) \nof the 2010 budget resolution makes it out of order to consider \nlegislation that increases the deficit by more than $10 billion in the \nSenate for any fiscal year covered by the most recently agreed to \ncongressional budget resolution, S. Con. Res. 13.\n  The pending amendment would increase the short-term deficit in excess \nof $10 billion in the following year: 2011. Therefore, I raise a point \nof order under section 404(a) of S. Con. Res. 13 against the pending \namendment.\n  I would note that this exceeds the budget resolution by, I believe, \nabout $10 billion. That is how much it is out of kilter relative to \nwhat we said we would spend.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable budget \norder, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nappears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remains 12 minutes 39 seconds \non the majority side and 12 minutes 53 seconds on the minority side.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have several Senators coming to the \nfloor, if the Senator from New Hampshire wishes to continue speaking at \nthis time.\n  Mr. President, I will make a few comments then. We do have several \nSenators on their way at this time.\n  I listened with interest to our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle come to oppose the amendment that is being offered, and it is \nsurprising to me because, as everyone knows, we are in a very tough \neconomic recovery right now. All of our States, all of our communities, \nall of our families are struggling to get back on their feet. We have \nbeen working for some time now to help get our economy back on track.\n  As I outlined earlier, we have come forward to the Senate floor a \nnumber of times with small business bills and other bills to try to \nmove the economy forward, and we have been blocked every time.\n  On this amendment, where we have been trying to make sure that \n130,000 teachers are not lost--and it is not about the teachers unions; \nit is about kids in the classroom. This is about the future of the \nUnited States of America. Are we going to punish these students and \ngive them less of an education because of the economic time they happen \nto be in in the first grade or the fifth grade or the eighth grade? \nThat doesn't make sense to me as a mom or as a former teacher or as a \nSenator. This is about making sure our kids are not hurt in this tough \neconomic recession. It is at a time when the States are struggling with \ntheir budgets, and it is at a time when we have told them we are trying \nto help them fill the gap, a gap they have in Medicaid spending.\n  We went to our colleagues. They blocked the bills when we brought \nthem because they said they were too big. We made them smaller. They \nsaid they were not paid for. We went back and worked hard and brought \npay-fors now. Yet with all of this compromise, our Republican \ncolleagues have come to the floor today to say that now they have a new \nidea why they are opposing it--that we have not allowed States to have \nflexibility within their funding.\n  I remind all of us that Medicaid funding for a lengthy amount of time \nhas had strings attached. I would suggest to all of our colleagues that \nif we just had open-ended funding out to our States, we would not be \nhearing: Oh, you are sending money to States with strings attached; we \nwould be hearing the opposite: Oh, you are sending our States money \nwithout any strings attached.\n  So I say enough is enough with the politics. Enough is enough with \nfinding excuses. This is about people in our States who are struggling \ntoday to get back on their feet. This is a basic measure that we can \npass, fully paid for, at a time when our States--not just our States \nbut our children, our families, and our communities need it the most.\n  I urge our colleagues to work with us, to do what a legislative body \ndoes. When you compromise and you compromise and you compromise and you \nhave reached an agreement that makes a difference for people, let's \nmove it forward and start to help our families get back on their feet. \nThat is what this amendment is about, and I hope we get to the 60 votes \nand then can move, before we all go home for an August recess, to make \nsure people are breathing a little bit easier--the kids who are going \nto go off to school and the parents who are worried they are not \ngetting the right kind of education; in our States, the many \ncommunities of people who are worried, who are in poverty, who are \ngoing to lose their health care; state employees who work in our jails \nor provide very important functions for our States that we count on. \nThey are invisible. We don't see them all the time. But they make sure \nour lives are safe, that we can go to work and be cared for. That is \nwhat this amendment provides our States with the ability to do.\n  We all want our economy back on track. We all wish we were not here \nhaving to do this. But we are naive if we think our States are at a \npoint where this Federal Government, our United States, can start \nignoring them. That is what this amendment is about, and I urge our \ncolleagues to vote yes.\n  I see my colleague from New York has arrived, and I yield him the \nremainder of the time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I very much thank my colleague from \nWashington, who has been such a leader on\n\n[[Page S6683]]\n\nthis issue and on so many issues involving our economy, jobs, and the \nmiddle class. I thank her for her leadership on this issue as on so \nmany others.\n  Today, I rise in ardent support of the legislation before us. Let me \nbe clear. This critical funding bill is about one thing and one thing \nonly; that is, saving American jobs. Congress should be focused like a \nlaser on fighting unemployment and getting the economy humming on all \ncylinders again. This bill is part of that ongoing effort.\n  Our economy is starting to show signs of life again, but we have a \nlong, long way to go. We are on the road to recovery, but it is a rocky \nand uncertain one. Too many American families are still suffering from \nthe immeasurable hardship and heartache wrought by the worst recession \nsince the 1930s. We all know the unemployment rate is unacceptably \nhigh. What we cannot forget is that high unemployment is not a blue \nState problem or a red State problem; it is a national problem, and it \ndemands immediate bipartisan attention. If there is only one issue on \nwhich we can find common ground this year, it should be jobs. Yet the \nminority party has blocked this bill at every turn.\n  There is no doubt about it, if we fail to pass this bill, hundreds of \nthousands of teachers and firefighters will lose their jobs. \nNationwide, 140,000 teachers will be kicked out of the classroom if \nthis bill does not become law. In my home State of New York, there are \n7,100 teacher jobs on the line. From Watertown to Buffalo, from Oneida \nto Queens, every school district will have to make painful cuts. Will \nthose cuts hurt only the teachers? Of course not. Our kids--their \neducation is our future. They will have vital programs cut, their \neducation will decrease, and we all know that a child who loses \nsomething in the third grade or the sixth grade or the ninth grade \ndoesn't gain it back. How can you look a kid in the eye and explain \nthat their beloved teacher, Mrs. Ross or Mr. O'Malley, is no longer \nable to teach this year? We must pass this bill for the good of our \nNation's schoolchildren.\n  From coast to coast State budgets are bleeding. Many States have made \ntough, responsible choices--cutting important programs and making \nnecessary revenue adjustments. We cannot afford to kick them while they \nare down by denying them the FMAP and teacher funding.\n  We are fighting hard to create private sector jobs, and we should. \nBut to then allow so many public sector layoffs robs Peter to pay Paul. \nWe will not be able to reduce unemployment unless both the public and \nprivate sectors are healthy.\n  The bill directly injects money into our economy, and the best thing \nabout it is it saves jobs without adding a dime to the deficit. I say \nto my colleagues on the other side, again, it saves jobs without adding \na dime to the deficit. We cut in other places to help save the jobs of \nfirefighters and teachers. This bill is fully offset. It closes tax \nloopholes multinational companies use to dodge taxes abroad. We should \ndo that on its own, but the fact that now we have that as the offset, \nto do something so necessary and so good, is important.\n  I ask my colleagues to think of this not in terms of macronumbers but \nin terms of individuals--individuals who have worked hard their whole \nlives and are now about to be laid off; kids in classrooms who, again, \nwill not be able to have their teacher teach them. Maybe it is that \nspecial science class. Some schools are cutting football. Some people \nthink that is frivolous. I think that is an important part of school \nlife.\n  The greatness of this country depends on us overcoming our problems. \nUnemployment is a huge problem. The lack of having the best education \nin the world is a problem. Keeping our streets safe from fire and crime \nis a problem. We are running away from it here to hide behind \nideological barriers.\n  Let me repeat, this bill saves hundreds of thousands of jobs, \nprovides vital help to the States, and reduces the deficit. For the \ngood of the country, I implore my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to support this sensible and important bill. It is the right \nthing to do. Maybe just this once, in a bipartisan way, we will rise to \nthe occasion.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am voting to end a filibuster that is \nblocking critical funding for Wisconsin. Passage of this bill, as \namended, would help prevent major cuts to education and health care \nfunding as my State, and other States, continue to struggle to make up \nbudget shortfalls due to the biggest recession since the Great \nDepression. While I do not agree with all of the offsets in the bill, I \nam pleased that it is fully offset. In fact, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the bill will reduce the budget deficit by \n$1.4 billion over the next decade. Supporting this fiscally responsible \nfunding is the right thing to do for our children and for the many \nWisconsinites who depend on BadgerCare.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a package that \nwould provide critical relief to school districts across the Nation. \nThe proposed amendment would provide $10 billion in additional support \nto local school districts to prevent imminent layoffs.\n  It is estimated that this fund will help keep nearly 140,000 \neducators employed during the upcoming school year.\n  The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act has been credited with \nsaving 300,000 education jobs and has mitigated that impact of the \nrecession.\n  As that funding comes to an end, however, massive job cuts once again \nthreaten to stall economic recovery and damage our educational system.\n  Thus far, almost 80 percent of school districts across the Nation \nhave had to lay off educators. My home State of Maryland, which is No. \n1 in education according to Education Week for the second year in a \nrow, is not immune. One Maryland county has seen 800 jobs cut, 355 of \nthose classroom positions.\n  These job losses have an economic ripple effect. The Economic Policy \nInstitute projects that every 100,000 education jobs lost causes an \nadditional loss of 30,000 private sector jobs in local communities.\n  This can take a devastating toll on families and on whole \ncommunities.\n  As our children prepare to go back to school, let's think for a \nmoment about what these job cuts will mean for them.\n  For some, the bus route has changed since there are fewer drivers so \nit takes a bit longer to get to school.\n  When students get to class, it will be a little more crowded as the \nclass size grows to accommodate more students and fewer teachers.\n  The lunch lines might be longer because there are fewer cafeteria \nworkers to serve the students.\n  Art, music, and even social studies programs have been cut and \nteachers dismissed.\n  Get sick at your own risk because a school nurse will no longer be \navailable to assist with treatment.\n  So, the remaining teachers, in addition to performing their \ntraditional roles, now also become nurses, counselors, and custodians \nto even more students.\n  Larger class sizes, cutting programs, and cutting support personnel \nsuch as school nurses, counselors, bus drivers, and custodians, are \njust a few of the ways school districts are dealing with budgeting \nshortfalls.\n  Other options include unpaid furlough days and shortened school \nweeks.\n  All of these are detrimental to the educational experience and fly in \nthe face of what we are trying to achieve with educational reform.\n  There are many theories about education reform. But to put it quite \nsimply, there can be no educational reform if there are no teachers!\n  The $10 billion that this package puts into the States will provide \nimmediate relief to school districts across the Nation.\n  In Maryland, it could mean an estimated allocation of $178 million \nfor Maryland, translating to 2,200 jobs.\n  Yet it does not add 1 cent to the deficit. The education jobs funding \nis fully offset, including $8.4 billion in rescissions. This is not \nwithout sacrifice. I am particularly disappointed by the rescission of \n$10.7 million in Department of Education innovation and improvement \nfunds for public television's ``Ready to Teach'' program.\n  However, I am respectful of the difficult choices that must be made \nin these times of economic crisis. We need to make choices about \nspending. And I choose to support putting teachers to\n\n[[Page S6684]]\n\nwork and giving students the best chance to learn.\n  I urge my colleagues to think of the mixed messages we would send to \nour children by not making this investment and passing this amendment.\n  We say to our children that they should work hard to get the best out \nof education but then we are not willing to work to put the best into \nit?\n  We say that our children are our future but we are not willing to \ninvest in them?\n  We expect teachers to equip our children with the knowledge they need \nto succeed but are not willing to equip our teachers with the resources \nthey need to succeed?\n  It is time to stand up for our students and teachers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for education by \nvoting yes on the proposed amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remains 2\\1/2\\ minutes on the \nmajority side and 12 minutes 53 seconds on the minority side.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I reserve 1 minute of our time and ask that the quorum \ncall be equally divided between both sides and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?

Mr. President, can we have order in the Senate? Senator \nGregg wishes to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I made a point of order dealing with the \nbudget and the fact that this bill violates the budget, so I find \nmyself once again rising with enthusiasm to defend the Democratic \nbudget because that is what this bill violates. It is the Democratic \nbudget that is violated in this bill. It increases the deficit in 2011 \nby $22 billion. That is not small change anywhere in this country. So \n$22 billion is what the budget deficit increase is next year as a \nresult of this bill. That is why it violates the Democratic budget.\n  I congratulate my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for \nputting in place this point of order. I presume they would want to \ndefend their own budget and defend this point of order because they do \nnot want to run up the deficit by $22 billion in 2011.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my good friend, the senior Senator from the \nState of New Hampshire, whom I admire so much, had to be smiling when \nhe said that. I think he was part of the time. This is paid for. He \nobjects to how it is paid for. That is a new one here.

The Chair announces that the time \nbetween now and 12 noon will be equally divided between the chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee and the ranking Republican.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, over the last few weeks, many Americans \nhave watched Supreme Court confirmation hearings that took place before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. At times, the atmosphere was tense, but \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle performed their solemn duty \nunder the Constitution. They subjected the President's nominee to \nrigorous questioning and took a hard look at her qualifications.\n  At every turn, the nominee offered thoughtful testimony and proved \nherself to be a woman of powerful intellect and sound judgment.\n  Earlier this week I met with Solicitor General Elena Kagan in my \noffice. I congratulated her on her nomination to the highest Court in \nthe land. Then I asked her some tough questions of my own.\n  The power to advise and consent is not one this Senate should ever \ntake lightly. As a trained lawyer and former attorney general of \nIllinois, I have a deep understanding of the Court's enormous impact on \nthe lives of ordinary Americans. These nine individuals have the power \nto set binding precedent. They are trusted to navigate difficult legal \nground, and in every case, they hand down rulings that carry the full \nweight of law.\n\n[[Page S6686]]\n\n  There are no armies to back them up. There is no threat of violence; \njust a quiet force of a written opinion. That is what makes this \ncountry so remarkable. We are a nation of laws. We have dedicated \nourselves to the principle of self-government. Although our legal \nlandscape is consistently evolving, the Founders of this great Republic \ncreated a strong judiciary charged with interpretation of these laws \nand upholding the Constitution. So when this body considers a \nnomination to the Federal bench, it is a duty my colleagues and I take \nvery seriously.\n  After speaking with Solicitor General Kagan on Tuesday, I am \nconfident she will be a worthy addition to the Supreme Court. General \nKagan's legal training is second to none, and her diverse experience \nwill bring added depth to the highest Court in the land.\n  As a former law clerk, a private practice attorney, a professor, and \ndean of Harvard Law School, Elena Kagan has proven herself to be a \nworld-class legal mind. As the current U.S. Solicitor General and as a \nformer associate White House counsel, she possesses a keen \nunderstanding of current issues and a strong commitment to the values \nof public service.\n  As I take the floor today, she is poised to become the fourth female \nJustice ever to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. More important, she \nwill be the first Justice in many years who was not elevated to the \nCourt from a lower court. I believe this will lend fresh perspective to \nthe highest judicial body in our land that will bring new diversity to \nthe Supreme Court and help to build debate rather than consensus.\n  It is our constitutional duty to shape a high Court that is inclusive \nof all considerations and points of view. Each ruling is grounded in \ntested reasoning and bound by the weight of precedent. If Elena Kagan \nis confirmed, I am confident she will help do just that. She will be a \nnew, independent voice standing on the side of fairness and reason.\n  I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting \nher timely confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nconsequential vote the Senate is getting ready to take, probably \ntomorrow, on the nomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  Without question, the advise-and-consent role of the Senate on \nSupreme Court appointments is very important. It is one of our most \nimportant constitutional duties. Like elections, Supreme Court \nappointments have consequences.\n  Nearly a year ago, this body considered the record, the judicial \nphilosophy, and the statements of Justice Sonia Sotomayor. At the time, \nI vocalized my serious concerns about her second amendment views and \nher correlating judicial record on the Second Circuit Court.\n  When Ms. Sotomayor was questioned about these views during her \nconfirmation hearing, she said:\n\n       I understand the individual right fully that the Supreme \n     Court recognized in Heller.\n\n  Which was the previous case that stated the second amendment is an \nindividual right to keep and bear arms.\n  Because of her record in the Second Circuit on this issue, I was not \nconvinced that she would uphold the Framers' intent that the right to \nkeep and bear arms is, indeed, a fundamental individual right, and \nlargely on her record on this issue I opposed her nomination.\n  Just last month, Justice Sotomayor voted with the minority on the \nMcDonald v. City of Chicago case to uphold Chicago's gun ban. This \nminority opinion stated:\n\n       I can find nothing in the Second Amendment's text, history, \n     or underlying rationale that could warrant characterizing it \n     as ``fundamental'' to protect the keeping and bearing of arms \n     for private self-defense purposes.\n\n  That was a disappointment, but it was not a surprise. It reaffirms \nwhy we must thoroughly scrutinize the nominee's judicial philosophy and \ndemonstrated adherence to the Constitution as we determine whether to \nsupport a nomination.\n  We have been faced with a somewhat unique confirmation process for \nMs. Kagan. She has primarily worked in politics and academia rather \nthan in the actual practice or adjudication of law. It is not a \nnegative to me that she has not been a judge. I do think having a new \nperspective of a practicing lawyer or someone who has clearly stated \nand written extensively on their Constitutional views could be a good \nthing. But it also means that if you have someone who has not actually \npracticed law, there is not very much evidence on her methodology or \nviewpoints on major constitutional issues. We have to use the \ninformation we have to make a judgment.\n  I turn to the biggest incident in my mind that causes me to have \ngreat concerns about her nomination. It was Ms. Kagan's decision to ban \nmilitary recruiters from Harvard's Office of Career Services when she \nwas dean of the Harvard Law School. When my distinguished colleagues on \nthe Judiciary Committee pressed her on this issue during her \nconfirmation hearing, Ms. Kagan claimed that ``don't ask, don't tell'' \nviolated Harvard's antidiscrimination policy. Thus, she denied our \nmilitary equal access to some of the brightest new legal minds in the \nNation, and she did so in a time of war.\n  This snub demeaned our military and defied Federal law. The U.S. \nSupreme Court unanimously disagreed with her actions in its 9-to-0 \nruling on the Solomon Amendment.\n  In the Senate, we must strongly consider how Ms. Kagan's personal \npolitical views guided this and other decisions she has made while \nholding positions of authority. I am deeply concerned that Ms. Kagan \nwill not exercise the impartiality that must be expected of any nominee \nseeking a lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest Court.\n  Another factor that troubles me is her apparent indifference to \nprivate property rights. During the confirmation hearings, my colleague \nfrom Iowa, Senator Grassley, asked Ms. Kagan her view on the 2005 \nruling on the eminent domain case Kelo v. the City of New London. Ms. \nKagan evaded the constitutionality of private property rights and \nsuggested that the goal of Kelo was to leave the issue to the States.\n  I do not believe the Supreme Court decision in Kelo did that. It \nactually empowered a local entity to trample private property rights \nthat I believe are protected under the Constitution.\n  As I have already mentioned, we have less of a record to examine Ms. \nKagan's qualifications because she has not been a judge. All Justices \ncurrently on the bench served as judges before their Supreme Court \nappointments. I do believe there is merit to bringing the perspectives \nof other sectors of the legal field to the Supreme Court. It is not a \npoint against her at all that she was not a Federal judge.\n  However, Ms. Kagan also has had limited experience in actual legal \npractice, which provides us a very thin record on which to evaluate her \njudicial philosophy. Indeed, one statement she made that might give us \na glimpse into her philosophy is from her Oxford graduate thesis in \nwhich she stated: ``It is not necessarily wrong or invalid'' for judges \n``to mold and steer the law in order to promote certain ethical values \nand achieve certain social ends.''\n  She was a student when she wrote this, so I give her some leeway \nbecause she might have changed her views since then. But she did not \nsay she changed her views when she had the opportunity to before the \nJudiciary Committee during her confirmation hearings. She has not \ndisavowed judicial activism, which makes me think then perhaps that is \na guiding principle in her thinking.\n  The experience we have to look at, specifically her tenure as dean of \nHarvard Law School, gives evidence of her personal views instructing \nher professional decisions in order to promote a social agenda.\n  I simply cannot reconcile Ms. Kagan's sparse record and my concerns \nabout whether she can be an impartial arbiter of the law. I will say I \nthink Ms. Kagan's academic record is excellent, and that is a major \nqualification we would expect of a Supreme Court nominee. She has \ncertainly done good things with her life. But the areas where I am \nconcerned, which would be the protection of the second amendment as an \nindividual right, which was clearly the intent of the Framers of our \nConstitution and which the Supreme Court has already held to be the\n\n[[Page S6687]]\n\ndoctrine of our country, I don't believe she is going to agree with \nthat position from what she has said in her record, as thin as it is.\n  I have to say that I am very concerned about her position on the \nmilitary, the respect for the military, the importance of the military \nin our great country, and the protection of freedom our military \nprovides. To disallow military recruiters on the Harvard campus at the \nsame location where everyone else offers their recruitment \nopportunities weighs heavily on me. In addition, her views on private \nproperty rights and the Supreme Court Kelo decision are directly \nopposite from mine and from what I believe are inherent Constitutional \nprotections. I think the Supreme Court was wrong. Even people I have \nvoted to confirm as a Senator on the Supreme Court, in my opinion, were \nwrong on the Kelo decision. I do think private property rights are part \nof the success of America and one of the strongest provisions in the \nConstitution that provides for our free enterprise system, as well as \nthe rights of individuals.\n  I am not going to support Ms. Kagan's appointment.\n  Last but not least, I will say in weighing my responsibility as a \nSenator and looking at Supreme Court appointments and any Federal \njudicial appointment, but certainly for appointments to the highest \nCourt in our land, Justices are there simply to be arbiters of the law. \nThey are not elected and therefore have no real accountability to the \npeople of our country. It is elected officials who make and implement \nthe laws whom people always have had the ability to reject. That is \npart of the balance in our system. Our President is elected. Our \nCongress is elected. Congress makes the laws and the President signs or \ndoes not sign a law. The Supreme Court is a lifetime appointment. \nBecause it is a lifetime appointment, the founders in their wisdom knew \nthe Court should not be responsible for making law because they have \nnot been elected by the people of our country and they will not have to \nface the electorate of our country. They need to have a judicial \ntemperament and a view of the Constitution that says they are going to \ntry to determine the intent, not try to change the intent, just because \nit differs from their particular views. Therefore, I am always very \nstudied in my approach to Federal appointments that have a lifetime \ntenure because I think when they will not have to face any future \nelectorate, when the people of our country will not have an opportunity \nto hold them accountable for what they have done, the Senate's advise \nand consent role is even more important. So I have to say that while I \nrespect her as a person and as an academic, I cannot support her \nnomination to be a member of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe reasons for my vote for the nomination of Solicitor General Elena \nKagan to the Supreme Court and to comment more broadly on the status of \nthe Court and the nomination process, which I have seen during my \ntenure in the Senate, where some 14 nominees have been submitted by \nPresidents.\n  I have sought 1 hour, which is the longest I can recollect asking to \nspeak, because of the wide scope of issues which the Senate faces in \nits constitutional responsibility for the confirmation of Supreme Court \nJustices.\n  Early on, as I observed the nominees, I came to the conclusion that \nnominees would answer only about as many questions as they thought they \nhad to to be confirmed. The nomination process during my tenure reached \nthe most extreme point of nonanswers during the confirmation in 1986 of \nJustice Scalia.\n  Justice Scalia stated in advance that he would not talk about \nideology or philosophy. I saw Justice Scalia at the 90th birthday party \nof a distinguished American, former Secretary of Transportation, Bill \nColeman, and in a group of people I joked a little and I said: Mr. \nJustice Scalia, even prisoners of war have to give name, rank, and \nserial number. When your nomination was up you would only give your \nname and rank--which was in a light spirit, and he took it that way. \nBut virtually no answers were given during the course of that \nproceeding, and he was confirmed unanimously, 98 to nothing.\n  At that time, Senator DeConcini and I were considering a resolution \nto establish standards for the Senate to require responses by nominees. \nBut then, in 1987, the confirmation proceeding of Judge Bork occurred. \nIn that proceeding Judge Bork answered many questions which, in fact, \nhe had to because he had such an extensive so-called paper trail. He \nhad written a very famous Law Review article in 1971 in the University \nof Indiana Law Review on the doctrine of original intent. If we look to \noriginal intent, for example, when the 14th amendment was adopted, \nequal protection, the galleries in this Chamber were segregated. That \nwas hardly a standard that could be applied in an era of Brown v. Board \nof Education, and it was not. We have a Constitution which evolves in \naccordance with the changing values of our society, and Judge Bork was \ncompelled to answer a great many questions.\n  So Senator DeConcini and I shelved our idea to try to find some \nstandards, but then in the intervening nominations we had nominees \nrevert to form, answering only as many questions as they thought they \nhad to in order to be confirmed and not to have any significant \ndisclosures on ideology or philosophy. I thought, when we had the \nnomination of Elena Kagan, that there would be an opportunity for \ngreater insights because she had written a now famous Law Review \narticle for the University of Chicago, in 1995, sharply criticizing \nSupreme Court nominees by name and sharply criticizing the Senate. She \nsaid in that article that Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer had \nstonewalled, had not given any meaningful answers. She criticized the \nSenate for, in effect, letting them get away with that.\n  But during the confirmation proceedings of Ms. Kagan, it was a repeat \nperformance, and the issue was brought and I shall illustrate it with \none line of questioning which I asked her. It was about what was the \nrequisite record that Congress had to have to uphold the \nconstitutionality of legislation it passes. The standard had been, for \ndecades, that if there was a rational basis for the legislation, it \nwould be upheld. That was the standard in the Wirtz case in 1968, \narticulated by Justice Harlan.\n  Then, in a sharp departure, in 1997 in a case captioned City of \nBoerne, the Supreme Court plucked out of thin air a new standard for \nthe adequacy of a record. They said the standard had to be \nproportionate and congruent. Justice Scalia later criticized that \nstandard as being a ``flabby test,'' which enabled the Court to in \neffect legislate. They decided it however their predilections would \ncall for. In two cases under the Americans with Disabilities Act--in \nthe case of Tennessee v. Lane and in the case of Alabama v. Garrett--\nthe Supreme Court came to opposite conclusions, interpreting two \nsections of that same act which had a very voluminous record, which \nillustrates the vagueness of the standard and further illustrates the \nwords of Justice Scalia that it was a ``flabby standard'' which enabled \nthe Court to, in effect, legislate.\n  So the question which I asked Ms. Kagan was, What is the standard? In \nher Law Review article she had been explicit in saying that standards \ninvolving how you decide a case were well within the ambit of \nappropriate senatorial inquiry in a confirmation proceeding. I asked \nher the question, and she declined to answer, as she did repeatedly not \njust for my questions but for questions of other Senators.\n  I raised the issue in those confirmation proceedings as to whether we \ncould find some way to get reasonable answers short of voting no.\n  I noted Senator Kyl in his presentation yesterday cited that \nquestion, which is on his mind as well.\n  In the final analysis, as I stated during the course of the Judiciary \nCommittee deliberations, I have decided to vote for Ms. Kagan because \nshe was following an accepted pattern. That is what nominees have been \ndoing, and it has been accepted by the Senate. I did not think it \nappropriate to cast a protest vote for her testimony. There were\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\nfacets about her nomination which I found very appealing. I found it \nvery important that she cited Thurgood Marshall as a role model. With \nthat in mind, and with the fact that she was replacing a Justice on the \nliberal wing, it seemed to me that her confirmation would maintain the \ncurrent balance.\n  I am also impressed with the President's nominating another woman. I \nthink that is very salutary. When I came to the Senate, prior to the \n1980 election, we only had one woman Senator, Senator Nancy Landon \nKassebaum. Now our body is much improved with the 17 women we now have \nin this body. I thought that was a desirable trait. I also thought it \nwas good to have somebody on the Court who had not been on the circuit \ncourt of appeals. All of the other eight Justices come from the circuit \ncourts of appeals, and I have urged Presidents in the past to nominate \nsomebody with a broader background, broader diversity of experience. I \nthink Ms. Kagan represents that quality and that attribute.\n  I have been asked about the distinction I make between my negative \nvote for Solicitor General contrasted with my affirmative vote for \nSupreme Court. It is based on the fact that I thought for the Solicitor \nGeneral we were entitled to answers. In that proceeding in the \nJudiciary Committee she refused to answer questions which I thought \nwere requisite.\n  I asked her what her position would be on the case involving an \nappeal by Holocaust victims to the Supreme Court of the United States. \nThe Court looks to the Solicitor General for the position of the \ngovernment. It seemed to me that case should have been heard by the \nSupreme Court. The argument was made that the courts ought to be \nforeclosed from deciding it because it ought to be governed by an \ninternational pact between governments. It seems to me the Holocaust \nvictims were entitled to their day in court.\n  Ms. Kagan would not answer the question.\n  I similarly raised what position she would take as Solicitor General \non an appeal taken by the survivors of victims of 9/11. The Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit had said there was not State-sponsored \nterrorism involved because Saudi Arabia was not on the list. This is in \nthe face of voluminous evidence that Saudi princes and Saudi charities \nhad financed the terrorists on 9/11. There is nothing in tort exception \nto the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act which requires a country to be \non the list of state sponsors of terrorists.\n  The Solicitor General said the Second Circuit was wrong but used the \nreason, well, the acts occurred outside the United States, which seemed \nto be insufficient when the consequences were devastating within the \nUnited States, with airplanes being flown into skyscrapers in New York \nCity. Her refusal to answer those questions led to my negative vote in \nthat situation.\n  The nominations which I have seen, especially the last four \nnominations, bring into very sharp focus two major problems which \nconfront Senators in seeking to exercise our constitutional \nresponsibility on confirmation. As I have already commented to some \nextent, one is the difficulty of getting answers to get some \nsignificant idea of the nominee's ideology or philosophy. The second \nproblem is the factor that when nominees have testified in response to \nquestions--as Justice Alito and Chief Justice Roberts did--on issues \nsuch as deferral to congressional factfinding and to stare decisis, \nwhat recourse do we have when the nominees, once seated, do a 180-\ndegree reversal.\n  I believe there is an approach we can undertake on that, and that is \nto inform the public as to what is going on and to have a public \nunderstanding of those positions as a factor, which I think, \nrealistically viewed, could influence Justices to stand by, at least in \na respectable way, their testimony at the confirmation hearing.\n  The difficulty with the recent trend in the Supreme Court decisions, \nas I see it, is that there has been an abrogation of the fundamental \ndoctrine, constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. When the \nConstitution was formulated, as is well known, there were three \nbranches of government--article I, the Congress; article 2, the \nexecutive; and article 3, the court system.\n  The separation of powers was viewed as an indispensable element in \nappropriate governance, providing for the checks and balances.\n  But we have seen in recent decades that the decisions of the Court \nhave taken a great deal of power from the Congress and a great deal of \npower has been shifted to the Court. There have been very significant \ncases where the Court has declined to act where significant power has \nshifted to the executive branch.\n  I will be very specific. In United States v. Lopez, decided in 1995, \nthe Supreme Court altered 60 years of uniform interpretation of the \ncommerce clause which has been the basis from the 1930s for declaring \nNew Deal legislation unconstitutional. In the face of a Court packing \nplan President Roosevelt was articulating to raise the number of \nJustices to 15, the Court had given broader latitude to congressional \nauthority under the commerce clause, and that was abruptly changed in \nthe Lopez case.\n  The case of United States v. Morrison involved a further abrogation \nof congressional authority. That case involved legislation protecting \nwomen against violence. There, the Supreme Court of the United States, \nin the face of a mountain of evidence, as specified in the dissent by \nJustice Souter, ruled that the act was unconstitutional. The reason for \nthe ruling, according to the opinion of the Court, written by Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, was the congressional ``method of reasoning.'' When \nI saw that in the opinion, I wondered what transformation there was on \nmethod of reasoning when a nominee stepped outside of the Senate \nhearing room on a nomination to walk across Constitution Avenue and sit \non the Supreme Court. I wondered what was the method of reasoning which \ndistinguishes what goes on in this Chamber from what happens a few \nhundred yards to the east in the Supreme Court of the United States. \nBut that is what the Supreme Court decided--it was our method of \nreasoning which was faulty. Method of reasoning. Another way of saying: \nYou are stupid. Method of reasoning. Another way of saying: You don't \nknow what you are doing. Well, the Congress's power, under the \nConstitution, is to legislate, and it has been regarded for decades--\nreally, centuries--that when Congress has a rational basis for what we \ndo, it is upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  A few minutes ago, I referred to the cases of Tennessee v. Lane and \nAlabama v. Garrett, two cases which were decided under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. Once again, there were hearings held in many \nStates, enormous records, but the Supreme Court of the United States \ndecided in Tennessee v. Lane, which involved access to public \nfacilities--a paraplegic was unable to get to an elevated floor in a \nTennessee courtroom. They had no elevator. The Supreme Court said that \nwas a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act under the \nstandard of congruence and proportionality. Then in Alabama v. \nGarrett--same act, same kinds of voluminous hearings--which raised the \nissue of employment discrimination, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates decided by five to four that it was unconstitutional.\n  It was in the Lane case that Justice Scalia articulated his now often \nquoted comment that congruence and proportionality is a ``flabby test'' \nwhich calls upon the Supreme Court to check the homework of the \nCongress. That is the way he put it. What we do over here requires \nsomeone else to check on our homework, as a parent would on a fifth \ngrader, and Justice Scalia commented that was not the way to treat a \nbranch of coordinate authority as the Constitution requires.\n  The Supreme Court in those cases has taken power to themselves to \ndisagree with our factfinding and to declare acts unconstitutional \nunder this standard which is not understandable on any rational basis, \nproved by the Court itself on those two cases, Garrett and Lane.\n  The Court has further significantly affected the balance of power and \nthe separation of power by deciding not to decide certain cases. In \nexercising their discretion not to take cases, they have let rulings \nstand which have given an enormous amount of what is legitimately, in \nmy opinion, congressional authority to the executive branch of \ngovernment.\n  I cite first the situation involving the terrorist surveillance \nprogram--\n\n[[Page S6689]]\n\nwarrantless wiretaps put into effect after 9/11--contrasted with \ncongressional authority under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, which establishes, by act of Congress, that the exclusive means to \ninvade privacy on a wiretap is by going to a court, having an affidavit \nstating probable cause, having judicial review and the judge deciding \nthat the requirements of the fourth amendment prohibiting unreasonable \nsearch and seizures are satisfied. Well, the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States has declined to hear that case.\n  A Federal judge in Detroit declared the terrorist surveillance \nprogram unconstitutional. The case went on appeal to the Court of \nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit. The defense was interposed of lack of \nstanding, and in a split decision--two to one--the Sixth Circuit \ndecided that there was not the requisite standing. Well, standing is a \nvery fluid doctrine, and it is used from time to time to avoid deciding \nan issue. Common parlance would say that is a good way to duck a case. \nThe dissent in that case was powerful, I think by any fair reading, had \nmuch more legal authority behind it that there was standing to raise \nthis issue.\n  Certiorari was sought from the Supreme Court of the United States, \nand they denied cert. As is the custom, they didn't say why. That \ninaction by the Supreme Court--and the Supreme Court has tremendous \nimpact by its inaction, contrasted with cases it does decide--that \nleaves the President with the power which the President asserts under \narticle II of the Constitution as Commander in Chief, contrasted with \nthe authority of Congress under article I to legislate with the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. That is a case which we really ought to \nhave an answer to one way or another. The Court ought to make a \ndecision in a case such as that.\n  Another case which illustrates the concession of legislative \nauthority to the executive branch by inaction of the Court involves the \nlawsuit brought by survivors of the victims of 9/11 where the \nGovernment of Saudi Arabia was sued, as were Saudi princes, as was a \nSaudi charity, for financing the 19 Saudis who were among the 20 \nterrorists directing the planes which crashed into the Trade Centers in \nNew York and in Somerset County in my State, Pennsylvania, and into the \nPentagon in Virginia. And the evidence there was overwhelming.\n  Recently, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing, which I chaired, on \nlegislation to cure the problems that were articulated by the Second \nCircuit and by the Solicitor General. But in that case, the Court \ndeclined to take jurisdiction, denied cert. So here you have the \nCongress of the United States, in a very important piece of \nlegislation--the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act--saying that foreign \nstates were not immune for tortuous conduct, like crashing into a \nbuilding.\n  As I had alluded to very briefly earlier, the Second Circuit found \nagainst the survivors of the victims on the grounds that Saudi Arabia \nwas not a state which had been designated by the State Department as a \nterrorist state. Well, there is nothing in the legislative enactment \nwhich requires a state to be on the terrorist list in order to \nestablish liability.\n  The Solicitor General said the Second Circuit was wrong but in \nopposing a grant of certiorari, came up with a different theory, and \nthat was that the acts occurred outside of the United States in \nfinancing the terrorists. Well, how much more direct impact could \nconduct have than financing terrorists coming to the United States to \nhijack planes and to do what the 9/11 terrorists did? Well, that case \nremains unresolved, and we are looking for a legislative change to deal \nwith that case. But here is another illustration where the Court, by \nnot deciding a case, shifted a tremendous amount of authority to the \nFederal Government to decide as a matter of foreign policy not to anger \nthe Saudis, under the great proposition, under the great legal holding \nof oil, oil, oil. But there we are--more power in the executive, less \npower in the Congress.\n  So these are issues which we really need to understand and get \nanswers from nominees if we are to maintain the balance in the \nseparation of powers, which is a very fundamental point in our system \nof constitutional governance.\n  In considering the nomination of Elena Kagan, as I said, concerned \nwith maintaining the balance on the Court--and the Court has really \nbecome an ideological battleground. Chief Justice Roberts, in an \ninterview with C-SPAN, recently said: We are not a political branch of \ngovernment. We are not a political branch of government. I will return \nto that in some greater detail in a few moments.\n  Richard Posner, Judge Richard Posner, a distinguished judge on the \nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in a very noted book on the \njudiciary, devoted an entire chapter, chapter 10--which the title is: \nThe Supreme Court Is a Political Court. The Court decides political \nissues. The Court decides political governance, political values, \npolitical rights, and political power.\n\n  The status of an ideological battleground is illustrated by the \ndecision of the Supreme Court of the United States in a case captioned \nCitizens United, which upset 100 years of precedents in permitting \ncorporations to pay for political advertising. This is a case which \ncame to the Court on a grant of certiorari to examine the McCain-\nFeingold Act to decide whether the application of that act was \nconstitutional as it applies to a movie about Hillary Clinton. Well, \nthat was under the standard of ``as applied.''\n  The case was argued in the Supreme Court. Then, sua sponte--the Latin \nexpression which means ``on the court's own authority''--after the case \nwas argued, the parties were then notified that the Court was going to \nconsider the constitutionality of McCain-Feingold facially, which means \nwhether it would be unconstitutional in any context. But that is an \nunusual reach by the Court.\n  Then, in a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court decided to overrule a \nrelatively recent case, the Austin case, and to overrule certain \nportions of McConnell v. the Federal Election Commission. The case was \nnoteworthy in two respects. One is, the Court disregarded a 100,000-\npage record, which had been amassed in congressional hearings, showing \nthe undesirable consequences of money in politics, how it raises the \nskepticism of the American people about the integrity of government and \nraises issues of corruption in government and the collateral issue of \nthe appearance of corruption in government.\n  The case was especially problemsome from the point of view that Chief \nJustice Roberts and Justice Alito had testified at great length about \ndeference to Congress on congressional findings, and all that was \nignored in the Court's decision. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice \nAlito had testified extensively. Twenty-eight minutes of my first round \nof 30 minutes of the Roberts confirmation hearing was addressed to the \nissue of stare decisis. Chief Justice Roberts, as a nominee, was \nemphatic about respect for stare decisis, observing precedents, as was \nJustice Alito, and the stability of the law and, as Chief Justice \nRoberts said, not jolting the system but to have modest decisions.\n  In a concurring opinion--only Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito \nsigned the concurring opinion; the other three Justices in the majority \ndid not--but in that concurring opinion was a 180-degree reversal as to \nwhat both nominees had testified to during their confirmation \nproceedings.\n  I have said in discussing this issue in the past that I appreciate \nthe difference between answers in a nomination proceeding and what a \nsitting Justice has a responsibility to do on the bench and in deciding \ncases and I do not, in any way, impugn the good faith of Chief Justice \nRoberts and Justice Alito. But from the perspective of a Senator asking \nquestions about how nominees are going to approach judicial philosophy \nand judicial ideology, there ought to be some approach which would give \nsome greater consideration to that testimony and those commitments made \nto Senators who then vote for their confirmation.\n  This issue was taken up by circuit judge Richard Posner, whom I \nquoted earlier on the proposition that the Supreme Court is, in fact, a \npolitical body and makes political decisions, makes decisions on \npolitical governance and political values and political rights and \npolitical power. This is what Judge\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\nPosner had to say about the decisions of Chief Justice Roberts. The \nChief Justice has ``demonstrated by his judicial votes and opinions \nthat he aspires to remake significant areas of constitutional law.'' \nThe ``tension'' between what he had said at his confirmation hearing \nand ``what he is doing as a Justice is a blow to Roberts' reputation. . \n. .''\n  The issue of who understands what happens in complex cases such as \nCitizens United--it has a very limited impact. For those who study the \nconfirmation testimony closely and for those who study the opinions \nclosely, there is an issue raised as to reputation, and I do believe it \nis a fact that Justices, similar to all the rest of us, are concerned \nabout their reputations.\n  So the issue then is, What can be done to acquaint the public with \nwhat happens in the Supreme Court of the United States? What is going \non with the balance of power and the separation of power? What is \nhappening with the constitutional responsibility of Senators to ask \nquestions, to use that as a basis for confirmation?\n  I believe one step which can be taken of real significance would be \nthe televising of the Supreme Court. Is it an absolute answer? Well, of \ncourse not. But Justice Brandeis, in a very famous article written in \n1913, said that sunlight was the best disinfectant, and he analogized \nthe disinfectant quality of sunlight with publicity on solving social \nproblems and social ills.\n  There was an article by Stuart Taylor which appeared in the \nWashington Post, captioned ``Why the justices play politics.'' This, I \nthink, is very weighty in the observation of an astute commentator on \nthe Supreme Court and what is happening on the precise issues which I \nam raising today about the Court taking over congressional power and \nthe Court acting in a political way on the Court's decisions. This is \nwhat Stuart Taylor, Jr., had to say:\n\n       The key is for the justices to prevent judicial review from \n     degenerating into judicial usurpation. And the only way to do \n     that is to have a healthy sense of their own fallibility and \n     to defer far more often to the elected branches in the many \n     cases in which original meaning is elusive.\n\n  Then, Mr. Taylor comments about nominee Kagan:\n\n       Elena Kagan professed such a modest approach in her \n     confirmation testimony. Yet so did the eight current \n     justices, and once on the court, all eight have voted \n     repeatedly to expand their own powers and to impose policies \n     that they like in the name of constitutional interpretation.\n\n  So that is in line with the title of this article: ``Why the justices \nplay politics.''\n  Mr. Taylor goes on to say this:\n\n       Why so modest?\n\n  That is, why is the Court so modest?\n\n       Perhaps because the justices know that as long as they stop \n     short of infuriating the public, they can continue to enjoy \n     better approval ratings than Congress and the president even \n     as they usurp those branches' powers.\n\n  This is an interesting test--more even than interesting, it is \nintriguing--the test of infuriating the public. There have been \nsubstantial efforts made to acquaint the public with the gridlock in \nthe Congress of the United States, that we are failing to act on \nmatters of enormous importance because of raw, partisan politics. There \nis an effort in the New Yorker magazine, current edition, about what is \nhappening in the Congress, which would infuriate anybody who reads it, \nand we are waiting for more of the mainstream press to tell the \nAmerican people how raw the politics are here, how partisan it is, and \nthe gigantic wall which separates the two parties here. We call it an \naisle. Well, it would more accurately be called a wall, taller and \ntougher than the Berlin Wall. That wall has come down.\n  But we are undertaking enormous delays on extending unemployment \ncompensation, in an economy where people cannot find jobs, and it is a \nmatter of being sustained, avoiding eviction from their houses, buying \ngroceries for their families. But I think what we have here, \nrealistically viewed, is a test of infuriating the public before you \nget some response. But that is a pretty tough job to do, to infuriate \nthe public.\n  Chief Justice Roberts was interviewed recently by C-SPAN and had this \nto say in elaboration on his contention of the Court is not a political \nbody. On that point, Chief Justice Roberts may be right, or Chief \nJustice Roberts may be wrong. Judge Richard Posner and Stuart Taylor \nmay be right in specifying political activity in the Court, and the \nobservation of many of us is that it is an ideological battleground, a \npolitical ideological battleground. But this is what Chief Justice \nRoberts had to say on a C-SPAN interview a few months ago:\n\n       I think the most important thing for the public to \n     understand is that we are not a political branch of \n     government. They didn't elect us. If they don't like what \n     we're doing, it's more or less just too bad.\n\n  Well, it is true that ``they didn't elect us'' and that they don't \nhave standing to legislate. That is up to the Congress. But I am not \nprepared to accept the statement ``if they don't like what we're doing, \nit's more or less just too bad.'' I am not prepared to accept that in a \ndemocracy. I am not prepared to accept that when we have the learning \nof Justice Brandeis and know from our own practical experience that \nsunlight is the best disinfectant. Publicity has a tremendous effect on \nthe way government operates on all levels, including, I submit, the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  They made a drastic departure in the New Deal legislation in the \n1930s in the face of overwhelming public opinion. When we have \nobservers such as Judge Posner commenting about the impact on the \nreputations of Justices, I think if there were a general understanding \nas to what goes on, there could be an effect on that. We could get more \nout of nominees in the confirmation process, and we could have a \ngreater likelihood of having Justices, once confirmed, follow what they \nhave said during their confirmation hearings.\n  I have pressed this idea of televising the Court for a long time--\nmore than a decade. I have introduced legislation calling for the Court \nto be televised unless in a specific case there is cause showing why, \nin that one case, there should not be television. The bill has been \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee on a number of occasions and is \nnow on the agenda. I have reason to believe we will have a chance to \nvote on the Senate amendment. I have talked to the leadership in the \nHouse of Representatives and have gotten favorable responses there. The \nJudiciary Committee voted it out recently 13 to 6, so that is more than \nthe 2 to 1. I believe there is adequate legal basis for the \nlegislation.\n  Congress cannot tell the Court how to decide cases, but the Congress \ndoes have the authority to establish administrative matters in the \nCourt. For example, the Congress has the authority to decide how many \nJustices will be on the Court. In response to the restrictive \ninterpretations of the Supreme Court in the 1930s, President Roosevelt \nfloated a court-packing plan to raise the number of Justices to 15. \nThat was defeated, and I think wisely so.\n  I think the principle of judicial independence is the hallmark of our \nsociety governed as a rule of law, and I think we have to maintain that \njudicial independence within the existing framework. But I think \ntelevising the Court would still respect that.\n  Just as Congress has the authority to determine how many Justices \nthere will be, Congress has the authority to decide what a quorum of \nthe Court is, how many members must be present for the Court to act. We \nset that number at six. The Congress sets the date when the Court will \nstart its session--on the first Monday in October. The Congress has \nestablished time limits on judicial decisions. Habeas corpus has been \ndelayed tremendously; Congress has that authority. Congress has the \nauthority to tell the Court what cases to hear--not how they decide \nthem but what cases to hear--illustratively, on McCain-Feingold, part \nof the legislation on the flag burning case. The Congress has the \nauthority to establish the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on \ndiscretionary matters.\n  The Justices are frequently televised. Quite a number of them appear \non television, on ``60 Minutes.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a listing of \nsituations where Justices have appeared on television.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Examples of Televised Public Appearances by Justices\n\n       Justice Scalia appeared on the CBS news program ``60 \n     Minutes'' on April 27, 2008, for the entire program.\n\n[[Page S6691]]\n\n       Justice Thomas appeared on the CBS news program ``60 \n     Minutes'' on September 30, 2007.\n       Justice Thomas appeared in a series of interviews with ABC \n     News over four days between October 1 and 4, 2007.\n       Justices Breyer and Scalia have engaged in several \n     televised debates, including a debate on December 5, 2006, \n     sponsored by the American Constitution Society.\n       Justices O'Connor and Stephen Breyer appeared on ABC News's \n     ``This Week'' on July 6, 2003.\n       All of the Justices have sat for television interviews \n     conducted by C-SPAN: J. Alito: Sept. 2, 2009; J. Breyer: June \n     17, 2009; J. Ginsburg: July 1, 2009; J. Kennedy: June 25, \n     2009; C.J. Roberts: June 19, 2009; J. Stevens: June 24, 2009; \n     J. Scalia: June 19, 2009; J. Sotomayor: Sept. 16, 2009; J. \n     Thomas: July 29, 2009.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there has been an objection by the Court \non grounds that it would interfere with the collegial dynamics of the \nCourt, that somebody might be reaching for a 30-second sound bite. \nWell, I think that, in the first place, is unlikely and wouldn't be \nvery well received and wouldn't be repeated. Even so, the objections \nwhich have been raised to televising the Court are minimal, de minimis, \ncontrasted with the advantages to televising the Court.\n  If the Court were televised, there would also be an understanding of \nthe limited docket of the Court, and the Court could undertake the \ndecision in more cases if the public understood how few cases they \nhear. In 1886, the Supreme Court decided 451 cases. In 1987, a little \nmore than two decades ago, the Court issued 146 opinions. In 2006, that \nnumber was down to 78; in 2007, 67; 2008, 75; 2009, 73. When Chief \nJustice Roberts testified, he said the Court could undertake more \ndecisions. He has been the Chief for 5 years and the number is at 73.\n  The Court, in its discretionary authority, leaves many circuit splits \nundecided. Most people don't have the foggiest notion of what a circuit \nsplit is, so for the few people who are watching on C-SPAN 2, a very \nbrief explanation. The country is divided up into circuits, different \ncourts of appeals. The Third Circuit, for example, has jurisdiction \nover my State, Pennsylvania, as well as New Jersey and Delaware. The \nSecond Circuit has jurisdiction over New York and, I believe, Vermont. \nFrequently, the Third Circuit will differ from the Second Circuit. A \nmatter arises in Philadelphia governed by different law than arises in \nNew York City. An issue arises in the Sixth Circuit in Detroit, there \nis no definitive resolution. People there don't know what the law is. \nThe Supreme Court could undertake those decisions. They have sufficient \ntime.\n  These are matters of very substantial importance. For example, the \ncircuit splits are left unresolved by the Court when a Federal agency \nmay withhold information in response to a request under the Freedom of \nInformation Act on the grounds that it would disclose the agency's \n``internal deliberations.'' The Court has left undecided when a civil \nlawsuit must be dismissed or may be dismissed as involving a state \nsecret. Left undecided circuit splits, should national community \nstandards or local community standards be applied to Internet obscenity \ncases; left undecided circuit splits, does a constitutional decision \nregarding the exclusionary rule apply retroactively to evidence \nobtained from illegal searches undertaken prior to that constitutional \ndecision.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a fuller list be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the authority which we are exercising in \nconfirming Solicitor General Elena Kagan is a very important \nconstitutional authority, and we take it very seriously. During my \ntenure on the 14 nominations which the President has made, we have \nfound a pattern which has become the accepted standard of answering \nabout as many questions as nominees believe they have to answer in \norder to be confirmed. If you can't get someone like Elena Kagan to \nanswer questions after her forceful statement from the University of \nChicago Law Review criticizing Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer for \nstonewalling and criticizing the Senate for not getting information, I \nthink that is the standard which is going to prevail. And where you \nhave nominees coming into the nominating process and testifying under \noath about important philosophical underpinnings, ideological \nunderpinnings of congressional authority on factfinding and stare \ndecisis, and then doing a 180-degree turn, we need to look for some \nresponse.\n  I do not believe requiring the Court to be televised is a denigration \nof their authority. I think that is within the authority of Congress, \nas I have delineated on so many administrative matters such as the size \nof the Court, the quorum, when they convene, and what cases they must \nhear.\n  I approach the Court with more than respect. I approach the Court \nwith reverence. I have had the privilege of arguing in that Court. I am \nthe first to acknowledge--there is no one faster on acknowledging--the \nimportance of the Court as the final arbiter under Marbury v. Madison \nand the importance of judicial independence.\n  I do not think this idea is on a level with what the Court had to say \nabout Congress in the Morrison case, declaring the act protecting women \nagainst violence as unconstitutional because of our method of \nreasoning. As I said earlier, another polite way of calling us stupid \nor saying we don't know what we are doing--no polite way really to say \nthat on method of reasoning. What wisdom accrues from walking across \nConstitution Avenue from the hearing room in the Judiciary Committee or \nwhat great wisdom lies across the green a few hundred yards to the east \nof this Chamber.\n  I do believe television would be a step in the right direction. Would \nit be a cure? No. But when we have someone such as circuit judge \nRichard Posner criticizing a named Chief Justice on reputation, I think \nthat would have an ameliorating effect.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       Interesting Circuit Splits\n\n       Can the Attorney General of the United States bypass the \n     notice and comment period requirement of the Administrative \n     Procedure Act in applying the Sex Offender Registration and \n     Notification Act retroactively?\n       Do federal district courts have ancillary jurisdiction over \n     expungement of criminal records?\n       May jurors consult the Bible during their deliberations in \n     a criminal case and, if so, under what circumstances?\n       Must a civil lawsuit predicated on a ``state secret'' be \n     dismissed?\n       May a federal court ``toll'' the statute of limitations in \n     a suit brought against the federal government under the \n     Federal Tort Claims Act if the plaintiff establishes that the \n     government withheld information on which his claim is based?\n       Is a defendant convicted of drug trafficking with a gun \n     subject to additional prison time under a penalty-enhancing \n     statute, or is his sentence limited to the period of time \n     provided for in the federal drug-trafficking law?\n       When may a federal agency withhold information in response \n     to a FOIA request or court subpoena on the ground that it \n     would disclose the agency's ``internal deliberations''?\n       Should national community standards or local community \n     standards be applied in internet obscenity cases?\n       Which party has the burden of proof at a competency \n     hearing?\n       Does state or federal law governs the inquiry into the \n     enforceability of a forum selection clause when a federal \n     court exercises diversity jurisdiction?\n       Does a constitutional decision regarding the exclusionary \n     rule apply retroactively to evidence obtained from illegal \n     searches undertaken prior to that constitutional decision?\n       Is pre-litigation notice and opportunity to cure necessary \n     in cases alleging unequal provision of athletic opportunities \n     in violation of Title IX?\n       Is a non-violent walkaway escape a violent felony for \n     purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act?\n       Does a defendant's robbery conviction count as a crime of \n     violence, thus classifying the defendant as a career offender \n     under the Sentencing Guidelines?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the nomination of \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n  The nomination of Ms. Kagan has stirred up an old debate in our \ncountry. There are some that say that our Constitution is outdated and \nthe intent of our Founders when drafting it no longer relevant.\n  However, I am of the belief that the U.S. Constitution is the very \nfoundation of our country and its words and the written intent of our \nFathers are the cornerstone of our freedoms, our liberty, and our \nprotection from radical actions and ideas.\n\n[[Page S6692]]\n\n  Alexander Hamilton addressed this very issue when he said that, ``Our \nfounders clearly revealed their central purpose was defending \nAmericans' rights and liberties against encroachment, particularly by \nan overbearing national government. The Supreme Court's major purpose \nis preventing such overstepping. That requires following the \nConstitution as the highest law of the land in fact as well as on \npaper, because as George Mason put it, `no free government, or the \nblessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people but by frequent . \n. . recurrence to fundamental principles.' If we are to be true to our \nheritage, the coming Supreme Court nomination debate must focus on \nthose principles.''\n  It is with these words from Alexander Hamilton that I have thoroughly \nconsidered Ms. Kagan's qualifications and fitness to serve as the next \nSupreme Court justice. And specifically, whether Ms. Kagan will uphold \nthe written word of the U.S. Constitution and the intent of our \nFounding Fathers or twist it to fit a favored political outcome.\n  I had the privilege of meeting with Solicitor General Kagan a few \nweeks ago and I, like most who met with her, was impressed by her \nintelligence and poise. There is no question that she has a vast \nknowledge of the law which stems from years of working as a Supreme \nCourt law clerk, an adviser to President Clinton, dean of Harvard Law \nSchool, and through her current position as Solicitor General.\n  When I had the opportunity to ask Ms. Kagan about her views on the \nFounders' intent of the second amendment, she informed me that although \nshe had read much analysis regarding the second amendment, she had \nnever studied its history or origin. Certainly, this statement was \nsurprising to me, especially given her documented history of hostility \ntoward the second amendment.\n  This hostility became apparent for the first time as a law clerk for \nJustice Thurgood Marshall when she said, ``I'm not sympathetic'' to an \nindividual's argument that the DC handgun ban violated his second \namendment rights.\n  I have been rather vocal on this issue and I have advocated strongly \nagainst the District of Columbia's denial of this fundamental right for \nlaw-abiding citizens.\n  The case that Ms. Kagan was ``unsympathetic'' toward involved Lee \nSandidge, an African-American business owner who was arrested and \nconvicted in DC for possessing ammunition and an unregistered pistol \nwithout a license. He faced up to 10 years in prison, but received a \nsuspended sentence of probation and $150 fine. Mr. Sandidge's second \namendment claim that Ms. Kagan cared little for challenged the same \nrestrictive DC gun control law that was struck down by the Supreme \nCourt in the 2007 Heller decision.\n  In this instance, I believe that Ms. Kagan allowed for her personal \nbeliefs and emotions to cloud the meaning of the U.S. Constitution, \nsince she apparently did not care to look to the Founders' intent or \ncite legal precedent.\n  Her lack of sympathy for gun owners and gun rights was again apparent \nduring her years at the Clinton White House where she coauthored two \npolicy memos in 1998 that advocated for White House events and policy \nannouncements on various gun proposals, including ``legislation \nrequiring background checks for all secondary market gun purchases,'' a \n``gun tracing initiative,'' and a call for a new gun design ``that can \nonly be shot by authorized adults.''\n  Ms. Kagan also played a role in an executive order that required all \nFederal law enforcement officers to install locks on their weapons.\n  When it comes to the second amendment, I believe that Ms. Kagan shows \na blatant disregard for the U.S. Constitution, and a feigned ignorance \nfor the intent of our founders when crafting this amendment--however, \nthis has not deterred her from providing advice to her superiors on an \nissue that she goes to great lengths to nullify.\n  Unlike Ms. Kagan, my colleagues and I, along with millions of \nAmericans have studied the intent of our founders in regards to the \nsecond amendment.\n  The Founders looked to the writings of prominent philosophers when \ndebating the importance of the right to keep and bear arms to protect \nthe people of this country from tyranny and from a governing class that \nhad a history of shown propensity for oppression. The second amendment \nwas drafted to address an issue of trust, protection, and most of all, \nto establish individual rights over the government.\n  James Madison wrote in Federalist paper 46 that the Constitution, \n``preserves the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over \npeople of almost every other nation . . . where the governments are \nafraid to trust people with arms.''\n  St. George Tucker, the first commentator on the Constitution, wrote \nin 1803, that the second amendment was ``the true palladium of \nliberty'' and that, ``the right to self-defence is the first law of \nnature: in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine \nthe right within the narrowest limits possible. Wherever standing \narmies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms \nis, under any colour or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not \nalready annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.''\n  Ms. Kagan has stated, when asked whether she personally believes that \nthere was a preexisting right to self-defense before the Constitution, \nshe said she ``didn't have a view of what are natural rights \nindependent of the Constitution.''\n  Ms. Kagan's shocking admission upholds my conclusion that she does \nnot believe the second amendment codifies with the beliefs of our \nFounders who fervently believed the right to keep and bear arms was a \nnatural right.\n  Ms. Kagan's failure to study the history surrounding the second \namendment is in stark contrast to her emphasis on the importance of \nstudents studying international law at Harvard Law School. As dean, she \nmandated the study of international law, but made the study of the \nconstitution optional. As an American, I find this thoroughly \ninsulting.\n  When asked ``What specific subjects or legal trends would you like \n[Harvard] to reflect?'' Kagan responded: ``First and foremost \ninternational law \n. . . we should be making clear to our students the great importance of \nknowledge about other legal systems throughout the world. For 21st \ncentury law schools, the future lies in international and comparative \nlaw, and this is what law schools today ought to be focusing on.''\n  Her decision to not educate American law students on the cornerstone \nof American freedom, the U.S. Constitution, allows Harvard law students \nto graduate without ever taking a course in constitutional law. This I \nfeel demonstrates her willingness to set aside the core principles of \nour democracy in favor of ``good ideas'' for an outcome favorable to \nher political beliefs.\n  In fact, Ms. Kagan need look no farther than the Declaration of \nIndependence to understand our founders intent in regards to our second \namendment when they wrote, ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, \nthat all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator \nwith certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and \nthe pursuit of happiness.''\n  I am of the belief that our Constitution is what helps to make this \ncountry the best in the world and it's what stands between the United \nStates of America and every other country on Earth.\n  Ms. Kagan's penchant for political activism was showcased in her \ntreatment of military recruiting during her tenure as dean of the \nHarvard Law School and her decision to ban military recruiters from \ncampus over objections to the don't ask, don't tell policy.\n  As dean of the Harvard Law School, Ms. Kagan barred the military from \nthe campus recruiting office, even as our troops risked their lives in \ntwo wars overseas that stemmed from the deadliest terror attack on \nAmerican soil, September 11, 2001. She did so in defiance of a Federal \nlaw, the Solomon Amendment, which requires that the military receive \n``access . . . at least equal'' to that of other employers. In fact, \nSolomon's explicit equal access clause passed this Chamber unanimously \nin 2004, 1 month before Ms. Kagan began blocking recruiters.\n  Despite a clear record on this issue, Ms. Kagan testified during her \nhearing that the military had ``full,'' ``excellent,'' and even \n``complete'' access during her tenure as dean. Documents\n\n[[Page S6693]]\n\nfrom the Pentagon, however, demonstrate that recruiters were \n``stonewalled,'' and that banning them from the recruitment office was \n``tantamount to chaining and locking the front door of the law \nschool.'' During this contentious period, she filed briefs, spoke at \nprotests, and sent campus-wide e-mails attacking the governmental \npolicy.\n  Given Ms. Kagan's fierce opposition to the don't ask don't tell law, \nin her hearing for Solicitor General, she was specifically asked \nwhether she would be able to set aside her personal political views and \ndefend that law. She testified that she would defend the law with \nvigor. However, a review of her record reveals something different.\n  As Solicitor General, she chose not to challenge a Ninth Circuit \nruling that significantly damaged and undermined don't ask don't tell. \nIt is my belief that by neglecting to do this, she failed in her duty \nas Solicitor General and violated the pledge that she made to the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I wish I could say that her history of activism ended here, but we \nneed only look back to her work as an advisor to the Clinton \nadministration to see a demonstrated proclivity to inject progressive \nviews and an activist agenda into all her work, a trait that I am \nafraid she is unlikely to abandon if confirmed.\n  Ms. Kagan's proclivity toward judicial activism is best highlighted \nin her inability to express a limit on the Federal Government's power.\n  At her hearing, she was unable to identify a single meaningful limit \non Federal Government power under the commerce clause. As the Federal \nGovernment continues to expand both in scope and size, we need Justices \nwho recognize and are willing to enforce the limitations the \nConstitution places on the Federal Government. Given that Ms. Kagan \napparently does not recognize those limitations, it is clear that she \nwould not enforce them.\n  As a Supreme Court Justice, Ms. Kagan is likely to rule in favor of \nthe government as opposed to enforcing the vital role that the Supreme \nCourt plays in keeping the overreaching arm of the government in check.\n  After thoroughly studying Ms. Kagan's record and after questioning \nher on my many concerns, I feel that I must remind Ms. Kagan on the \nintent of our Founding Fathers when establishing the United States as \nthe world's leading democracy and symbol of freedom throughout the \nworld:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, \n     liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n  If confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice, I fear that Elena Kagan will \nbe unable to set aside her personal beliefs and uphold even these most \nbasic tenets of the United States of America. I believe her reign as a \nSupreme Court Justice will lead to the interpretation of international \nlaw over the U.S. Constitution, will lead to a great assault on the \nsecond amendment, and will be marred by precedent of court cases rather \nthan intent of Framers of the constitution. As the highest Court in the \nland, the Supreme Court plays this vital role in keeping the \noverreaching arm of the Federal Government in check.\n\n  That said, anyone nominated to sit on the bench of this Court must be \nwilling to do the same--set aside personal politics and views and defer \nto the Constitution for the good of the country.\n  While I am impressed with her intellect and accomplishments, my \nmeeting with Ms. Kagan and a review of her record did little to dispel \nmy concerns as to whether she will adhere to the Framers' intent of the \nConstitution.\n  Ms. Kagan's lack of support for the U.S. military, demonstrated \nhostility toward the second amendment, and her propensity toward \npolitical activism signaled to me that her role on the Court will be \none of liberal judicial activism.\n  For these reasons, I will respectfully oppose her nomination to the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Who seeks recognition? The \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on July 2, following the conclusion of \nthe hearings on Elena Kagan's nomination to serve as an Associate \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court, I informed my colleagues and my \nconstituents in the State of Alaska that I could not support her \nnomination. I decided to express my views at the time in summary form, \nknowing I would get many questions about Ms. Kagan in the course of my \ntravels during the Independence Day recess, when I was up in the State.\n  Many of the Alaskans I encountered during that trip and in subsequent \nvisits around Alaska indicated their concerns about Ms. Kagan's \nqualifications to serve and indicated they shared those same concerns. \nThat said, Alaskans are certainly a diverse and an independent people \nwho are accustomed to speaking their minds. It is fair to say I have \nalso heard from those who strongly support Solicitor General Kagan's \nnomination. I respect both viewpoints. But I am required by our \nConstitution to make an up-or-down decision.\n  I regard a Senator's vote to confirm or not to confirm a Supreme \nCourt nominee as one of the most important responsibilities bestowed on \nthis body by the U.S. Constitution. I believe it is a Senator's \nresponsibility to evaluate each nominee on his or her merits, consider \nthe record with great reflection, and explain her conclusions to the \nbody and to her constituents.\n  I come to the floor to expand the thoughts I expressed earlier about \nthe Kagan nomination, as well as to offer some observations about the \ncomposition of the Court as we go forward.\n  As I observed in early July, there is no doubt--no doubt in my mind--\nthat Elena Kagan is a gifted teacher of the law. Watching the \nconfirmation hearings, I was impressed with her command of the Supreme \nCourt's precedents and her ability to explain those precedents in a \nlanguage nonlawyers can understand.\n  In the course of those hearings, Elena Kagan vowed to respect Supreme \nCourt precedent. But she offered little insight into the circumstances \nthat might lead her to overturn established precedent and even less \ninsight into how she would approach those cases when precedent was not \nclearly established.\n  Most troubling, Ms. Kagan's responses to the questions posed to her \nin the Judiciary Committee indicated gaps in her understanding of the \nConstitution. Indeed, the most glaring of these gaps involved the right \nto keep and bear arms, guaranteed to law-abiding Americans under the \nsecond amendment. This is a matter of great significance to my \nconstituents in Alaska. So I find myself compelled to discuss it at \nsome length.\n  There was a colloquy between our colleague, Senator Grassley, and \nSolicitor General Kagan that sticks very clearly in my mind. Senator \nGrassley began his question by observing that the Supreme Court in the \nHeller case concluded that the second amendment involved an individual \nright to possess firearms, not a collective right conditioned by \nparticipants in a militia.\n  Senator Grassley further noted that the Supreme Court ruled in \nMcDonald that the individual right recognized in Heller is applied to \nthe States through the doctrine of incorporation via the 14th \namendment.\n  Senator Grassley then went on to ask Ms. Kagan whether she personally \nbelieves that the second amendment includes an individual right to \npossess a firearm.\n  Elena Kagan did not answer the question. Her response was:\n\n       I have not had myself the occasion to delve into the \n     history that the courts dealt with in Heller.\n\n  Senator Grassley went back again. He asked straight on:\n\n       Do you believe the second amendment conveys an individual \n     right?\n\n  Once again, Ms. Kagan ducked the question. She said that she lacked \nthe wherewithal to grade Heller because the case is based so much on \nhistory she never had an occasion to look at. This is very similar to \nthe comments she expressed to my colleague from Nevada who spoke before \nme.\n  I find it difficult to accept that an individual who occupied the \nrole of dean of Harvard Law School and Solicitor General of the United \nStates would never have had occasion to look at the history underlying \nthe second amendment.\n  My constituents in Alaska have long understood this right to be \nfundamental, personal in nature, and binding on both the Federal \nGovernment and\n\n[[Page S6694]]\n\nthe States, just as the courts in Heller and McDonald have held. I view \nour second amendment rights in the same way. Yet Elena Kagan evidently \nhas not thought much about the question.\n  One has to wonder: Is this just a lack of preparation or does Ms. \nKagan think the second amendment right is insignificant? Again, one has \nto wonder.\n  Ms. Kagan had fair and sufficient warning that she would be \nquestioned vigorously about her views on the second amendment. Justice \nSotomayor had very intense questioning on the same subject just a year \nago.\n  I doubt Dean Kagan would accept an answer: Sorry, I am not prepared \nto answer the question, from one of her Harvard law students if posed \nthe same question Senator Grassley asked.\n  With all due respect for the nominee, I am not prepared to accept \nthis kind of answer from a prospective Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. To put it perhaps a bit more bluntly, I would have expected that \na constitutional law expert of Ms. Kagan's stature would have devoted \nsome serious intellectual attention to that question at some point in \nher career. Truthfully, I cannot be sure she does not hold strong \npersonal views about the second amendment--views that she is unwilling \nto express because they might pose an impediment to her confirmation. \nThis is, by no means, mere speculation.\n  While serving as a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall in 1987, \nMs. Kagan had an opportunity to comment on a petition for certiorari \nfiled by a District of Columbia resident who was charged with the \npossession of an unregistered firearm. The petitioner asked the Supreme \nCourt whether the DC gun control law violated his second amendment \nrights.\n  Ms. Kagan dismissed his argument. In a note devoid of any legal \nanalysis, she simply told Justice Marshall: ``I am not sympathetic.'' \nNot sympathetic suggests some knowledge of the second amendment. If Ms. \nKagan were uncertain whether she knew enough about the second \namendment to make such a recommendation to Justice Marshall, perhaps \nshe might have done more research.\n\n  One is also left to wonder whether Solicitor General Kagan was \nunsympathetic to the view that the second amendment applies to the \nStates when the Justice Department decided it would not file a brief in \nthe McDonald case. We may never know the answer to this question \nbecause the deliberations of the Solicitor General's Office are \nprivileged.\n  The conclusion I draw from all this is that Ms. Kagan is, at best, \nuninterested in the second amendment at this point in her career. At \nworst, she is unsympathetic to the millions of Americans who, similar \nto this Senator, believe the second amendment is one of the most \nimportant of our constitutional liberties. On this basis alone, I \ncannot support her lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the \nland.\n  But this is not the only basis on which I find I must vote against \nthe nominee. If confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court, Elena Kagan \nwill be one of the least experienced Supreme Court Justices in our \nNation's history. It is often observed that one need not have judging \nexperience to sit on the Supreme Court. But all the Supreme Court \nJustices who did not have judging experience had extensive courtroom \nlitigation experience, and Elena Kagan has neither. While it is true \nshe spent a brief period of time as a junior associate in a prestigious \nWashington law firm, she has spent most of her professional career as a \nlaw professor, a university administrator, and as a political appointee \nfocused on matters of public policy.\n  Ms. Kagan's extensive experience as a policy adviser, when compared \nwith her sparse experience as a litigator, should concern all of us.\n  During her confirmation hearings, Ms. Kagan was asked repeatedly \nwhether she could set aside her interest and experience in matters of \npublic policy and refrain from legislating from the bench. She said she \ncould. Time will tell whether the benefit of the doubt is justified. \nHowever, Ms. Kagan's answer to questions concerning her willingness to \ndefer to unelected bureaucrats on questions of environmental law is \nquite troubling to me. History demonstrates that agencies at times are \nquite activist in interpreting the gaps Congress intended them to fill \nthrough regulations. It is well known throughout this body that I do \nnot believe Congress ever intended for the EPA to set climate policy \nthrough Clean Air Act regulations.\n  On two occasions before the Judiciary Committee, Ms. Kagan expressed \nthe view that it is legitimate for courts to give great deference to \nFederal agencies as they interpret congressional mandates.\n  I understand it is settled precedent for Federal courts to defer to \nadministrative agencies in appropriate cases. However, I also think \nthis administration's activism demands a more skeptical look at agency \nrulemaking exercises. Ms. Kagan, on the other hand, enthusiastically \nendorsed the position that the decisions of unelected bureaucrats \ndeserve great deference because Federal agencies have expertise and are \naccountable to the elected Executive. I think this approach will \ncontinue to diminish the role of Congress in lawmaking and will result \nin less accountability to the electorate, not more, as Ms. Kagan \nsuggests.\n  I am also concerned about the deference that a Justice Kagan might \ngive to international law in interpreting the Constitution and the laws \nof the United States. Perhaps there is a limited role for the \nconsideration of international or foreign law when the issues posed in \nthe case unavoidably turn on the interpretation of a treaty or a \nforeign law. But unlike Ms. Kagan, I would not think that a Federal \njudge at any level should cite foreign and international law in their \ndecision simply because the judge is open to ``good ideas wherever they \nmay come from.''\n  When the Senate inquires as to whether a nominee is qualified for the \nCourt, it is asking a very specific question: Does the nominee \nunderstand and is she prepared to assume the role of an impartial judge \nin our constitutional system?\n  I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that Elena Kagan does not \nrise to this standard. During her confirmation hearings, Ms. Kagan \nexhibited charm and wit, even as she weaved her way through the serious \nquestions that were put before her. I would have preferred a bit less \ncleverness and a lot more serious reflection.\n  As I reflect back upon the record before me, as I think about the way \nMs. Kagan answered the second amendment questions posed to her, her \nlack of substantive legal experience, her comfort with the judgments of \nunelected bureaucrats, her acceptance of the use of international law \nas persuasive authority in U.S. court decisions, I am not comfortable \nwith this nominee.\n  I understand others of my colleagues may not share this view and that \nconventional wisdom holds that Elena Kagan will be confirmed to the \nSupreme Court. I would like to close with a few observations about the \ncomposition of the Court going forward.\n  Ms. Kagan, similar to this administration's last nominee, Justice \nSotomayor, is a native of New York City. Although she spent a portion \nof her career in Chicago, most of her career has been spent inside the \nbeltway of Washington, DC, and Cambridge, MA.\n  If Elena Kagan is confirmed, six of the nine Supreme Court Justices \nwill be from the Northeast United States, and only 3 law schools of the \n199 law schools accredited by the American Bar Association will be \nrepresented on the High Court.\n  Our colleague, Senator Feingold, took note of this during the \nconfirmation hearings. He made reference to a question he received from \none of his constituents in a townhall meeting. That constituent asked \nwhy nominees to the Supreme Court always seem to be from the east coast \nwhen we have plenty of fine candidates in the Midwest. Senator Feingold \nfollowed up by asking Ms. Kagan this question:\n\n       How will you strive to understand the effects of the \n     Supreme Court's decisions on the lives of millions of \n     Americans who don't live on the east coast or in our biggest \n     cities?\n\n  That same question is on my mind today, as it was last summer when I \nspoke on the nomination of Justice Sotomayor. I welcome the fact that \nthis administration has substantially increased the representation of \nwomen on the High Court. Yet it is of greater significance to me that \nthe administration has not increased the representation of people from \nthe West or from rural backgrounds on the Court. I\n\n[[Page S6695]]\n\nwould suggest that given the composition of the Supreme Court at this \npoint in our history, it is important for the Justices to venture \nbeyond the bench and the beltway. It is important that they get to know \nhow Americans with different backgrounds than theirs think about their \ncountry. And I might suggest that they come and visit us in Alaska.\n\n  If Elena Kagan is confirmed to the Supreme Court, as I understand she \nlikely will be, I wish her well in the discharge of her crucial duties. \nThe liberties we treasure dearly will depend on her wise and thoughtful \njudgments.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the pending \nnomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice \non the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The constitutional role of the Senate in the confirmation process of \nFederal judicial nominees is to provide for ``advice and consent,'' and \nit is up to each individual Senator to determine what he believes that \nphrase means. As I have had an opportunity to participate in this \nprocess on several occasions, I have discovered this is more of an art \nthan a science.\n  I believe there should be some level of deference granted to the \nPresident's nominees. Elections do matter, and the President has the \nconstitutional duty to put forward nominees whom he would like to serve \non the Federal judiciary. However, when the President nominates an \nindividual whose record, in the eyes of some Senators, proves to be \ndisqualifying, then it is incumbent upon those Senators to oppose that \nnominee.\n  Several weeks ago, Ms. Kagan was granted an opportunity to sit before \nthe Judiciary Committee and respond to her critics and clarify her \nseemingly controversial positions. Years before she herself would face \nthe requisite questioning of a confirmation hearing, Ms. Kagan \ncriticized the confirmation process as lacking ``seriousness and \nsubstance.'' This is a criticism based on the notion that recent court \nnominees believe the surest path to confirmation is by providing \nmilquetoast, evasive answers to any question involving a controversial \ntopic. In this instance, Ms. Kagan chose to emulate those whom she had \nonce criticized.\n  Through many hours of questioning regarding her past statements, \npositions, and actions, her answers proved evasive and unhelpful, and \nwith many portions of her record having not been adequately addressed, \nI am left with far too many doubts to simply presume the President's \nnominee should be confirmed.\n  There is little doubt Ms. Kagan is intelligent and accomplished. She \nhas excelled in both professional and academic pursuits. However, it is \nimportant to consider that many of her accomplishments have taken place \nin overtly political arenas and have involved extremely controversial \nissues. Many of the controversial positions she advocated in the past \nwill almost certainly be litigated before the Supreme Court. It is, \ntherefore, incumbent upon her to show us she will leave her role as an \nactivist and advocate behind when assuming a position on the bench. \nAgain, this is an area where her responses before the Judiciary \nCommittee were found lacking.\n  I believe any judge who sits on the Nation's highest Court must \nunderstand that the correct venue for making policy is here in the \nlegislative branch. After a thorough review of her record, I am simply \nnot convinced Ms. Kagan will exercise that requisite restraint. While \nthere are numerous issues I find troublesome in her record, there are a \nfew I would like to focus on today.\n  I am especially concerned about her discriminatory actions against \nmilitary recruiters--in clear violation of Federal law and which was \nruled against unanimously by the Supreme Court--while she was the dean \nof Harvard Law School. This was an act of defiance designed to protest \nthe military's don't ask, don't tell policy. It has been argued that \nthis was simply a misunderstanding or that Ms. Kagan made a good-faith \nattempt to apply the law as she saw fit. I believe her actions show a \ndangerous hostility toward the military and a troubling disregard for \nduly-enacted statutes with which she disagrees.\n  Another issue where I remain concerned is on the topic of abortion. \nWhile not having a litmus test here and while I never anticipated this \nPresident would nominate someone who shares my pro-life views, I could \nnot imagine him nominating someone with the extreme views Ms. Kagan's \nrecord indicates. This is not just a pro-life versus pro-choice dilemma \nfor me. There is substantial evidence from her time clerking for \nJustice Thurgood Marshall and from her time in the Clinton White House \nthat demonstrates an alarming agenda she has on the issue of abortion.\n  While clerking for the Supreme Court, Ms. Kagan was tasked with \nreviewing a lower court ruling that had found that prison inmates have \na constitutional right to taxpayer-funded abortions. While she \nconcluded that the lower court ruling had gone ``too far,'' she also \ndescribed the decision as ``well-intentioned.'' While there may be \nsubstantial political disagreement on the topic of abortion, it is hard \nfor me to reason that any effort to further the idea of taxpayer-funded \nabortions, particularly for prisoners, is ``well-intentioned.''\n  Further, when she served as senior advisor to then-President Bill \nClinton, she was a key player in the White House efforts to keep \npartial-birth abortion--an abhorrent practice that was finally banned \nin 2003--from being outlawed by the Congress. Documents seem to show \nextensive efforts to prevent any restrictions being placed upon the \nprocedure. In fact, it appears Ms. Kagan actually went so far as to \nparticipate in the redrafting of a report from a medical group--the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists--on the practice \nthat served to dilute the findings of the report and bolster her \nposition of not restricting the procedure. These efforts appear to show \na position on life-related issues that is well outside the view of \nmainstream Americans and mainstream legal thought.\n  Such views are not limited to the topic of abortion. She has \ndemonstrated hostility toward the second amendment and gun rights \nduring her past tenures in the judicial and executive branches.\n  Again while serving as a Supreme Court clerk, she was tasked with \nwriting a memo on the case of a man who had petitioned the Court, \nclaiming the District of Columbia's handgun ban was unconstitutional \nbecause it deprived him of his second amendment right. Striking an \ninterestingly personal note, Ms. Kagan wrote: ``I am not sympathetic.'' \nIt is common knowledge that a similar challenge to the District's \nhandgun ban was successfully considered by the Supreme Court in 2008. \nWhat we do not know is why Ms. Kagan did not believe a similar \nchallenge brought in 1987 was worthy of consideration before the Court.\n  Documents made available from the Clinton Library show she was a key \nplayer in that administration's gun control efforts. She was a key \nadvocate for multiple gun control proposals and even authored multiple \nExecutive orders that placed restrictions on gun owner rights.\n  Ms. Kagan is a unique nominee for the Supreme Court, as she has no \njudicial experience. The last time we confirmed a Justice to sit on the \nCourt without earlier having served as a judge was nearly 40 years ago.\n  While a lack of judicial experience should not be disqualifying for a \nSupreme Court nominee, it does increase the necessity for that nominee \nto be forthcoming and open during their confirmation hearings. With no \nprior judicial record to view, Senators are left with little guidance \nas to how a nominee will act once they become a Supreme Court Justice. \nThis is where we would hope the nominee could fill in the gaps. \nInstead, in Ms. Kagan's case, we are left to look to the past and at \nher records, and we are forced to make an overwhelmingly important \ndecision with significant questions unanswered.\n  I remain concerned that Ms. Kagan will carry the political agenda \nthat is evident in her past to the Supreme Court. Many of her views are \nclearly outside those of mainstream America, and therefore I will vote \nagainst her nomination to the Supreme Court.\n  I will close by saying that all of us, as Members of this body, \nreceive input\n\n[[Page S6696]]\n\nfrom our constituents, and anytime there is a significant or \ncontroversial issue before the Senate, the volume of those statements \nfrom our constituents increases. In the case of Ms. Kagan, it has been \nextremely unusual and extremely interesting. I have had one phone call \nand four e-mails from Georgians in support of Ms. Kagan. I have had \nthousands of phone calls and e-mails in opposition to her nomination. \nThat is very unusual, and it is an indication of why the polls \nnationwide are showing that her approval for a Supreme Court nominee is \nso low.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Solicitor \nGeneral Elena Kagan's nomination to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n  As Members of this body are well aware, there is no other matter \nconsidered by the Senate which has such a profound impact on the \nconstitutional landscape of our country than a lifetime appointment to \nthe Supreme Court of the United States. When reviewing any nomination, \nI believe the Senate should be thorough, fair, and extensively cover a \nnominee's background, record, and ability to apply the Constitution and \nother laws as written.\n  To quote then-Senator Obama:\n\n       There are some that believe that the President, having won \n     the election, should have complete authority to appoint his \n     nominee and the Senate should only examine whether the \n     Justice is intellectually capable and an all-round good guy; \n     that once you get beyond intellect and personal character, \n     there should be no further question as to whether the judge \n     should be confirmed.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       I disagree with this view. I believe firmly that the \n     Constitution calls for the Senate to advise and consent. I \n     believe it calls for meaningful advice and consent, and that \n     includes an examination of a judge's philosophy, ideology, \n     and record.\n\n  I also believe the Senate's constitutional duty of advice and consent \nplays one of the most important rules in protecting the Constitution \nand an individual's constitutional rights. While nominees should not be \nrejected based on their personal or political ideology, the Senate must \ndetermine whether they are prepared to put those things aside when they \nassume the bench. Our country deserves a Supreme Court nominee who will \njudge cases on the constitutional bedrock rule of law, not on their own \npersonal feelings or a desire to legislate from the bench.\n  After reviewing Ms. Kagan's record, her testimony at the confirmation \nhearings, and having met with her personally, I am unable to support \nher confirmation.\n  As many in this body have already noted, Ms. Kagan has no judicial \nexperience and virtually no experience with the practice of law. Before \nbeing nominated by President Obama to be Associate Justice on the U.S. \nSupreme Court, Ms. Kagan had never tried a case to verdict or argued an \nappellate case. While judicial experience is not a prerequisite for \nserving on the Supreme Court, a record on the bench can provide \nimportant evidence that an individual understands that the role of a \njudge is to impartially apply the law.\n  Justices who have not previously served as a judge typically have \ndeep experience in the courtroom as practical lawyers. That type of \nexperience can also inform how an individual might approach serving on \nthe bench. Ms. Kagan's resume and experience offer no such evidence. \nShe has spent almost her entire career either in partisan staff \npositions or in academia.\n  Throughout, she seems to have been a forceful advocate for liberal \npositions. This consistently liberal world view started early. She once \nwrote: ``Where I grew up--on Manhattan's Upper West Side--nobody ever \nadmitted to voting for Republicans.'' And when referring to the \npoliticians in her neighborhood, she wrote they were ``real Democrats, \nnot the closet Republicans that one sees so often these days, but men \nand women committed to liberal principles and motivated by the ideal of \nan affirmative and compassionate government.''\n  At Princeton, Ms. Kagan wrote a thesis lamenting the decline of the \nsocialist movement in America and later at Oxford, in another paper, \nsupported the activist Warren Court who ``time and time again . . . \nasserted its right to do no less than lead the nation.''\n  Her non-academic career is filled with purely partisan staff \npositions: the Michael Dukakis Presidential campaign, special counsel \nto Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats, and domestic policy aide to \nPresident Clinton.\n  Even both of her clerkships were for strongly liberal judges: Judge \nAbner Mikva of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and Justice Thurgood \nMarshall.\n  There is nothing wrong, of course, about having strong political \nviews. The question before the Senate is whether Ms. Kagan is the type \nof person who can set aside those views when she puts on the black robe \nof a judge.\n  Unfortunately, her record shows that when she has found an objective \nreading of the law, or even medical science, that conflicted with her \npolitical goals, Ms. Kagan would choose her political goals.\n  A good example of this was when she led efforts to keep the brutal \npractice of partial-birth abortion legal, while serving as an adviser \nto President Clinton.\n  While there are many different opinions on abortion policy, an \noverwhelming majority of Americans believe that the gruesome procedure \nis one that is not acceptable and in fact federal law bans this \npractice with the exception of saving the mother's life.\n  After President Clinton vetoed Congress's first attempt at a ban and \nCongress was again debating the procedure, Ms. Kagan urged the \nPresident to support an alternative she believed was unconstitutional.\n  Additionally, when she was confronted with a draft scientific \nstatement from a medical association that would undermine her preferred \npolicy, she decided to rewrite the statement so that it aligned more \nwith her preferred policy goals, as opposed to the association's \nmedical judgment.\n  At her hearing Ms. Kagan confirmed she had no medical training when \nshe rewrote their statement, but said she was merely helping the \nmedical association more accurately state its own medical views.\n  Unfortunately, medical experts disagree with her assertion.\n  Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has said that ``no published \nmedical data supported her amendment in 1997, and none supports it \ntoday.''\n  Further, he believes Ms. Kagan's rewriting of the opinion was in fact \n``unethical, and it is disgraceful, especially for one who would be \ntasked with being a measured and fair minded judge.''\n  Ms. Kagan has even been unable to separate her partisan political \nviewpoint from her time in academia, most notably her time as dean of \nthe Harvard Law School when dealing with military recruiters.\n  While dean, Ms. Kagan was confronted with the Federal law requiring \nschools receiving Federal funds to give equal access to military \nrecruiters.\n  Instead of requiring Harvard Law School to comply with the plain \nreading of the law, she continued to deny the military access to \nHarvard's on-campus recruiting program, while accepting Federal funds.\n  She even signed on to an amicus brief to the Supreme Court which \nargued that noncompliance was in fact compliance.\n  This argument was so flawed, and based purely on her personal \nopposition to the law enacted by President Clinton and a Democratic \nCongress, that the Supreme Court unanimously rejected it and said her \nconstruction was ``clearly not what Congress intended.''\n  As Solicitor General, when faced with the proposition of defending \nthe federally enacted don't ask, don't tell policy after the liberal \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision against the policy and \nrequired a costly trial, Ms. Kagan again chose to follow her personal \nbeliefs and allowed for the trial, which is unfavorable to the military \nand current law, to go forward.\n  At her confirmation hearings, when asked about this decision, she \nsaid she allowed the trial to go forward because it would allow for the \ndevelopment of a fuller record in support of the government's best \ninterest.\n  The problem is that the district court records clearly contradict \nthis position.\n  According to the plaintiff's lawyers in this case, Ms. Kagan herself \ntold them ``loud and clear'' that further discovery would be bad for \nthe government's interests.\n  It is clear to me that Ms. Kagan considers herself a ``real \nDemocrat'' committed to liberal principles and has, at\n\n[[Page S6697]]\n\nno time, shown an ability to separate her personal beliefs from the job \nat hand.\n  Again, practical judicial and courtroom experience is not necessary, \nbut what is critical is the ability to serve with impartiality.\n  Unfortunately, I have nothing but Ms. Kagan's word to indicate that \nshe will be able to do so, nothing to show that she can apply the law \nto the facts and not her ideology to the law.\n  At this time in our Nation's history, when the size of government has \nexploded and spending is out of control, we need more than her word.\n  We need concrete evidence that she will be more than a politically \nmotivated ideologue on our highest Court.\n  We need a Supreme Court Justice that is willing to apply the \nconstitutional principles of a limited government with limited powers.\n  We need a Supreme Court Justice that does not believe Congress has \nthe right to pass overreaching laws requiring Americans to eat three \nfruits and three vegetables a day, something she suggested at her \nhearing Congress has the power to do.\n  When pushed on the outer limits of federal power, Ms. Kagan said ``I \nwould go back, I think, to Oliver Wendell Holmes on this. He . . . \nhated a lot of the legislation that was being enacted during those \nyears, but insisted that, if the people wanted it, it was their right \nto go hang themselves.''\n  For our system of government to work as intended by the Framers, each \nbranch of government must do its job.\n  It is the job of the courts to apply the law, including the \nconstitutional limitations on Federal power.\n  When Ms. Kagan says that the people have ``the right to go hang \nthemselves,'' she is suggesting that the Supreme Court should not do \nits job, that it should let Congress claim whatever power it wants.\n  That is not what the Constitution says and it is not what is in our \nNation's ultimate interest.\n  Freedom and limited government must endure; they must not be cast \naside because a temporary electoral majority finds them inconvenient.\n  Our Founders intended for our Supreme Court Justices to be more than \na rubberstamp to a particular ideology, administration, or political \nparty.\n  I cannot trust that Ms. Kagan will be more than this, and \nconsequently am left with no other choice than to oppose her \nconfirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the nomination of \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice on the United \nStates Supreme Court, I want to thank Senators Leahy and Sessions for \ntheir work in the Judiciary Committee on this nomination. The hearings \nwere informative and respectful, and they produced a hearing record \nthat gives all Senators a better understanding of the nominee's \nbackground.\n  She graduated with academic honors from Princeton University and \nHarvard Law School. She clerked for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood \nMarshall, served as a White House policy advisor for the Clinton \nadministration, and as dean of Harvard Law School. Last year, on March \n19, she was confirmed by the Senate as U.S. Solicitor General.\n  She has not had much experience as a practicing lawyer, and she has \nhad no experience as a judge. Her lack of legal and judicial experience \nis not a disqualification, but it does make our job of evaluating this \nnominee a bit different. We should ask ourselves whether Elena Kagan \nwill perform the duties of a Supreme Court Justice with the requisite \nfairness, restraint, and respect for settled precedent under the laws \nand constitution of the United States.\n  After reviewing the record and her testimony, I believe serious \nquestions about her respect for precedent have not been answered. \nGeneral Kagan has a history of political advocacy, and she has not \nshown that she appreciates the critical distinction between political \nadvocacy and neutral judicial decisionmaking.\n  As an example, General Kagan's prior work suggests that she would not \nprotect an individual's constitutional right to bear arms. As a policy \nadvisor to President Clinton, Kagan promoted several gun control \nproposals, including background checks for all gun purchases in the \nsecondary market, a gun tracing initiative, and giving law enforcement \nthe ability to retain background check information from lawful gun \nsales. She also drafted executive orders to restrict the importation of \nsemiautomatic rifles and to require all Federal law enforcement \nofficers to install locks on their weapons.\n  More recently, as Solicitor General, Ms. Kagan refused to submit a \nbrief to the Supreme Court in support of the petitioner in the McDonald \nv. Chicago case. In June of this year, the Supreme Court ruled in favor \nof the McDonald petitioner, holding that the second amendment right to \nbear arms is binding on the States. Notably, McDonald was a 5-to-4 \ndecision. It is the second Supreme Court decision in recent years to \naffirm the right to bear arms by a narrow, 5-to-4 majority. When asked \nwhether she agrees with the four dissenting Justices in these two \ncases, General Kagan repeatedly declined to answer the question.\n  I am concerned that General Kagan is not committed to observing \nbinding precedent in the area of second amendment rights. If she is \nconfirmed to the Supreme Court, she could overturn the closely decided \nholdings of these recent cases.\n  General Kagan's record on military recruiting at Harvard Law School \nalso is troubling to me. As dean of Harvard Law School, she disallowed \nmilitary recruiting on campus during a time of war. Her actions were in \nviolation of Federal law that requires schools accepting Federal funds \nto allow military recruiters access to campus. As justification for her \nactions, she referred to the military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' \npolicy as a ``moral injustice of the first order,'' and she reaffirmed \nthose views during her confirmation hearings. When she openly defied \nFederal law, she emailed the Harvard Law community to say she ``hoped'' \nthe Federal Government ``would choose not to enforce'' the law. The \nSupreme Court later ruled unanimously that Harvard was, in fact, in \nviolation of Federal law.\n  What is even more troubling is that Kagan was not candid about this \nincident during her recent confirmation hearings. When asked about this \nissue, she claimed that Harvard Law School was ``never out of \ncompliance with the law.'' That is a quote from the record--``never out \nof compliance with the law.'' She also said that the military had \n``equally effective substitute'' methods for recruiting students from \nHarvard and had ``full and good access'' to students during this time.\n  Her assertions are belied by several contemporaneous documents from \nmilitary recruiters, showing that they encountered severe impediments \nto recruiting Harvard students. Internal Pentagon documents indicate \nthat under Dean Kagan, ``[t]he Army was stonewalled at Harvard.'' The \nchief of recruiting for the Air Force's Judge Advocate General Corps \nwrote that ``Harvard is playing games.'' That's in quotes: `` Harvard \nplaying games.'' And an Air Force recruiter wrote to Pentagon officials \nsaying that, ``[w]ithout the support of the Career Services Office [at \nHarvard], we are relegated to wandering the halls in hopes that someone \nwill stop and talk to us.''\n  I believe that the nominee's discriminatory treatment of military \nrecruiters was both contrary to law and a disservice to the military \nduring a time that America was at war. Her recent testimony that she \nacted within the law and that the military had equal access to students \nis less than candid and is directly contradicted by a unanimous Supreme \nCourt ruling.\n  It is the responsibility of the Senate to make certain that those who \nare confirmed to the Supreme Court are not only qualified by reason of \nexperience and training, but also are fully committed to upholding the \nrule of law. I cannot support Ms. Kagan's nomination to a lifetime \nappointment on the Supreme Court, based on the facts I have just \ndescribed.\n  Ms. Kagan has a history of openly defying established Federal law and \nof being hostile to certain individual rights guaranteed by our \nconstitution. Her recent hearing testimony did not show that she is \nprepared to relinquish the role of political advocate and to take \nseriously the oath to ``faithfully and impartially'' uphold the \nconstitution and laws of the United States.\n\n[[Page S6698]]\n\n  For these reasons, I cannot support her nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich.) The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of \nElena Kagan to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The \nresponsibilities of a Supreme Court Justice are weighty indeed. It is \nhis or her task to interpret the Constitution, to protect our cherished \nrights, and to enforce the laws passed by Congress.\n  Justices entrusted with lifetime appointments also must avoid the \ntemptation to usurp the legislative authority of the Congress or the \nexecutive authority of the President. As Chief Justice John Marshall \nfamously wrote in the 1803 decision, Marbury v. Madison, the Court must \n``say what the law is.'' That is, after all, the appropriate role of \nthe judiciary. For a judge to do more would undermine the \nconstitutional foundation of the separate branches of government.\n  Given this backdrop, disputes regarding the scope of the Senate's \npower of advice and consent are not uncommon, nor unexpected whenever a \nPresident puts forward a Supreme Court nominee for our consideration. \nMore than 215 years after the Senate rejected President George \nWashington's nomination of John Rutledge to serve on the Supreme Court, \nSenators continue to grapple with the criteria to use to evaluate \nSupreme Court nominees and the degree of deference to accord the \nPresident.\n  The Constitution, after all, pronounces no specific qualifications \nfor Supreme Court Justices. It does not require that a Justice possess \njudicial experience nor even be an attorney. The absence of such \nrequirements in the Constitution allows the Court to be comprised of \npeople from different backgrounds, but in carrying out our advice and \nconsent role, the Senate must ensure that judicial nominees have \nqualities befitting the post.\n  Senators must examine each nominee's competence and expertise in the \nlaw, judicial temperament, and integrity as demonstrated throughout his \nor her professional career. Determining a nominee's fitness to serve a \nlifetime appointment to the Nation's highest Court is one of the most \ncritical and consequential responsibilities any Senator faces.\n  In considering judicial nominees, I carefully weigh their \nqualifications, competence, professional integrity, judicial \ntemperament, and philosophy. I believe it is also critical for nominees \nto have a judicial philosophy that is devoid of prejudgment, \npartisanship, and preference. Only then will the decisions handed down \nfrom the bench be impartial and consistent with legal precedents and \nthe constitutional foundations of our democratic system.\n  I have applied these standards to Elena Kagan. Having analyzed her \nrecord, questioned her personally, and reviewed the Judiciary \nCommittee's hearings, I have concluded that Ms. Kagan should be \nconfirmed to our Nation's highest Court.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has unanimously rated Ms. Kagan as ``well qualified.'' Ms. \nKagan's remarkable legal and academic career demonstrates amply her \nintellectual capacity to serve on the Court. Her writings, testimony, \nand my discussions with her all demonstrate not only a sweeping \nknowledge of the law, but also a love for the law, a passion for \njudicial reasoning.\n  Ms. Kagan reflected the judicial temperament and philosophy I am \nseeking in nominees when she said during her testimony, ``I will listen \nhard to every party before the court and to each of my colleagues. . . \n.And I will do my best to consider every case impartially, modestly, \nwith commitment to principle and in accordance with law.''\n  In writing in support of Ms. Kagan, former court of appeals nominee \nMiguel Estrada said the following:\n\n       Elena possesses a formidable intellect, an exemplary \n     temperament and a rare ability to disagree with others \n     without being disagreeable. She is calm under fire and mature \n     and deliberate in her judgments. Elena would also bring to \n     the Court a wealth of experience at the highest levels of our \n     government and of academia. If such a person who has \n     demonstrated great intellect, high accomplishments and an \n     upright life, is not easily confirmable, I fear we will have \n     reached a point where no capable person will readily accept a \n     nomination for judicial service.\n\n  As many of my colleagues will recall, Mr. Estrada's own nomination to \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was the first \nappellate court nomination in history to be successfully derailed by a \nfilibuster, even though a majority of Senators, including myself, \nsupported his nomination. That was truly unfair.\n  With that experience as a guide, I take Mr. Estrada's endorsement of \nMs. Kagan to heart, and I agree that the Senate must put aside \npartisanship, must avoid political considerations, and must evaluate \nCourt nominees with great care and with great fairness. We must not do \nto Ms. Kagan what, unfortunately, many Members on the other side of the \naisle did to Mr. Estrada, despite his qualifications.\n  To be clear, in her previous posts, Ms. Kagan has taken positions \nwith which I disagree. It appears that her personal opinion on gun \nrights is at odds with my own. But, nevertheless, Ms. Kagan indicated \nin her testimony before the Judiciary Committee that she would follow \nthe precedent established in the Heller and the McDonald cases, \ndescribing those decisions as settled law. These cases clearly \nestablish that the right to bear arms is an individual right guaranteed \nby the Constitution.\n  I believe Ms. Kagan will respect the precedent established in these \ntwo important cases. Ms. Kagan's responses on several issues indicate \nthat she appears to understand and embrace judicial restraint and the \nlimits of when courts should and should not intercede in matters.\n  She rightly deferred on several issues as policy questions more \nappropriately resolved by Congress and the executive. Based on my \nreview of Ms. Kagan's record, my assessment of her character, and my \nbelief in her promise to adhere to precedent, Ms. Kagan warrants \nconfirmation to our Nation's highest Court. She possesses the \nintellect, experience, temperament, integrity, and philosophy to serve \nour country honorably as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here to speak in \nfavor of Elena Kagan's nomination to the Supreme Court. Over the course \nof our Nation's history there have been 111 Justices of the U.S. \nSupreme Court. Only three of those have been women. They are \noutstanding women: Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, and Sonia \nSotomayor. There have never been more than two women serving on the \nSupreme Court at the same time.\n  But this week, Elena Kagan is poised to rewrite that history and set \na new highwater mark for our country. My meeting with her is one that I \nwill always remember. I will also remember my meeting with Justice \nSotomayor.\n  We covered a lot of ground. Of course, it was generalized \nconversation because I cannot really ask how an individual will vote on \na certain case. I asked her about privacy rights. I asked her about \nindividual rights. I asked her how she felt about stare decisis.\n  I believe she was very strong in her view that there are precedents \nthat have been set, that she would not use any type of agenda other \nthan the Constitution of the United States to decide the cases that \nwill come before her. When she is confirmed, we will have three \nincredibly talented women serving on the Supreme Court at the same time \nfor the very first time in our country's history.\n\n  Why is that important? Of course, the most important thing is to have \nthe best legal minds. But it is also important to have the diversity \nthat reflects our Nation, and we know more than half our people are \nwomen, and the reach of the Court is enormous. It reaches to every \ncitizen. I think it is important we begin to see more women on the \nCourt who, of course, are as qualified as Elena Kagan.\n  She has broken barriers throughout her career. She was the first \nfemale dean of Harvard Law School. She is our Nation's first female \nSolicitor General. We are so fortunate to have a nominee who is as \nbright and respected and as committed to equality and justice for all \nAmericans as Elena Kagan. I congratulate the President for this \nnomination, and I thank at least five of my\n\n[[Page S6699]]\n\nRepublican colleagues who have already stated they are going to vote \nfor her. I hope there will be more.\n  Elena Kagan was born into a family with a deep and abiding commitment \nto public service. Her mother was a public schoolteacher. Her dad was a \ntenant's lawyer. She followed in both her parents' footsteps, serving \nboth as a teacher and a lawyer.\n  She brings a depth and richness of legal experience that will serve \nher well on the Supreme Court. She served as a law clerk for legendary \nJustice Thurgood Marshall. She has been an attorney in private \npractice. She has been a White House lawyer, a law school professor, a \ndean, and now she is the Nation's top lawyer. So when I hear a few of \nmy colleagues come to the floor and say she is not qualified for this \nposition, I wish to repeat her experiences: law clerk for legendary \nJustice Thurgood Marshall, an attorney in private practice, a White \nHouse lawyer, a law school professor, a dean of a law school, and the \nNation's top lawyer before the Supreme Court.\n  I think that resume speaks for itself. She has been in the real world \nin some of these jobs--practically all of them--and that is important. \nWe want to make sure we have Justices who understand what life is all \nabout.\n  As Solicitor General, the country's top lawyer before the Court, she \nhas filed hundreds of briefs and successfully argued a broad range of \ncases, including defending Congress's ability to protect our children \nfrom pedophiles and protecting our Nation's ability to prosecute those \nwho provide material support to terror groups. That is why she has the \nsupport of so many former Solicitors General, and that is why she \nreceived the highest rating from the American Bar Association: \nunanimously ``well qualified.''\n  She is widely respected for her exceptional intellect, her deep \nknowledge of constitutional and administrative law and she has a proven \nability to build consensus. How important is that in today's world \nwhere there is too much shouting and not enough conversation. Her \nqualities are qualities that are critical for the Court at this time.\n  Let's hear what Elena Kagan's peers and colleagues in the legal \nprofession say about her. There is a letter signed by eight former \nSolicitors General who served in both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations. This is what they wrote:\n\n       Elena Kagan would bring to the Supreme Court a breadth of \n     experience and a history of great accomplishment in the law.\n\n  Then, there is a joint letter from former Deputy Solicitors General \nand Assistants to the Solicitor General. They write about her:\n\n       [Her] intellectual ability, integrity and independence, \n     personal skills, and broad experience promise to make her an \n     outstanding Supreme Court Justice.\n\n  The National Association of Women Judges wrote:\n\n       General Kagan's rich and varied legal career--as a private \n     attorney, a White House lawyer, a professor, Dean and as the \n     country's top lawyer--provides her with a unique \n     constellation of experiences that will bring fresh ideas to \n     the Court.\n\n  Sixty-nine law school deans wrote a letter on her behalf, and they \nwrote:\n\n       She is an incisive and astute analyst of the law, with a \n     deep understanding of both doctrine and policy.\n\n  The National District Attorneys Association wrote that they believe \nthat ``Solicitor General Kagan's diverse and impressive life \nexperiences will be a welcome addition to the Court.''\n  So if you look at these letters, what you see is a broad swath of \nsupport for this nominee, from Republicans and Democrats and \nIndependents, from people who practice law to prosecutors. It is a very \nbroad range of support.\n  So I think this is an important day for all Americans who believe \nevery branch of our government--the Congress, the administration, and \nthe judiciary--should reflect the diversity of our great country.\n  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said in an interview last year:\n\n       About half of all law graduates today are women, and we \n     have a tremendous number of qualified women in the country \n     who are serving as lawyers. So they ought to be represented \n     on the Court.\n\n  I have had the extreme honor of speaking with the Honorable Sandra \nDay O'Connor, the former Justice of the Supreme Court, many times, and \nshe always made the point to me, over and over, about how crucial it \nwas in the Court to have a woman's voice. In a body of nine, it seems \nright that we move toward equal numbers, and we are doing that today. \nAgain, the most important thing is, you have to get the best on the \nCourt. Of course, that is No. 1. But as Sandra Day O'Connor has said \nclearly, since ``half of all law [school] graduates today are women, we \nhave a tremendous number of qualified women . . . [s]o they ought to be \nrepresented on the Court.'' I am sure she is--I do not want to speak \nfor her, but I am sure she is very pleased to see we are moving toward \nfull equality in this country.\n  Elena Kagan is a role model for so many women entering the legal \nprofession today. Her intellect, her broad range of legal experience, \nher sense of fairness, her profound respect for the law make her well \nqualified to serve as an Associate Justice of the Court.\n  I will be so honored to vote in favor of her nomination, and I hope \nwe will have more than five Republicans, and I hope the one Democrat \nwho said no might rethink it. We will see what happens. But I think, at \nthe end of the day, this country will be better served because we will \nhave a new Justice and her name will be Elena Kagan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the \nnomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to be Associate Justice of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. As Senators, we have few responsibilities that \nhave greater lasting impact on our country than providing advice and \nconsent on the confirmation of nominees to serve on the high Court. In \nmy 10 years in the House of Representatives, I witnessed the Senate \nconsider just two Supreme Court confirmations, and now after serving \nonly 19 months in the Senate, I have already had the distinct honor of \nconsidering two nominations. The historic importance of these \nappointments has not been lost on me, as we now consider confirming \nGeneral Kagan to become the third female Justice on the current court, \nand only the fourth woman ever to serve on a court that was exclusively \nmale for almost 200 years.\n  I take my advice and consent responsibilities seriously, and as I \nconsider each Supreme Court nominee, I focus on their judicial \ntemperament, experience, pragmatism and demonstrated ability to view \nthe law in ways that go beyond ideology. When I met with Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan 2 months ago, I was impressed with her thoughtfulness and \nher knowledge of constitutional law. After reviewing her testimony \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, studying her record and hearing from a \nwide range of Coloradans, I am convinced that General Kagan possesses \nthe qualities and attributes of a nominee who is eminently qualified \nand will be an effective member of the highest Court in our land. I am \nconfident that she is not a rigid ideologue and that her judicial \napproach will serve our country well.\n  I have not come to this decision lightly. I know that the judgments \nmade by the Supreme Court have a real impact on the lives of \nColoradans. From the right to equal pay to the freedom to keep and bear \narms to so many other issues, the Supreme Court makes decisions that \nprofoundly impact our rights and freedoms every year. I believe that \nGeneral Kagan will provide a voice on the Court that will ensure \nfairness and adherence to judicial restraint and the rule of law.\n  As I told General Kagan when I met with her, I am particularly \ninterested in ensuring that the Justices understand the weight and \nimpact of issues uniquely important in the West, including water \nrights, natural resources and Federal lands. And I am convinced that \nshe understands the complexity and unique importance of these issues to \nColorado.\n  While I am comfortable with General Kagan's sensitivity to Western \nissues, I would be remiss if I did not add that I hope that after this \nconfirmation process is complete, the White House will seriously \nconsider the importance of geographic and educational diversity on the \nSupreme Court. Many of my colleagues have talked in the past about how \na judge's personal background can help shape his or her understanding \nof the practical side of the issues that come before them. Similarly, I \nbelieve that the Court would be enhanced by the addition of Justices \nwho come from west of the Mississippi.\n\n[[Page S6700]]\n\n  But today we are considering the nominee that the President chose, \nand she is an excellent choice. This week, I plan to cast my vote to \nconfirm Solicitor General Kagan to be the next Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court, and I would encourage my colleagues to support her \nconfirmation as well.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I have often said that few decisions have \na more lasting effect on our democracy than that of approving an \nindividual's nomination to the Supreme Court. As you know, Supreme \nCourt Justices enjoy lifetime tenure and answer some of the toughest \nquestions facing our great Nation. For this reason, I take my \nconstitutional duty of advice and consent very seriously.\n  This will be the fourth time that I have provided advice and consent \nfor a Supreme Court nominee. My votes have reflected the belief that, \nwhile the Senate should not act as a rubber stamp for the President, it \nshould afford him due deference for his judicial nominees. Accordingly, \nI was proud to support the nomination of Chief Justice Roberts, Justice \nAlito, and Justice Sotomayor--all of whom have served our country with \ncandor and dignity. While these Justices differ in some aspects of \ntheir judicial philosophy, they are alike in several respects: each has \nan unwavering commitment to justice and the rule of law, a thorough \nunderstanding of American jurisprudence, and views that are within the \nbroad mainstream of contemporary legal thought. I am confident that Ms. \nKagan shares these characteristics, which are crucial for service on \nthe high Court.\n  Ms. Kagan's distinguished career is a testament to her hard work, \nintegrity, and intelligence. As her confirmation hearings made clear, \nMs. Kagan is extremely well-respected in the legal community; her \ncolleagues have spoken extensively of her keen legal sense and \nabilities as a consensus-builder. These are skills that will serve her \nwell should she be confirmed by this body. Additionally, Ms. Kagan has \nexhibited a devotion to precedent and an understanding that, if \nconfirmed, she will interpret, and not enact, the law. Importantly, Ms. \nKagan received the highest rating possible from the American Bar \nAssociation. It is clear that she has an accomplished resume.\n  Earlier this summer, I had the privilege of meeting with Ms. Kagan to \nlearn more about her judicial philosophy. I was impressed by her \nbrilliant legal mind and her commitment to justice and the rule of law. \nMs. Kagan assured me that she will strictly adhere to precedent and \nremain a neutral arbiter should she be confirmed to the Supreme Court. \nI reviewed her record and found nothing to deter me from that belief. I \nhad the opportunity to ask Ms. Kagan about her treatment of military \nrecruiters while dean of Harvard Law School. This issue is particularly \nimportant to me because my son Brooks is a military recruiter for the \nMassachusetts National Guard. Ms. Kagan assured me that military \nrecruiters had full access to Harvard law students for the entire \nduration of her deanship. I was very satisfied with Ms. Kagan's \nresponses to my questions, and believe her to have the utmost respect \nand gratitude for military service.\n  During our meeting, I asked Ms. Kagan about her understanding of \ntribal sovereignty. She told me that--while she has only a basic \nunderstanding of Native American legal issues--she would welcome the \nopportunity to visit Indian Country and learn more about tribal \ngovernment. Upon reviewing her record, I was happy to learn that Ms. \nKagan is an advisory board member of the American Indian Empowerment \nFund, an organization that seeks to empower Native American children \nand families. After speaking with Ms. Kagan, I am confident that she \nwill respect the right to tribal sovereignty. I look forward to her \neventual visit to Indian Country.\n  I believe that Elena Kagan would make a tremendous addition to the \nCourt. Her distinguished record and commitment to justice and the \nConstitution make her a well-qualified candidate. It is my hope that \nshe receives the bipartisan support that she deserves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                     Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come to the floor for the second week \nto continue to urge and compel my colleagues to pass the child \nnutrition reauthorization legislation before our child nutrition \nprograms expire on September 30.\n  I know we have much to do. We are coming to the end of our work \nperiod before we go home to our States during August. But we all know \nwhen we come back in September our time will also be limited, and doing \nsomething now is critically important.\n  The bipartisan Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act will put our country on \na path to significantly improving the health of the next generation of \nAmericans. Congress has the opportunity to make a historic investment--\nthe biggest investment in the history of our program--in our most \nprecious gift and the future of this country: our children--all our \nchildren.\n  We are circulating a consent request right now that will require no \nmore than 3 hours, at a maximum, of Senators' time to do this. Three \nhours is all we are asking of this body to be able to make a historic \neffort on behalf of our children.\n  Last week, I spoke multiple times on the floor about this bill. I \ntalked about the very real threat of hunger and obesity in this country \nand how our bill works to address both these critical issues.\n  I talked about the cost of action. This bill is completely paid for \nand will not add one cent to the deficit. In fact, in my opinion, we \nhave operated in this bill exactly how the American people want to see \nus operate. We have gone through the regular order of the committee. We \nhave worked in a bipartisan way. We have worked in a fiscally \nresponsible way to pay for this bill out of the actual areas in \nagriculture and in the Ag Committee where we could pay for this bill. \nIt is completely paid for, as I said before, so adding to the debt is \nnot an issue.\n  I also talked about the cost of inaction, about what it will mean to \nour States, to our schools, to our hard-working families, and to those \nfamilies who, unfortunately, due to no fault of their own, have been \ncaught in these economic crisis times, who are without work but whose \nchildren still go to school and still need to be fed.\n  Certainly, I have talked about the cost to the most important \ncategory; that is, our children--the fact that if we do not move on \nthis bill, it is yet 1 more year in a child's life that is not going to \nsee the evidence of good nutrition, its availability in schools through \nprograms that we both have and we expand, and those programs which we \ncan actually create more for in terms of afterschool meals instead of \nafterschool snacks. Another school year will start without nutritional \nstandards for meals served in schools, meaning we will miss yet another \nimportant cycle in a child's life to instill good eating habits.\n  I think about not just younger children but older children, as my \nkids are moving into high school and starting football practice. I \nthink about the ability to be able to see even those older children in \nafterschool programs, to be able to receive a full meal at the end of \nthat day instead of just a simple snack.\n  Schools will lose out on the first increase in the reimbursement rate \nto school feeding programs since 1973.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, think about where you were in 1973. I \nthink about where I was in 1973. I think about what 1973 dollars \npurchased and what 2010 costs are today. How far do those 1973 dollars \ngo when we go to the grocery store and pay 2010 prices? Think about \nwhat our school services are up against in using those 1973 dollars.\n  Our afterschool feeding programs will suffer, meaning Congress will \nfail to recognize that hunger does not end when the school bell rings \nand our children are done with their studies.\n  I simply do not think it is too much to ask. We can sacrifice 3 hours \nof our time for our children, for all our children in this great \ncountry, because they will be there as a workforce, as leaders, as \nteachers, as soldiers. They will be there for us as they grow up and \nbecome the next generation.\n  Yet we have an opportunity here, and if we let it pass us by, it will \nbe certainly no one's fault but our own. We continue to spend a lot of \ntime debating bills on the floor this week without seeing much in the \nway of actual results. This bill represents a real opportunity for us \nto actually get something\n\n[[Page S6701]]\n\ndone and to breathe some fresh, new, bipartisan air into this Chamber \nfor a change.\n  I think the American people are looking for us to do that. I think \nthey are thirsty for results. They want us to roll up our sleeves, make \nthe tough decisions, and get things done, which is what we were elected \nto do. They do not want to see us wasting precious time, putting each \nother's respective political parties in difficult positions. They want \nto see us spending our time wisely and seizing the opportunities where \nwe have come together in a bipartisan manner to solve real problems.\n  Hunger and childhood obesity are real problems in the lives of our \nchildren today, and it is unfortunate. These are diseases for which we \nhave a cure. It is simply that we must put that cure into place.\n  We are elected in this body to work together to pass legislation that \naddresses the very real issues our families all across this Nation face \ntogether in each and every one of our States. Although our rates for \nhunger or obesity may fluctuate and be different State to State, it is \nstill a very real problem in all of our States.\n\n  This legislation allows us to do that. It allows us to address the \nvery real issues that families are facing today and tomorrow and in the \nmonths ahead.\n  On Monday of this week, First Lady Michelle Obama wrote an op-ed that \nwas published in the Washington Post that reminded us about the \nhistoric opportunity we have in front of us--an opportunity to make our \nschools and our children healthier by passing this bill. I happen to \nhave a copy of the First Lady's op-ed with me right now, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the full text be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. One clear call to action in \nthe First Lady's article was her statement about how important it is \nfor Congress to pass this bill as soon as possible. She recognizes that \nwe are poised to do something truly historic, and I could not agree \nwith her more. I applaud her for her initiative and for her passion \nabout this issue, her willingness to elevate it every opportunity she \nhas, and to focus on, again, our greatest resource--our children.\n  We also saw yesterday in the New York Times an op-ed published by our \nown Senator Dick Lugar who has been working so diligently in his time \nhere in the Senate to bring a tremendous focus on hunger which exists \nin this country and globally. Very few people can match his dedication \nand his passion to this issue, and I am grateful for his comments. I \nask unanimous consent that his op-ed be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I know we have a lot on our plate this \nweek and certainly in the weeks to come, but I am determined to see \nthis bill come up for a vote. I think people in this body have a great \nopportunity--and they know it--to make a difference not just in their \nchildren's lives but in the lives of their neighbors' children, or \npeople whom they don't even know, but they do know that those parents \nlove and care for their children as much as each one of us loves and \ncares for our own children. They know those parents want every \nopportunity for other children across this globe, but certainly across \nthis Nation, to be able to reach their potential.\n  If you visit our schools, particularly in low-income areas, and you \nlook in the eyes of those children, you know that one of the barriers \nfor them in terms of reaching their potential unfortunately happens to \nbe that they are hungry, that they are living in food insecurity, that \nthey are struggling with obesity because of unfortunate cultural or \npoor eating habits. If there is anything we can solve that is a barrier \nto our children reaching their potential, it is something such as this \nwhich we know we have the cure for, we know we have the solutions for, \nand we have an opportunity this week to begin that process and make it \nhappen through legislation we can pass here in the Senate. We can do it \nand we should.\n  I am going to continue to come to the floor or to my colleagues to \nbring up this issue and to talk about it. It is a bill that I think can \nmake a difference. I am going to continue to talk about the real \nchildren and the real families out there across this Nation who would \nbenefit from this legislation and who are depending on us to do the \nright thing. I am going to continue to hassle and press my colleagues, \nas I have been known to do, so we can get this very important bill done \nin a timely way.\n  I say to my colleagues, to this Nation, and to the opportunity that \nexists before us: Let's do it. In the words of the First Lady: Let's \nmove. Let's get it going. Let's get it done. Let's not let this \nhistoric opportunity to change the lives of our children in this \nNation--all of our children and, therefore, our future--let us not \nallow it to pass us by.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 2, 2010]\n\n                          A Food Bill We Need\n\n                          (By Michelle Obama)\n\n       Last spring, a class of fifth-grade students from Bancroft \n     Elementary School in the District descended on the South Lawn \n     of the White House to help us dig, mulch, water and plant our \n     very first kitchen garden. In the months that followed, those \n     same students came back to check on the garden's progress and \n     taste the fruits (and vegetables) of their labor. Together, \n     they helped us spark a national conversation about the role \n     that food plays in helping us all live healthy lives.\n       For years our nation has been struggling with an epidemic \n     of childhood obesity. We've all heard the statistics: how one \n     in three children in this country are either overweight or \n     obese, with even higher rates among African Americans, \n     Hispanics and Native Americans. We know that one in three \n     kids will suffer from diabetes at some point in their lives. \n     We've seen the cost to our economy--how we're spending almost \n     $150 billion every year to treat obesity-related conditions. \n     And we know that if we don't act now, those costs will just \n     keep rising.\n       None of us wants that future for our children or our \n     country. That's the idea behind ``Let's Move!''--a nationwide \n     campaign started this year with a single and very ambitious \n     goal: solving the problem of childhood obesity in a \n     generation, so kids born today can reach adulthood at a \n     healthy weight.\n       ``Let's Move!'' is helping parents get the tools they need \n     to keep their families healthy and fit. It's helping grocery \n     stores serve communities that don't have access to fresh \n     foods. And it's finding new ways to help America's children \n     stay physically active.\n       But even if we all work to help our kids lead healthy lives \n     at home, they also need to stay healthy and active at school. \n     The last thing parents need or want is to see the progress \n     they're making at home lost during the school day.\n       Right now, our country has a major opportunity to make our \n     schools and our children healthier. It's an opportunity we \n     haven't seen in years, and one that is too important to let \n     pass by.\n       The Child Nutrition Bill working its way through Congress \n     has support from both Democrats and Republicans. This \n     groundbreaking legislation will bring fundamental change to \n     schools and improve the food options available to our \n     children.\n       To start, the bill will make it easier for the tens of \n     millions of children who participate in the National School \n     Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program--and many \n     others who are eligible but not enrolled--to get the \n     nutritious meals they need to do their best. It will set \n     higher nutritional standards for school meals by requiring \n     more fruits, vegetables and whole grains while reducing fat \n     and salt. It will offer rewards to schools that meet those \n     standards. And it will help eliminate junk food from vending \n     machines and a la carte lines--a major step that is supported \n     by parents, health-experts, and many in the food and beverage \n     industry.\n       Over the past year, I have met with community leaders and \n     stakeholders from across the country--parents and teachers, \n     school board members and principals, suppliers and food \n     service workers--about the importance of making sure every \n     child in America has access to nutritious meals at school. \n     They all want what's best for our children, and they all know \n     how critical it is that we keep making progress.\n       That's why it is so important that Congress pass this bill \n     as soon as possible. We owe it to the children who aren't \n     reaching their potential because they're not getting the \n     nutrition they need during the day. We owe it to the parents \n     who are working to keep their families healthy and looking \n     for a little support along the way. We owe it to the schools \n     that are trying to make progress but don't have the resources \n     they need. And we owe it to our country--because our \n     prosperity depends on the health and vitality of the next \n     generation.\n       Changes like these are just the beginning, and we've got a \n     long way to go to reach our goals. But if we work together \n     and each do our part, I'm confident that we can give our \n     children the opportunities they need to succeed--and the \n     energy, strength and endurance to seize those opportunities.\n\n[[Page S6702]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 3, 2010]\n\n                   The Senate's Important Lunch Date\n\n                         (By Richard G. Lugar)\n\n       With federal child nutrition programs due to expire Sept. \n     30, the Senate should approve reauthorization legislation \n     this week, before the monthlong Congressional recess.\n       The bill was unanimously approved by the Senate \n     Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee in March, and \n     it has no significant opposition. It has simply been a victim \n     of the crowded calendar of the Senate. But if we don't pass \n     the bill immediately, we will imperil programs that have \n     proved vital to our youth, families and schools for decades, \n     and that are especially important during this time of \n     economic stress.\n       Since the recession began in late 2007, the use of federal \n     free and reduced-price school lunches has increased by 13.7 \n     percent. Twenty-one million children--roughly two-thirds of \n     the students eating school lunches--benefit from the program.\n       For many of these children, school lunches represent the \n     bulk of the nutrition they receive during the day, and it is \n     imperative that there are no gaps in providing these meals. \n     The bill would also cut out a lot of red tape in the filing \n     process, ensuring that more families and schools can \n     participate. And it would increase the scope of the \n     afterschool meal program that currently operates in only 13 \n     states.\n       Research shows that food insecurity and hunger rise during \n     the summer, when children don't have regular access to school \n     meals. The bill would continue to enlarge programs, operated \n     through organizations like local recreation departments, that \n     help feed young people when schools aren't in session.\n       Year-round child nutrition programs, on top of improving \n     children's health and teaching them to eat better, are \n     critical to academic success. The school breakfast program \n     has been directly linked to gains in math and reading scores, \n     attendance and behavior, and speed and memory on cognitive \n     tests.\n       By passing the legislation, we would expand access to the \n     supplemental nutrition program that makes certain that low-\n     income women, infants and children are provided healthy \n     foods, information on eating well and referrals to health \n     care. The supplemental program already helps almost half of \n     all infants and about one-quarter of all children ages 1 to 4 \n     in the United States; this legislation would provide millions \n     of dollars worth of further support.\n       The new bill would also make great strides in reducing junk \n     food in schools and improving the nutritional quality of \n     meals. Nearly one-third of our children are either overweight \n     or obese, which is telling evidence of greater social \n     problems. Indeed, it's become a national security issue--27 \n     percent of 17-to 24-year-olds weigh too much to enlist in the \n     military, according to a recent study by a group of retired \n     generals and admirals. This cannot continue.\n       I have been through many battles on child nutrition, from \n     my days on the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners to \n     my time as the chairman of the Agriculture Committee. We have \n     debated local and state control, nutritional mandates, the \n     scope of the lunch programs and the unhealthy food choices in \n     school vending machines.\n       This bill, though, is as close to a moment of consensus as \n     can be achieved. There is bipartisan agreement, thanks to the \n     efforts of the Agriculture Committee's Democratic chairwoman, \n     Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, and its ranking Republican \n     member, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia. Our only hurdle is the \n     Senate schedule, which we would do well to surmount this \n     week.\n       Given our economic climate and tradition of bipartisan \n     support for child nutrition, we should pass this meritorious \n     bill now. It would be a success that both parties can claim.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and note \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nnomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Upon President Obama's nomination of Ms. Kagan, I stated that I would \nbase my decision on what I could ascertain about her judicial \nphilosophy from other components of her record, in light of her lack of \njudicial experience. What little information she offered during her \nconfirmation hearings did not accrue to her credit, in my judgment.\n  I am unconvinced that the hostility Ms. Kagan demonstrated toward the \nsecond amendment as clerk to Justice Marshall, counsel for the Clinton \nsdministration, and as Solicitor General under President Obama has \nchanged or would not drive her legal opinions on the matter.\n  Ms. Kagan has spent her career implementing antigun initiatives and \nevidence of her antagonistic attitude towards the second amendment can \nbe found from the beginning of her legal career.\n  As a U.S. Supreme Court law clerk in 1987, Ms. Kagan stated she was \n``not sympathetic'' toward a man who contended that his constitutional \nrights were violated when he was convicted for carrying an unlicensed \ngun. Think about that.\n  In a memorandum to Justice Marshall regarding Sandidge v. United \nStates, Ms. Kagan wrote that Mr. Sandidge's ``sole contention is that \nthe District of Columbia's firearm statutes violate his constitutional \nrights to keep and bear arms.' I'm not sympathetic.'' She recommended \nthat the Supreme Court not even hear the case, thereby allowing Mr. \nSandidge's conviction to stand.\n  When Ms. Kagan served as a political adviser to President Clinton, \nshe played a key role in the gun control efforts that were a trademark \nof the Clinton administration. Ms. Kagan took a lead role in a series \nof efforts to respond to the Supreme Court's 1997 ruling in Printz v. \nUnited States, which struck down parts of the 1993 Brady handgun law.\n  Ms. Kagan drafted proposals that would have effectively prohibited \nthe sale of guns without action by a ``chief law enforcement officer.'' \nShe authored a draft executive order requiring ``all federal law \nenforcement officers to install locks on their weapons'' and one to \nrestrict the importation of certain semiautomatic rifles. Ms. Kagan \ndrafted two memorandums in 1998 that advocated for policy announcements \non various gun control proposals, including ``legislation requiring \nbackground checks for all secondary market gun purchases,'' and a ``gun \ntracing initiative.''\n  As Solicitor General for President Obama, Ms. Kagan failed to find a \nFederal interest in the McDonald v. Chicago case and did not even file \na brief in the case.\n  Assaults on the second amendment will not end with the McDonald v. \nChicago ruling. Therefore, the overarching question remains will Ms. \nKagan's attitude as a Supreme Court Justice radically change from her \nclear and extensive anti-second amendment record?\n  I firmly believe the right to bear arms is a fundamental right. This \nhas been enunciated through the courts. I do not believe Ms. Kagan's \npolitical record and prejudiced background in opposition to the second \namendment shows that she is prepared to uphold this core constitutional \nguarantee as a Supreme Court Justice.\n  In fact, Ms. Kagan's record has demonstrated a disregard for those \nlaws and constitutional rights she disagrees with. This is also clearly \nevidenced in her affront to our men and women in the military. I will \nexplain.\n  As a vocal critic of the military's don't ask, don't tell policy, Ms. \nKagan barred military recruiters from Harvard's campus during her time \nas dean of Harvard Law School. She made her personal feelings \nunmistakable by repeatedly stating that she abhorred the military's \ndon't ask, don't tell policy, calling it a ``moral injustice of the \nfirst order.''\n  By barring recruiters, Ms. Kagan's actions violated the Solomon \nAmendment, which requires that the military receive equal access to \nthat of other employers on campus or jeopardize their Federal funding. \nMs. Kagan joined a brief before the Supreme Court arguing that Harvard \nshould be able to keep military recruiters off campus but still receive \nFederal funds--although that was in violation of the law.\n  She refused to permit ordinary campus access to military recruiters \nduring a time of war, yet still wanted to cash in on Federal funding.\n  This position was unanimously rejected in 2006, with the Supreme \nCourt stating that this was clearly not what Congress intended.\n  I find it ironic that we are asked to replace the only Justice with \nwartime experience with a nominee who willingly obstructed our military \nduring a time of war.\n  It is unacceptable to limit the ability of our Armed Forces to \nrecruit on campus at a time when the United States is fighting two \nwars.\n\n[[Page S6703]]\n\n  I have serious concerns about her actions against the military and \nher willingness to prevent access to potential recruits during a time \nof war.\n  This incident illustrated her liberal agenda superseding her \nprofessional judgment.\n  I have highlighted only two issues of many that exemplify Ms. Kagan's \nwell-defined political record. Put simply, she is a political activist, \nnot a jurist.\n  Throughout her confirmation hearings, she failed to explain where her \npolitical philosophy ends and her judicial philosophy begins.\n  Mr. President, we need a legal mind on the Supreme Court, not a \npolitical one.\n  We need an impartial arbiter, not a partisan political operative.\n  Therefore, I firmly oppose Ms. Kagan's nomination to be an Associate \nJustice on the Supreme Court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                  Lima Company Battalion, 25th Marines\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise today to honor some 30 \nmembers of the Armed Forces who were killed in action serving our \ncountry. Five years ago this week, 19 marines from the 3rd Battalion, \n25th Marine Regiment lost their lives while serving in Iraq. It was one \nof the most catastrophic IED attacks on our forces up until that time \nin the war. Eleven of those marines were from the Lima Company, an \nInfantry Reserve company with marines from Cincinnati, Chillicothe, \nTallmage, Willoughby, Delaware, and Grove City, OH.\n  Headquartered in Brook Part, OH, the 3rd Battalion, 25th Marine \nRegiment, known as the 3/25, deployed to Iraq on February 28, 2005. \nUpon arriving in Iraq, they were indispensable. They trained Iraqi \nsecurity forces. They conducted critical stability and security \noperations in and around the cities of Iraq's Al Anbar Province.\n  From May to August of that year, 5 years ago, they tracked down \ninsurgents, disrupted enemy transportation routes, and seized weapons \ncaches.\n  They participated in Operation Matador to eliminate an insurgent \nsanctuary north of the Euphrates River. In doing so, they disrupted a \nmajor insurgent smuggling route and gained valuable intelligence.\n  During Operation New Market, the Lima Company of 3/25 swept a hostile \narea near Haditha, Iraq.\n  In June of 2005, during Operation Spear, they helped clear the city \nof Karabila and recovered Iraqi hostages and destroyed several weapons \ncaches.\n  From August 1 to 3, 2005, the Lima Company participated in the Battle \nof Haditha, a code-named Operation Quick Strike. This operation was \nlaunched after a marine unit of the 3/25 was attacked and killed by a \nlarge group of insurgents on August 1, 2005.\n  On August 3, 2005, the 3/25 were en route to the initial attack when \ntheir amphibious assault vehicle hit a pair of double-stacked antitank \nmines. The vehicle was completely destroyed in the explosion, and 15 of \nthe 16 marines inside the vehicle died. All of the marines killed were \nassigned to the 3/25; 11 belonged to the Lima Company. At the time, the \nLima Company was one of the hardest hit marine units in the war. In the \nspan of 72 hours--from August 1 to August 3, 2005--19 marines with the \n3/25 were killed by insurgents or insurgent-made IEDs.\n  Yet in the wake of losing their fellow marines, the Lima Company \ncontinued to carry out their mission to disrupt the militant presence \nin the surrounding areas.\n  Returning from Iraq, the Lima Company was welcomed by family members, \nfriends, and communities. Many families, however, tragically were \nunable to welcome home their son, husband, father, or loved one.\n  Over the course of their 7-month deployment, the marines of the 3/25 \nparticipated in 15 regimental and battalion operations; 33 of them were \nkilled in action.\n  We should again honor these heroes. I have met the families of many \nof these men--they were all men--many of these marines who were killed \nin action. I spent time talking with many of them about their sons or \ntheir husbands or their fathers or their loved ones.\n  Five years after the Lima Company's single greatest loss, we remember \nthe marines who lost their lives early in those days of August 2005. I \nwish to share the names with my colleagues in the Senate:\n  Cpl Jeffrey A. Boskovitch, 25, of Seven Hills, OH;\n  Sgt David Coullard, 32, of Glastonbury, CT;\n  LCpl Daniel Deyarmin, Jr. 22, of Tallmadge, OH;\n  LCpl Brian Montgomery, 26, of Willoughby, OH;\n  Sgt Nathaniel Rock, 26, of Toronto, OH;\n  LCpl Christopher Jenkins Dyer, 19, of Cincinnati, OH;\n  LCpl William Brett Wightman, 22, of Sabina, OH;\n  LCpl Edward August ``Augie'' Schroeder II, 23, of Columbus, OH.

The memorial is currently on display \nat the Museum of the Marine Corps just outside Washington, DC, in \nQuantico, VA. These men are remembered and they are honored through a \nstanding granite memorial at Lima Company's headquarters at \nRickenbacker Air National Guard Base just outside of Columbus.\n  Most notably, these fallen men are immortalized in the hearts, minds, \nand lives of their families and fellow marines.\n  When I talk still with family members, they are so interested in our \ncontinuing to memorialize and remember in our hearts and our minds and \nin public displays, such as this when possible, the sacrifice of their \nrelatives.\n  Today we remember and we honor these courageous men. Their sacrifice \nhas not gone unnoticed by the people of a proud State and a grateful \nnation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Brown for his important \ncomments, and I join him in expressing my sympathy for their loss and \nmy appreciation of the courage and dedication of our men and women in \nuniform.\n  I rise to speak of my concerns over Ms. Elena Kagan's refusal as \nSolicitor General of the United States to defend Federal laws--laws \nwith which she clearly did not agree and with which her President, \nPresident Obama, did not agree. Her handling of this matter alone, in \nmy opinion, as one who spent 15 years in the Department of Justice, who \nloves the Department of Justice, who believes in the rule of law in \nAmerica, is a disqualifying act by her and should disqualify her from \nserving on the Supreme Court.\n  I laid out my concerns at her confirmation hearings and asked her to \nrespond. I gave her at the hearing almost 10 minutes to do so. It was \nthe only time I noticed she actually used notes. Her explanation was \nnot satisfactory.\n  It is well known by anyone who followed the process that Ms. Kagan \nhas personally opposed the don't ask, don't tell law--a law passed by a \nDemocratic Congress and signed into law by President Clinton. It was \nnot merely a military policy but a Federal law. She served 5 years in \nthe administration of President Clinton in the White House. I am not \naware that she ever protested to him about signing that law.\n  The law says, in effect, that openly homosexual persons may not serve \nin the U.S. military--don't ask, don't tell. Ms. Kagan was a fierce \ncritic of that law when she was dean of Harvard Law\n\n[[Page S6704]]\n\nSchool. She justified her decision while at Harvard to ban military \nrecruiters from the campus Career Services Office--in clear defiance of \nsubsequent Federal law, the Solomon Amendment--on the basis of her \nopposition to don't ask, don't tell. The Congress passed four separate \nSolomon Amendments to make sure people such as Dean Kagan were not \ntreating our military on campus as second-class citizens, which is how \nthey were being treated.\n  She argued while at Harvard that don't ask, don't tell was a ``moral \ninjustice of the first order.'' I accept that as her opinion. I do not \nagree with it, but I accept that as a legitimate opinion. But I do not \naccept her actions blocking military recruiting as legitimate.\n  Given her strong personal opposition to don't ask, don't tell, she \nwas specifically asked when she appeared before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on her nomination to be Solicitor General of the United \nStates--the position in the Department of Justice that defends Federal \nlaw before the Supreme Court of the United States, the greatest lawyer \njob in the world, some say--whether she would be able to fulfill her \nduty as Solicitor General by defending this very law she had opposed.\n  She promised the committee under oath that she could and that she \nwould defend the law. She said that her ``role as Solicitor General . . \n. would be to advance not my own views, but the interests of the United \nStates.'' That is absolutely correct. That is the duty of the Solicitor \nGeneral. It is a duty, not a matter of discussion. She stated she was \n``fully convinced'' that she could ``represent all of these interests \nwith vigor, even when they conflict with my own opinions.''\n  She said she would ``apply the usual strong presumption of \nconstitutionality'' to the don't ask, don't tell law as reinforced by \n``the doctrine of judicial deference to legislation involving military \nmatters.''\n  There was no doubt about what Ms. Kagan's duty was as Solicitor \nGeneral if, as was expected, she would be confronted with legal \nchallenges to the don't ask, don't tell law. She had a clear duty under \nthe law and in her duty as Solicitor General to defend this law of the \nUnited States. In addition, she had explicitly promised the Senate \nunder oath that she would defend this specific law, even though she \ndisagreed with it.\n  As it happened, Ms. Kagan was, indeed, faced with the opportunity to \ndefend the don't ask, don't tell law immediately after she took office. \nRight after she took office, there it was.\n  In the months leading up to her confirmation, two Federal courts of \nappeals had decided cases challenging don't ask, don't tell. In one \ndecision, the First Circuit--is in the Northeast of our country--upheld \nthe law. They said it was lawful and constitutional. In the other case, \ncalled Witt v. Department of Air Force, the Ninth Circuit, on the west \ncoast, considered to be the most liberal circuit in America, refused to \nuphold the law.\n  The Ninth Circuit's decision in the Witt case basically did two \nthings. I hope my colleagues will pay attention to this because it is \nimportant. Did the Solicitor General, who now wants to be on the \nSupreme Court, fulfill her duty or did she not?\n  The Ninth Circuit ordered the military to go back down to the \ndistrict court. This is the Court of Appeals, one step below the \nSupreme Court. They said: No, we want this case to go back to the \ndistrict court to be decided after a trial, during wartime, I might \nadd. The military would be required to justify the don't ask, don't \ntell law under a new legal standard that the court had invented out of \nwhole cloth.\n  The Ninth Circuit said the government would not be allowed to defend \nthe law as a rational, uniform policy that applies to all Armed Forces, \nas had been done in the First Circuit where the law was affirmed. The \nFirst Circuit affirmed it as a matter of law, without any big trial. \nWas this statute, this congressional action setting military policy, \nunconstitutional? The First Circuit said it was not. It was lawful. But \nthe Ninth Circuit said the military would have to prove that the \napplication of don't ask, don't tell ``specifically to [this individual \nplaintiff--Witt] significantly furthers the government's interest and \n[that] less intrusive means would [not] achieve substantially the \ngovernment's interest.'' That was a devastating standard. It was very \nproblematic.\n  After that unprecedented decision in mid-2008, the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office then in the Bush administration immediately recognized \nthe seriousness of the decision and authorized an appeal to the full \nNinth Circuit en banc and asked the full circuit to overrule this \nthree-judge panel decision.\n  The court did not agree to take the case and overrule the panel. But \nthere were strong objections from several judges of the Ninth Circuit \nwho thought their colleagues had clearly gotten the case wrong, as I \ntruly believe they had.\n  At that point, the government was faced with a decision: Should they \nappeal the Ninth Circuit decision directly to the Supreme Court? By \nthat time, the Obama administration had come into office and, Ms. \nKagan, who believed this law was immoral and an injustice of the first \norder, had been confirmed as Solicitor General. It fell to her to \ndecide whether to take the appeal to the Supreme Court. She refused.\n  Instead, she decided to let the Ninth Circuit decision stand and \nallow the case to go back down to the trial court for a prolonged \ntrial. In so doing, she failed in her fundamental responsibility as \nSolicitor General and to her sworn promise to the Senate to defend the \nstatutes of the United States regardless of her personal policy views.\n  I make that statement with care. I gave her 10 minutes, virtually \nuninterrupted, to explain why she made this decision, because it \ntroubled me, as someone who understands the importance of the duties of \nthe Solicitor General. If you do not fulfill your duties of Solicitor \nGeneral, should you then be promoted to the U.S. Supreme Court, I ask? \nThis was a very bad decision, in my view.\n  Her long answer I thought was hollow and at many points disingenuous. \nShe gave three reasons why she acted the way she did.\n  First, she said she concluded it would be better to wait to appeal to \nthe Supreme Court until after trial because a trial would build a \n``fuller record'' of the case. Once the facts were better developed, \nshe claimed, the government might be in a better position before the \nSupreme Court.\n  Second, she said that allowing the case to go back to the district \ncourt would help the government in a future appeal because it would be \nable to ``show what the Ninth Circuit was demanding that the government \ndo'' in order to defend the don't ask, don't tell statute. Going \nthrough a disruptive trial, she said, would allow the government to \ntell the Supreme Court just how invasive and ``strange'' were the \ndemands of the Ninth Circuit on the government. Well, they were \ninvasive and strange. There is no doubt about that.\n\n  Third, she said, the appeal in the Witt case would have been \n``interlocutory''--that is an appeal in the middle of a case rather \nthan at the end, after a final judgment--and the Supreme Court prefers \nnot to hear these kinds of appeals.\n  None of her explanations are credible, in my view. If you analyze \nthis fairly, I do not believe any one of those explanations can be \nsustained. Another explanation, however, can be sustained.\n  It is true that appellate courts, including the Supreme Court, prefer \nto hear appeals at the end of a case rather than at the middle, but \nthat is a decision the Court can make for itself and does make for \nitself. It is not something the Solicitor General should decide on the \nCourt's behalf and not to take up a case when they have a good legal \nbasis to take it up and to avoid an incredibly burdensome trial would \nundermine military policy in 40 percent of the country. The Ninth \nCircuit includes 40 percent of America under its jurisdiction.\n  At the very least there would have been no harm to the government in \nasking the Court to review the case early. No harm whatsoever. If the \nCourt refused to take the case at that time--interlocutorily--the \ngovernment could always take a later appeal. Any concerns about \navoiding early appeals were clearly outweighed in this case. There \nalready had been a split among the circuit courts of appeals. The Ninth \nCircuit ruling squarely conflicted with the First Circuit, and it was \nalso at\n\n[[Page S6705]]\n\nodds with the decisions from four other circuit courts on similar \nissues. The Ninth Circuit opinion presented clean questions of law: \nShould this matter be decided as a matter of law, as the First Circuit \nsaid, or should it be decided only after some prolonged trial, as the \nNinth Circuit said? This was a critically important matter that I think \nthe Supreme Court, recognizing we are a Nation at war, recognizing this \nis an important Defense Department policy, would have agreed to hear.\n  Ms. Kagan's second explanation--that letting the case go to trial \nwould allow the government to just show how painful a trial would be--\nmakes no sense. The Ninth Circuit made it very clear in their opinion \nthat the government was going to have to justify the application of \ndon't ask, don't tell to this specific plaintiff--Ms. Witt--to prove \nthat this specific plaintiff was going to harm the military if she were \nto be allowed to remain in the Air Force. It was also obvious that such \na trial was going to be disruptive to the military and that it would \nharm the ``unit cohesion'' that Congress had set out to protect when it \npassed don't ask, don't tell.\n  Ms. Kagan's predecessors in the Department of Justice and in the \nSolicitor General's Office immediately recognized the damage that would \nresult from allowing the Ninth Circuit decision to stand. That is why \nthey asked for a rehearing immediately. At that time, this is what they \nsaid:\n\n       [The Ninth Circuit decision] creates an inter-circuit split \n     . . . a conflict with Supreme Court precedent, and an \n     unworkable rule that cannot be implemented without disrupting \n     the military.\n\n  I think they were exactly right on that. The Ninth Circuit decision, \nthey went on to say, made the constitutionality of a Federal law \nsetting military policy for the entire Nation ``depend[] on case-by-\ncase surveys, taken by lawyers, of the troops in a particular \nplaintiff's unit.'' And that is true. Immediate review, they insisted, \nwas ``needed now to prevent this unprecedented and disruptive \nprocess.''\n  Most importantly, Ms. Kagan's first explanation to the Judiciary \nCommittee for her decision to send this case back to trial--that she \nthought the government's case would benefit from a fuller factual \ndevelopment of the case--was simply false. The records of this case on \nremand to the District Court show that Ms. Kagan knew--knew--at the \ntime she decided to let the case go back to trial that such a trial was \ngoing to be massively disruptive.\n  I have studied the record in the case as it headed for trial, where \nlower ranking lawyers in the Department of Justice are now trying to \ndefend the case at trial. These lawyers have been fighting desperately \nto avoid or to limit this open discovery process. According to these \ncareer attorneys, the discovery process is ``threatening'' and \n``jeopardizing the unit morale and cohesion.''\n  Remember, Ms. Kagan told us--the members of the Judiciary Committee, \nduring her confirmation testimony--that building a factual record would \nbe good for the government's case. But here the career lawyers who are \ndefending the case are contending that building this factual record is \nbad for the government, and these lawyers are right.\n  The plaintiff in this case has asked for and received, by virtue of \nthe Ninth Circuit order--and this was plainly predictable from reading \nthat order--access to the personnel records of the entire military unit \nof the plaintiff. They have demanded depositions of other soldiers who \nserved with the plaintiff before she was separated from the military. \nThey have demanded the right to interview soldiers about their private \nlives, their personal views of their former colleague, and their \nprivate thoughts about sexuality.\n  As I have said before, this is not just a case in which Ms. Kagan \nshowed bad legal judgment. She did not send her client, the U.S. Air \nForce, down this path by mistake, it seems to me. She knew this was \ngoing to happen, and I believe she had reasons other than a strategic \nplan to defend the law as her reasons in making this decision.\n  We know Ms. Kagan realized a trial would harm the military's \ninterests because she said so to the lawyers on the other side of the \ncase in the weeks before she made the final decision not to appeal. \nOnce the case was back in this trial court, in this district court, the \nplaintiff's lawyers in one of the hearings made this statement to the \ntrial judge there:\n\n       [T]he government just doesn't want any discovery. I have \n     heard that message from the government clearly--loud and \n     clear. [We] were asked to meet with the Solicitor General of \n     the United States in April, and we heard that message loud \n     and clear that discovery is a big problem.\n\n  So they had been asked, these lawyers, to go to Washington to meet \nwith the Solicitor General to discuss the case and were told at that \nmeeting that discovery was bad. Yet she testified in our hearing just a \nfew weeks ago that she thought it was good for the government.\n  In May of 2009, as Solicitor General, she made a decision to block an \nappeal to the Supreme Court. Before she made that decision, she had \nalready met with these opposing counsel. And who were these lawyers? \nThey were lawyers from the ACLU who were committed to the defeat and \nthe elimination of this don't ask, don't tell law. She told them ``loud \nand clear'' that developing a factual record would be bad for the \ngovernment. Yet she told us just a few weeks ago that it was good; that \nit was going to help the government's case.\n  It appears to me that the most plausible--almost the only--conclusion \nthat one can reach is that Ms. Kagan and the Obama administration \ngenerally were trying to keep the Supreme Court from deciding the \nconstitutionality of don't ask, don't tell. Ms. Kagan, like the \nPresident, is personally opposed to don't ask, don't tell. The \nPresident has asked Congress to repeal don't ask, don't tell, and there \nis legislation pending now in the Senate that would repeal that law.\n  But given the record of the Supreme Court on questions of military \npersonnel policy, I am confident that the Ninth Circuit's radical \ndecision would have been overturned had the Solicitor General taken the \nappeal. And given the timing of the case, we would likely have been \nreading a few weeks ago of a Supreme Court opinion holding that don't \nask, don't tell was a constitutionally legitimate exercise of \nCongress's power over military affairs. If you think about it, you can \nsee why such a ruling--upholding the constitutionality of a law that \nthe administration wants to repeal--might not be politically helpful to \nthem in that process.\n  As I said earlier, there was another case dealing with don't ask, \ndon't tell where the First Circuit had upheld the law. Of the 12 \nplaintiffs involved in that First Circuit case, 11 of them decided to \nabandon their case and not appeal. In other words, they lost, they \ncould have appealed to the Supreme Court, but hey abandoned their \nappeal and accepted the loss.\n\n  Why would they do that? Why would their lawyers allow them to do \nthat? Because, it appears to me, those defendants and their lawyers--\nand included among some of those lawyers were Ms. Kagan's former \ncolleagues from Harvard Law School--knew that the Supreme Court would \nlikely uphold don't ask, don't tell if they took an appeal. That is \nwhat they did not want.\n  Only one of the plaintiffs insisted on appealing to the Supreme \nCourt--1 of the 12--in the face of much resistance from his legal \nadvisers who, as you can see, were less interested in vindicating the \nright of those specific defendants than they were trying to create the \nbest possible strategy to undermine or to defeat don't ask, don't tell. \nInterestingly, Ms. Kagan, again, did what the lawyers attacking the law \nwanted.\n  One of the defendants wanted to appeal the First Circuit case. She \ncould have allowed that appeal to go forward and gotten a definitive \nSupreme Court ruling. But she wrote the Supreme Court that they should \nnot hear the appeal of the First Circuit; they should not accept that \ncase for Supreme Court review. By urging the Court not to hear an \nappeal from that decision she denied the government a definitive \ndecision from the Supreme Court, which I think was within their grasp.\n  Actually, one of the reasons she urged the Supreme Court not to take \nthe appeal in the First Circuit case was because she said the Ninth \nCircuit case would be a better case for the Court to review. Then, when \nthe Ninth Circuit case was ripe, she did not appeal it. In\n\n[[Page S6706]]\n\neffect, Ms. Kagan prevented the Supreme Court from ruling on the \nconstitutionality of this law--a law she so strongly opposed.\n  So I think it is clear. It would seem to me to be clear. If I am \nwrong about this, I would like to see my colleagues explain it. I offer \nthem an opportunity. I don't think I am wrong. I have tried a lot more \ncases than Elena Kagan ever tried--since she has never tried one. I \nthink it is clear her strategy was to avoid a Supreme Court ruling--\nbecause she thought the Supreme Court would uphold don't ask, don't \ntell--and to drag out the proceedings in the lower court in hopes that \nmaybe the administration would be able to convince Congress to repeal \nthe law before the Supreme Court ruled. The record shows she was \nwilling to do so, even if it meant this military unit would be turned \nupside-down by the lawyers from the ACLU.\n\n  Remember, in each case--even in the First Circuit case, where they \nhad lost--the ACLU lawyers did not want that case to go on appeal. And \nin the Ninth Circuit case they did not want the case to go on appeal to \nthe Supreme Court. Why? To me, that is the final argument. Why did the \nSolicitor General acquiesce and adopt the very policy the ACLU lawyers \nwanted--not to appeal to the Supreme Court--other than that she did not \nwant a definitive ruling and agreed with them it was likely the Supreme \nCourt would affirm the law? I think that is what we are talking about.\n  I hate to say that. That is why, in an unprecedented way--I don't \nthink it has ever happened since I have been in the Senate, certainly \nfor a Supreme Court nominee, that they were given a full 10 minutes to \nanswer uninterrupted why they made that decision.\n  Her answer was unsatisfactory for the Solicitor General, the lawyer \nfor the United States of America, whose duty and explicit promise was \nto defend don't ask, don't tell, even though she and her President did \nnot agree with it.\n  I have expressed my concern in this process, that Ms. Kagan's \nbackground and her record is more that of a political lawyer than a \nreal lawyer. She certainly has never been a judge. She has never been, \nfor any real period of time, a real lawyer. She went right out of law \nschool, had 2 years in a private law firm and 14 months as Solicitor \nGeneral.\n  These political lawyers, sometimes they do not grasp the \nresponsibility and duty and the power and the beauty and the majesty of \nthe American legal system. They think it is all politics. They have not \nbeen before judges as I have been, as have many other lawyers by the \nhundreds of thousands in America, and seen justice rendered day after \nday--and sometimes seen injustice rendered--and know how to admire and \nappreciate justice and objectivity and legal acumen.\n  Ms. Kagan's willingness to advance a political agenda without regard \nfor her duty strikes at the very root of the rule of law in America, \nour greatest strength. As the hymn says, our liberty is in law. A \nperson who cannot constrain herself to her proper role, to fulfill her \nduty to defend law, even when it runs contrary to her personal views, \nis no more likely to follow a law she dislikes if she is elevated to \nthe Supreme Court. I suggest that is a threat to justice in America.\n  I do think this is another incident--there are others in the record \nof this nominee--that indicates this is a political lawyer, an agenda-\ndriven lawyer, someone who has never served as a judge and never truly \npracticed law. The horrendous decision in not pursuing the opportunity \nto get a final decision from the Supreme Court on don't ask, don't \ntell, I believe, was made for reasons other than faithfully fulfilling \nher responsibilities as Solicitor General to defend these laws. And I \nbelieve it is disqualifying for one who seeks to serve on the highest \nCourt in the land.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss Solicitor General Elena \nKagan's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. During my time in \nCongress, I have had the honor to vote in support for the nominations \nof several Associate Justices put forward by both Democratic and \nRepublican Presidents. Presidents are due a great amount of deference \nin the evaluation of his or her nominees to be members of the highest \nCourt in the land, and elections, I understand very well, do have \nconsequences. However, in this case I am not able to provide such \ndeference to President Obama's nominee who has shown such a public \nunwillingness to follow the law.\n  When Ms. Kagan was dean of the Harvard Law School, she unmistakably \ndiscouraged Harvard students from considering a career in the military \nby denying military recruiters the same access to Harvard students that \nwas granted to the Nation's top law firms. She barred military \nrecruiters because she believed the Federal Government's don't ask, \ndon't tell policy to be ``a profound wrong--a moral injustice of the \nfirst order.''\n  Ms. Kagan is entitled to her opinion of whether the policy is wrong. \nShe is not entitled to ignore the law that required universities to \nallow military recruiters on campus or forgo Federal funds.\n  The chief of recruiting for the Air Force Judge Advocate General \nCorps was repeatedly blocked from participating in Harvard's spring \n2005 recruiting season and wrote to Pentagon leaders: ``Harvard is \nplaying games and won't give us an on-campus interviewing date.''\n  The Army's report from the 2005 recruiting season was even more \nblunt, stating: ``The Army was stonewalled at Harvard.''\n  Ms. Kagan sought a compromise by asking the law school's Veterans \nAssociation to host military recruiters, but the association responded: \n``Given our tiny membership, meager budget, and lack of any office \nspace, we possess neither the time nor the resources . . . of \nduplicating the excellent assistance provided by the Harvard Law School \nOffice of Career Services.''\n  The association was right and an Air Force Judge Advocate General \nrecruiter wrote Pentagon officials, and I quote from his letter: \n``Without the support of the Career Services Office, we are relegated \nto wandering the halls in hopes that someone will stop and talk to \nus.''\n  That was a remarkable statement from a military recruiter. According \nto the Solomon Amendment, any institution that barred recruiters from \ntheir campus would therefore not be eligible for Federal funds. Ms. \nKagan and Harvard University, in general, and the law school in \nparticular, were, according to this Air Force officer, doing that. \n``Without the support of the Career Services Office we are relegated to \nwandering the halls in hopes that someone will stop and talk to us.''\n  The university that portrays itself as the premier institution in \nAmerica relegated our officers and recruiters for honorable service in \nthe military of the United States of America to ``wandering the halls \nin hopes that someone will stop and talk to us.''\n  Ms. Kagan had a direct role in seeing that military recruiters were \n``relegated to wandering the halls in hopes that someone will stop and \ntalk'' to them. Ms. Kagan's claim that she was bound by Harvard's \nantidiscrimination policy is belied by the fact that her predecessor \nallowed military recruiters full official access, a policy Ms. Kagan \nchanged.\n  While Ms. Kagan barred military recruiters access to the school, \nHarvard continued to receive millions of dollars in Federal aid. I will \nnot go into my opinion of Harvard University's behavior throughout this \nwhole issue of whether recruiters should be allowed on their campus. \nThere are members of the ROTC who are still condemned to go to a \nneighboring institution for their training. But we are speaking of Ms. \nKagan.\n  During her confirmation hearing last month, Ms. Kagan asserted that \nHarvard law school was ``never out of compliance with the law . . . in \nfact, the veterans' association did a fabulous job of letting all our \nstudents know that the military recruiters were going to be at Harvard. \n. . .''\n\n[[Page S6707]]\n\n  She went on to state: ``The military at all times during my deanship \nhad full and good access.''\n  Absolutely false statement. Facts show that these statements are \nfalse, and recruitment for our Nation's military suffered due to her \nactions.\n  Well, I strongly disagree with Ms. Kagan. I take no issue in terms of \nher nomination with her opposition to President Clinton's don't ask, \ndon't tell policy. She is free to have her own ownership. Ms. Kagan was \nnot free to ignore the Solomon Amendment's requirement to provide \nmilitary recruiters equal access because she opposed don't ask, don't \ntell. In short, she interpreted her duties as dean of Harvard to be \nconsistent with what she wished the law to be, not with what the law \nwas as written.\n  In the end, Ms. Kagan's interpretation of the Solomon Amendment was \nsoundly rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court. By changing the policy she \ninherited and restricting military recruiter access when the prevailing \nlaw was to the contrary, Ms. Kagan stepped beyond public advocacy in \nopposition to a policy and into the realm of usurping the prerogative \nof the Congress and the President to make law and the courts to \ninterpret it. It is precisely for this reason that I cannot support her \nnomination.\n  I have previously stated that I do not believe judges should stray \nbeyond their constitutional role and act as if they have greater \ninsight into the meaning of the broad principles of our Constitution \nthan representatives who are elected by the people. These activist \njudges assume the judiciary is a superlegislature of moral \nphilosophers. It demonstrates a lack of respect for the popular will \nthat is fundamental to our republican system of government.\n  Regardless of one's success in academic and government service, an \nindividual who does not appreciate the commonsense limitations on \njudicial power in our democratic system of government ultimately lacks \na key qualification for a lifetime appointment to the bench. For Ms. \nKagan, given the choice to uphold the law that was unpopular with her \npeers and students or interpret the law to achieve her own political \nobjectives, she chose the latter.\n  I cannot support her nomination to the Supreme Court, where, based on \nher prior actions, she is unlikely to exercise judicial restraint and \nrespect the roles of the coequal branches of government.\n  I am sure my colleague from Alabama, who has done so much work on \nthis issue, probably recalls that during her confirmation process, \nPeter Hegseth, who is the executive director of Vets for Freedom, a \nveteran of the Iraq war, and currently an infantry captain in the \nMassachusetts Army National Guard, testified: ``I have serious concern \nabout Elena Kagan's actions toward the military and her willingness to \nmyopically focus on preventing the military from having institutional \nand equal access to top-notch recruits at a time of war.''\n  He went on to say: ``I find her actions toward military recruiters at \nHarvard unbecoming a civic leader and unbefitting a nominee to the U.S. \nSupreme Court.''\n  Another veteran, Flagg Youngblood, ROTC graduate from Princeton, \ntestified at the same hearing: To defend the barriers Dean Kagan \nerected by saying military recruiting did not suffer misses the point. \nJust imagine how many more among Harvard Law's 1,900 young adults would \nhave answered the Defense Department's call.\n  Lastly, retired Air Force COL Thomas Moe, a veteran with 33 years of \nservice to our Nation, testified: ``Ms. Kagan knowingly defied a \nparticular law and treated military recruiters as second-class \ncitizens. How can our warriors look at such people when they are poised \nat the tip of the sword, ready to sacrifice everything for their \ncountry, while a cloistered clique in ivory towers eats away at their \ninstitution for the sake of narrow ideological interests.''\n  I know the Senator from Alabama was present at these hearings. I ask \nunanimous consent to engage in a short colloquy with the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Ms. Kagan stated that she--I understand \nher words were ``reveres the military;'' is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. She did use that word.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it a bit contradictory that you would want to treat \nthe military as ``separate but equal,'' condemning them--the Air Force \nJudge Advocate General military person said they were condemned to \nwandering the halls of Harvard Law School in hopes that someone would \nstop and talk to them. Is that, I wonder, in keeping with the actions \nof someone who claims they revere the military?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I certainly do not believe it is. As the Senator has \nnoted repeatedly--and we serve on the Armed Services Committee \ntogether--this was not a military policy; this was a law passed by this \nCongress and signed by President Clinton, with whom she worked for 5 \nyears. But she was punishing these young officers, many of them, \ndemeaning them, making them be treated in a second-class way because \nshe did not agree with that policy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the Senator, is there any doubt in your mind, \ngiven the testimony of other witnesses, including letters such as from \nthe Air Force Judge Advocate General recruiters and others, that Ms. \nKagan--then Dean Kagan--did take these actions restricting the access \nof recruiters to the Harvard Law School?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. There is absolutely no doubt about it. She openly sent \nan e-mail to all students and said she considered this policy that \nCongress adopted a moral injustice of the first order.\n  On one occasion a military recruiter was apparently working in one \nbuilding, and she spoke to a protest rally outside the next-door \nbuilding, creating a climate that was certainly hostile to the good \nefforts of that military officer.\n  Mr. McCAIN. But at the same time, then-Dean Kagan never asked to \nreturn the Federal funds that were flowing into the university?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No. In fact, it took the president of Harvard, Larry \nSummers--now President Obama's chief financial economic adviser; he was \nthen president of Harvard--he had to reverse her decision when he was \nfaced with the loss of Federal funds. The entire recruiting season, \nhowever, was lost before the military realized they were systematically \nbeing blocked. And they protested to the university, and finally she \nwas overruled by the president.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So then-Dean Kagan's actions, which she believed--and I \nrespect her views that it was a moral imperative, and basically she \nchose what she viewed as a moral imperative--i.e., her opposition to \nthe don't ask, don't tell law--as overriding compliance with the law, \nwhich then brings into question her qualifications and what her future \nactions will be as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely. I think that is the essence of what \nhappened. She eventually acknowledged that at no time was the Solomon \nAmendment not in force at Harvard when she was there.\n  I know Senator McCain remembers that we passed four versions of the \nSolomon Amendment because every time one was passed, these law schools \nor others figured out a way to get around it. We finally wrote one they \ncouldn't get around. This was systematic obstruction by universities \nthat I think does not speak well of them.\n  She also filed a brief with the Supreme Court attacking the law, and, \nas the Senator noted earlier, the Supreme Court rejected that brief 8 \nto 0.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So we are not discussing the merits or demerits of a law \nthat was passed by Congress; we are discussing then-Dean Kagan's \nactions in opposition to this law which were absolutely in \ncontradiction to the law.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely. Harvard had agreed to follow this law. Her \npredecessor as dean, Dean Clark, had agreed to do so. She seized upon \nan opportunity, without legal authority, to cease to comply with that \nlaw, denied the military full access to the campus as the law required, \nand eventually had to be reversed by the president of Harvard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I finally ask my colleague from Alabama, do you \never think the day will come when we have a nominee for the U.S. \nSupreme Court who didn't go to Harvard Law School?\n\n[[Page S6708]]\n\nMaybe that might be healthy for America.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, you know, I think it might. If they have good \njudgment and are good people, I am not so worried where they come from. \nBut when you have five people on the Supreme Court--and we will have \nthat if she is confirmed--all from one of the boroughs of New York and \nmost of them from Harvard or Yale, then I think it does raise questions \nabout it. Maybe someone from Arizona could handle that job.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Or perhaps Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Perhaps so.\n  With regard to those young officers who were on the Harvard campus, \nmy understanding of the military--and the Senator's experience is far \ngreater than mine--is that many of those officers may well have just \nreturned from Iraq or Afghanistan. You don't just serve all your career \nas a recruiter. I mean, they may have been combat officers or \nhelicopter pilots or convoy leaders putting their lives at risk. I \nwonder how the Senator thinks they felt when they faced this kind of \ndiscrimination.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Frankly, I would say to my colleague from Alabama, \nobviously it is not related to Dean Kagan, but treatment at these elite \ninstitutions in the Ivy League, going all the way back to the Vietnam \nwar--you know, they are entitled to their views and their opinions and \ntheir opposition, but to treat people who were designated by the \nPresident of the United States to be recruiters, to motivate other \nyoung men and women to join what I believe is a very honorable \nprofession, most honorable, to put impediments in their way and \nintentionally block their ability to do so is something that I guess \nthey will have to answer for in the future.\n  I thank my colleague from Alabama for his leadership on this issue on \nthe Judiciary Committee. He has worked tirelessly, night and day, on \nthis issue for a long period of time now. I thank the Senator from \nAlabama for his outstanding work and leadership. I appreciate it. I \nknow Americans do too.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. I would note that one of the \narguments that has been made--and my time is about up--has been that: \nWell, nothing was really done at Harvard. We asked a veterans group, a \nveterans organization to take care of all of these things we were \nrefusing to allow the military to have through the Career Services \nOffice.\n  And this is what the veterans group said at the time. They sent an e-\nmail to everybody on campus because it offended them that they were \nbeing asked to do a job that should have been done through the Career \nServices Office. They sent this e-mail:\n\n       Given our tiny membership, meager budget, and lack of any \n     office space, we possess neither the time nor the resources \n     to routinely schedule campus rooms or advertise extensively \n     for outside organizations, as is the norm for most recruiting \n     events. . . . [Our effort] falls short of duplicating the \n     excellent assistance provided by the Office of Career \n     Services.\n\n  So this argument has been repeatedly made: Don't worry about it; the \nveterans groups were taking care of all of this. It is bogus. It is \nincorrect. And she repeated that. I am not surprised to get that kind \nof statement from the White House spin doctors, but a nominee under \noath----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Should not have made the statement she did in that \nregard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on July 1 of this year, the Judiciary \nCommittee received a letter from LT Zachary W. Prager. He serves in the \nU.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps. He writes:\n\n       I was a student at Harvard Law School under Ms. Kagan and \n     commissioned into the Navy. . . . I am grateful to Dean Kagan \n     for her leadership on military recruiting, as well as the \n     myriad of other positive impacts that she had on my law \n     school experience. I would not be serving today--\n\n  Referring to the military--\n\n     without it. She has earned my most heartfelt support for her \n     nomination.\n\n  This is a member of the military who felt Dean Kagan helped greatly \nwith him joining the military.\n  As the dean of Harvard Law School, Elena Kagan worked hard to find \nways to both enforce the school's nondiscrimination policy and allow \nthe military to recruit Harvard students.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Lieutenant Prager's \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: I write in support of Solicitor \n     General Elena Kagan's nomination to the United States Supreme \n     Court. I am a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate \n     General's Corps. I was a student at Harvard Law School under \n     Ms. Kagan and commissioned into the Navy upon graduation in \n     2007. Without Ms. Kagan's leadership and evenhandedness as \n     Dean, I would not have joined the military,\n       Dean Kagan set a standard at Harvard of respect for \n     military servicemembers, while still expressing her \n     opposition to the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. She made it \n     clear that Harvard Law School would fight the policy, but \n     never impugn the soldiers, sailors and airmen who came to \n     Harvard to recruit. Her guidance on this issue permeated \n     throughout her administration, from the Dean of Student's \n     Office to the Office of Career Services. Like many students, \n     I was reticent to join an institution that practices overt \n     discrimination. The environment they established opened the \n     door for me to consider the military as a career path. Their \n     example helped clear my reservations.\n       My decision to join the Navy was welcomed by Dean Kagan's \n     administration. Military service was valued the same as any \n     other public interest job. At a dinner to honor those of us \n     entering public service, I dined next to public defenders, \n     federal prosecutors and human rights activists. Notably, I \n     now serve in the Navy alongside another classmate, and alumni \n     from my class serve in the Marine Corps and Army Judge \n     Advocate General's Corps.\n       I am proud to serve in the Navy and I love my job. I \n     completed a deployment to Iraq and leave soon for my next \n     tour overseas in Japan. I am grateful to Dean Kagan for her \n     leadership on military recruiting, as well as the myriad of \n     other positive impacts that she had on my law school \n     experience. I would not be serving today without it. She has \n     earned my most heartfelt support for her nomination.\n           Very Respectfully,\n                                                   Zachary Prager.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on that subject, I would like to note a \nletter of support the Judiciary Committee received from 1LT David \nTressler. He was at Harvard Law School when Solicitor General Kagan \nserved there as dean. He is currently serving in harm's way in \nAfghanistan, and he strongly supports Solicitor General Kagan for this \nnomination.\n  Here is what the lieutenant writes:\n\n       I believe that, while dean of Harvard Law School, [Elena \n     Kagan] adequately proved her support for those who had \n     served, were currently serving, and all those who felt called \n     to serve, including those like me who joined upon graduation \n     as well as those patriots who were not permitted to do so \n     under the policy of ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Lieutenant Tressler's \nletter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 30, 2010.\n     Re: Nomination of Elena Kagan.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Sessions: From Afghanistan \n     I have read about the criticism being leveled at Elena Kagan \n     during the confirmation hearings for her nomination as an \n     Associate Justice of the Supreme Court over her decisions and \n     positions while dean of Harvard Law School with regard to \n     military recruiters on campus and the military's ``Don't Ask, \n     Don't Tell'' (DADT) policy. Senator Sessions issued a \n     statement that Kagan ``stood in the way of devoted, \n     hardworking military recruiters,'' and Senator Jon Kyl said \n     that ``[h]er tenure . . . was marred, in my view, by her \n     decision to punish the military and would-be recruits for a \n     policy--`don't ask, don't tell' and the Solomon Amendment. . \n     . .'' I am one of those recruits and write to share with the\n\n[[Page S6709]]\n\n     Committee my experience as a law student at Harvard between \n     2004 and 2006 when the controversy over military recruiters \n     on campus unfolded. Shortly after my 2006 graduation I \n     enlisted in the Army Reserve and I am currently serving as a \n     civil affairs officer at a remote combat outpost in eastern \n     Afghanistan.\n       I am focused on my mission here, but as a citizen, lawyer, \n     and military officer who swore to defend the Constitution, I \n     care also about the integrity of the Supreme Court selection \n     process and disagree with efforts to paint Elena Kagan as \n     unsupportive of the military.\n       Like most Americans I want to see a nomination process \n     focused on Kagan's qualifications and judicial philosophy, \n     not on empty political theater. The details and chronology of \n     her decisions with regard to military recruiters on campus \n     have been well-reported by the media and described again by \n     Ms. Kagan, but I will recount them briefly from my experience \n     as a student who was there at the time considering enlistment \n     in the military. I remember her decisions and the tenor of \n     her messages about the military, DADT, and military \n     recruiting.\n       There was a legitimate legal debate taking place in the \n     courts over the Solomon Amendment, and when court decisions \n     allowed it in 2004, Kagan made a decision to uphold the \n     school's anti-discrimination policy. Military recruiters were \n     never barred from campus. During the brief period when \n     recruiters were not given access to students officially \n     through the law school's Office of Career Services, they \n     still had access to students on campus through other means. \n     Immediately following this period, in 2005 more graduating \n     students joined the military than any year this decade, \n     according to the Director of the Law School's Office of \n     Career Services.\n       Kagan's positions on the issue were not anti-military and \n     did not discriminate against members or potential recruits of \n     the military. Nor do I believe that they denied the military \n     much-needed recruits in a time of war. There are only a few \n     of us each year who joined the military while attending, or \n     after graduation from, Harvard Law. Kagan's decision to \n     uphold the school's anti-discrimination policy for a brief \n     period of time and express disagreement with DADT did not \n     prevent us from talking with recruiters and joining.\n       I heard Kagan speak several times about this issue. She \n     always expressed her support for those who serve in the \n     military and encouraged students to consider military \n     service. It was clear she was trying to balance the \n     institution's values underlying its antidiscrimination policy \n     with her genuine support for those who serve or were \n     considering service in the military. Indeed, her sense of \n     DADT's injustice seemed to grow out of her belief in the \n     importance and value of military service. I remember that she \n     repeatedly said as much while dean. More recently while \n     speaking to cadets at West Point, she explained that, ``I \n     personally believe that the exclusion of gays and lesbians \n     from the military is both unjust and unwise. I wish devoutly \n     that these Americans too could join this noblest of all \n     professions and serve their country in this most important of \n     all ways.''\n       I believe she was right. But Senator Sessions recently \n     suggested, referring to Ms. Kagan's positions, that ``to some \n     in the elite, progressive circles of academia, it is \n     acceptable to discriminate against the patriots who fight and \n     die for our freedoms.'' With due respect, as a Soldier who \n     serves side by side in a hostile combat zone with patriots \n     who are subjected to the discrimination imposed by DADT \n     policy, I see it differently.\n       Like most servicemembers serving in a combat theater, when \n     we go outside the wire, I care more about the fitness, \n     experience, and tactical proficiency of the Soldiers around \n     me than who they might want to date or marry when they get \n     home. Out here on the ground in Afghanistan, when we are \n     attacked--which happens often at and around my outpost--it \n     does not matter who is straight or gay any more than it \n     matters who is white or black or who among us can drink \n     legally and who is still underage. We come under fire \n     together. And when it's over, we pick ourselves up and \n     continue on with the mission together. Yet contrary to the \n     military's code of leaving no comrade behind, DADT continues \n     to selectively discriminate against some of these \n     servicemembers who put their lives at risk for this country.\n       Nevertheless, reasonable, well-intentioned and equally \n     honorable people disagree about the wisdom of DADT. To attack \n     Ms. Kagan for a principled position she took as a law school \n     dean that had no practical effect on military recruitment \n     looks, from where I stand, like a political distraction. What \n     the country deserves instead is a substantive debate over \n     Elena Kagan's judicial philosophy and her qualifications to \n     interpret the Constitution and decide cases as a member of \n     this nation's highest court.\n       I urge you to maintain that focus for the remainder of the \n     hearings and refrain from further hyperbole questioning Ms. \n     Kagan's support for the men and women of the U.S. military. I \n     believe that, while dean of Harvard Law School, she \n     adequately proved her support for those who had served, were \n     currently serving, and all those who felt called to serve, \n     including those like me who joined upon graduation as well as \n     those patriots who were not permitted to do so under the \n     policy of ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.''\n           Respectfully,\n     David M. Tressler,\n       First Lieutenant, Civil Affairs, United States Army \n     Reserve, Khost Province, Afghanistan.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I might say what a red herring this question is of where a \nrecruiter's office is. If you have people who want to serve in the \nmilitary, they can usually find them.\n  Our youngest son joined the U.S. Marine Corps directly out of high \nschool--a brilliant young man who wanted to serve his country. So I \nasked him again the other day, just to be sure.\n  I said: Mark, now, was that recruiter at the high school or on \ncampus?\n  He said: Oh, no, Dad. We didn't have anything like that.\n  I said: How did you find it?\n  He said: Well, I got out the telephone book. I looked up the address: \ndowntown Burlington. He told me exactly where it was. I know the area. \nI walked down there and joined the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  Frankly, and obviously, my wife and I are very proud of him. He \nserved honorably. I cannot help but think for just about everybody I \nknow who joined the military, if you asked them: How did you do this, \nthey would say: Oh, I checked where the recruiter was and went and \njoined or I was at an event somewhere where somebody was speaking, and \nI heard about it and joined.\n  So this is probably the biggest red herring. I have been here for \ndebates and votes on every single member currently serving on the \nSupreme Court and some who have since retired from the Supreme Court. I \nhave heard a few red herrings over the years, never one like this.\n  Mr. President, during the 3 months that this nomination has been \npending, Senators have made many statements about Solicitor General \nElena Kagan. I wish to commend the statements made yesterday and today \nby the majority leader, Senator Cardin, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Kohl, Senator Franken, Senator Durbin, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Dorgan, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Shaheen, Senator \nKlobuchar, Senator Hagan, Senator Mikulski, Senator Bingaman, Senator \nCarper, Senator Levin, Senator Whitehouse, Senator Graham, Senator \nBurris, Senator Specter, Senator Collins, and Senator Boxer. They were \noutstanding in describing the qualifications of a nominee who should be \nconfirmed with a strong bipartisan majority.\n  If I might, seeing the distinguished Presiding Officer, I wish to \nacknowledge the extraordinary contributions of his colleague, Senator \nKlobuchar. She spoke eloquently. She organized a group of Senators, and \nshe persevered, despite the personal loss she suffered this week.\n  When President Obama set out to find a well-qualified nominee to \nreplace retiring Justice John Paul Stevens, he said he would ``seek \nsomeone who understands that justice isn't about some abstract legal \ntheory or footnote in a casebook. It's also about how laws affect the \ndaily realities of people's lives--whether they can make a living and \ncare for their families, whether they feel safe in their homes and \nwelcome in our nation.'' In introducing Solicitor General Kagan as his \nSupreme Court nominee, President Obama, whose 49th birthday is today, \npraised her ``understanding of the law, not as an intellectual exercise \nor words on a page, but as it affects the lives of ordinary people.''\n  President Obama is not alone in recognizing the value of judges and \nJustices who are aware that their duties require them to understand how \nthe law works and the effects it has in the real world. Within the last \nfew months, two Republican appointees to the Supreme Court have made \nthe same point. Justice Anthony Kennedy told a joint meeting of the \nPalm Beach and Palm Beach County Bar Associations that, as a Justice, \n``You certainly can't formulate principles without being aware of where \nthose principles will take you, what their consequences will be. Law is \na human exercise and if it ceases to be that it does not deserve the \nname law.''\n  In addition, Justice David Souter, who retired last year and was \nsucceeded by Justice Sotomayor, delivered a thoughtful commencement \naddress at Harvard University. He spoke about judging, and explained \nwhy thoughtful judging requires grappling with the\n\n[[Page S6710]]\n\ncomplexity of constitutional questions in a way that takes the entire \nConstitution into account. He spoke about the need to ``keep the \nconstitutional promises our nation has made.'' Justice Souter \nconcluded:\n\n       If we cannot share every intellectual assumption that \n     formed the minds of those who framed that charter, we can \n     still address the constitutional uncertainties the way they \n     must have envisioned, by relying on reason, by respecting all \n     the words the Framers wrote, by facing facts, and by seeking \n     to understand their meaning for living people.\n\n  Justice Souter understood the real world impact of the Supreme \nCourt's decisions, as I believe does his successor, Justice Sotomayor. \nAcross a range of fields including bankruptcy, the fourth amendment, \nstatutory construction, and campaign finance, Justice Sotomayor has \nwritten and joined opinions that have paid close attention to the \nsignificance of the facts in the record, to the considered and \nlongstanding judgments of the Congress, to the arguments on each side, \nand to Supreme Court precedent. In doing this she has shown an \nadherence to the rule of law and an appreciation for the real world \nramifications of the Supreme Court's decisions.\n  Given America's social and technological development since we were a \nyoung nation, interpreting the Constitution's broad language requires \njudges and Justices to exercise judgment. In the real world, there are \ncomplex cases with no easy answers. In some instances, as Justice \nSouter pointed out in his recent commencement address, different \naspects of the Constitution point in different directions, toward \ndifferent results, and they need to be reconciled. Acknowledging these \ninherent tensions is not only mainstream, it is as old as the \nConstitution, and it has been evident throughout American history, from \nChief Justice John Marshall in the landmark case of McCulloch v. \nMaryland to Justice Breyer this past June in United States v. Comstock.\n  Chief Justice John Marshall wrote for a unanimous Supreme Court in \nthe landmark case of McCulloch v. Maryland in 1819, writing that for \nthe Constitution to contain detailed delineation of its meaning ``would \npartake of the prolixity of a legal code, and could scarcely be \nembraced by the human mind.'' He understood, as someone who served with \nWashington, Jefferson, Adams and Madison, that its terms provide ``only \nits great outlines'' and that its application in various circumstances \nwould need to be deduced. The necessary and proper clause of the \nConstitution entrusts to Congress the legislative power ``to make all \nlaws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution'' \nthe enumerated legislative powers of article I, section 8, of our \nConstitution as well as ``all other powers vested by this Constitution \nin the Government of the United States.'' In construing it, Chief \nJustice Marshall explained that the expansion clause ``is in a \nconstitution, intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently, to \nbe adapted to the various crises of human affairs.'' He went on to \ndeclare how, in accordance with a proper understanding of the necessary \nand proper clause and the Constitution, Congress should not by judicial \nfiat be deprived ``of the capacity to avail itself of experience, to \nexercise its reason, and to accommodate its legislation to human \naffairs'' by judicial fiat. Chief Justice Marshall understood the \nConstitution, knew its text and knew the Framers. He rejected stagnant \nconstruction of the Constitution.\n  McCulloch v. Maryland was the Supreme Court's first interpretation of \nthe necessary and proper clause. The most recent was this past June, in \nUnited States v. Comstock. That case upheld the power of Congress to \nenact the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, which included \nprovisions authorizing civil commitment of sexually dangerous Federal \nprisoners who had engaged in sexually violent conduct or child \nmolestation and were mentally ill. Quoting Chief Justice Marshall's \nlanguage from McCulloch, Justice Breyer wrote in an opinion joined by a \nmajority of the Supreme Court, including Chief Justice Roberts, about \nthe ``foresight'' of the Framers who drafted a Constitution capable of \nresilience and adaptable to new developments and conditions.\n  Justice Breyer's judicial philosophy is well known. A few years ago, \nhe authored Active Liberty in which he discussed how the Constitution \nand constitutional decisionmaking protects our freedoms and, in \nparticular, the role of the American people in our democratic \ngovernment. When he writes about how our constitutional values apply to \nnew subjects ``with which the framers were not familiar,'' he looks to \nbe faithful to the purposes of the Constitution and aware of the \nconsequences of various decisions.\n\n  During the Civil War, in its 1863 Prize Cases decision, the Supreme \nCourt upheld the constitutionality of President Lincoln's decision to \nblockade southern ports before a formal congressional declaration of \nwar against the Confederacy. Justice Grier explained that it was no \nless a war because it was a rebellion against the lawful authority of \nthe United States. Noting that Great Britain and other European nations \nhad declared their neutrality in the conflict, he wrote that the Court \nshould not be asked ``to affect a technical ignorance of the existence \nof a war, which all the world acknowledges to be the greatest civil war \nknown in the history of the human race.'' That, too, was judging in the \nreal world.\n  In the same way, the Supreme Court decided more recently in Rasul v. \nBush, that there was jurisdiction to decide claims under the Great Writ \nsecuring our freedom, the writ of habeas corpus, from those in U.S. \ncustody being held in Guantanamo. Justice Stevens, a veteran of World \nWar II recognized that the United States exercised full and exclusive \nauthority at Guantanamo if not ultimate, territorial sovereignty. The \nploy by which the Bush administration had attempted to circumvent all \njudicial review of its actions was rejected, recognizing that ours is a \ngovernment of checks and balances.\n  Examples of real world judging abound in the Supreme Court's \ndecisions upholding our individual freedoms.\n  Real world judging is precisely what the Supreme Court did in its \nmost famous and admired modern decision in Brown v. Board of \nEducation--a landmark decision that ended the scourge and the shame of \nsegregation in this country. I recently saw the marvelous production of \nthe George Stevens, Jr., one-man play, ``Thurgood,'' starring Laurence \nFishburne. It was an extraordinary evening that focused on one of the \ngreat legal giants of America. In fact, at one point, Justice \nMarshall--the actor playing Justice Marshall--reads a few lines from \nthe unanimous decision of the Supreme Court in 1954 that declared \nracial discrimination in education unconstitutional. Chief Justice \nWarren had written:\n\n       In approaching this problem, we cannot turn the clock back \n     to 1868, when the [Fourteenth] Amendment was adopted or even \n     to 1896 when Plessy v. Ferguson was written. We must consider \n     public education in the light of its full development and its \n     present place in American life throughout the Nation. Only in \n     this way can it be determined if segregation in public \n     schools deprives these plaintiffs of the equal protection of \n     the laws.\n\n  Understanding the facts in context, the entire Court helped to end a \ndiscriminatory chapter in our history, and they did it unanimously, the \nCourt, made up of people such as a former Senator from Alabama who had \nbeen a member of the Ku Klux Klan, to Earl Warren, a former Attorney \nGeneral and Governor, and just about every other possible permeation in \nbetween.\n  The Supreme Court did not limit itself to the Constitution as it was \nwritten in 1787. At that point in our early history, ``We the People'' \ndid not include Native Americans or African-American slaves, and our \nlaws failed to accord half the population equality or the right to vote \nbecause they were women. Do any one of us want to go back to 1787 and \nsay this should be the rules of the game?\n  Real world judging takes into account that the world and our \nConstitution have changed from 1788, beginning with the Bill of Rights. \nIt takes into account not only the Civil War but the Civil War \namendments to the Constitution, adopted between 1865 and 1870, and \nevery amendment adopted since then.\n  Would anyone today, even Justice Scalia, read the eighth amendment's \nlimitation against cruel and unusual punishment to allow the cutting \noff of ears, a practice employed in colonial times? Of course not, \nbecause the\n\n[[Page S6711]]\n\nstandard of what is cruel and unusual punishment was not frozen for all \ntime in 1788. Does anyone dispute that most of the Bill of Rights is \ncorrectly applied today to the States through the due process clause of \nthe 14th amendment? Our Bill of Rights freedoms were expressed only as \nlimitations on the authority of Congress. Does anyone think the equal \nprotection clause of the 14th amendment cannot be read to prohibit \ngender discrimination? Remember, when it was written, the drafters \nobviously did not have women in mind. But does anybody think this does \nnot make it very clear that our laws should apply equally to men and \nwomen today?\n  The Constitution mentions our Armed Forces, but there was no Air \nForce when the Constitution was written. Does anyone doubt that our Air \nForce is encompassed by the Constitution, even though no Framer had \nthem in mind when the Constitution was being ratified? Of course not.\n  Likewise, in its interpretation of the commerce clause and the \nintellectual property provisions providing copyright and patent \nprotection for writings and discoveries, the Supreme Court has sensibly \napplied our constitutional principles to the inventions, creations, and \nconditions of the 21st century. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison may \nhave mastered the quill pen, but they did not envision modern computers \nor phones or smart phones or satellites.\n  The first amendment expressly protects freedom of speech and the \npress, but the Supreme Court has applied it, without controversy, to \nthings that did not exist when the first amendment was written, such as \ntelevision, radio, and the Internet. Our Constitution was written \nbefore Americans had ventured into cyberspace or outer space. It was \nwritten before automobiles or airplanes or even steamboats. Yet the \nlanguage and principles of the Constitution remain the same as it is \napplied to new developments. Our privacy protection from the fourth \namendment has been tested, but it has survived because the Supreme \nCourt did not limit our freedom to tangible things and physical \nintrusions but decided to ensure privacy consistent with the principles \nembodied in the Constitution.\n  There are unfortunately occasions in which the current conservative \nactivist majority on the Supreme Court departs from the clear meaning \nor purpose of the law and even its own precedents. One such case, the \nLedbetter case, would have perpetuated unequal pay for women, by using \na rigid, cramped reading of a statute which defied congressional \nintent. We corrected that decision by statute. Now there is the Gross \ncase that would make age discrimination virtually impossible to prove. \nThat erroneous decision, which disregarded the court's own precedent, \nshould also be corrected.\n  And, of course, the Citizens United case wrongly reversed 100 years \nof legal developments to unleash corporate influence in elections. A \nnumber of us are trying to correct some of the excesses of that \ndecision with the DISCLOSE Act, but Republicans have filibustered that \neffort, and will not allow the Senate to consider corrective \nlegislation to add transparency to corporate electioneering.\n  Frankly, I am left to wonder whether some of the current members of \nthe conservative activist majority on the Supreme Court would have \nsupported the decision in Brown v. Board of Education had they been \nmembers of the Supreme Court in 1954. They turned that decision upside \ndown with their decision just a few years ago in the Seattle school \ndesegregation case. Theirs was an ideological decision not based on \nthat magnificent precedent, but undermining it.\n  It took a Supreme Court that, in 1954, understood the real world to \nsee that the seemingly fair-sounding doctrine of ``separate but equal'' \nwas in reality a straightjacket of inequality and offensive to the \nConstitution. All Americans have come to respect the Supreme Court's \nunanimous rejection of racial discrimination and inequality in Brown v. \nBoard of Education. That was a case about the real world impact of a \nlegal doctrine.\n  But just 3 years ago, in the Seattle school desegregation case, we \nsaw a narrowly divided Supreme Court undercut the heart of the landmark \nBrown v. Board decision. The Seattle school district valued racial \ndiversity, and was voluntarily trying to maintain diversity in its \nschools. By a 5-4 vote of conservative activists on the Supreme Court, \nthis voluntary program was prohibited. That decision broke with more \nthan a half century of equal protection jurisprudence and set back the \nlong struggle for equality.\n  Justice Stevens wrote in dissent that the Chief Justice's opinion \ntwisted Brown v. Board in a ``cruelly ironic'' way. Most Americans \nrecognize that there is a crucial difference between a community that \ndoes its best to ensure that its schools include children of all races, \nand one that prevents children of some races from attending certain \nschools. Experience in the real world tells us that. Justice Breyer's \ndissent criticized the Chief Justice's opinion as applying an ``overly \ntheoretical approach to case law, an approach that emphasizes \nrigid distinctions . . . in a way that serves to mask the radical \nnature of today's decision. Law is not an exercise in mathematical \nlogic.''\n\n  Chief Justice Warren, a Justice who came to the Supreme Court with \nreal world experience as a State attorney general and Governor, \nrecognized the power of a unanimous decision in Brown v. Board. The \nRoberts Court, in its narrow desegregation decision 2 years ago, \nignored the real world experience of millions of Americans, and showed \nthat it would depart from even the most hallowed precedents of the \nSupreme Court.\n  Considering how the law matters to people is a lesson that Elena \nKagan learned early in her legal career when she clerked for Justice \nThurgood Marshall. In her 1993 remarks upon the death of Justice \nMarshall, she observed: ``Above all, he had the great lawyer's talent . \n. . for pinpointing a case's critical fact or core issue. That trait, I \nthink, resulted from his understanding of the pragmatic--of the way in \nwhich the law acted on people's lives.''\n  If confirmed, Elena Kagan will be the third member of the current \nSupreme Court to have had experience working in all three branches of \nthe government prior to being nominated. Some criticize her work during \nthe Clinton administration as political. I suggest that a fair reading \nof her papers indicates that she has the ability to take many factors \ninto account in analyzing legal problems and that her skills include \npracticality, principle, and pragmatism. These were all used in their \nservice to the American people by Justice O'Connor, Justice Souter, and \nJustice Stevens--each one nominated by a Republican President, each one \nbeing Justices I voted for. There is more to serving the country as a \nSupreme Court Justice.\n  I reject the ideological litmus test that Senate Republicans would \napply to Supreme Court nominees. Unlike those on the right who drove \nPresident Bush to withdraw his nomination of Harriet Miers and those \nwho opposed Justice Sotomayor, I do not require every Supreme Court \nnominee to swear fealty to the judicial approach and outcomes ordained \nby adhering to the narrow views of Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas. I \nexpect judges and Justices to faithfully interpret the Constitution and \napply the law, and also to look to the legislative intent of our laws \nand to consider the consequences of their decisions. I hope that judges \nand Justices will respect the will of the people, as reflected in the \nactions of their democratically elected representatives in Congress, \nand serve as a check on an overreaching Executive.\n  It seems some want the assurance that a nominee to the Supreme Court \nwill rule the way they want, so they will get the end results they want \nin cases before the Supreme Court. Lack of such assurances was why they \nvetoed President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers, only the third \nwoman to be nominated to the Supreme Court, and the only one not to be \nconfirmed. They forced Ms. Miers to withdraw even while Democrats were \npreparing to proceed with her hearing. They do not want an independent \njudiciary. They demand Justices who will guarantee the results they \nwant. That is their ideological litmus test. As critics level \ncomplaints against Elena Kagan, I suspect the real basis of that \ndiscontent is that the nominee will not guarantee a desired litigation \noutcome. That is not what I want. I want an independent judiciary. I do \nnot want a\n\n[[Page S6712]]\n\njudiciary that will tell me way in advance exactly how they will rule. \nI want them independent.\n  Of course, that is not judging. That is not even umpiring. That is \nfixing the game, and that is wrong. It is conservative activism plain \nand simple. It is only recently that some Republican Senators conceded \nthat judicial philosophy matters. I hope this means that they will \nabandon the false premise that all a Justice does is mechanically apply \nobvious legal dictates to reach preordained outcomes. Solicitor General \nKagan was right to reject that as ``robotic.''\n  It is the kind of conservative activism we saw when the Supreme Court \nin the Ledbetter case disregarded the plain language and purpose of \ntitle VII. It is the kind of activism we saw when, this past January, a \nconservative activist majority turned its back on the Supreme Court's \nown precedents, the considered judgment of Congress, the interests of \nthe American people and our long history of limiting corporate \ninfluence in elections in their Citizens United decision.\n  We can do better than that. In fact, we always have done better than \nthat. In reality, we can expect Justices who are committed to doing the \nhard work of judging required of the Supreme Court. In practice, this \nmeans we want Justices who pay close attention to the facts in every \ncase that comes before them, to the arguments on both sides, to the \nparticular language and purposes of the statutes they are charged with \ninterpreting, to their own precedents, and to the traditions and \nlongstanding historical practices of this Nation.\n  Applying these factors would reflect an appreciation for the real \nworld ramifications of their decisions. Judging is not just textual and \nit is not just automatic. If it were, we could have a computer do the \njudging. If it were, important decisions would not be made 5 to 4. A \nSupreme Court Justice is required to exercise judgment but should \nappreciate the proper role of the courts in our democracy.\n  The resilience of the Constitution is that its great concepts, these \nwonderful phrases in the Constitution, are not self-executing. There \nare constitutional values that need to be applied. Cases often involve \ncompeting constitutional values. So when the hard cases come before the \nCourt in the real world, we want--and we actually need--Justices who \nhave the good sense to appreciate the significance of the facts of the \ncase in front of them as well as the ramifications of their decisions \nin human and institutional terms.\n  I expect in close cases that hard-working and honest Justices will \nsometimes disagree about results. I don't expect to agree with every \ndecision of every Justice. I understand that. I support judicial \nindependence. I noted I voted for Justice Stevens and Justice O'Connor \nand Justice Souter, who were all nominees of Republican Presidents. I \nknew I would not agree with all of their decisions but I respected \ntheir approach to the law and their independence.\n  A few days before Independence Day, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwas able to complete its hearing on the nomination of Elena Kagan to be \nan Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. After \nopening statements on Monday afternoon, June 28, we were able to \ncomplete the questioning of the nominee on Tuesday, June 29, and \nWednesday, June 30. We proceeded for 10 hours on Tuesday, and were able \nto complete most of the first round. We returned on Wednesday to \ncomplete the remainder of the first round, a second round, and a third \nround for those who requested additional time to question Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan. We also held the traditional closed session and held the \nhearing record open for members of the committee to submit additional \nquestions to Solicitor General Kagan.\n  Out of respect for the Senate observances honoring Senator Byrd, we \nreconvened at 4 p.m. on Thursday, July 1. We heard testimony from \nrepresentatives of the American Bar Association, and 14 members of the \npublic invited by the Republican minority and 10 invited by the \nmajority. I especially thank Senators Cardin, Kaufman, and Schumer for \nsharing the duty of chairing our proceedings on Thursday, which \nextended past 8 p.m., long after the last Senate vote of the week.\n  In my opening statement at the hearing, I urged the nominee to engage \nwith the Senators and she was, in fact, engaging. I also urged \nSolicitor General Kagan to answer our questions about her judicial \nphilosophy. I think that she was more responsive than other recent \nnominees, and that she provided more information than was shared at \nother Supreme Court hearings in which I have participated. Of course, \nsome of the questions attempted to solicit indications as to how she \nwould rule in cases likely to come before the Supreme Court. Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan appropriately avoided such attempts but displayed a keen \nunderstanding of the complex set of legal issues that come before our \nhighest Court.\n  I was disappointed that one line of attack against Elena Kagan was to \ndisparage Thurgood Marshall. I appreciated the statements of Senators \nCardin and Durbin in defense of this towering figure of American law. I \ncommend the columns written by Stephanie Jones, the daughter of Judge \nNathan Jones; Frank Rich; Dana Millbank; Margaret Carlson; Carol \nSteiker; and, of course, Thurgood Marshall, Jr. In addition, editorial \npages, blogs and reports rejected this ill-advised efforts. It is a \nstrength and a blessing that Elena Kagan clerked for Justice Thurgood \nMarshall.\n  I remember Justice Marshall. The caricature of him by some at the \nKagan confirmation hearing was wrong. Knowing him, I suspect that when \nhe told his clerks that his philosophy was to do the right thing and \nlet the law catch up, he was most likely referring to his precedent-\nsetting career as the leading advocate of the time and not strictly \ndefining a judicial philosophy or approach. To the contrary, in Elena \nKagan's tribute to Justice Marshall in 1993 in the Texas Law Review, \nshe recalled his commitment to the rule of law. She described, as did \nCarol Steiker in her column in The National Law Journal, how Justice \nMarshall's law clerks had tried to get him to rely on notions of \nfairness rather than the strict reading of the law to allow an appeal \nto proceed on a discrimination claim. She wrote that the 80-year-old \nJustice referred to his years trying civil rights cases and said: ``All \nyou could hope for was that a court would not rule against you for \nillegitimate reasons. You could not expect that a court would bend the \nrules in your favor. That is the rule of law.''\n  Just as Sir Thomas More reminded his son-in-law in that famous \npassage from ``A Man for All Seasons'' that the law is our protection, \nJustice Marshall reminded his clerks that the existence of rules and \nthe rule of law is the best protection for all, including the least \npowerful. Justice Thurgood Marshall was a man of the law in the highest \nsense. He understood the Constitution's promise of equality to his \ncore. He relied on the law and the American justice system to overcome \nracial discrimination.\n  So I was deeply disappointed to see the manner in which his legacy \nwas treated by some during the recent confirmation hearing and to read \nthat there are Republican Senators currently serving who recently said \nthat they would vote against Thurgood Marshall's confirmation to the \nSupreme Court. He was disparaged at his confirmation hearing to the \nSupreme Court. His confirmation to the United States Court of Appeals \nto the Second Circuit, to be Solicitor General, and to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt were delayed and made difficult at the time, but I had hoped and \nthought those dark days were behind us.\n  The attacks on Justice Marshall during Elena Kagan's confirmation \nhearing were particularly striking. On the first day of the hearings \nRepublican members of the Judiciary Committee mentioned Justice \nMarshall 35 times. They did not do so to praise him or his \ncontributions to America's historic effort to overcome racial \ndiscrimination. Rather, they pilloried him as if someone who functioned \noutside the mainstream of American constitutional law. In fact, he did \nas much as any American in the last century to make sure America lived \nup to its promise. He moved America forward, toward a more perfect \nunion. On that day, however, they were trying to penalize Elena Kagan \nbecause as a young lawyer she clerked for him on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n\n[[Page S6713]]\n\n  Two current Justices also clerked for Supreme Court Justices--Chief \nJustice John Roberts and Justice Stephen Breyer. That Chief Justice \nRoberts clerked for then-Justice Rehnquist was viewed by Republicans as \na credential and a positive just a few years ago. Judge Douglas \nGinsburg of the DC Circuit and Judge Ralph Winter of the Second Circuit \neach clerked for Justice Marshall as young lawyers. They were not \ncriticized during their confirmation hearings for having done so; far \nfrom it.\n\n  Thurgood Marshall was perhaps the most influential lawyer of the 20th \ncentury. He dedicated his life to the rule of law. He, and the \ndedicated and talented team of lawyers with whom he worked at the \nNAACP, did not engage in violent protests but sought to ensure the full \nequality of all Americans by appeal to American justice and our \nConstitution. They brilliantly and courageously argued their claims on \nbehalf of their clients. They bettered America's soul. Beginning in the \nlate 1930s, their cases eventually led to the overturning of the \nmisguided 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson and the dismantling of \nState-mandated segregation of the races in public facilities. When the \nSupreme Court unanimously agreed with Thurgood Marshall's argument in \nthe landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education that State-mandated \nsegregation of the races in public school violated the Constitution, it \nwas vindication of the rule of law. Brown was one of the 29 cases that \nThurgood Marshall won out of the 32 cases that he argued as a Supreme \nCourt advocate. Justice Marshall's record of advocacy before the \nSupreme is unsurpassed and not likely to ever be matched.\n  Thurgood Marshall's life was lived in the law, not outside it. As a \nJustice, he was the embodiment of what the rule of law can achieve. He \nwas a giant in the law. For good and enduring reason, Thurgood Marshall \nis a hero not just to Solicitor General Kagan, but to countless \nAmerican lawyers, judges, Presidents, and hardworking Americans. He \nshould be a hero to us all.\n  I am concerned that the younger Americans who waited in line to \nattend our confirmation hearings or who tuned in to watch them may not \nunderstand what the mischaracterization of Justice Marshall by some at \nour hearing how important it was four decades ago for President Lyndon \nJohnson to nominate then-Solicitor General Marshall, to the Supreme \nCourt. As President Johnson said at the time, ``He is the best \nqualified by training and by valuable service to the country. I believe \nit is the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right \nplace.''\n  Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas, \nall Republican appointees, have acknowledged Justice Marshall's \ngreatness as a lawyer and judge. Shortly after Justice Marshall's \npassing, Justice O'Connor, who had served on the Court with him, wrote:\n\n       His was the eye of a lawyer who had seen the deepest wounds \n     in the social fabric and used law to help heal them. His was \n     the ear of the counselor who understood the vulnerabilities \n     of the accused and established safeguards for their \n     protection. His was the mouth of a man who knew the anguish \n     of the silenced and gave them voice.\n\n  Justice Scalia remarked that Justice Marshall ``could be . . . a \npersuasive force just sitting there. . . . He was always in the \nconference a visible representation of a past that we wanted to get \naway from and you knew that, as a private lawyer, he had done so much \nto undo racism or at least its manifestation in and through \ngovernment.'' During his own confirmation proceedings, Justice Thomas \npraised Justice Marshall, as ``one of the greatest architects of the \nlegal battles to open doors that seemed so hopelessly and permanently \nsealed and to knock down barriers that seemed so insurmountable to \nthose of us in Pin Point, Georgia.'' These Justices recognize and \nrespect Justice Thurgood Marshall and his enduring impact on American \nlaw. He made this a stronger and more inclusive Nation.\n  At least two Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nrecently said that they are not sure whether, if given the chance, they \nwould vote to confirm Thurgood Marshall as a Justice on the Supreme \nCourt. Though he had to face humiliating questioning during his own \nconfirmation hearings for the Court, he was confirmed by a vote of 69 \nto 11 in 1967. I would have hoped that as a nation we would have \nprogressed to acknowledge Thurgood Marshall's fitness to serve on the \nSupreme Court but I am sad to acknowledge that is not so. If there are \nRepublicans who would now vote against the nomination of Thurgood \nMarshall to the Supreme Court, it is a sign of just how far the former \nparty of Lincoln has changed and just how much some would like to undo \nthe progress made over the last century.\n  We 100 men and women in this body are the ones who are charged with \ngiving our advice and consent on Supreme Court nominations. We 100 \nstand in the shoes of 300 million Americans, and we should consider \nwhether those nominees have the skills and the temperament and the good \nsense to independently assess in every case the significance of the \nfacts and how the law applies to those facts. I believe Elena Kagan \ndoes meet that test.\n  The more judges appreciate the real world impact their decisions have \non hard-working Americans, I believe the more confidence the American \npeople have in their courts, and I think it is important for the \nAmerican people in a democracy to have confidence in their courts. I \nhave been in the Senate now with seven Presidents. I have urged \nPresidents, both Democratic and Republican, to nominate people from \noutside the judicial monastery because I think real world experience is \nhelpful to the process. The American people live not in an abstract \nivory tower world but a real world with great challenges.\n  We have a guiding charter that provides all Americans great promise. \nThe Supreme Court functions in the real world that affects all \nAmericans. Judicial nominees need to appreciate that simple, undeniable \nfact, and they must promise to uphold the law that Americans rely on \nevery day for their continued safety and prosperity.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nReed, on the Senate floor, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are debating the President's nomination \nto succeed Justice John Paul Stevens, who has served this country \nadmirably and with great distinction. I rise in wholehearted support of \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan's nomination to be our next Supreme Court \nJustice. She has had an illustrious legal career that includes clerking \nfor Judge Abner Mikva on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit \nand Justice Thurgood Marshall on the U.S. Supreme Court; obtaining \ntenure at two of the top law schools in the country, the University of \nChicago and Harvard; serving as an associate counsel in the Clinton \nadministration; becoming Dean of Harvard Law School; and now serving as \nSolicitor General of the United States. Casting a vote on a nominee to \nthe Supreme Court is one of the most consequential votes we face as \nSenators because no court can review the decisions of the Supreme \nCourt. They are the ultimate arbiters of the law and the Constitution \nin this country.\n  The Constitution includes the Senate as an active partner, along with \nthe President, in this process of confirming Justices to the Supreme \nCourt. As stated in article II, section 2, clause 2 of the \nConstitution, nominees to the Supreme Court shall only be confirmed \n``by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.'' This confirmation \nprocess and the Senate's role in it serves as a vital democratic check \non America's judiciary, particularly in a case where a Supreme Court \nJustice will serve for a life term.\n  Indeed, one of the Senate's greatest opportunities and \nresponsibilities to support and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates is achieved through upholding our duty as Senators to give \nadvice and consent on the nominations of the President to the Federal \nbench.\n  As I have stated before, my test for a nominee is simple and is drawn \nfrom the text, the history, and the principles of the Constitution. A \nnominee's intellectual gifts, experience, judgment, maturity, and \ntemperament are all important, but these alone are not enough. I need \nto be convinced that a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court will live up \nto both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution. The nominee \nneeds to be committed not only to enforcing laws, but also to doing \njustice.\n\n[[Page S6714]]\n\nThe nominee needs to be able to make the principles of the Constitution \ncome alive--equality before the law, due process, full and equal \nparticipation in the civic and social life of America for all \nAmericans; freedom of conscience, individual responsibility, and the \nexpansion of opportunity. The nominee also needs to see the unique role \nthe Court plays in helping balance the often conflicting forces in a \ndemocracy between individual autonomy and the obligations of community, \nbetween the will of the majority and the rights of the minority. A \nnominee for the Supreme Court needs to be able to look forward to the \nfuture not just backwards. The nominee needs to make the Constitution \nresonate in a world that is changing with great rapidity.\n  Elena Kagan passes this test. She is extraordinarily qualified on the \nbasis of her intellectual gifts. But what is most striking about \nSolicitor General Kagan, in both her academic work and her life work, \nis her commitment to the Constitution.\n  In a speech she gave in October 2007 at my alma mater, West Point, \nwell before she was considered for Solicitor General or for the Supreme \nCourt, she stated that our Nation is most extraordinary because we, in \nher words, ``live in a government of laws, not of men or women.'' She \nused as a touchstone for her speech a place on the West Point campus \ncalled Constitution Corner, which was a gift from the West Point class \nof 1943, who not only served our Nation but defended the Constitution \nthrough the rigors of World War II and beyond.\n  There are five plaques at this sight. One of the plaques is titled \n``Loyalty to the Constitution,'' one of the principal tenets by which \nevery professional soldier must abide. It basically states what those \nwho serve in the military are keenly aware of and points to the fact \nthat the United States broke with an ancient tradition when it was \ncreated. Instead of swearing loyalty to a military leader, the American \nmilitary swears loyalty to the Constitution. Interestingly enough, \nalthough Elena Kagan never wore the uniform of the United States, she \nhas demonstrated this same loyalty to the Constitution throughout her \nlife.\n  I am confident she will continue to uphold and defend our \nConstitution as she assumes her next role as a Justice of the Supreme \nCourt. During her confirmation hearings, on the role of a judge, she \nsaid:\n\n       As a judge, you are on nobody's team. As a judge, you are \n     an independent actor, and your job is simply to evaluate the \n     law and evaluate the facts and apply one to the other as \n     best, as prudently and wisely as you can. You know, the \n     greatness of our judicial system lies in its independence, \n     and that means when you are on the bench, when you put on the \n     robe, your only master is the rule of law.\n\n  Supreme Court Justices matter, and their impact on the lives of \nAmericans from all walks of life can be profound. We only need to look \nat a couple of the recent Supreme Court decisions to understand how \nprofound that impact can be.\n  More than four decades ago, Congress passed laws to protect women and \nothers against workplace discrimination. However, five Justices in the \ncase of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire gave immunity to employers who \nsecretly discriminate against their workers. Thankfully, we passed the \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which I cosponsored and President \nObama signed into law, to ensure equal pay for equal work and to \neffectively and properly overturn this immunity granted by these five \nJustices.\n  This year, five Justices in Citizens United v. Federal Election \nCommission favored big corporations by ignoring precedent to bestow \nupon corporations the same power as any individual citizen to influence \nelections--in fact, some might argue much greater power through much \ngreater spending. In his dissent, Justice Stevens, who is retiring and \nwho will, I hope, be replaced by Solicitor General Elena Kagan, warned \nthat the ``Court's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of \nelected institutions across the Nation. The path it has taken to reach \nits outcome will, I fear, do damage to this institution.''\n  On this point, the words of Lilly Ledbetter are particularly \nrelevant. The plaintiff in the famous case said:\n\n       We need Justices who understand that law must serve regular \n     people who are just trying to work hard, do right, and make a \n     good life for their families . . . This isn't a game. Real \n     people's lives are at stake. We need Supreme Court Justices \n     who understand that.\n\n  Elena Kagan understands this point, and she will bring this \nunderstanding to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In addition, I am confident that Solicitor General Kagan's tenure as \nDean of Harvard Law School will serve her well as she works with her \ncolleagues on the Court. As Dean, she drew acclaim as a pragmatic \nproblem solver who could bridge ideological divides among the faculty. \nIndeed, her success in leading and bringing together one of the most \ncontentious legal faculties in the Nation is a testament to her \ninterpersonal, oratory, and analytical skills--all of her skills. As \nsomeone who had the privilege of graduating from Harvard Law School, I \ncan indeed confirm that it is one of the most intellectually \ncontentious places in the country, as it should be, because it is there \nwhere the ideas of law, of Constitution, and of our relationships with \none another in this democracy, are vigorously debated.\n  The fact that she has garnered wide bipartisan support is further \nevidence of her great standing. She has received the endorsement of \neight former Solicitors General from both parties, including Ken Starr \nand Ted Olson; 54 former Deputy and Assistant Solicitors General of \nboth parties; 69 law school deans; and more than 850 law school \nprofessors from across the country and across the political spectrum.\n  Just to give an example of how well regarded she is, here is what \nProfessor Jack Goldsmith, former Assistant Attorney General during the \nGeorge W. Bush administration, had to say:\n\n       [Elena] Kagan possesses an extraordinary knowledge of the \n     legal issues before the Supreme Court. Whatever else may be \n     said about being a law professor, it is the profession that \n     requires one to know legal subjects comprehensively enough to \n     teach them . . . What I do know is that Kagan will be open-\n     minded and tough minded; that she will treat all advocates \n     fairly and will press them all about the weak points in their \n     arguments; that she will be independent and highly \n     analytical; and that she will seek to render decisions that \n     reflect fidelity to the Constitution and the laws.\n\n  Clearly, she is not only well qualified, but she also has wide \nbipartisan support.\n  Before I conclude, I wish to make one final point regarding Elena \nKagan's respect and admiration for the military. She has won praise \nfrom students who have served our country in uniform for creating a \nhighly supportive environment for students who served in the Armed \nForces of the United States and who were attending Harvard Law School. \nIn my view, her respect and admiration for the military is sincere and \nproven.\n  America's courtrooms are staffed with judges not machines because \njustice requires human judgments. This is particularly so on the \nSupreme Court. Of all the hundreds of thousands of cases filed in \nAmerican Federal courts each year, only a small percentage reach the \nSupreme Court. These are the hardest of cases--cases that have divided \nthe country's lower courts. These are cases where one constitutional \nclause may be in conflict with another, where one statute may influence \nthe interpretation of another, and where one core national value may \ninterfere with another. These cases often divide the Justices of the \nCourt by close margins.\n\n  Surely, the Justices on both sides of a 5-to-4 case can claim to be \nfollowing the judicial process and respecting the precedents of the \nCourt. What divides their opinions is the set of constitutional values \nthey bring to the case. Elena Kagan, in my view, brings the set of \nconstitutional values that, to quote the words of Lilly Ledbetter \nagain, will make her a Supreme Court Justice ``who understand[s] that \nlaw must serve regular people who are just trying to work hard, do \nright, and make a good life for their families.'' As Elena Kagan \nherself put it, she will do her ``best to consider every case \nimpartially, modestly, with commitment to principle and in accordance \nwith the law.''\n  It is with great pleasure that I support the nomination of Elena \nKagan to the highest Court in the land, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Solicitor \nGeneral Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n\n[[Page S6715]]\n\n  I am confident that Solicitor General Kagan is highly qualified for \nthis prestigious position. She has worked hard and earned a place at \nthe top of the legal profession.\n  During her career, she has held various positions across the Federal \nGovernment that have prepared her well for this new position.\n  As Solicitor General since 2009, she worked on many issues currently \nbefore the Court.\n  She has argued a broad range of issues--from defending Congress's \nability to protect kids from child predators--to the United States' \nability to go after those supporting terrorist organizations.\n  Through several different assignments in the Clinton White House, \nElena Kagan worked for the President on the challenges facing our \nNation.\n  She also has experience in the judicial branch, including clerkships \nin the U.S. Supreme Court as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDC Circuit.\n  Solicitor General Kagan also spent many years as a professor of law \nat the University of Chicago Law School and Harvard Law School.\n  As dean of Harvard Law School, she worked with the student body to \nimprove the quality of student life and encourage a spirit of public \nservice.\n  She also worked as a lawyer in private practice. In all, she has \nspent years studying complex legal theories and debating issues.\n  Some of the most difficult issues end up at the Supreme Court and \neach Justice needs a thorough understanding of the law.\n  Elena Kagan has demonstrated her knowledge of the law and I believe \nshe will be a successful jurist.\n  Her nomination to our Nation's Highest Court is something our entire \ncountry can be proud of.\n  In recent years, we have taken many positive steps to make our \ngovernment a better reflection of the American people.\n  Solicitor General Kagan's confirmation as associate justice will \ncontinue that progress and mark the first time the U.S. will have three \nwomen on the Supreme Court at the same time. This is a wonderful \nmilestone for our country.\n  I was very impressed with Elena Kagan when we met earlier this year.\n  We talked about Hawaii and the importance of reconciliation with \nNative Hawaiians.\n  I was impressed with her history of building consensus and bringing \npeople together--as well as her knowledge of the law. I know that she \nwill do a tremendous job upholding our Constitution as an Associate \nJustice on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  After receiving many letters of support for Solicitor General Kagan's \nnomination--and seeing for myself her character, her intelligence, and \nher legal expertise--I am pleased to support her nomination--and urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest called the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Authorizing Settlement Funding\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today, as this Chamber debates the \nnomination of Elena Kagan--someone I am looking forward to supporting \nwhen we vote--to raise another issue of ensuring justice in our \ncountry, an issue the Presiding Officer, I know, has been concerned \nabout as well, and that is urging this Chamber to take action and \napprove funding for the settlement of racial discrimination claims made \nby thousands of African-American farmers.\n  This is an issue with which I have dealt for years, first as Governor \nof Virginia, now as a Senator. This issue was first brought to my \nattention by John Boyd, who is a fourth generation African-American \nfarmer from Southside, VA. He founded the National Black Farmers \nAssociation in 1995.\n  He and a group of other African-American farmers brought forward a \nseries of claims that were finally addressed in a lawsuit named Pigford \nv. Glickman. That lawsuit concerned allegations that the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture had denied farm loans and other services to \nAfrican-American farmers between 1983 and 1997, although I think \nhistory will show those acts of discrimination long preceded 1983.\n  That case was settled in 1999. But due to very tight deadlines, \nthousands of farmers missed the deadline to file their complaints.\n  An estimated 74,000 Black farmers now await approval of funding by \nthis body, following the announcement of a settlement of these \nadditional claims by the USDA in February of this year. The USDA has \nacknowledged these claims. They have agreed to a settlement. These \nfunds have been appropriated. This funding has been paid for.\n  According to Mr. Boyd, this effort, if we can get this funding \napproved, will mark the seventh time the Senate has tried to act on \nproviding the Black farmers settlement money.\n  I have to say that as we debate the nomination of a very talented \nindividual to serve on the Supreme Court and we hear folks on both \nsides of the aisle talk about American justice and American \njurisprudence, it is a varnish on that record and, to a certain degree, \non this body that we in the Senate have not acted to make sure that \nclose to $1 billion in these settlement claims--again, that have been \nauthorized by USDA--that those funds are not fully appropriated and \napproved by this Senate body for these farmers, many of whom have been \nstruggling for decades, some who struggle due to the discrimination \nthat has been acknowledged by our own Department of Agriculture. We \nhave not acted. Senate procedure has gotten in the way of authorizing \npayment of these funds.\n  Now it is the time to act. This week the Senate has the opportunity \nto finally authorize funding of the settlement costs and turn the page \non past discriminatory practices.\n  As I stated earlier, this legislation is fully paid for and there \ndoes not appear to be any substantive opposition to honoring the terms \nof this settlement.\n  I know we are all anxious to vote on Elena Kagan. I know many of us \nare anxious to vote on the small business legislation. I know we are \nall anxious, as well, for the August recess to start. As we go through \nthis process on a matter that reflects on the integrity of this body, \nreflects on the value of our jurisprudence system, as we think through \ntrying to get out of town and getting home, I hope our leaders can come \ntogether and act to make sure that these Black farmers, many times \nwaiting literally for decades for the appropriate compensation that \neveryone throughout the judicial system has said is owed to them, that \nin this rush to get out and get back home, the Senate can finally take \naction in the Pigford case and these farmers can receive their \nappropriate compensation.\n  I again thank those involved in this action. I particularly thank Mr. \nJohn Boyd, as I mentioned, from Southside, VA, who has been a \npassionate and tireless leader on this issue for more than two decades.\n  I see my good friend, the Senator from Delaware, is here to speak on \nbehalf of Elena Kagan. I know he and the Presiding Officer have also \nraised this issue making sure these Black farmers get--not their day in \ncourt; they have had their day in court, but they are waiting for the \nSenate to act on a noncontroversial issue so they can receive the \nfunding that is long overdue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nthe Senator from Virginia. He is right on point. This is not about a \ntrial. This is about people getting what they justly deserve. It is \ntime we do it. I thank him for coming to the floor and making that \nargument.\n  I wish to speak tonight in support of the nomination of Solicitor \nGeneral Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court.\n  On July 13, I first came to the floor and gave my reasons for \nsupporting this outstanding nominee. She has a superior intellect, \nbroad experience, superb judgment, and unquestioned integrity. \nThroughout her career, she has\n\n[[Page S6716]]\n\nconsistently demonstrated a first-rate intellect and an intensely \npragmatic approach to identifying and solving problems--two traits that \nare indispensable in any great judge, and she will be a great judge. I \nsupport her nomination with enthusiasm and without reservation.\n  I am here today not to repeat the basis for my support but to note \nbriefly two aspects of this debate that I find particularly troubling.\n  First, I have heard some of my colleagues attack this nominee based \non arguments she made and positions she took in her role as Solicitor \nGeneral in a particular case when she made this argument on behalf of \nher client, the United States of America. That causes me great concern \nbecause I think these kinds of attacks--think about it for a minute \nnow. She is not in a public forum. She is not giving a speech. She is \nnot writing an article. What she is basically doing in court is \nrepresenting the United States of America, making the argument that she \nthinks is the best argument to carry for the United States of America. \nAnd people pull that out on the Senate floor and read it and are \ncritical of it.\n  I can understand why one disagrees with the Solicitor General on an \nargument they make. I can understand why one disagrees with the Supreme \nCourt. But to pull that out and use that against a nominee is very \ntroubling because it gets to the basic question of what is the job of a \nlitigator, of a lawyer, of a solicitor in making the argument for their \nclient.\n  Solicitors General are responsible for representing the United States \nbefore the Supreme Court. They should be free to make all appropriate \narguments on their client's behalf without fear that those arguments \nmight someday be held against them if they happen to be considered for \nanother office.\n  The Solicitor General's role in selecting cases in which she must \nrepresent the government is very limited, particularly in the many \ncases in which the government is the respondent. We want lawyers \nrepresenting the United States in any court to do so zealously, well \nwithin the bounds of the law. We should not give them reason to \nhesitate about doing so by later treating those arguments as reflecting \ntheir own personal, private beliefs, which they do not do.\n  I am reminded of the attacks we too often see on lawyers who \nrepresent unpopular clients, with the suggestion being that the \nlawyer's legal arguments must also reflect that lawyer's personal \nviews. Think about that. A lawyer gets on a case, a lawyer is doing pro \nbono work, a lawyer has been assigned by a judge and makes an argument \nin court for their client, trying to get their client cleared, and we \nbring it back as if the lawyer is making that argument about \nthemselves. I have heard it too often on this floor and in committee.\n  Let's not forget that the American tradition of representing \nunpopular clients is older than our Nation, dating at least as far back \nas John Adams' representation of British soldiers charged in the Boston \nMassacre. John Adams defended the British soldiers involved in the \nBoston Massacre. Would it be fair to bring that up on the floor of this \nbody to say that he was in favor of the British soldiers and use that \nagainst him if, in fact, he had been nominated to a position?\n  The vigorous defense of the United States requires that we not limit \nits advocates to making only those legal arguments with which they \npersonally agree. I am surprised I even have to make that statement on \nthe floor.\n  More broadly, our adversarial system depends on advocates making all \nproper arguments that are in the interest of their clients. I feel as \nthough I am in a lawyer 101 class. Why do I have to be saying this? It \nis simply wrong to assume a lawyer's arguments reflect his or her \npersonal convictions. Again, lawyer 101. It is, therefore, also wrong \nto oppose a nominee based upon proper arguments that a nominee has made \nas a lawyer, regardless of whether an individual Senator regards those \narguments to be legally correct.\n  My second concern relates to the repeated and unjustified comments by \nmany of my colleagues regarding the word ``empathy,'' which they seem \nto regard as a trait deserving of recrimination. Empathy, empathy, \nempathy.\n  I commend to my colleagues a superb commentary on this point by Joel \nGoldstein, distributed by the History News Network. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have this commentary printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From History News Service]\n\n             How Empathy Makes Superior Judges--and Justice\n\n       Critics ridiculed President Obama's statement that judges \n     should be empathetic. But as the Senate prepares to vote on \n     the Supreme Court nomination of Elena Kagan, legal historian \n     Joel Goldstein argues that senators should be looking for \n     that very quality.\n       In voting on President Obama's nomination of Elena Kagan \n     for the Supreme Court this week, senators should consider her \n     legal ability and constitutional vision, but also her \n     capacity to be an empathetic justice.\n       Republicans mocked President Obama when he suggested that \n     empathy was an important ingredient in a justice. In fact, \n     the president was simply repeating the insight Theodore \n     Roosevelt uttered more than a century ago when he explained \n     to his close friend, Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge, why he was \n     inclined to nominate Judge Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. to the \n     Supreme Court.\n       T.R. recognized that those who become judges invariably \n     have had close association with wealthy and powerful people. \n     Those relationships dispose them to understand perspectives \n     of the successful classes. But would they give a fair shake \n     to the less fortunate who were outside the professional or \n     social circles that shaped and reflected their attitudes?\n       Roosevelt thought it ``eminently desirable'' that the \n     Supreme Court show its ``entire sympathy with all proper \n     effort to secure the most favorable personal consideration \n     for the men who most need that consideration.'' He \n     appreciated Holmes, who could ``preserve his aloofness of \n     mind so as to keep his broad humanity of feeling and \n     his sympathy for the class from which he has not drawn his \n     clients.''\n       If anything, Obama's comment was more neutral than \n     Roosevelt's. Roosevelt twice used ``sympathy'' which connotes \n     identification with, or bias toward, another. ``Empathy,'' \n     Obama's misconstrued word, simply implies an understanding \n     of, and sensitivity to, the feelings or experiences of \n     another, not any predisposition in favor.\n       In context Roosevelt and Obama were making the same point, \n     that effective judging requires sensitivity to a wide range \n     of experiences. It is relatively easy for judges, like other \n     human beings, to relate to experiences and perspectives they \n     have shared. What's difficult, for judges and for the rest of \n     us, is to comprehend those to which we have not been exposed.\n       That reality sometimes inclines judges to favor those whose \n     positions and circumstances are familiar. The bias may be \n     unconscious but that does not make it any less real or \n     decisive or unfair.\n       The Republican Roosevelt and the Democratic Obama \n     recognized that empathy was an important corrective to these \n     hidden preferences. Far from conferring favoritism or setting \n     law aside, as Obama's critics contend, T.R. and Obama \n     understood that empathy is often a prerequisite for \n     impartiality.\n       Justice Holmes's great colleague, Justice Louis D. \n     Brandeis, captured the Roosevelt-Obama insight when he wrote \n     that ``knowledge is essential to understanding, and \n     understanding should precede judging.'' A judge cannot fairly \n     assess something he or she does not understand and they \n     cannot understand that which is unfamiliar if they do not \n     make a real effort to relate to it.\n       Whether Kagan is empathetic may determine how she will act \n     when the court faces the watershed cases that often define \n     the jurisprudence of a generation.\n       The quality of empathy, which Obama's critics ridicule, was \n     critical in decisions which all now celebrate. Brown v. Board \n     of Education declared racially segregated education a \n     violation of the Equal Protection Clause because it created \n     in African-American children a ``feeling of inferiority as to \n     their status in the community that may affect their hearts \n     and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.'' By viewing \n     the world from the perspective of black children, the court \n     identified the moral wrong in segregation even while some \n     strict constructionists saw the decision as lawless.\n       And imagine the national embarrassment America would have \n     been spared in Korematsu v. United States, the case that \n     sanctioned internment of loyal American citizens of Japanese \n     descent during World War II, had the court followed Justice \n     Robert Jackson's empathetic dissent, which, unlike the \n     majority opinion, tried to understand the impact of imposing \n     a racially motivated penalty on innocent Americans.\n       Although Roosevelt was a great Republican president of the \n     20th century and a hero to modern Republican luminaries such \n     as George W. Bush, John McCain, Karl Rove and others, the \n     idea's pedigree has not protected Obama from partisan \n     caricature of his commonsense observation.\n       That's too bad. It has led some to distort as inconsistent \n     with impartiality a quality that is really designed to help \n     achieve it.\n       To their credit, Theodore Roosevelt and Obama recognized \n     that a judge must make special efforts to understand the \n     thoughts and perspectives of those whose experiences\n\n[[Page S6717]]\n\n     she has not shared. It's time for Obama's critics to stop \n     distorting his statement and pretending that this sensible \n     insight is subversive to the law or judging.\n       Let's hope that senators of both parties include this \n     bipartisan criterion as a desirable trait in a justice when \n     they debate and vote on the Kagan nomination this week.\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, as Professor Goldstein points out, \nPresident Obama's interest in empathy in Supreme Court nominees follows \nin the path of President Theodore Roosevelt who chose to nominate \nOliver Wendell Holmes in 1902 based in part on Holmes' capacity for \nempathy.\n  Roosevelt said it was ``eminently desirable'' that the Supreme Court \nmake ``all proper effort to secure the most favorable personal \nconsideration for the man who most needs that consideration.''\n  I can understand concern about sympathy. I do not have it, but I \nunderstand sympathy. But empathy? President Theodore Roosevelt was not \nsuggesting that Justices should somehow favor or advantage the \ndowntrodden; that is not what he was saying and that is not what \nPresident Obama was saying when he was a Senator, only that they make \nevery effort to understand the position of the litigants from walks of \nlife different from their own.\n  Likewise, President Obama's promotion of empathy is not, as his \ncritics suggest, the advocacy of bias. ``Empathy,'' as a quick look at \nthe dictionary will confirm, is not the same as ``sympathy.'' \n``Empathy'' means understanding the experiences of another, not \nidentification with or bias toward another. Let me repeat that. \n``Empathy'' means understanding the experiences of another, not \nidentification with or bias toward another. Words have meanings, and we \nshould not make arguments that depend on misconstruing those meanings.\n  Let me quote several insightful paragraphs from Professor Goldstein's \narticle about why empathy is important in judging. I quote Professor \nGoldstein:\n\n       In context, Roosevelt and Obama were making the same point, \n     that effective judging requires sensitivity to a wide range \n     of experiences. It is relatively easy for judges, like other \n     human beings, to relate to the experiences and perspectives \n     they have shared.\n\n  All of us can do that. We can relate to the people we know around us. \nWe can relate to our experience. We can relate to people with whom we \nwent to school. We can relate to all those things.\n\n       What's difficult, for judges and the rest of us, is to \n     comprehend those to which we have not been exposed.\n       That reality sometimes inclines judges to favor those whose \n     positions and circumstances are familiar.\n\n  We all know that. There but for the grace of God go I, reasons why \njuries will let someone go free.\n\n       The bias may be unconscious but that does not make it any \n     less real or decisive or unfair.\n\n  To continue the quote:\n\n       The Republican Roosevelt and the Democratic Obama \n     recognized that empathy was an important corrective to these \n     hidden preferences. Far from conferring favoritism or setting \n     law aside, as Obama's critics contend, T.R. and Obama \n     understood that empathy is often a prerequisite for \n     impartiality.\n       The quality of empathy, which Obama's critics parody, was \n     critical in decisions which all now celebrate. Brown v. Board \n     of Education declared racially segregated education a \n     violation of the equal protection clause because it created \n     in African-American children a ``feeling of inferiority as to \n     their status in the community that may affect their hearts \n     and minds in a way unlikely to ever be undone.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour controlled by the majority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I thank the Chair.\n\n       By viewing the world from the perspective of black \n     children, the Court identified the wrong in segregation even \n     while some strict constructionists saw the decision as \n     lawless.\n\n  I happen to think Elena Kagan is an outstanding nominee. I respect \nthe fact that others disagree. I truly do. I hope that as this debate \ncontinues, we take care to make arguments that are fair expressions of \nour very real disagreements and avoid arguments that chill legitimate \nadvocacy or deliberately misconstrue the words of others.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am here to talk about the nominee, Ms. \nKagan, for the Supreme Court, but I thought I would put it in the \ncontext of how I view what we are doing.\n  As a physician, a father, and a grandfather taking a look at where we \nare as a nation, it is very worrisome to me. The 62 years I have lived \nhave been fraught with great opportunity, great challenges, but never \nwith a fear that what we have in this country may not last. I have to \nadmit to my colleagues that I have that fear now. And it is not an \nunfounded fear. You see, this year we will borrow almost $1.6 trillion \nfrom our grandchildren. We will borrow in excess of $4 billion a day--\nmoney we don't have. At this moment, we owe $13.35 trillion. No \nquestion, we are the biggest economy in the world, being fast caught by \nother large economies.\n  The uniqueness of the American experiment could have been predicted \nby those who studied republics because freedom and liberty were the \nbasis for such an explosion in growth and wealth and freedom and \nstandard of living. The poor in our country live far in excess of half \nof the world's populations because of the great republic we are.\n  I believe we have a short period of time to right the ship for our \ncountry. We have large disagreements in this body on how we do that, \nand others' ideas have as much value as mine. But it is not debatable \nthe kind of trouble we are in as a nation. It is indisputable. We have \na mountain of debt, and we are going to have interest costs that are \ngoing to chew up our freedom and chew up our children's prosperity and \nopportunity over the years that lie ahead of us.\n  So we have great responsibility as we place somebody on the Supreme \nCourt. Our constitutional responsibility is to advise and either give \nconsent or not give consent. I have no doubts that my speech on the \nfloor this afternoon will change any Senator's mind. It won't. But what \nI hope to do is to lay out the questions, as we put Ms. Kagan on the \nCourt, of where we will be with the basis of her philosophy. I have \nserved on the Judiciary Committee for almost 6 years. I have been \nthrough four Supreme Court Justice hearings. I have met with four--\nactually, more than four--prospective nominees to the Supreme Court, \nand the responsibility is heavy.\n  Elections do have consequences. They give the President of the United \nStates the right to appoint, with advice and consent, all the judges in \nthis country, as well as numerous other officials. But none is greater \nand none is more important than a Supreme Court Justice.\n  My concern with Ms. Kagan is whether she really believes in what our \nConstitution says, and by her own words she fails to meet that test. So \nI think it is time for an extra parameter to be considered in light of \nthe difficulties we face when we give consent for somebody who is going \nto be in a lifetime position who will, I believe, have negative \nconsequences for our future. And I am going to spell out why I believe \nthat.\n  Ms. Kagan is a highly qualified woman who has attained much in her \nyoung life. She is highly intelligent, highly articulate, and quite \npleasant. I believe she did the best job of at least letting us get to \nsee some of what she thinks of any of the Supreme Court nominees we \nhave heard, and I give her credit for that. But what I saw causes me to \nshake in my boots, and let me tell you why.\n  Ms. Kagan made two critical statements. She believes Supreme Court \nprecedent trumps the original intent of our Founders. Think about that \nfor a minute. We just heard the Senator from Delaware mention Brown v. \nBoard of Education. Under that philosophy, reaching back to our \nDeclaration of Independence and our Constitution, Brown v. Board of \nEducation would never have happened. We would have had ``separate but \nequal'' had we relied on Supreme Court precedent and not the underlying \nbody of our Constitution.\n  As I was reading recently, I came across something written by Calvin \nCoolidge. He is not very often quoted in this body, and for some of \nthat I understand why.\n  But one of the other things Nominee Kagan did was she refused to \nembrace natural rights in her testimony before the committee. You see, \nthe whole foundation for our country is based on the fact that the \nrights we have are not given to us by the Congress of the\n\n[[Page S6718]]\n\nUnited States or the Government of the United States or the \nConstitution of the United States; they are inherently ours. They are \ninalienable rights--the right of life, the right of liberty, the right \nto pursue happiness. We have a government to be a caretaker, to ensure \nour rights are not infringed upon. So lacking that understanding--and \nit wasn't just once that she was asked that; she was asked that in \nterms of Blackstone's principles on the right of an individual to \ndefend their life. She does not embrace that concept. It was not only \nevident in her plain words that she spoke but in her answers indirectly \nto other questions.\n  So we have a Supreme Court nominee who believes that the wisdom of \nmen today, outside of the Constitution, based on precedent, trumps the \nwisdom that was brought forth by our forefathers in both the \nDeclaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. \nAnd there are other proofs for this that I will go through during my \nspeech to explain.\n  Listen to what Calvin Coolidge had to say:\n\n       About the Declaration there is a finality that is \n     exceedingly restful. It is often asserted that the world has \n     made a great deal of progress since 1776; that we have had \n     new thoughts and new experiences which have given us a great \n     advance over the people of that day, and that we may \n     therefore very well discard their conclusions for something \n     more modern. But that reasoning cannot be applied to this \n     great charter.\n\n  Or the Constitution that followed it.\n\n       If all men are created equal, that is final.\n\n  It can't be improved upon. It can only be lessened.\n\n       If all men are endowed with inalienable rights, that is \n     final.\n\n  It cannot be improved upon. It can only be lessened.\n\n       If governments derive their just powers from the consent of \n     the governed, that is final.\n\n  The power of the U.S. Government comes from the power we loan to the \ngovernment as people and citizens of the United States.\n\n       No advance, no progress can be made beyond these \n     propositions. If anyone wishes to deny their truth or their \n     soundness, the only direction in which he can proceed \n     historically is not forward, but backward toward the time \n     when there was no equality, no rights of the individual, no \n     rule of the people. Those who wish to proceed in that \n     direction cannot lay claim to progress. They are reactionary. \n     Their ideas are not more modern, but more ancient, than those \n     of the Revolutionary fathers.\n\n  Well said, Calvin Coolidge. Well said.\n  So we have before us a judge who said the following to me during our \nhearing:\n\n       To be honest with you, I don't have a view of what are \n     natural rights, independent of the Constitution.\n\n  Oh, really? So we are going to have a Supreme Court Justice who has \nno view of what our inalienable rights are other than what the \nConstitution says? Where can that take us? It can take us anywhere she \nwants to go, outside the bounds of the very liberties we loan to the \ngovernment to have a civil society.\n  If you look at the Declaration of Independence, it says:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident--\n\n  Why aren't they self-evident to her? Why doesn't she hold an opinion \non them--\n\n     that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by \n     their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among \n     these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to \n     secure these rights, Governments are instituted among men \n     deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed . \n     . .\n\n  We have inalienable rights. We have natural rights. Yet we are about \nto put a Justice on the Supreme Court for life who, by her own words, \ndoes not have a view of what are natural rights. I don't know anybody \nwho is an adult in this country who doesn't have a view of what they \nthink are their natural rights.\n  This is a quote from Elena Kagan:\n\n       In some cases original intent is unlikely to solve the \n     question, and that might be because the original intent is \n     unknowable or might be because we live in a world that's very \n     different from the world in which the framers lived. In many \n     circumstances, precedent is the most important thing.\n\n  No, that is just the opposite of what Coolidge had to say about the \nDeclaration of Independence, just exactly the opposite. More modern, we \ngot it right. Natural rights do not matter. Our wisdom, our intellect, \nour arrogance--of a government and the governing body--has more import, \nhas more value, has more to do with what we do today than the wisdom of \nthose inalienable rights and the Constitution that came out of it.\n  Do you realize that in the Constitution, for every time it gives us a \nresponsibility, it says four or five times what we can't do? Because \nthe Framers were interested, and knowing the condition of men, that we \nwould abandon--our tendency would be to allow the concentration of \npower to abandon those very principles they put into the Constitution.\n  What did Madison have to say, just on the general welfare clause of \nthe Constitution? He anticipated the Elena Kagans of this world. He \nsaid:\n\n       With respect to the words general welfare, I have always \n     regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers connected \n     with them. To take them in a literal and unlimited sense \n     would be a metamorphosis of the Constitution into a character \n     which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its \n     creators.\n\n  You see, that is how we have gotten into trouble as a country. That \nis why our economic future is not secure--because the Congress has \nexceeded its authority under a limited Constitution and the courts have \nfailed to rein us in. They have failed to recognize their obligation.\n  So we are going to have someone who believes that the precedent and \nwisdom of modern men is much more important than the original intent of \nour Founders to keep us free, to secure our liberty, to provide our \ninalienable rights to the pursuit of life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness.\n  Here is another area. If we read the Constitution and we read where \nthey have set up our judicial system, what they reference, they say:\n\n       The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and \n     equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the \n     United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, \n     under their authority. . . .\n\n  They gave no wiggle room for the utilization of foreign law in \ninterpreting the U.S. Constitution--none. Here is Elena Kagan:\n\n       It may be proper for judges to consider foreign law sources \n     in ruling on constitutional questions.\n\n  Here is what the Constitution says. Here is what the nominee to the \nSupreme Court says--exactly opposite of what the Constitution says. In \nother words, it is OK to use any source of law you want, not the source \nthat the Constitution says you will be bound by in your oath.\n  Let's take it a step further, same quote: ``Judges can get'' good \nideas ``on how to approach legal issues from a decision of a foreign \ncourt. It may be proper for judges to consider foreign law sources in \nruling on Constitutional questions.''\n  Here is their oath:\n  I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully and impartially discharge \nand perform all the duties incumbent upon me as a justice under the \nConstitution and laws of the United States. So help me God.\n  ``Under the laws and the Constitution of the United States'' is not \nforeign law. That is the U.S. Constitution and our statutes. So as soon \nas she takes the oath, her very philosophy violates it because she \nhonestly testified that it is fine to use foreign law to interpret our \nlaws and our Constitution.\n  Again, how did we get in the trouble that we are in today? How did we \nget that 20 years from now every man, woman, and child in this country \nis going to be responsible for over $1 million worth of debt? How did \nwe get to the point where $350 billion of waste, fraud, and duplication \noccurs every year in the Federal Government? How did we get to the \npoint that we can take people's rights away because we deem so in the \nCongress, in our smart, modern wisdom that lessens liberty and freedom \nthroughout this land?\n  We do it because we do not use the book, and we don't follow the oath \nthat we are sworn to uphold; that is, the U.S. Constitution and the \nlaws of this land.\n  Then it comes to the commerce clause. Elena Kagan:\n\n       The commerce clause has been interpreted broadly. It's been \n     interpreted to apply to . . . anything that would \n     substantially affect interstate commerce.\n\n  When asked if a Federal law requiring Americans to eat three fruits \nand three vegetables every day would be unconstitutional, Ms. Kagan \navoided the question by simply saying, ``That would be a dumb law.''\n  Madison had something different to say:\n\n\n[[Page S6719]]\n\n\n       Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.\n\n  He is talking about us.\n\n       If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If \n     angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal \n     controls on government would be necessary. In framing a \n     government which is to be administered by men over men, the \n     great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the \n     government to control the governed; and in the next place \n     oblige it to control itself.\n\n  We have had this vast expansion since the late 1940s in this country \nin the commerce clause. It started with Wickard v. Filburn. A farmer \nraising chickens was raising his own wheat. But the Government didn't \nwant him raising his own wheat because they had allotted limits during \nthe 1930s, the Great Depression--limits to what you could grow. So he \nowns his own land, he has his own chickens, but the Supreme Court said: \nYou can't raise your own feed. You have to buy it from somebody.\n  So here we started with the Supreme Court ruling and moving in to \ntake away the freedom of an individual farmer to raise his own feed for \nhis own chickens for a greater good--supposedly to control the price \nand availability of wheat.\n  What has happened to us since then? Look at the expansion of the \ncommerce clause and how it is moving power away from those who are \ngoverned without their consent to a central government in Washington. \nWhat does Ms. Kagan complain about during the hearing? That she thinks \nthe Supreme Court may be moving to reverse that--of which she adamantly \ndisagrees. When asked about the Seminole case and the Lopez case, she \nworried that it moves us back to individual freedom and a more \nrestrictive commerce clause, a commerce clause that says our rights are \nmore important than those of the government.\n  That goes back to the basis that she doesn't believe we have natural \nrights. The fundamental question of whether an individual, free in a \ncountry, can walk on to the Supreme Court and disavow inalienable \nrights and natural rights, that is a very dangerous concept because if \nyou don't believe in natural rights, you don't worry about taking them \nfrom those who are governed. You don't worry about the Congress taking \nthem from those of the governed.\n\n  We are about to move to a point where we are going to put somebody in \na lifetime position on the U.S. Supreme Court who believes in foreign \nlaw utilization to interpret the issues before it; who believes that \nprecedent trumps original intent of the Founders--in other words, the \narrogance is we are much smarter than they were, our wisdom is much \nbetter, we are more modern, therefore things have changed, therefore we \nhave to ignore what they have said; that the commerce clause is \nboundless; even if Congress passes stupid laws, they have the right to \ndo it and there is no obligation on the Court to look at the \nConstitution and the documents behind it and what our Founding Fathers \nhad to say about the authority and what they intended and meant as they \nwrote that clause into the Constitution.\n  Then, finally, one last point. She does not believe in the individual \nnatural right that you have as a person to defend yourself. She \nwouldn't embrace that--which implies, very rightly so, that the second \namendment, even though we now have precedent, is at risk under Elena \nKagan as a Supreme Court Justice.\n  So, summing up, we are going to put somebody on the Court that I see \nwill further the problems we have versus starting to reembrace the \nprinciples that made this country great. Are we going to embrace what \nhas gotten us into trouble? Are we going to embrace the $13.34 trillion \nworth of debt growing at $1.4 trillion to $1.6 trillion today, that is \nstealing the opportunity of the future? We are. We are going to put her \non there, and her wisdom and her vision is very different from our \nFounders, our Constitution, and our natural rights.\n  This will be a huge mistake for this country if we want to solve the \nproblems in front of us. As I said, I don't expect anybody to change \ntheir vote on the basis of my viewpoint. I will congratulate her for \nbeing more honest and open on her testimony than others would because \nnormally we would not find out these things about judges.\n  With a worried heart, I yield the floor.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S6719, August 4, 2010, the Record reads: With the word \n`hark,' I yield the floor.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: With a worried \nheart, I yield the floor.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am always reluctant to find out that I \nam following the Senator from Oklahoma on the floor of the Senate. He \nis always prepared and always eloquent. I commend the Senator on his \nspeech.\n  But I want to commend him on his questioning in the hearing because \nhe allowed us to gain, and Ms. Kagan to express, important points, \nimportant opinions, important judgments, and important statements for \neverybody in this body to make up their minds. That is really what this \nSenate is all about, and it is Senators like the Senator from Oklahoma \nwho help us all to do our job, and I commend him very much for his \nwork.\n  I also commend him for covering so many facts. My speech will be very \nbrief. I announced about 4 weeks ago that I would not vote for the \nconfirmation of Ms. Elena Kagan and expressed at that time the reasons. \nBut I wanted to memorialize that on the Senate floor because it is a \nserious responsibility that we have to advise and consent on the \nnomination of the President of the United States.\n  In response to that, the advice and consent should always be \nthoughtful and should always be thorough, and mine is generally based \nentirely on the Constitution when it comes to the Supreme Court and the \nappointments the Presidents of the United States make because I am well \naware my position, the President's position, and the position of all of \nus in this was a creation of those of our Founding Fathers who wrote \nthe Constitution that created the government, that is the United States \nof America and the three branches of that government that will govern \nus as a nation: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. \nExecutive, as in the President; legislative, as in us; and the \njudicial, as the jury--the jury not of who is right and wrong but is \nthe Constitution right, is the law right that we passed in relation to \nthe Constitution that created us.\n\n  Two things in Ms. Kagan's past concern me greatly in terms of the \ndirection she would go as a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. One is \nthe Solomon rule application when she was dean of the Harvard Law \nSchool.\n  When I helped write, along with a lot of other Members in this body, \nNo Child Left Behind, we made sure we covered this issue of military \naccess on campuses of secondary schools and postsecondary schools.\n  The Solomon Amendment is a simple amendment that says: If you accept \nFederal funds as a public institution or as a private institution, in \nterms of Harvard through research or funds such as that, that U.S. \nmilitary representatives will have access to the campus.\n  Ms. Kagan made the conscious decision as dean of the law school that \nthat access would not be available at Harvard and, even after direction \notherwise, continued in that position until she eventually withdrew. \nWell, if someone is going to the Supreme Court of the United States of \nAmerica to be a judge of our Constitution and its application to our \nlegislative and judicial branches, you must remember the first \nresponsibility designated to this Congress and to this government is to \nprotect and defend the domestic tranquility of the people of the United \nStates of America and to constitute an army and a navy to do that.\n  You cannot draw on that army and navy if you cannot draw on the \npeople in your country. At a time today, a contemporary time such as \n2010, where everyone who serves--everyone, not a one is conscripted, \nevery single one is a volunteer--the information about the \nopportunities, the availability and the promise of a career in the \nmilitary or a period of service should not be denied anyone who goes to \nan institution that receives funds from the United States of America \nand from this Congress.\n  Secondly, you know there has been a lot of talk about the Citizens \nUnited case, and there have been a lot of political arguments about the \nCitizens United case. But it is a first amendment case. I do not think \nanybody argues about that.\n  In listening to the testimony in the Judiciary Committee and reading \nthe record on the Citizens United case, it is obvious, in her \nexpression and her arguments before the Supreme Court, Ms.\n\n[[Page S6720]]\n\nKagan felt that even though you had a first amendment, through either \nprinting or writing or video or audio, the government could restrict \npolitical speech.\n  Well, the first amendment is the guarantee of free speech. To argue a \ncase that, notwithstanding the first amendment, political speech could \nbe run by the government and judged by the government and its timing \nand its accessibility, to me, flies in the face of the very first \namendment, of the first 10 amendments that finally allowed us to pass a \nConstitution and come together as a nation.\n  So there are a lot of other issues. The Senators who preceded me have \nraised a lot of those issues. I commend Ms. Kagan, too, on her complete \ncongeniality and her complete candor before the committee. But in terms \nof this Senator, in terms of my vote, in terms of my judgment, it is \nthe case and the opinions on the first amendment in Citizens United, \nand the actions contrary to the Solomon Amendment, and military access \nthat, to me, deliver a temperament that I do not think is appropriate \nof a Justice of the Supreme Court at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are we here to discuss Solicitor \nGeneral Elena Kagan's qualifications for the Supreme Court. We have \nheard a number of conversations from our colleagues who are themselves \nlawyers, who have sat in on the Judiciary Committee, and who have gone \nthrough the record with great detail.\n  As I have said before, I am unburdened with a legal education. I have \ngreat respect for those who have been taught to think like that and \ntalk like that and who go into that kind of detail. But I view this \nfrom a slightly different point of view, and I hope it is a commonsense \npoint of view. I would like to share it with my colleagues this \nafternoon.\n  I go back, not to start with Ms. Kagan but to start with an incident \nthat occurred when we were discussing the possibility of John Roberts \ngoing to the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice. In that period of \ndiscussion, there was a particular case that was raised in the press \nwhere John Roberts had issued a ruling that, according to the \nnewspapers and the reporters, was an egregious ruling.\n  Here are the facts of the case: There was a young woman riding the \nMetro who ate a french fry, not a lot of french fries--just one french \nfry. She had the misfortune--she was 12 years old--she had the \nmisfortune to do that in the presence of one of the security officers \nof the Metro who arrested her for violating the publicly advertized \nzero-tolerance, no-eating policy in a Washington Metro station.\n  She was not just detained, she was arrested, searched, handcuffed, \ndriven to police headquarters, booked, and fingerprinted. Three hours \nlater, her mother showed up at the police station and she was released \nto her mother. The mother sued, alleging that her daughter was treated \nimproperly, that an adult would have only received a citation, and that \nthis was a terrible thing that had been done to her.\n  The law says children who violate this policy have to be detained \nuntil their parents can arrive. Well Justice Roberts, the case finally \ncame to him on the circuit court, ruled that the Metro police had acted \nproperly. In an attempt to derail his confirmation to Chief Justice, \nthere was a dust-up in the newspapers and the media: This is a man, we \nwant to put him as Chief Justice of the United States, and he will \ntolerate this kind of treatment of a young woman who does nothing more \nthan eat a single french fry in a Metro station? Is that the kind of \nman we want on the Court?\n  I remember those kinds of editorials and denunciations that were made \nof Mr. Roberts. Then, the facts came out as they got into what \nhappened. What I have said are, indeed, the facts. But this is what \nJustice Roberts said when he handed down his opinion. He said: No one \nis very happy about the events that led to this litigation. He said it \nwas a stupid law. He did not say it in those kind of terms. He said it \nin appropriate legal terms. But basically the burden of what he said \nwas it was a stupid law.\n  But he said: The question before us is not whether these policies \nwere a bad idea but whether they violated the fourth and fifth \namendments of the Constitution. And, as Judge Roberts concluded, they \ndid not.\n  Interestingly, the city council, in response to this case, had \nchanged the law. So he made it clear: I do not agree with this law. I \nthink it is a bad law, but that is not my responsibility. My \nresponsibility is to determine whether it violates the Constitution.\n  This is reminiscent of Justice Potter Stewart's dissent in Griswold \nv. Connecticut. He said: We are not asked in this case to say whether \nwe think this law is unwise or even asinine. We are asked to hold that \nit violates the U.S. Constitution, and that I cannot do.\n  What does that have to do with Elena Kagan? She was faced with a \nsimilar situation. She was not a judge. But she was in a position of \nauthority, and she was faced with a law that she decided was a bad law. \nThis was the Solomon Amendment, having to do with the question of \nmilitary recruiters on college campuses. She was in a position as the \ndean of the law school at Harvard, to prevent military recruiters from \ncoming on campus.\n  The Solomon Amendment basically said: You cannot do that, Dean Kagan. \nYou may disagree with the military's policy with respect to don't ask, \ndon't tell, and you can do that. But you cannot accept federal funds \nand prevent military recruiters from coming on campus. You can even \nexpress your disagreement in a legal fashion, and she did. She openly \nopposed it. She joined other faculty to sign an amicus brief in support \nof a constitutional challenge of the Solomon Amendment.\n\n  I do not object to that. She has every right, as an American citizen, \nto challenge something she thinks is inappropriate in the law. But she \ndoes not have the right to flout the law, and to say: No, we choose not \ndo it. When she became the dean at Harvard, she did that.\n  She refused to allow the recruiters to come on at the Harvard Law \nSchool. She says she did not. She says: The military had full access at \nall times. By the way, she was wrong on the law, as far as the Solomon \nAmendment is concerned, because the Supreme Court decided unanimously \nthat the Solomon amendment was constitutional and that the military had \nthe right to equal access to students at institutions receiving Federal \nfunding.\n  So she should have waited for the Supreme Court to rule, but she did \nnot. She said: I will comply with the law. This is what the recruiters \nsaid. She says they had full access. All right. If they had full \naccess, I would think they would confirm that they had full access. But \nthis is what they had to say. The Army's report from Spring 2005 said: \nThe Army was stonewalled at Harvard. Phone calls and e-mails went \nunanswered and the standard response was: We are waiting to hear from \nour higher authority.\n  There is a Defense Department memo stating: Denying access to the \nCareer Service Office is tantamount to chaining and locking the front \ndoor of the law school, as it has the same impact on our recruiting \nefforts.\n  The chief of recruiting for the Air Force JAG Corps was repeatedly \nblocked from participating in Harvard's 2005 recruiting session. He \nreported: Harvard is playing games and will not give us an on-campus \ninterviewing date.\n  Three different recruiters give a different view of what was done \nwith respect to Harvard. Yet General Kagan says: No. No. They all had \nfull access at all times. If they did, then they are lying. If they did \nnot, then she is giving us false information. She denies the entire \nincident.\n  I think she should have stated her opposition in the Judiciary \nhearings. The proper approach should be to say: I hate the Solomon \nAmendment. I think it is the wrong thing to do. But just as Judge \nRoberts upheld the action with respect to a 12-year-old girl that was \nclearly not appropriate, because it was the law, I have a \nresponsibility, as a lawyer, and lawyers are officers of the court, I \nhave a responsibility as a lawyer at Harvard, even as I am voicing my \nobjection, to say: The Solomon Amendment is in place, and I am going to \nrespect it.\n  She did not respect it. She denies that she did not respect it, in \nthe face of testimony to the contrary from at\n\n[[Page S6721]]\n\nleast three different sources who were directly involved in the case. I \ndo not find that the kind of behavior, regardless of my ideological \ndifference with her, the kind I think a Justice of the Supreme Court \nshould have.\n  She has had much the same attitude with respect to the second \namendment. She has taken a position of being above the law. She refused \nto declare support for the second amendment and when she was questioned \nabout it, she simply dismisses it as ``settled law.'' Going back to the \nSolomon Amendment, wasn't that settled law? When she had an opportunity \nto act against it, she took that opportunity, feeling correctly that \nshe would not be disciplined for it at Harvard. But now I do not think \nshe can appropriately say she should not be questioned about it as she \nis being proposed for the Supreme Court.\n\n  When clerking for Justice Thurgood Marshall in 1987, Kagan was faced \nwith a challenge to the District of Columbia gun ban. With respect to a \nplaintiff's contention with respect to the District of Columbia's \nfirearms status--as he said, the District of Columbia violated his \nconstitutional right to keep and bear arms--She wrote: I am not \nsympathetic, and she recommended that the Court not even consider the \ncase. The Court recently considered the case and has ruled otherwise in \nthe Heller decision.\n  So she is going to go to the Court--I assume she will be confirmed--\nwith at least two circumstances where she has taken firm positions in \nopposition to the Court she intends to join. In one case it was a \nunanimous decision that overturned her; it was not a 5-to-4 decision.\n  My concern about her is that she has never shown any inclination \ntoward impartiality. I do not mind people of strong opinions. This \nChamber is filled with them. I do not mind judges who have strong \nopinions as long as they do not let those strong opinions get in the \nway of what the law says. I am afraid in her case she is one who will \nlet her strong opinions get in the way of what the law says. For that \nreason, I intend to vote against her nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the confirmation \nof Ms. Kagan to the Supreme Court, and I would like to put this \nopposition in context with what is going on all around the country.\n  All of us know, and we have seen on the news--and many of us have \nseen in person--that people are upset with what is happening in \nWashington. They are angry. They are fearful. They are frustrated at \nall the spending, the borrowing, the debt, the government takeovers. I \nkeep hearing from people: What can we do? How can we stop it? Why is it \nhappening?\n  That is a question we need to keep asking here: Why is it happening? \nWhy has this country, this Congress, and many Congresses before spent \nthis country to the edge of bankruptcy--and continue to spend week \nafter week? Even though the President and the majority are talking \nevery week about the unsustainable debt, almost every week we are \nadding to that debt, adding new programs. It makes no sense.\n  Our Founders believed it very important that every Member of \nCongress--the House and the Senate--the President, the Supreme Court, \nand the military officers all take an oath of office to protect and \ndefend the Constitution. That may seem perfunctory, just something we \ndo as a part of history. But that was not its intent because the \nConstitution is a document that limits what the Federal Government can \ndo. If anyone reads it seriously, it is pretty clear its primary \npurpose is to limit what the Federal Government can do. It specifies a \nfew things, such as protecting our Nation, making sure there is \njustice, making sure we have the rule of law and the enforcement of \nthose laws across all of our States.\n  But it says a lot about what we cannot do. The whole Bill of Rights \nsays much about what the government cannot do to take our freedoms. The \n10th amendment itself says whatever is not specified in the \nConstitution is left to the States and the people.\n  Even though all of us take that oath of office, it seems to me, after \nbeing here a number of years, that just about everyone here sets aside \nthat Bible when they put their hands down and completely forgets they \nhave just taken an oath to protect and defend a constitution that \nlimits what we can do.\n  Last year, when we passed this health care bill, Obamacare, a \nreporter asked Speaker Nancy Pelosi where in the Constitution did she \nfind the authority to require people to buy a government-approved \nhealth insurance policy. All she could say is, ``Are you serious?'' In \nfact, if you talk about a limited constitutional government, as I often \ndo in the Senate, you are considered a radical, even though all of us \ntake that oath of office.\n  What we have turned into here--and the President has used this phrase \na lot--is a ``yes, we can'' Congress. It does not matter what it is, \nwhat problem comes up all across the country, we can do it, we can fix \nit. Government has a solution to almost anything because we do not pay \nany attention to the Constitution.\n  The Constitution is a constitution of no, of what we cannot do. That \nis to protect us and to avoid where we are today, which is approaching \na $14 trillion debt which is about to destroy our whole country.\n  Think about this: In the world's great bastion of freedom that we \ncall America, our Federal Government owns the largest auto companies. \nIt owns the largest insurance company. It owns the largest mortgage \ncompanies. It controls our education system. It just took over our \nhealth care system. It controls the whole energy sector and our \ntransportation sector. The rules and regulations and taxes that we put \non businesses pretty much means mostly it controls all the business \nactivity in our country.\n  When Congressman Pete Stark was asked last week--in an interview we \nhave seen all over the Internet--is there anything that the Federal \nGovernment cannot do, he said no because he had forgotten the \nconstitutional oath of office.\n  What is the Court's rule, as we think about Ms. Kagan, the Supreme \nCourt, the confirmation process? What is the role of the Court? The \nintent is pretty clear that it is to watch over Congress, the executive \nbranch, to make sure we do not get outside the bounds of the \nConstitution. If we do, the Court is supposed to say: No, you can't; \nthat is unconstitutional. But the Court, over the years, has pretty \nmuch thrown that responsibility out the window.\n  Back during FDR's days, in their interpretation of the commerce \nclause, it had essentially given Congress and the White House unlimited \nability to do almost anything that comes up, any whim that we have. \nThat is how we ended up with over $13 trillion in debt. I know this \noveractive government is really important. This idea of a limited \ngovernment is very important.\n  When Ms. Kagan was in my office and I asked: Does the Constitution \nlimit us from doing anything, she really could not come up with a good \nanswer. It is pretty similar to her hearings, when Senator Tom Coburn \nasked her: If the Congress passed a law, and the President signed it, \nthat every American had to eat their fruits and vegetables every day, \nwould that be constitutional? And she said: It would be a dumb law. But \nshe would not say that is unconstitutional.\n  Friends, if this government can tell us what we have to eat, it can \ntell us anything. We cannot claim to have any freedoms if this \ngovernment can tell us what we have to eat. It is essentially the same \nthing as telling us we have to buy a government-approved health \ninsurance policy. We cannot say no. But the Constitution is intended to \nmake sure we do.\n  Ms. Kagan talked a lot about precedents, which are just previous \ncourt rulings, not much about the Constitution being our standard. The \nproblem with that is a precedent is a lot like what we used to call the \ngossip game. Some people call it the telephone game, where you have a \nbunch of people sitting around a table, and the person at the head of \nthe table whispers a phrase to the person next to them. They whisper it \nto the person next to them, and it goes all around the room. The whole \nfunny part of the game is, by the time it gets back to the person who \nstarted it, you cannot even recognize the phrase. It has nothing to do \nwith what was originally said.\n  That is exactly how precedent works. Once you throw the standard out, \nthen\n\n[[Page S6722]]\n\nthe whole idea of a constitutional standard is out the window, if we \nhave judges today who are making decisions by picking and choosing the \nprecedent that agrees with their opinion rather than basing their \ndecisions on true constitutional standards.\n  I oppose Ms. Kagan's nomination because she, in my opinion, does not \nbelieve in constitutional limited government. She does not believe in \nthe original intent of the Constitution but more of President Obama's \nbelief of a more living Constitution. As President Obama said before he \nwas elected, he sees the Constitution as a document of negative \nliberties because it tells the government what it cannot do. But it \ndoes not tell us what we have to do.\n  It was never supposed to tell us what we have to do. But the \nprogressives in power in Washington and many of our judges believe they \nneed, through court rulings, to change that Constitution. What has \nresulted in that is the government controlling more and more of our \nlives, spending and borrowing money we do not have, and bringing our \ncountry to the brink of economic disaster.\n  We cannot afford more ``yes, we can'' judges in our country. We can \ncannot afford more ``yes, we can'' Senators or Congressmen. And we \ncertainly cannot afford another ``yes, we can'' President. The \ndecisions that have been made about our economy over the last couple of \nyears have brought our economy to its knees. This is no longer \nsomething we can blame on President Bush. In fact, the Democrats have \nbeen in control of policymaking, economic policy spending for 4 years \nnow. This is not Bush's recession. This is the result of Democratic \neconomic policies.\n  This nomination will continue our move in the wrong direction because \nit will put another person on the Court who does not see their role as \nlimiting what we can do in Congress, and this Congress desperately \nneeds a Supreme Court that tells Congress no when we step outside the \nbounds of the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I believe America is looking at Congress closer than \nthey ever have before. They expect us to make the hard decisions, to \nstop the spending, to stop the waste, to stop the borrowing, to stop \nthe debt, to stop the government takeovers, and to stop our courts from \ntaking our freedoms away. That is why I am opposing Ms. Kagan to be a \nSupreme Court Justice, and I encourage my colleagues to consider their \nvote and to vote no.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, we are not in a quorum call at this time. \nI am told there is a brief pause. I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Coordination of Wind and Flood Perils Act\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, during this brief pause in the debate on \nthe Supreme Court nominee, I rise to call to the attention of Senate \nMembers my introduction of S. 3672, the Coordination of Wind and Flood \nPerils Act of 2010.\n  This month is, of course, the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. \nWe are still rebuilding on the coast, and we are still rebuilding in \nmany areas of the gulf, in the South, as depicted on this map.\n  Two weeks ago, I attended the opening of a municipal complex and \nlibrary in the historic town of Pass Christian. The fact that we are \njust getting the money and just getting this library and city all \nrebuilt after 5 years is testimony to the extent of the destruction and \nthe difficulty of funding projects like that. This is true in the \npublic sector, and it is also true in the private sector.\n  But one of the greatest impediments to rebuilding, and one of the \nmain reasons Katrina is still not over for the people of Mississippi \nand other areas of the gulf is the lack of affordable insurance. This \nis true in Mississippi, and it is also true from Texas all the way \nthrough the gulf, south, down to the tip of Florida, and on up through \nthe New England coastal States. Anywhere there is coastal exposure \nthere is a problem with affordability and availability of insurance.\n  I have had quite a number of visits to the coast in recent weeks, \nparticularly in the last 100 days because of the oilspill. The recovery \nthere is going to be a challenge.\n  There will be speeches later on this month commemorating the \nanniversary and discussing the heroism and the resilience and the \ndetermination of the people of the coast. All of this will be \nappreciated and necessary, but the truth is one of the best things that \ncould be done for the gulf coast area--not just my State of Mississippi \nbut in the entire area--is to resolve the issue of wind insurance \nversus flood insurance, and that is what S. 3672 is all about: \ncoordinating the coverage between wind and flood perils coverage.\n  Of course, for people in this area, for people in my State of \nMississippi, you need hazard insurance, you need fire insurance, as \ndoes everyone, you need wind insurance, and you need flood insurance. \nBack in 1968, that was the year of Hurricane Camille. It also was the \nyear it became apparent to this Congress that something needed to be \ndone at the Federal level to cover water damage. Hence, the National \nFlood Insurance Program was established in 1968. Since that time, \nAmericans have been able to get flood insurance through the NFIP. \nActually, in 1973, this Congress in its wisdom made such coverage \nmandatory for people mortgaging property in flood zones.\n  Let's fast forward to 2005, the year of Hurricane Katrina. Many \nvictims who needed it didn't have flood insurance. One of the reasons \nthey didn't have flood insurance is that the flood zone maps were \nwrong. I hope to a large extent this has been corrected. It is supposed \nto have been corrected now, and people in flood zones who have \nmortgages are required to have it. Oftentimes they cancel those \npolicies, and that is something we need to attend to also, but that \ninsurance is available.\n  The problem is wind insurance. The private insurance coverage for \nwind damage has pretty much left the coastal areas of many of our \nStates in the eastern part of the United States. So we have this \nsituation now where a homeowner needs flood insurance through the \nNational Flood Insurance Program. They need their own hazard insurance \nthat they get through their local broker. Then, they probably have to \nresort to the State wind pool, a State program, because private wind \ninsurance is not available to them.\n  Another problem we had in 2005 after Katrina is that many homeowners \nfound themselves caught in the middle between the issue of whether it \nwas water damage in connection with the hurricane that caused their \nproperty loss or whether it was flood damage in connection with the \nhurricane that caused the loss. After hurricanes such as Katrina, if a \nhomeowner has wind and flood insurance, the homeowner often has to \nprove in court whether it was wind or water that caused the damage. \nThis is unacceptable. Let me emphasize this: Individuals who had all \nthe appropriate insurance--wind and water--were, in many instances, \ncaught in the middle and forced to go to court to watch the insurance \ncarriers fight among themselves. My legislation would remove the burden \nof determining flood or wind loss allocation from the property owner \nand put it where it belongs--a decision to be made between the \ninsurers.\n  If my bill becomes law, insurance companies, including State-run wind \npools and the National Flood Insurance Program, would have to pay a \nclaim as soon as possible after the hurricane. If there is a dispute, \neach would pay 50 percent. The homeowner would be paid for the loss \nwhile the parties responsible for paying the claim would work out the \ndetails.\n  My legislation--and again, it is S. 3672, the Coordination of Wind \nand Flood Perils Act of 2010--would prevent homeowners from having to \ngo to court to determine what portion of the damages were caused by \nwind and what portion by water. This should not be part of the duties \nof the homeowner. Under my legislation, if there is a dispute between \nthe parties responsible for paying the claim, the insured would be \ncompensated immediately and the dispute between the insurers would be \nresolved by arbitration.\n  This is only a small step. It doesn't answer the whole problem. I \nstill support the concept of putting wind coverage under the National \nFlood Insurance Program on a voluntary basis, as\n\n[[Page S6723]]\n\nmy amendment would have done in 2008. It is an amendment that has \npassed the House of Representatives and it is known as the multi-peril \nconcept. That did not get majority support in the Senate and is, \nfrankly, unlikely to get that support in short order. They are having \ntrouble with that concept in the House of Representatives, but I wish \nto emphasize that I still support the multi-peril concept. This is a \nstep. It puts us on the right track and it removes the wind and water \ndebate.\n  I would suggest that my friends in the Senate look at this bill. I \ninvite them to become cosponsors, and I hope we will be able to add \nthis simple amendment to the law in short order.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have been in the Senate a long time. \nThis is my 25th year of service. This is one of the most exciting \nmoments I have seen here. Today we have an opportunity to fulfill a \ngreat responsibility and an honor, to be able to stand in this Chamber \nto declare our support for the President's selection of an outstanding \nnominee: Solicitor General Elena Kagan to be a Justice of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States.\n  Everyone is aware that she brings an intellect, experience, and \nknowledge of the law that places her among the few in this country so \nperfectly qualified to serve on this most important body of \njurisprudence in the entire world.\n  Upon the entrance to the Federal courthouse in Newark, NJ, there is \nan inscription that reads: ``The true measure of a democracy is its \ndispensation of justice.'' I was the author of that statement and I \nlabored over it, short as it is, to reflect my view that reflects a \nfundamental principle of our democracy and the values on which the U.S. \nConstitution was founded. These values pervade throughout our \ngovernment and legal system, and especially in the decisions of our \nNation's highest Court.\n  I met with Solicitor General Kagan to hear her views and her personal \nhistory, and I watched the testimony before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. I have no doubt that, if approved, Solicitor General Kagan \nwill be an outstanding defender of our Constitution in the dispensation \nof justice entrusted to a Supreme Court member. That is why I hope that \nwith this historic opportunity, the Senate will stand up for what is \nright, to confirm Ms. Kagan's appointment to become a member of the \nhighest Court in our country because of her outstanding qualifications.\n  When I met with her, I told her the people of New Jersey were excited \nabout her nomination not only because of her outstanding educational \nachievements--by the way, graduating from Princeton, NJ, summa cum \nlaude, and contributing so much in her life through her commitment to \npublic service. The excitement is generated because Ms. Kagan is a \ntrailblazer who has paved the way to the top of the legal profession \nthat has helped open doors to women as well as men. She was the first \nwoman chosen to be dean of Harvard Law School. She is the first woman \never to have served as Solicitor General of the United States, a post \nmany call the ``tenth Justice'' of the Supreme Court. We must remember \nwhat that job is, what that task is, and that is to appear on behalf of \nthe United States as an advocate, having tested abilities to bring the \ncase to the Court, defending our country, and experience second to none \nin that courtroom.\n  Let us not forget that in the last year she has amassed an impressive \nrecord as Solicitor General. She has filed more than 3,500 pages of \nmerit briefs before the Court, and she has argued cases on a broad \nrange of issues from protecting children from pedophiles to protecting \nAmericans from terrorists. If she is confirmed, of nine members of the \nCourt, the proportion of women will be at its highest level in history, \nwith women holding three seats.\n  She is the granddaughter of immigrants, and that experience shaped \nthe world in which she grew up. Similarly, I came from parents brought \nto America by my grandparents, who had the common experience of so many \nof the struggle to learn a new language, adopt new skills to get by, \nmustering the determination to help their children rise above their \ncircumstances in this new world. Though my parents worked very hard, \nthey were never able to accumulate valuables. Instead, the heritage \nthey left my sister and me was a set of values and a love for America \nwith its freedom and opportunities and appreciation for what this \ncountry gives us all. They often reminded us that there were those far \nworse off than we and we had an obligation to contribute if we could to \ngive something back to our community.\n  These same values are inherent in Ms. Kagan's views as she expressed \nthem to me. Her father was a housing lawyer. Her mother was a public \nschoolteacher for 20 years, and she carries the heritage of their \npublic service dedication. Solicitor General Kagan's career has \nconfirmed her own commitment to public service, protecting rights and \nindividual freedoms.\n  She served as a clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall whom she, as many \nother Americans, greatly admired. Frankly, it is sad to see that some \non this floor during her confirmation hearings attempted to discredit \nSolicitor General Kagan's reputation because of her association with \nJustice Thurgood Marshall. Justice Marshall was an icon who expanded \nrespect and tolerance in America as few others have in our history. He \nargued Brown v. The Board of Education. He was the first African \nAmerican to serve as Solicitor General of the United States, at which \nhe excelled, amassing a remarkable record of Court victories. He was \nthe first African-American Supreme Court Justice and distinguished \nhimself as one of America's greatest jurists.\n  Some on the other side, in order to keep this appointment from being \nconfirmed, have gone so far in their desperation to denigrate Ms. Kagan \nthat they have labeled Justice Marshall as some radical on the bench \nand attempted to tear apart the years of brilliant contributions of \nthis great man.\n  I want to be clear. The fight to end racial discrimination may have \nbeen radical to some, but it was the right fight and the right cause, \nand there will never be anything shameful about a person whose great \nmind and ferocious eloquence made him a giant in the civil rights \nmovement. Shame on those who would denigrate those achievements.\n  Ms. Kagan's lifelong dedication has been to break down barriers and \nwork for what is right, not simply popular. At Harvard Law School, one \nof her accomplishments as dean was to welcome different views among \nfaculty members. She believed--and exercised that belief--that her \nstudents would not get the legal education they deserved if it was \nlimited by one ideological perspective. She made it a point to add \nfaculty members who came from different points along the political \nspectrum. No wonder Solicitor General Kagan's nomination has not only \nbeen endorsed by liberals but also by conservatives, including Ken \nStarr, Ted Olson, and Miguel Estrada.\n  Considering a Supreme Court nominee is one of the most important \nresponsibilities we have. The Supreme Court makes decisions that \ndetermine the very underpinnings of our country's character. It has a \ndirect say on the rights--or lack thereof--our children and \ngrandchildren will have. The Court can decide whether big corporations \nand the rich and famous should have a stronger claim to justice than \nthe average person. The Court sets the table for government power--\nwhether it goes unchecked or is responsible to the people. The rulings \nof the Court affect everyday New Jerseyans and everyday Americans. \nThere is no doubt in my mind that Ms. Kagan understands that.\n  After careful consideration, I am going to proudly vote yes to \nconfirm a person who I believe will be one of the great Justices of the \nSupreme Court of the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I hope there isn't this continuing attempt and process \nwe have seen here where it is the objective of individuals in this \nroom--typically on the other side of the aisle--to stop things from \nhappening, to be obstructionists. There is no point in exercising that \nkind of foolishness. This is a time to step up and say we want the best \nwe can get for our Supreme Court. President Obama has chosen carefully \nand wisely, and we want to see Ms. Kagan seated on the Supreme Court. I \nhope my colleagues will vote affirmatively to make sure that happens.\n\n[[Page S6724]]\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Small Business\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand we are in controlled time. \nI will speak for the next 10 minutes, and if someone else comes to the \nfloor, I will be happy to yield.\n  I know the discussion today has primarily been on our new potential \nSupreme Court nominee, but that is not why I have come to the floor. I \nhave come to the floor to talk about an issue I have spent a good bit \nof time talking about in the last several weeks--particularly the last \nweek--and that is the issue most Americans have on their minds right \nnow, and that is, when is this recession going to end? That is a good \nquestion. My answer to that is that this recession is going to end as \nsoon as we can get Main Street moving again.\n  The First Lady has been so wonderful in her advocacy to help \nAmericans understand the importance of activity and moving, with her \ncampaign ``Let's Move,'' to help us all get into better shape--\nparticularly the young children of our country. I think we can really \nuse almost that same slogan for Main Street--to get Main Street moving \nagain, percolating again, and generating jobs, because that is the only \nway this recession is going to end. We can pass bill after bill up here \nregarding big bank bailouts, saving the big auto manufacturers. We can \nstep up and send money to big, troubled banks. But until we figure out \na way to get money to Main Street, this recession is going to be with \nus a long time.\n  I think that is really what is on people's minds, at least in \nLouisiana, my home State, the places with which I am very familiar. Our \nsituation in Louisiana is even more complicated, and right now I am not \ngoing to take the opportunity--but I will before this session ends--to \ntalk about the gulf coast disaster and the moratorium that has been \nplaced on drilling in the gulf, which has exacerbated our problem. \nSuffice it to say that on Main Street all over America, people are \nwondering--we know that Supreme Court Justices are important, that \nhealth care is important, and we know that stabilizing the financial \nsituation is important.\n  When is Congress going to focus on Main Street and small business? \nThat is what our bill, the small business lending bill and particularly \nthe small business lending fund, does.\n  I want to start the first few minutes of this discussion--there will \nbe some Members coming down to the floor--by reading an e-mail I \nreceived in my office 2 days ago. This e-mail was so well written and \nso passionate and so encouraging to me that I was afraid it was not \nreal. I actually had my staff call the man who wrote it to make sure \nbefore I came to the floor of the Senate, because I did not want to be \nfooled or embarrassed by someone sending some kind of form e-mail and \nnot being sure it was correct.\n  I want my colleagues to know that we called Mr. Bryan Gipson, Sr. I \nam going to read his e-mail because I think this says better than I \ncould what is at stake for those who have tried to obstruct this bill, \nunfortunately, for many of my friends on the other side:\n\n       Dear Senator Landrieu, I wanted to start this e-mail by \n     telling you I am a life long Republican and a former member \n     of your district. I currently reside in Ocean Springs, \n     Mississippi, and I am a Commercial Real Estate Broker. I \n     watched with great interest today as the Senate debated H.R. \n     5297, the Small Business Jobs Credit Act. I was very, very \n     disappointed by the unjustified stonewalling of the \n     Republicans. To think that a Bill, whose only purpose is to \n     provide funding for small business, create jobs and help the \n     most battered segment of our economy recover from the worst \n     recession of all time could be held up because one side had \n     their feelings hurt because they don't have enough amendments \n     is sickening.\n       Senator Landrieu, I am a commercial real estate broker. My \n     company sells hotels, throughout the southeastern United \n     States. We have not completed a transaction in almost two \n     years. There is no third party commercial financing for \n     commercial real [estate] in the United States today our \n     industry has been battered because of this. Hotels are \n     closing through out this country and workers are being laid \n     off. These workers make beds and clean rooms. They work as \n     wait staff, accountants, reservationists, and front desk \n     personnel. Thousands of these hard working Americans have \n     been laid off. It's time for Congress to do something to put \n     Americans back to work on the jobs.\n       As I said, I am a life long Republican. I was sick to my \n     stomach to see the leadership of the Republican Party do \n     everything in their power to kill this bill. Please remind \n     them they have lost my vote. I will do everything in my power \n     to defeat my two Republican Senators when election time \n     comes. It is plain to see the Senators of the Republican \n     Party are holding the American economy and it's workers \n     hostage for selfish, partisan politics, and the American \n     voters are tired of it.\n\n  I will not read his last sentence because I do not think it is \nappropriate for the Senate.\n  Today I had the opportunity to speak with one of the region's most \noutstanding community bankers by phone. My phone call was prompted by a \nroundtable I held earlier this week--it was not yesterday but the day \nbefore--with some of the country's most outstanding entrepreneurs. I \nhad several individuals from Louisiana--surprising to many people. You \nmay be surprised to know that New Orleans, LA, has been on the front \ncover of Entrepreneurial magazine twice in the last year because after \nKatrina, some of the leaders, including myself, had the sense to say: \nWe are not going to build back just what we had; we are going to build \nback better and stronger, and part of that is inspiring young people \naround the country to come and start new businesses in New Orleans and \nhelp us build a greater city and a better region.\n  We also had individuals from all parts of the United States. One of \nthe two most interesting individuals who owns arguably the most famous \nsmall business in America today, Georgetown Cupcake, better known as DC \nCupcakes, the reality show--Sophie and Katherine were in my committee 2 \ndays ago. I want to tell you what they said, and nobody is going to \nbelieve it. There is a transcript of this record.\n  This is one of the most famous, most popular small businesses in \nAmerica. They have their own reality show. They testified to my \ncommittee that they could not themselves get a business loan. They \nknocked on bank after bank until finally a community banker--the \nchairman of the bank is Ron Paul. I spoke with him today. It is \nEagleBank right in this region. They finally gave them a loan which \nthey paid back in 3 months. For 2 years they used every credit card \nthey had. They used their entire savings. Even with a line 2 blocks \nlong--if anyone in Washington, DC, doesn't know about it, they should \nknow about it. I have not been there, but my children have been there. \nThey ask me to take them there all the time. The line is 2 blocks long, \nI hear, every night.\n  If a small business not 10 minutes from the Capitol, with a line 2 \nblocks long, cannot get a loan from a bank and has to go through all \nthis trouble--but they finally, thank goodness, found a community bank \nto lend them the money--do I have to say anymore about what we are \ntrying to do?\n  Another young woman showed up in our committee. She graduated magna \ncum laude from Duke University. She received a scholarship from the \nFulbright Scholarship Program. She went to Sri Lanka to work for a year \nunder the Fulbright Scholarship Program. Her idea as a scholar was that \nmaybe she could create a business using environmentally sensitive \nmethods and practices designing very fashionable clothes that she could \nthen sell to college students because our college students today are \nmuch more sensitive to the environment and to these sorts of things \nthan we were when we were in college.\n  She had a very brilliant idea. She had a great market. She went to \nbank after bank with $250,000 worth of purchase orders and could not \nget a loan and does not have one today.\n  If our young people who are graduating at the very top of their \nclass, who have the most extraordinary ability to create jobs in \nAmerica, cannot get money in their hands, we should close these doors \nand turn these lights off because it is never going to get fixed. That \nis what this bill tries to do.\n  It has been stopped by petty politics or slowed down considerably. We \nare\n\n[[Page S6725]]\n\nstill hoping we can get this done by the other side, which wants to \npretend this is not important or that the Small Business Lending \nProgram that got 60 votes on the floor of the Senate is somehow \ndamaging to this bill. It is the heart of this bill.\n  I want to use fact versus fiction to clear up another point. I could \ngo on and on about what these young entrepreneurs running small but \nextraordinarily exciting businesses said at that roundtable. This bill \nwill help them, and we are going to continue to do more.\n  One of the things I want to speak about today is fact versus fiction \nabout the one article that has criticized us. It was an AP article that \nwas written 2 days ago and was circulated in defense of the opposition, \nso I want to take this issue by issue.\n  The article was written by Daniel Wagner of Associated Press. When we \ncalled him, he admitted that he failed to call anyone from our office \nor the Small Business Committee to get any real information about the \nbill. He had not written in an updated way. He had gotten this \ninformation some months ago. He was frustrated. He couldn't get \nTreasury to respond, so he just wrote the article.\n  The problem is half of his article is completely factually wrong \nabout this bill. I want to go point by point.\n  He comments in his article:\n\n       Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and others have \n     questioned whether the problem is lack of capital or if there \n     simply are not enough creditworthy borrowers.\n\n  I have given two examples in the last 2 or 3 minutes about \ncreditworthy borrowers. I think every Member of Congress knows a dozen \nbusinesses that are good, solid businesses with good cashflow and a \ngood product with a good record that are beiing told they cannot get \nfunding. If you do not believe me or what you are hearing back in your \nStates, the fact is our Chairman stated last month:\n\n       It seems clear that some creditworthy businesses, including \n     some whose collateral has lost value but whose cash flow \n     remains strong have had difficulty obtaining the credit they \n     need to expand and, in some cases, even continuing to \n     operate.\n\n  Part of the article, quoting the Chairman, is factually wrong. \nChairman Bernanke did not say that. Chairman Bernanke said what I just \nquoted.\n  The second fiction he said was that Congress was at work on a new \nprogram to send $30 billion to struggling community banks. No, that is \nnot what our bill does. We do not send $30 billion to struggling \ncommunity banks. We allow healthy banks, not struggling banks, healthy \ncommunity banks to apply, completely voluntary, for money from the \nTreasury so they can increase the capital they have to lend hopefully \nto wonderful young people such as the two young women who started \nGeorgetown Cupcake, now better known nationally as DC Cupcake, and \nother small businesses that are hiring people and increasing their \nlocations and starting to bring this recession to an end.\n  The facts are that you have to be a healthy bank to apply for this \nprogram.\n  The next thing Mr. Wagner said--and he has retracted this already. We \nappreciate him retracting this statement. He said:\n\n       Under the new program, the 775 banks on the government \n     problem list can qualify for the bailout.\n\n  A, that is not true, it is not a bailout. And B, they are expressly \nprohibited in our bill. The 775 banks on the problem list would be \nineligible to receive capital. Only the strongest banks, and they are \nregistered as CAMELS 1, 2, and 3, not 4 and 5. Finally he said:\n\n       This time the money is more likely to disappear as a result \n     of bank failure and fraud.\n\n  It is not the community banks we have to worry about failing. Their \nrecord has been extraordinary. In fact, there was not one bank in 2005, \n2006, all the way up to 2007--there were less than a handful of \ncommunity banks that failed. In 2009 and 2010, those numbers shot up \nbecause of the despicable and reckless policies perpetrated by many big \nbanks and international lenders which put the whole economy at risk \nbecause of what they did, and then that had a ripple effect on our \neconomy.\n  It is not going to be the small community banks that take this Nation \ndown, I can promise my colleagues. It is going to be the small \ncommunity banks and other nonbank lenders in places that have a hard \ntime getting the capital they need to expand that are going to lead \nthis country out of the recession.\n  So I wish to put this up--this ``Party of No''--because, \nunfortunately, we have on the other side an unprecedented number of \nobjections. This is the graph that I think Senator Stabenow has used \nfor 246 objections. It is one thing, of course, politically, if you \nwant to say no to the President. I don't think it is great, but \nsometimes you have to, if you don't believe the President is right. I \nunderstand that. But to say no to the small businesses of America, most \nof which have done absolutely nothing wrong but try to build their \nbusinesses and try to expand their businesses? To say no to them is one \nno gone too far.\n  I wish to put up the chart about the businesses that will create \njobs, because if we would spend some time focused on passing this \nbill--and I hope this chart I am using is an effective visual for the \nshare of net new jobs by firm--these are our own statistics for 1993 to \n2009. So for the last 16 years, 65 percent of new jobs have come from \nsmall firms. This goes to show that if we can get this bill--and maybe \nthere are others but this bill for certain because it was built with \nbipartisan support. It has $12 billion of tax cuts targeted directly at \nsmall business. It is a $30 billion small business, healthy bank \npartnership fund that will help spur investments on Main Street, and it \nis an increase of lending limits and loan guarantees through the Small \nBusiness Administration for their very tested and proven and successful \nlending programs. This bill could have a tremendous impact on Main \nStreet throughout America.\n  We have only a few more days here. The leaders are still talking \nabout what can be worked out. I would suggest we get this bill on the \nfloor, we agree to one amendment on both sides, and get this bill \npassed for the American public. I know the Chair has been supportive, \nand I see Senator Cantwell and others on the floor who have been \narguing successfully and passionately for this bill. When people say we \nneed more amendments, this bill has been built with bipartisan \namendments, section by section--I have said this over and over again--\nevery section of this bill.\n  We call this chart our red-line, four-page outline of this bill. It \nis well known and has been well reviewed by not only Members here but \nstaff and reporters as well who can see for themselves. This is a \nSnowe-Landrieu; Crapo-Landrieu-Risch; Snowe-Landrieu; Snowe-Merkley. I \nmean, every single section has been bipartisan, and we now have a \nstrong bipartisan vote for the lending program. So all we need is for \nthe leaders to agree on one amendment. It could be the 1099 amendment, \nwhich has generated a great deal of interest around here. Let's make a \ndecision about how we move forward with that provision. I think it \nneeds to be adjusted or completely repealed, but that is worth \ndebating. Let's get that done and move this bill forward.\n  In addition, as I yield the floor for the Senator from Washington, we \ncontinue to receive more and more endorsements. Today, we got a letter \nfrom the United States Conference of Mayors:\n\n       On behalf of the Nation's mayors, I am writing to thank \n     you, Senator Landrieu, for supporting and sponsoring the \n     Small Business Jobs Act. The U.S. Conference of Mayors firmly \n     supports this legislation and urges all Senators to vote for \n     its immediate passage.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe entire letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 The United States\n\n\n                                         Conference of Mayors,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 4, 2010.\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,\n     Chairwoman, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, \n         U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: On behalf of the nation's mayors, I \n     am writing to thank you for sponsoring the Small Business \n     Jobs Act of 2010, H.R. 5297. The U.S. Conference of Mayors \n     firmly supports this legislation and urges all Senators to \n     vote for its immediate passage. Mayors believe it will create \n     jobs to help put Americans back to work. It will do\n\n[[Page S6726]]\n\n     so by increasing small business access to credit. You and \n     other supporters of the bill understand that even in these \n     challenging economic times, many small businesses are ready \n     to expand their operations but have not been able to borrow \n     the money they need to move forward. This legislation would \n     assist them by establishing a $30 billion lending pool for \n     small community banks that make loans to small businesses. It \n     also calls for increasing the limits on Small Business \n     Administration (SBA) loans available to small businesses.\n       Across our nation many local communities are suffering from \n     double digit unemployment. Every day mayors hear from \n     residents who have lost their jobs. They tell them they don't \n     want a hand out. They just want a decent paying job that will \n     enable them to support their families. Nationally and \n     locally, small businesses provide the vast majority of jobs \n     for local residents. By increasing small business access to \n     credit, this legislation will help create hundreds of \n     thousands of jobs for unemployed residents in local \n     communities across our nation.\n       Again, thank you for your support. Mayors stand ready to \n     work with you to ensure the immediate passage of this \n     important legislation. Please feel free to contact me or \n     Larry Jones of my staff if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Tom Cochran,\n                                       CEO and Executive Director.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. This recession is a national recession, but you feel it \nin every town, in every community, in every city where mayors and \nGovernors out there--Democrats and Republicans--are fighting every day \nto bring vitality back to their communities. This bill has the \npotential to help them, to be some wind under their wings and to get \nthis job done.\n  So I am proud to have the thousands of mayors in our country who have \nstepped up to support this legislation. I am also proud to have almost \n28, if not 30, Governors who have written personally, sometimes \nnumerous letters, to say they support this legislation.\n  I have used the time in conclusion to rebut the only article we know \nof that was a negative one. We have had many positive articles and \neditorials, and we are grateful because the bill is self-explanatory. \nThe one reporter who wrote, I thought, a very misleading story has \nretracted portions of it, which he admitted were not accurate, and I \nhave given the detail to rebut the other sections of his article. But \nwe continue to pick up endorsements.\n  The bill is bipartisan. We have to get Main Street moving again. When \nwe do--and only when we do--will this recession end and our \nconstituents can go back to work or they can fulfill their dreams to \nbuild a business of their own that can employ them and bring security, \nprosperity, and happiness to their families. But this Congress should \nact and we should act now--in the next 24 hours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the chair \nof the Small Business Committee for her continued advocacy on this \nissue. It is so important for us to help small businesses; that is, if \nyou believe they are the engine of economic growth for our economy, as \nI do, and as I think the chairwoman of the Small Business Committee \ndoes.\n  We know 75 percent of new job creation comes from small business. So \nwe can continue to talk about the economy, we can continue to debate it \nor we can get down to the business of helping small business, as this \nbill does by outlining three principal programs: tax credits for small \nbusinesses on depreciation to make new investments; an enhancement of \nthe 7(a) and 504 loan programs, which are successful programs for \nlending to small businesses where their capital has fallen off because \nthe program ended in June, so we basically have a lot less money for \nsmall businesses; and a small business lending program that could help \nsmall businesses grow and help our economy at this critical point in \ntime.\n  We are here tonight because we only have a few days left, but the \nchair of the Small Business Committee is not giving up on this issue \nand neither am I. I am saying it is important enough for us to stay and \nmake sure we get this legislation passed because we want to grow small \nbusinesses. I know my newspaper, the Seattle Times, had this to say: \n``Nothing should be more nonpartisan than putting people back to \nwork.''\n  I think that says it all. If you are down to this, a program that \ncould help grow small businesses, why would you be partisan at a time \nwhen our economy has huge unemployment and we have had such stagnant \ngrowth? Why would you continue being partisan instead of passing this \nlegislation?\n  In fact, I haven't actually heard people on the other side say if we \ngot through the cloture motion that they wouldn't support this \nlegislation. No one has come to the floor and said: I will not support \nthis legislation with this language in it. In fact, we have kind of had \npeople indicate the opposite. So if that is the case, let's have the \nvotes. Let's vote on this legislation and let's put people back to \nwork.\n  One of the important things I wish to talk about is this small \nbusiness bill is a lending program. As somebody said to me today: When \nyou can't figure out how to stop something, then make up something that \nit isn't and claim that it is. That is exactly what has been going on, \non the other side. They can't figure out a reason why they do not like \nthis, but if they can pretend it is TARP-like, then maybe they have a \nchance of defeating it.\n  Well, this is not TARP-like. This is a small business lending fund, \nwhich is a voluntary program for small businesses, and it uses \ncommunity banks as a conduit. So it is literally, if you will, similar \nto 7(a) and 504 programs in the sense that they are designed primarily \nto get capital to small business. Those two programs are direct lending \nprograms that help with the partnership of banks, and this is a program \nwe are creating--the Small Business Lending Fund--that helps, \nespecially given that during this huge economic downturn, two-thirds of \njob losses in America since 2008, because of the implosion, have \nimpacted small business the most. So when we look at all the job losses \nfrom 2008 to 2010, 81 percent of them are from small businesses.\n  So we can either design a program that is about helping to get \ncapital to small businesses and move our economy forward or we can go \nhome for the August recess and say we took partisan votes. I am for \ntrying to solve this problem.\n  What this is not is a TARP bill. I love the comparison people make, \nbecause I didn't support the TARP legislation. But just by comparison, \nTARP was an open-ended bailout of Wall Street firms. It basically was \nthe U.S. Government buying toxic assets. That is what it was. I call \nit, at times, a blank check, and being able to say no strings attached \nto firms that were failing and then actually get assistance from the \ngovernment. In fact, if you look at it more specifically, TARP was an \nopen-ended bailout. It basically said: Here are the resources--targeted \nat Wall Street. It bought toxic assets. The banks weren't viable. They \nbasically got the revenue because people were concerned they were \nfailing. Today's estimates are--we don't know what tomorrow's estimates \nwill be--that it basically cost the taxpayers $100 billion.\n  So none of these things are what the Small Business Lending Fund is. \nThe Small Business Lending Fund isn't a bailout, it isn't targeted at \nWall Street, it doesn't buy toxic assets, it is not for banks that are \nnot viable, and it doesn't cost the taxpayers any money.\n  So the other side is just trying to say this because they do not have \nanything else to say about this program. What they need to be able to \ndo is to explain to their constituents why we have lost so many jobs \nwith small businesses and we don't have a proposal on the table to help \ngrow small businesses.\n  But I will tell you what this Small Business Lending Fund is: It is a \nprogram that is lending to small businesses, it is targeted at Main \nStreet, it increases lending instead of buying toxic assets. TARP was \njust about buying toxic assets. This is about saying to banks: Show us \na plan. If you have a plan on how you are going to increase lending to \nsmall businesses, then we will give you access to capital. So nothing \ncould be further from the way TARP worked. TARP bought toxic assets and \nbailed out banks with no strings attached, and this is a lending \nprogram. The banks have to be healthy and viable. Nobody asked AIG or \nCitigroup or Goldman Sachs if they were viable. They just wrote a \ncheck. In fact, here you have to prove you are viable. This actually \nsaves taxpayers money; that is, in essence, the Federal Government is \ngoing to be making\n\n[[Page S6727]]\n\nloans available to small businesses and they will have to pay for that \naccess to capital. That payment back to us is expected to generate over \n$1 billion.\n  So nothing could be further from the truth in how these two programs \nwork. The bottom line is back to that small business job loss and how \nwe are going to actually increase job growth for the future. I actually \nthink this number is quite significant for our economy and that if we \nwant to help small business, we will get them capital.\n  One banker from my State sent a message to me and said this:\n\n       We would absolutely use the funds for small business \n     lending. Our bank has a backlog of $50 million to $70 million \n     of loan requests, which is counter to statements of soft loan \n     demand. We have reduced our lending to preserve capital as \n     expected by the regulators.\n\n  They did that because that is what regulators expected. He went on to \nsay:\n\n       This legislation would give us the capital to significantly \n     increase lending.\n\n  That is a banker from my State. So that is what they are up against. \nThey know this program will help them with the backlog of requests they \nhave and the requirements they also have from regulators to keep \ncapital and to have reserves. So this is about getting small business \nlending flowing.\n  When we think about the fact that this will generate, as some people \nsay, an estimated $300 billion of stimulus to our economy, it is \ncritical we get this program going. We have experienced six straight \nquarters of decline in overall commercial and industrial lending, and \nthe total cumulative decline in the fourth quarter from 2008 until 2010 \nof March of this year has been a 20-percent drop--over $315 billion \ntaken out of our economy.\n  So we can do something in the next couple days, if my colleagues will \nshow the dedication of breaking partisan gridlock and also the \ncommitment to stay here to get this legislation done. We can start to \ngive hope to small businesses.\n  My colleague mentioned all the small business organizations that \nsupport this legislation. I would like to point out, some people say \nthis might be about banks or it might be about community organizations. \nIt is not. We are working with them because this program is designed to \nuse them as a conduit, but we are tonight talking about this because we \nare talking about small businesses. We are talking about the gentleman \nfrom Mississippi who sent a letter to the chairwoman. We are talking \nabout people who do not have a hired lobbyist back here representing \nthem to go up and down the halls. They are depending on us.\n  We have heard these stories throughout America, of businesses not \ngetting access to capital, of people having performing loans cut right \nout from under them, of people who had a bank that was basically \nproviding small business capital who cut that access to capital and \nthey had to do all sorts of things to keep their businesses going.\n  We can continue to have job loss in America or we can start creating \njobs and do so by investing in small businesses. I hope we will get \nthis legislation moving in the next 2 days; that we will be able to \nbasically overcome the partisan gridlock. As the Seattle Times said, \n``There is nothing that should be more nonpartisan than putting people \nback to work.'' I could not agree more. So I hope we get this \nlegislation passed in the next 2 days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I understand the time controlled by the Democrats is \ncoming quickly to an end. I ask for 2 more minutes, if that is OK, to \nwrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Five minutes. That is great.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington, who has been a partner on this \nbill with me from day one. She is a member of the Small Business \nCommittee, quite an expert in the field of small business financing \nhaving built her own small business successfully and helped many others \nto build others. She brings that expertise to the Senate. I appreciate \nher focus and commitment.\n  Together with some of our other colleagues we have worked the extra \nhours and time, and we are still hopeful that we can get this bill done \nbefore we leave for the August break to go home and work in our States \nthrough that time.\n  I want to read just another short paragraph into the record. This is \ngoing to appear, I understand, in the Wall Street Journal tomorrow. I \nreceived a copy of it today. It is going to be in response to a \nwrongheaded editorial by the Wall Street Journal. They entitled their \neditorial a couple of days ago, ``Son Of TARP.''\n  As Senator Cantwell from Washington said, this doesn't look like \nTARP, it doesn't walk like TARP, it is not TARP. But there are a few \ncritics out there who, because they cannot say anything bad about it, \nwant to put a bad name on it and scare people away.\n  This gentleman, Mr. Richard Neiman, let me say, first, is a \nsuperintendent of banks for the State of New York. He knows something \nabout them, and is a member of the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel. \nSo he most certainly understands TARP since he is an overseer of TARP. \nI think he would know if this was TARP, but this is what he writes--\n``Small Business Lending Fund Will Help Recovery, Jobs.''\n\n       Your editorial, ``Son of TARP'' [on] July 30 is \n     unfortunately titled, and underestimates the potential of the \n     proposed Small Business Lending Fund.\n       Small business growth is the only way out of this \n     recession, yet our entrepreneurs are not being provided the \n     credit they need, as the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel \n     often hears from small business owners. Our recent report on \n     the issue demonstrates that, during the crisis, lending to \n     small business fell by 9 percent at our Nation's largest \n     banks. . . .\n\n  In other words, the Nation's big banks took the TARP money and cut \nlending to small businesses. That is what happened. This bill is to \nreverse that and to give small banks a fighting chance, and small \nbusinesses, to get a voluntary lending fund to start flowing capital to \nsmall business. He says:\n\n       Unlike TARP, the SBOF would incentivize banks to lend by \n     lowering the dividend rate at which banks must repay the \n     government if banks meet lending performance metrics. \n     Further, the SBLF removes the TARP stigma that discouraged \n     small banks from participating in government program. . . .\n       The SBLF is not a sequel to TARP,\n\n  It is not the son of TARP, it is not the daughter of TARP----\n\n     but it can be a segue toward a stronger future for our \n     Nation's small businesses and their employees.\n\n  I could not have said that better myself. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave the letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Small Business Lending Fund Will Help Recovery, Jobs\n\n       Your editorial, ``Son of TARP'' (July 30) is unfortunately \n     titled, and underestimates the potential of the proposed \n     Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF).\n       Small business growth is the only way out of this \n     recession. Yet our entrepreneurs are not being provided the \n     credit they need, as the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel \n     often hears from small business owners. Our recent report on \n     the issue demonstrates that, during the crisis, lending to \n     small businesses fell by 9% at our nation's largest banks, \n     and the bankruptcy of nonbank business lenders such as the \n     CIT Group has further limited credit options.\n       The financial crisis and recession have created the lack of \n     demand for credit that your editorial points out, but it is \n     as important to point out the lack of supply. Small banks are \n     reluctant to take on more risk when small businesses' \n     customer base is weak. Breaking this stalemate requires old-\n     fashioned underwriting to identify the good deals which are \n     still waiting to be made.\n       The SBLF is intended to provide public-sector support to \n     bring credit- and lending-worthy parties back to the table. \n     Unlike TARP, the SBLF would incentivize banks to lend by \n     lowering the dividend rate at which banks must repay the \n     government if the banks meet lending performance metrics. \n     Further, the SBLF removes the TARP stigma that discouraged \n     small banks from participating in government programs that \n     support lending. It is these banks that are the primary \n     source of credit for small businesses which lack the same \n     access to capital markets as large companies.\n       The SBLF is not a sequel to TARP, but it can be a segue \n     toward a stronger future for our nation's small businesses \n     and their employees.\n                                                Richard H. Neiman,\n                                                         New York.\n\n\n                         The Pigford Settlement\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. In my final minute I would like to change subjects and \nspeak about another subject that is very important to people in \nLouisiana, particularly to some of my African-\n\n[[Page S6728]]\n\nAmerican farmers and the small communities that they primarily reside \nin throughout my State.\n  These are farmers who were blatantly discriminated against in the \nlast several decades. We have a bill right here before us. It is \nreferred to as the Pigford settlement. This group of farmers took their \ngrievances to the courts. Before they could get a final judgment from \nthe courts, the Justice Department stepped in and smartly attempted to \nsettle this situation because the Federal Government is probably going \nto be very liable for past discriminations that were blatant and \nproven.\n  We came up with a fair way to solve this issue, to get money to many \nAfrican-American farmers. We have acknowledged there were some wrong \nthings done by the Department of Agriculture and by the Federal \nGovernment. We want to try to make amends. We cannot make everything \nright and everything perfect, but the Pigford settlement is a fair and \njust resolution to this issue. One thousand African-American farmers in \nLouisiana would be benefited by this settlement.\n  Again, this is being held up. I don't understand why, but I wanted to \nlend my voice to say that this settlement is not just about correcting \npast wrongs but about ensuring future prosperity. It is time for \nCongress to end the 12-year delay and approve this settlement as \nquickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RICHARDSON\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of my \nfriend, a consummate civil servant and respected legal mind, ``CJ'' \nWilliam S. Richardson.\n  Bill Richardson was born into a working class family of mixed ethnic \nheritage representative of Hawaii's community. He was part Native \nHawaiian, part Chinese, and part Caucasian. From these humble \nbeginnings, one of Hawaii's greatest figures emerged. Like many men in \nmy generation, Bill fought in World War II, serving as a platoon leader \nfor the U.S. Army; he would later be inducted into the Infantry Officer \nCandidate School Hall of Fame. This was just one of many achievements \nin a life filled with distinction: Bill served as chairman of Hawaii's \nDemocratic Party from 1956 to 1962, providing strong advocacy for \nstatehood, which Hawaii achieved in 1959. From 1962 to 1966, he served \nas the State's Lieutenant Governor. In 1966, Bill became the first \nNative Hawaiian to serve as Chief Justice of the Hawaii State Supreme \nCourt. As ``CJ,'' he deftly blended Hawaii's history and cultural \npractices with modern law, establishing a traditional Hawaiian \nunderstanding of water rights as the law of the land, and demanding \npublic access to Hawaii's shoreline.\n  Yet his dedication to Hawaii did not stop at writing landmark legal \nopinions that redefined the State. It was Bill Richardson who \nrecognized the need to build a law school in Hawaii. He was dedicated \nto creating more, and better, educational and professional \nopportunities for Hawaii. In keeping with his personal and legal \nopinions, he remained focused on the need for such opportunities within \nHawaii's most disadvantaged communities. With this vision, and by his \nperseverance, Bill worked with Hawaii's legislature to open Hawaii's \nfirst, and only, law school in 1973. The school, appropriately named \nthe William S. Richardson School of Law after its greatest champion, \nhas committed itself to educating attorneys from places as close as \nHonolulu and as far away as Thailand, with a clear focus on educating \nthe Pacific's traditionally disadvantaged groups. The school continues \nto follow Bill's vision: to promote justice, ethical responsibility and \npublic service. The law school was, perhaps, Bill's best and most \nprofound achievement.\n  Bill passed away on June 21, 2010, at the age of 90. Although I am \nsaddened by my friend's passing, I am comforted by knowing that his \nlegacy will live on through his family, his work, and the thousands of \nattorneys educated by the school bearing his name.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "04", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/04/senate-section/article/S6728-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COSPONSORSHIP CORRECTION\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, late last month I had the honor and the \nprivilege to be in Sitka, AK, to honor the crew of a U.S. Coast Guard \nhelicopter that went down in the waters off of the State of Washington. \nThat helicopter was based at the Coast Guard Air Station Sitka.\n  On Monday, it was my sad duty to attend yet another memorial service. \nA service to honor the crew of the Air Force C-17 Globemaster that \ncrashed on Thursday evening shortly after takeoff from Elmendorf Air \nForce Base. Quite coincidentally, that C-17 aircraft bore the call sign \n``Sitka 43.''\n  The C-17 crash took the lives of four of Alaska's finest airmen. MAJ \nAaron Malone, age 36, who went by the nickname ``Zippy.'' MAJ Michael \nFreyholtz, age 34, CAPT Jeffrey Hill, age 31 and SMSgt Tom Cicardo, age \n47.\n  Major Malone, Major Freyholtz and Senior Master Sergeant Cicardo were \nmembers of the 249th Airlift Squadron of the Alaska Air National Guard. \nCaptain Hill was active duty Air Force. He served with the 517th \nAirlift Squadron at Elmendorf.\n  The C-17 mission at Elmendorf is operated as an active Air Force/Air \nNational Guard association.\n  As our colleague Senator Begich noted on the floor, each was \nexemplary in his own right.\n  Zippy Malone was the unofficial morale officer. Michael Freyholtz \nbegan his career in the C-17 right out of pilot training. He was known \nas the best C-17 demonstration pilot around. But that is hardly his \ngreatest accomplishment. Major Freyholtz flew 608 combat missions in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  Jeffrey Hill began his career as an enlisted man at Elmendorf. He was \nknown as a phenomenal airman and maintainer. He earned his commission \nin 2002 and was a top instructor pilot. Yet he never forgot from where \nhe came. An inspiration to the enlisted airmen, he reinvigorated the \nbooster club and motivated young airmen to get and stay fit.\n  Tom Cicardo gave more than 28 years in the service of his Nation. He \nwas a soldier, a marine, and an airman. His peers described him as \n``old school.'' He was one of the Air Force's premier loadmasters. \nDuring his first 11 years in the Alaska Air Guard he was involved in 58 \nsearch and rescue missions in the State of Alaska where he was credited \nwith saving 66 lives. He also flew combat search and rescue missions in \nAfghanistan and personnel recovery missions in the Horn of Africa.\n  And each of these exemplary servicemembers lived their lives in \nAlaska to the fullest. Major Malone and Major Freyholtz coached Little \nLeague. Captain Hill was always traveling off-road, hunting and \nfishing, camping and hiking. They leave behind children, spouses, and \nloved ones.\n  Sitka 43 went down Thursday evening while on a training mission.\n\n[[Page S6729]]\n\nThey were preparing to participate in the Arctic Thunder air show--an \nopen house at Elmendorf Air Force base that draws hundreds of thousands \nof Alaskans, which was scheduled for last weekend.\n  After consulting with the families, the Air Force decided that Arctic \nThunder would go on as scheduled. Alaskans rewarded that decision with \na recordbreaking turnout. About 200,000 Alaskans came out to the base. \nMany stopped to pay their respects to the crew of Sitka 43 at a \nmakeshift memorial erected next to a static display of a C-17 aircraft.\n  They were guardsmen, airmen, wingmen, leaders, and warriors. But \nabove all else that they were aviators. This fact was driven home to \nall of us at Monday's memorial service by a poster erected between the \nphotos of our fallen airmen and the memorial wreathes. That poster \nread, ``To most people the sky's the limit. To those who love aviation \nthe sky is home.''\n  On behalf of all of our Senate colleagues, I extend our Nation's \ngratitude to the crew of Sitka 43. To their loved ones and to their Air \nForce colleagues, we extend our deepest sympathies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "04", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/04/senate-section/article/S6729-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SIMON ``CY'' V. AVARA\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I pay special tribute to \nSimon ``Cy'' Avara on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his \nbusiness, the Avara International Academy of Hair Design and \nTechnology.\n  Cy was born in Baltimore where his parents, Vincent and Mary, were \nworking-class Italian Americans. Cy grew up watching his father work as \na neighborhood barber. When Cy was 14 years old his father died in a \ntragic car accident. He decided to follow in his father's footsteps \nand, after a period of apprenticeship, he passed the Maryland State \nBoard Barber's exam. At age 16, he opened up his own barbershop, \ncharging 60 cents for a man's haircut.\n  He closed the barber shop for 2 years when he was drafted and served \nwith the U.S. Army in Korea. After the war, Cy returned to Baltimore to \nestablish an upscale salon to showcase his barbering talents. But his \nreal satisfaction came from teaching others how to cut and style hair. \nHe enjoyed helping others develop a skill that they could use \nthroughout their lives to support themselves and their families. In \n1960, he opened the Avara International Academy of Hair Design and \nTechnology in his southwest Baltimore neighborhood. His school was so \nsuccessful that he was able to acquire another school in Dundalk, \nBaltimore County, 10 years later.\n  Cy has been recognized as a leader in his profession and he has used \nhis knowledge of the industry to advocate for barbers and stylists. He \nhas served in several posts over the course of his career, including \nsecretary-treasurer of the International Barber School Association, \nnational president of Barber Examiners, and founder and chairman of the \nMaryland Hair Designers Association. But most important, while the \nsouthwest Baltimore and Dundalk neighborhoods have fallen on hard \ntimes, the Avara International Academy of Hair Design and Technology \nhas remained as a beacon of hope and opportunity.\n  As a child, Cy was raised to appreciate his blessings and to help \nothers who were less fortunate. His father gave haircuts to people who \nwanted to make a good impression so they could get a job; his mother \ngave out food to those in need in their neighborhood. Cy never forgot \nthese lessons in generosity. For more than 40 years, he has been deeply \ninvolved with St. Vincent's Center for Abused and Neglected Children, \nregularly sending his barber students to cut the children's hair. He \nhas also been a major contributor to the Ed Block Courage Award \nFoundation, which was started by one of his former barber students, Sam \nLamantia, to honor professional football players who have overcome \nadversity and contributed to the betterment of their community.\n  On August 29, 2010, Cy will hold a Cut-AThon fundraiser to celebrate \nhis special anniversary. The proceeds from the event will benefit the \nEd Block Courage Award Foundation which supports the St. Vincent Center \nfor Abused and Neglected Children.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me today to salute Simon ``Cy'' Avara; \nhis wife Rita; his sons Michael Thomas, and Lawrence; and his daughter \nSusan in celebration of their achievements as humanitarians and \nentrepreneurs on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the founding \nthe Avara International Academy of Hair Design and Technology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "04", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/04/senate-section/article/S6729-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6729-S6730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KAY SIGGINS\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I greatly appreciate having this \nopportunity to bring to the Senate's attention a remarkable citizen of \nWyoming and the United States on the occasion of her 107th birthday. \nHer name is Kay Siggins, and she is a resident of Cody, WY.\n  Over the years, Kay has seen it all--the beginnings of aviation, the \nintroduction of the automobile to everyday life, the Great Depression, \ntwo World Wars, the birth of the computer, the advent of television, \nthe evolution of radio, the start of the space program, the landing on \nthe Moon, and so much more. In a very real sense, for all she has seen \nand done, she is a walking history book.\n  The great adventure of Kay's life began when she was born on August \n12, 1903, in Medford, MA. After she had completed her school years, she \ntook a job in the State's education system and soon became her school's \nacting principal, in charge of the education of about 3,000 students. \nIt was right around then that she and a friend traveled west to stay as \na guest at the Triangle X Dude Ranch in Wyoming. I believe that must \nhave been the start of her great affection and regard for the West and \nWyoming, for in the years to come she would often return there to visit \nand enjoy all that the West has to offer.\n  Then, with the 1940s, the winds of war began to blow. Kay decided to \njoin the Navy. She became a commissioned officer and was soon placed in \ncharge of the WAVES Boot Camp. Later, as a lieutenant, she was assigned \nto the Great Lakes Naval Training Center and placed in charge of the \nCenter's WAVES barracks. She stayed on Active Duty for several years, \nafter which she joined the Reserves. She continued to serve in that \ncapacity until she retired with the rank of commander.\n  Anyone else would have been satisfied to call it a career at that \npoint but not Kay. She was just getting started. Kay decided that the \ntime had come to head West and see what life was like out there. \nUnfortunately, she must have had a problem with her compass for she \nwound up not in Wyoming but in Green Valley, AZ, where she made her \nhome.\n  Actually, Green Valley was more of her home base as she pursued her \ngoal of visiting all the States. It seemed that she was always on the \nroad heading to points north, south, east, or west. She would get her \nmotor home ready, hop aboard, and hit the highway. It wasn't long \nbefore she had seen every State that way but Hawaii. She eventually \nmade it there too. She also headed up north to visit Alaska not once \nbut twice, just to experience what life was like up there.\n  As the years continued to roll by, I have to think that the urge to \ncome home to Wyoming and relive those days on the Dude ranch was just \ntoo strong. She was a young 70ish lady and full of adventure and a love \nof life. She caught the eye of Raymond Siggins, who lived there, and \nthey were soon married.\n  A check of the records shows that Kay is now believed to be the \noldest female military veteran in America, the senior statesman of our \nArmed Forces. She may be the oldest veteran in terms of age, but she is \nthe youngest in spirit--and she will always be so. That is why Kay has \nalways been so successful. She has always led the best way--by \nexample--at everything she did, and because that is the way she lived \nher life, she was able to blaze a trail and leave a path for others to \nfollow.\n  There are always lessons we can learn from how someone else has lived \ntheir life. Kay has taught us all the wisdom of the old adage \nattributed to Abraham Lincoln: It is not the years in your life, it is \nthe life in your years. For Kay, both have been extraordinary.\n\n[[Page S6730]]\n\n  I have often said that there is something magical about living in \nWyoming. The way I see it, although Kay is celebrating her 107th \nbirthday, since she moved to Wyoming when she was in her seventies, she \nis only in her thirties in Wyoming years.\n  Happy Birthday, Kay. Wyoming couldn't be more proud of you. Because \nof you and your service for so many years of a very wonderful and \nproductive life, our Nation is a much better place to live--from coast \nto coast. You have made a difference wherever you have been, and we \nhope you continue to enjoy every day of your life in Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "04", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/04/senate-section/article/S6730-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING ECCO, INC.\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I recognize ECCO, Inc., a \nwonderful organization based in Madison, SD, that provides support \nservices for people with disabilities. ECCO has steadily grown in the \nlast 35 years to become a thriving center for employment and housing \nassistance.\n  In its beginning, the organization was a day program serving four \nindividuals; however, with hard work and a devotion to serving others, \nECCO has grown dramatically. Currently it is able to provide a 24-hour \nsupport staff to individuals throughout the community. ECCO's 91 full-\ntime and part-time employees work to see that all individuals are able \nto maintain their independence. Sixty-eight people receive services \nfrom ECCO, and half of those live in ECCO housing. With three group \nhomes and an apartment building, ECCO strives to make sure all citizens \nare able to have their own lives.\n  To celebrate reaching its 35th anniversary, ECCO will have an open \nhouse August 6 with tours of the main building. I am proud to recognize \nthis organization and all the people who have made it a success. The \ngoals of ECCO are praiseworthy, and I am thankful we have such a \nwonderful organization serving the Madison area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "04", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/04/senate-section/article/S6730-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING ROBERT HICKS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it brings me great sadness that I \ncome to the Senate floor today to reflect upon the passing of Robert \nHicks, a lion in the Louisiana civil rights movement whose legal \nvictories helped topple segregation in Bogalusa and change \ndiscriminatory employment practices throughout the South, passed away \nTuesday, April 13, in his home at the age of 81.\n  Born in Mississippi, but moved to Bogalusa at a young age, Robert \nHicks was the youngest of three children born to Quitman and Maybell \nHicks in 1929. He graduated from Central Memorial High School, where he \nplayed on the school's State champion football team. He later played \noffensive guard on The Bushmen, an all-Black semipro team.\n  Mr. Hicks began his civil rights work as a member of the local NAACP \nbefore working with the Voter and Civic League. He helped organize \ndaily marches to protest racial discrimination by merchants and city \ngovernment in a crusade that thrust Bogalusa into the national \nspotlight. The Hicks family opened their home to White civil rights \nworkers and national figures. Because of this, the family was targeted \nby the Ku Klux Klan, which in turn motivated the formation of the \nDeacons for Defense and Justice, an armed band of African-American men \nwho stood guard at the Hicks' home and protected civil rights workers \nin the city. The 2003 Showtime movie ``Deacons of Defense'' was loosely \nbased on the group.\n  As fellow civil rights worker Peter Jan Honigsberg wrote in his \nmemoir recalling his experience volunteering in Bogalusa in the summers \nof 1966 and 1967 about Hicks, ``Even today I still think of him . . . \nHe was determined to do what he had to do to change the South.'' Mr. \nHicks filed a landmark lawsuit against the city and police department \nof Bogalusa, obtaining a Federal court order requiring the police to \nprotect protest marchers, and a lawsuit that overturned officials' \nrefusal to allow protest marchers. In 1967, Mr. Hicks filed a suit \nagainst the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing, which resulted \nin the prohibition of the construction of public housing in segregated \nneighborhoods in Bogalusa.\n  Mr. Hicks began working at Crown Zellerbach, the local paper mill, at \na time when few Black people were employed there and eventually he \nserved as president of the Brotherhood of Pulp, Sulphite and Paper Mill \nWorkers. After fighting Crown Zellerbach for years in Federal court, \nMr. Hicks became the company's first African-American supervisor, a \nposition he held until his retirement.\n  Mr. Hicks and his wife Valeria had six children during their 62-year \nunion. With his wife, Mr. Hicks traveled the country, spreading the \nword about the conditions for Black people in the South and encouraging \npeople to travel to Bogalusa and other Southern cities to campaign for \ncivil rights. Besides his wife, thoughts and prayers go out to his \nsurvivors, including a daughter, Barbara Maria Hicks; three sons, \nRobert Lawrence, Gregory Vince, and Darryl Hicks; a sister, Grace \nBerry; 17 grandchildren; and 14 great-grandchildren. The work of Robert \nHicks will be forever remembered by the Bogalusa community, which is \nrenaming a street and holding a ceremony in his honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "04", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/04/senate-section/article/S6730-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   2010 CAVE CITY WATERMELON FESTIVAL\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, today I congratulate the \nresidents of Hope in my home State of Arkansas as they celebrate the \nannual Hope Watermelon Festival, a time-honored tradition that \ncommemorates the history and technique of watermelon growing and its \nimportance to the local community.\n  Home to the world's largest watermelon, Hope is a thriving community \nin southwest Arkansas. Since the 1920s, Hope residents and other \nArkansans have gathered to take part in the Watermelon Festival.\n  According to event organizers, the early Watermelon Festivals bear \nlittle resemblance to those in recent years. During the 1920s era, \ncitizens served ice-cold watermelon to passengers on the many trains \nthat stopped in Hope. These early festivals brought upwards of 20,000 \npeople in a day to Hope. The end to the first festivals came around \n1931 when the city, suffering from the effects of the Depression, could \nno longer accommodate the crowds.\n  In 1975, the city of Hope celebrated its centennial anniversary, \nwhich prompted local residents to consider staging the Watermelon \nFestival once again. Since the 1970s, the festival has continued to \ngrow, attracting approximately 50,000 visitors to Hope over a 4-day \nperiod each year.\n  I am looking forward to attending this year's Watermelon Festival, \nwhich will take place August 12-14 at Fair Parkin Hope. Sponsored by \nthe Hope-Hempstead County Chamber of Commerce, this year's event \nfeatures southwest Arkansas's largest arts and crafts show, live music, \na 5K run/walk, games and children's activities, food, an antique car \nshow, and of course, ice-cold Hope watermelon by the slice.\n  Mr. President, I salute the entire community of Hope and Hempstead \nCounty as they celebrate this annual event and enjoy ``a slice of the \ngood life.'' I commend them for keeping the history and heritage of \ntheir community alive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "04", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/04/senate-section/article/S6730-5", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6730-S6731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HUMANE SOCIETY OF PULASKI COUNTY\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

I commend them for reaching \nthis milestone.\n  The mission of the Humane Society of Pulaski County is to rescue, \ncare for and find homes for abandoned, abused, homeless and unwanted \nanimals. The group provides access to healthy animals for people \nseeking to adopt pets. In 2009, the Humane Society of Pulaski County \nadopted out almost 1,000 animals.\n  The Humane Society of Pulaski County is supported solely by \ndonations, fund-raisers, bequests and grants. The group has achieved a \n4-star rating from Charity Navigator, which means the smallest \npercentage of donations is allocated for administrative costs.\n  As a part of the ``Puppy Love'' program, the Humane Society also \nworks throughout the community, taking animals to visit residents of \nnursing homes, retirement centers, and women's shelters. Puppy Love \nmakes approximately 40 visits to local facilities each year.\n  Mr. President, I again congratulate the staff and volunteers of the \nHumane Society of Pulaski County as they celebrate this anniversary.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Hawaii urging Congress to \n     expedite the processing of all claims for payment, and the \n     distribution of checks to Filipino veterans under ARRA; to \n     the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 82\n\n       Whereas, during World War II, the Philippines was a United \n     States commonwealth; and\n       Whereas, in 1941, 250,000 Filipino soldiers volunteered \n     their services after being promised full veterans benefits to \n     volunteer to fight for the United States against the \n     potential threat of Japan; and\n       Whereas, on December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor \n     and on December 8, bombed the United States military bases in \n     the Philippines; and\n       Whereas, tens of thousands of Filipino men and women risked \n     their lives against the invading Japanese forces and assisted \n     our nation in its efforts to liberate the Philippines; and\n       Whereas, on April 9, 1942, the United States retreated from \n     the Philippines, and during the Bataan Death March, thousands \n     of American and Filipino prisoners of war died as they \n     traveled to Japanese prisoners of war camps; and\n       Whereas, on September 2, 1945, Japan surrendered the \n     Philippines to America; and\n       Whereas, in February 1946, Congress enacted the Recission \n     Act, denying World War II Filipino veterans rights to \n     veterans benefits like healthcare, disability pensions, and \n     burial expenses; and\n       Whereas, over the years, Congress has considered \n     legislation to restore the benefits denied to Filipino \n     veterans and even received encouraging words from Presidents \n     George W. Bush and Bill Clinton to fulfill the broken \n     promises made by the United States government; and\n       Whereas, more than 60 years later, in 2009, President Obama \n     signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), and \n     a provision tucked inside this stimulus bill finally called \n     for releasing $198,000,000 for lump sum payments to Filipino \n     veterans in lieu of pensions; and\n       Whereas, one year later, although today only about 11,000 \n     veterans now in their 80s and 90s are still alive to collect \n     these payments, some Filipino veterans are still waiting for \n     the promised checks; and\n       Whereas, in Hawaii, there are about 400 Filipino veterans \n     qualified for payments under ARRA, and about 15 percent are \n     still waiting for their checks and about 20 percent have \n     claims that are still pending; and\n       Whereas, according to Senator Daniel Inouye, it is ``a \n     matter of honor'' to correct this injustice to Filipino \n     veterans who served our nation so courageously, so many of \n     whom have died waiting for what was promised them: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     fifth Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2010, That the President of the United States and United \n     States Congress are urged to expedite the processing of all \n     claims for payment, and the distribution of checks to \n     Filipino veterans under ARRA, which are already long overdue; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That even payment of these claims does not \n     correct the injustice and discrimination done 60 years ago \n     but is a small step in making reparations; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, President \n     pro tempore of the United States Senate, Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, each member of \n     Hawaii's Congressional Delegation, the Director of the United \n     States Department of Veterans Affairs, the Director of the \n     Hawaii Office of Veterans Services, and the President of the \n     Philippines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "04", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/04/senate-section/article/S6734-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6734-S6736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive reports of nominations were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LEVIN for the Committee on Armed Services.\n       *Jonathan Woodson, of Massachusetts, to be an Assistant \n     Secretary of Defense.\n       *Neile L.

A bill to amend the Public Health Services Act to provide \nfor integration of mental health services and mental health treatment \noutreach teams, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMaryland, Senator Mikulski, in introducing the Positive Aging Act, \nwhich will help to increase older Americans' access to quality mental \nhealth screening and treatment services in community-based care \nsettings.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is particularly important \nfor states like Maine that have a disproportionate number of older \npersons. Fifteen percent of Maine's population is 65 or older, and, \nwith the highest median age, Maine is the ``oldest'' State in the \nnation. Moreover, our percentage of older adults is increasing, and, by \n2036 more than 1 in 5 Mainers will be over the age of 65.\n  One of the most daunting public health challenges facing our nation \ntoday is how to increase access to quality mental health services for \nthe more than 44 million Americans with severe, disabling mental \ndisorders that can devastate their lives and the lives of the people \naround them.\n  What is often overlooked, however, is the prevalence of mental \nillness among our Nation's elderly. Studies have shown that more than 1 \nin 5 Americans aged 65 and older experience mental illness, and that as \nmany as 80 percent of elderly persons in nursing homes suffer from some \nkind of mental impairment. Particularly disturbing is the fact that the \nmental health needs of older Americans are often overlooked or not \nrecognized because of the mistaken belief that they are a normal part \nof aging and therefore cannot be treated.\n  While older Americans experience the full range of mental disorders, \nthe most prevalent mental illness afflicting older people is \ndepression. Ironically, while recent advances have made depression an \neminently treatable disorder, only a minority of elderly depressed \npersons are receiving adequate treatment. Unfortunately, the vast \nmajority of depressed elderly don't seek help. Many simply accept their \nfeelings of profound sadness and do not realize that they are \nclinically depressed.\n  Moreover those who do seek help are often underdiagnosed or \nmisdiagnosed, leading the National Institute of Mental Health to \nestimate that 60 percent of older Americans with depression are not \nreceiving the mental health care that they need. Failure to treat this \nkind of disorder leads to poorer health outcomes for other medical \nconditions, higher rates of institutionalization, and increased health \ncare costs.\n  Fortunately, important research is being done that is developing \ninnovative approaches to improve the delivery of mental health care for \nolder adults by integrating it into primary care settings. This \nresearch demonstrates that older adults are more likely to receive \nappropriate mental health care if there is a mental health professional \non the primary care team, rather than simply referring them to a mental \nhealth specialist outside the primary care setting. Multiple \nappointments with multiple providers in multiple settings simply don't \nwork for older patients who must also cope with concurrent chronic \nillnesses, mobility problems, and limited transportation options. The \nresearch also shows that there is less stigma associated with \npsychiatric services when they are integrated into general medical \ncare.\n  The Positive Aging Act builds upon this research and authorizes \nfunding for projects that integrate mental health screening and \ntreatment services into community sites and primary care settings. \nSpecifically, the Positive Aging Act of 2010 would authorize the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to fund \ndemonstration projects to support integration of mental health services \nin primary care settings. It would also support grants for community-\nbased mental health treatment outreach teams to improve older \nAmericans' access to mental health services. To ensure that these \ngeriatric mental health programs have proper attention and oversight, \nit would mandate the designation of a Deputy Director for Older Adult \nMental Health Services in the Center for Mental Health Services, and it \nwould also include representatives of older Americans or their families \nand geriatric mental health professionals on the Advisory Council for \nthe Center for Mental Health Services. Finally, it would require state \nplans under Community Mental Health Services Block Grants to include \ndescriptions of the states' outreach to and services for older \nindividuals.\n  We are fortunate today to have a variety of effective treatments to \naddress the mental health needs of American seniors. The Positive Aging \nAct will help to ensure that older Americans have access to these \nimportant services. I therefore urge my colleagues to sign on as \ncosponsors of the legislation, which has been endorsed by a number of \nmental health and senior organizations, including the Alzheimer's \nAssociation, the American Geriatrics Society, the American Psychiatric \nAssociation, the American Psychological Association, the American \nAssociation for Geriatric Psychiatry, and the National Alliance on \nMental Illness.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 3703. A bill to expand the research, prevention, and awareness \nactivities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the \nNational Institutes of Health with respect to pulmonary fibrosis, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Pulmonary \nFibrosis Research Enhancement Act. Even though pulmonary fibrosis, or \nPF, kills almost as many people as breast cancer every year, it has not \nreceived the attention it deserves.\n  Imagine being told by a doctor that you have a life-threatening \ndisease with no known cure, no consistent standard of care, and no \nreliable prognosis. Though environmental factors, including \noccupational exposure to pollutants, are believed to play a role in its \nonset, PF has no strong demographic profile. In most cases, the doctor \ncan't even tell you what has caused you to get sick. That is exactly \nthe situation faced by the 48,000 people who are diagnosed with PF \nevery year in the United States.\n  Pulmonary fibrosis attacks the lungs, causing them to stiffen, \nthicken, and scar. As the disease progresses, it becomes harder and \nharder for oxygen to enter the bloodstream to feed the brain and other \nvital organs. Currently, the median survival rate for a person with PF \nis only around three years, and the disease kills roughly 40,000 people \nevery year in the United States. That translates into someone with PF \ndying every 13 minutes.\n  Perhaps the core obstacle in the fight against PF is how shockingly \nlittle we know about the disease. Because the research on PF is still \nin its infancy and awareness of PF is less than it needs to be, more \nthan half of the cases are initially misdiagnosed. The Pulmonary \nFibrosis Research Enhancement Act will start shedding light on PF so \nthat researchers and doctors can start to figure out how to treat it \neffectively. This bill will also make sure health care professionals \nhave the information they need to make accurate diagnoses of their \npatients, catching PF in the early stages and allowing for earlier \ntreatment.\n  The Pulmonary Fibrosis Research Enhancement Act will do two major \nthings to bolster efforts against this disease.\n  First, the act will establish the National Pulmonary Fibrosis \nAdvisory Board. The Advisory Board is charged with consulting with and \nadvising the Director of the Centers for Disease Control to create a \nNational Pulmonary Fibrosis Action Plan and with presenting the plan to \nCongress within one year of the bill's passage. Members\n\n[[Page S6739]]\n\nof this Advisory Board will come from government agencies, volunteer \nhealth organizations, patients and patient advocates, and leading \nscientists.\n  Second, the act will create the first National PF Registry to gather \nthe data about PF prevalence, risk factors, and development that will \nhelp scientists make progress against this disease. This registry will \nallow researchers to see where those diagnosed with PF are located, \nwhich can help determine if there clusters of cases and shed light on \nany environmental factors. This registry will also be made available to \nall researchers, including the National Institutes of Health and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and will allow researchers to build on \neach others' work to develop treatments in a more streamlined and well-\ninformed manner.\n  PF attacks Americans in all walks of life it knows no boundaries and \ncan affect anyone. The prevalence of PF has increased more than 150 \npercent since 2001, and is expected to continue rising as the \npopulation of the United States ages. With that in mind, it is clearly \ntime for Congress to take this first, long overdue step in the battle \nagainst PF. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can begin \nto bring relief to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who suffer \nfrom PF.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "04", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/04/senate-section/article/S6739-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 606--DESIGNATING AUGUST 29, 2010, AS ``RAILROAD \n                            RETIREMENT DAY''\n\n  Mr. BURRIS submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the nomination of \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court. Just over a \nyear ago, the Senate considered the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor \nto the Supreme Court and today we continue the debate on Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan's. Then, as now, I think it is fully appropriate for us \nto discuss the judicial philosophy of the nominees being put forward \nbecause of the increasing intrusion of the Supreme Court into very \ncontentious issues within the society. If that is the case, then I \nthink judicial philosophy needs to be discussed, and I think that is \none that we need to consider in this nominee in Solicitor General \nKagan.\n  The debate and discussion of Solicitor General Kagan's nomination \nfollowed a different path from the Sotomayor nomination, but it has led \nme to the same result: I have too many questions about the nominee's \njudicial philosophy to permit me to support the nomination to a \nlifetime appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  As I said last year, a nominee's judicial philosophy is a key concern \nat the heart of the Supreme Court confirmation process. For me, the \nquestion is whether a nominee to the Court supports an activist \njudicial philosophy that would invite the judiciary into all sorts of \nareas of American life where it has not intruded before, or whether \nthey hold a more deferential view of the Constitution that would limit \nthe role of the courts. It is really that view, of what is the \nappropriate role of the courts under the Constitution that I think is \nkey, given the more activist role the Court has taken in this society \nin recent years.\n  As I noted during the Sotomayor debate, in my view, democracy is \nwounded when Justices on the high Court, who are unelected, invent \nconstitutional rights and alter the balance of governmental powers in \nways that find no support in the text, structure, or history of the \nConstitution. Unfortunately, in recent years the courts have assumed a \nmore aggressive political role.\n  In last year's confirmation debate, we talked a lot about whether a \nnominee's life story and experiences should be a significant factor in \nassessing that nominee. Whatever the merits of that debate, Judge \nSotomayor was nominated as a Federal judge with a judicial background \nthat offered some clues as to her judicial philosophy. With this \nnominee, we have comparatively little of written record to evaluate.\n  Solicitor General Kagan has no previous experience on the bench. If \nconfirmed, she would be the first Supreme Court Justice without prior \nexperience on the bench in almost 40 years. In order to hire anyone for \nany job, an employer looks at an applicant's past employment history. \nThat is true for private sector jobs and public sector jobs. It is true \nfor the staffs we maintain in the Senate and it is certainly true for \nSupreme Court nominees. I think most Americans would agree that prior \njudicial experience would be a good thing for a nominee to the Supreme \nCourt to have. It is not a prerequisite for confirmation. Certainly, we \nhave had Justices in the past who did not have any prior judicial \nexperience. But I would suggest that since Solicitor General Kagan \nlacks prior experience on the bench, we have an obligation to look even \nmore closely at the professional experience she does have.\n  There is no question she has an outstanding resume. Few people in \nAmerica can say that they have her academic credentials, including an \nIvy League law degree, as well as experience teaching at the University \nof Chicago and as the dean of Harvard Law School. And she has terrific \npolitical credentials, including working on the Dukakis for President \ncampaign and as a policy adviser in the Clinton administration. \nUnfortunately, very little of her resume pertains to formal legal \npractice, let alone time on the bench.\n  So Solicitor General Kagan's experience is not necessarily the \nexperience we would prefer, but it is the experience that we have to go \non. And as I look through this professional experience, I see plenty of \nreasons to be concerned about the philosophy that she would bring to \nthe bench.\n  In particular, I want to highlight her experience as a policy \nadviser. From the Presidential campaign trail in 1988 to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to the Clinton White House, she has spent a great \ndeal of time working on tough, highly contentious issues. In each of \nthose cases, I think it is clear that she favors the kind of judicial \nactivism that has concerned me throughout my time in the Senate. Her \nviews, and the policies she has supported, endorse a role for the \ncourts that I find very troubling. And let me be clear, whether or not \nI agree with her views on any particular issue, I am most concerned \nabout the way those views will shape her still-emerging judicial \nphilosophy.\n  For example, let's take a look at the life issue. As an adviser in \nthe Clinton White House, Ms. Kagan led efforts to preserve partial-\nbirth abortion. Obviously, I disagree with that position, as do most \nAmericans, but that is the role that advisers often play inside the \nWhite House. Unfortunately in this case, however, the evidence shows \nMs.\n\n[[Page S6742]]\n\nKagan manipulated arguments about the need for a partial-birth abortion \nban and whether such a ban is constitutional. When a draft scientific \nstatement from a medical association threatened to undermine the policy \nshe supported, Ms. Kagan seems to have rewritten that statement in a \nway that did not reflect the considered medical judgment of the \nassociation but was more in line with the policy she supported. Her \nexplanation that she was merely helping the association state its own \nviews more accurately does not bear scrutiny. This should be a red flag \nfor Senators considering confirmation of someone to the Supreme Court. \nWithout a judicial track record to evaluate, I am concerned about how \nshe would apply her personally held views on similar matters if she is \nconfirmed.\n  To turn to another example, as many of my colleagues have pointed \nout, the scandal over military recruitment at Harvard also shows \nevidence of politically held views coloring the nominee's legal \njudgment. Ms. Kagan opposed military recruiting on campus as part of a \nprotest against the military's don't ask, don't tell policy, even \nduring a time of war, denying the military access to Harvard's on-\ncampus recruiting program while the university was receiving Federal \nmoney. It was apparent at the time that she was openly defying the \nintent of the Solomon Amendment, but she felt comfortable defying the \nlaw in the ``hope'' that the Defense Department would simply fail to \nenforce it. Her argument that law schools could take such steps despite \nthe plain intent of the Solomon Amendment was, again, primarily a \npolitical argument with very little, if any, legal standing. The \nSupreme Court unanimously disagreed with her.\n  Based on other statements she has made about issues ranging from \nmilitary tribunals for detainees in the war on terrorism to political \nspeech under the first amendment, there are numerous reasons to be \nconcerned about how Solicitor General Kagan might apply the law as an \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  It is worth asking whether the solicitor general has ever argued that \nthe law should be applied contrary to her political views. Perhaps I \nwould not have to ask that question if we could assess extensive legal \nwritings or a history of judicial rulings. But since this nominee lacks \nsuch experience, I am left to question how Ms. Kagan would let her \npolitical views shape her judicial philosophy. The weight of the \navailable evidence clearly suggests political motivations for her legal \nviews.\n  I have long believed that the judicial branch helps itself through \nrefraining from action on political questions. This concept was perhaps \nbest expressed by Justice Felix Frankfurter, a steadfast Democrat \nappointed by President Franklin Roosevelt.\n  Justice Frankfurter said this:\n\n       Courts are not representative bodies. They are not designed \n     to be a good reflex of a democratic society. Their judgment \n     is best informed, and therefore most dependable, within \n     narrow limits. Their essential quality is detachment, founded \n     on independence. History teaches that the independence of the \n     judiciary is jeopardized when courts become embroiled in the \n     passions of the day and assume primary responsibility in \n     choosing between competing political, economic and social \n     pressures. Primary responsibility for adjusting the interests \n     which compete in the situation before us of necessity belongs \n     to the Congress.\n\n  I would add, not to the court.\n  When the courts improperly assume the power to decide issues more \npolitical than legal in nature, the People naturally focus less on the \nlaw and more on the lawyers who are chosen to administer it. Some are \nkeen to impose their policy agendas through the judicial process. \nOthers want judges who will stick to interpreting the law, rather than \nmaking it. It is beyond dispute that the Constitution and its Framers \nintended for judges to satisfy the latter criteria.\n  I know that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nunderscored Ms. Kagan's strong intellect and outstanding academic \nbackground as evidence that she would rule fairly if confirmed to the \nCourt. Perhaps they are right. But we ought not be operating in the \nrealm of ``perhaps'' when it comes to a Supreme Court appointment. \nAdvise and consent is a serious matter and we have to do better than \n``maybe.'' As I read about Ms. Kagan's experience and background and \nlook for clues to her judicial philosophy, I believe it is far more \nlikely than not that she will rely on a set of political views to guide \nher decisions rather than a strict construction of the Constitution. \nAfter many weeks of public debate, hearings and discussion, I cannot \nescape the conclusion that this nomination would only perpetuate \njudicial activism on the Nation's highest Court. I opposed the \nconfirmation of Judge Sotomayor on that basis, and I will oppose Ms. \nKagan's confirmation on those grounds also. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I also rise to discuss President Obama's \nnomination of Elena Kagan, Solicitor General, to serve on the U.S. \nSupreme Court. I agree very strongly with the remarks made by my \ncolleague who has just indicated there is a strong concern about the \ncontinuation of a pattern of increasing judicial activism in our \ncountry, which we definitely do not need to perpetuate on the highest \nCourt of our land.\n  I appreciate the work that has been done by my colleagues on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee to examine this nomination and to hold \nthorough hearings. There is no doubt that Ms. Kagan's educational \nresume is impressive, with a degree from Princeton and from Harvard Law \nSchool. It is unfortunate that the Senate confirmation process has \nreached the point, though, where nominees are no longer comfortable \ncandidly discussing their judicial philosophy and views on key issues, \nespecially when the nominee herself decries this development prior to \nbeing nominated.\n  To date, I have received more than 1,500 letters and e-mails and \nphone calls from my Idaho constituents, overwhelmingly in opposition to \nElena Kagan's nomination. Many of the concerns raised in the \ncorrespondence I have received mirror concerns I also have about her \nnomination. It was my hope, through the committee hearings and \nquestionnaires and in my own personal meeting with Ms. Kagan, that my \nconcerns and those of my constituents could be resolved. As Ms. Kagan \nstated in her committee testimony, because she has not had prior \nexperience as a judge, my Senate colleagues and I must assess her \nnomination based on her other career experiences. Therefore, we must \nevaluate a career that has been focused largely in her role as a policy \nadvocate and political adviser and whether she would carry this \npolitical advocacy with her to the Court. I would like to discuss, in \nthat context, some of my areas of concern--first of all, the broad area \nof judicial activism.\n  I am concerned about Ms. Kagan's background in political advocacy and \nactivism and how her previous statements suggest her willingness to \nbring that activism to the bench. Rather than pursuing a path of \njudicial restraint, carrying out a limited role in interpreting the \nConstitution, Ms. Kagan's writings and testimony suggest that she sees \nthe Supreme Court as a body that must lead the Nation and have the \nfreedom to change the law in response to ``new conditions and new \ncircumstances.''\n  As dean of the Harvard Law School, Ms. Kagan used her position to \nlead the school in a direction not based on the law but based on her \nown personal policy preferences when she denied military recruiters \nequal access to the students at Harvard Law School, complying with the \nlaw only when forced to do so by the Court.\n  It seems that Ms. Kagan has an extremely broad view of the powers of \nall branches of the Federal Government and does not seem to respect the \ntraditional limits the Constitution places on each of those branches. \nIf the Constitution requires that a certain outcome can only be \nachieved through the actions of the legislative branch and if the \nlegislative branch fails to take those actions, it does not mean the \nexecutive or judicial branch can then have the opportunity to \nindependently take those actions or achieve those policy objectives. I \nam not convinced Ms. Kagan respects that constitutional separation of \npower.\n  She has gone so far as to cite Israeli Chief Justice Aharon Barak as \nher ``judicial hero,'' even though Judge Barak is widely regarded as \none of the most activist judges in the world.\n  The Framers of the Constitution wisely, clearly, and intentionally \nset\n\n[[Page S6743]]\n\nlimits on the powers of the Federal Government. The Framers also set \nforth a method with an appropriately high threshold for expanding or \ncurtailing those powers. That method for expanding or curtailing the \npowers of the government is the constitutional amendment process. \nJudges must respect the limits placed on the government by our \nConstitution and must not try to circumvent the constitutional \namendment process by seeking other opportunities to expand the powers \nof the Federal Government to meet their own personal policy \npreferences. I am not convinced Ms. Kagan respects that limit in our \nConstitution and the responsibility to have limited judicial activism \nand interpret our Constitution as it was intended.\n  I also have a very specific concern on a specific issue. In fact, \nthis is the same concern I had when we were presented with the \nPresident's nomination of the last nominee, Sonia Sotomayor, to our \nCourt; that is, the second amendment right to bear arms--a specific \nprovision in the U.S. Constitution which has been a very controversial \nand debated provision in recent years in the United States.\n  On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed, in \nthe District of Columbia v. Heller, that the second amendment to the \nConstitution guaranteed an individual's right to keep and bear arms for \nself-defense purposes. This landmark ruling finally established that \nthe right to bear arms in the second amendment is an individual right \nbut left open the question of whether this right in the second \namendment applies to the States rather than just to Federal enclaves \nsuch as the District of Columbia.\n  For those of us who believe in the right to law-abiding citizens to \nprotect themselves, the Court's ruling in Heller marked a new \nbeginning, especially for those who believe the second amendment to our \nConstitution gives Americans an individual right to bear arms. For too \nlong, many law-abiding Americans were told by their elected \nrepresentatives and by some courts that the Constitution did not \nnecessarily guarantee an individual's right to own a firearm, denying \ncitizens the right to protect themselves, their property, and their \nfamilies.\n  Soon thereafter, though, a case entitled McDonald v. Chicago made its \nway through the court system, in which a Federal district court and a \ncircuit court of appeals ruled that the very severe restrictions on \nsecond amendment rights in two Illinois municipalities were \nconstitutional because Heller only applied to the rights of those \nliving in Federal enclaves such as Washington, DC.\n  On June 28, 2010, the Supreme Court also overturned that decision, \naffirming that the 2nd amendment, like most of the provisions of the \nBill of Rights, is applicable to the States via incorporation \nprinciples derived from the 14th amendment. The Court affirmed that \nindividual rights established in Heller did not just apply to those \nliving in Federal enclaves such as Washington, DC; they ruled they also \napply to all law-abiding Americans who wish to keep and bear arms for \nself-defense. It is now firmly established by these two rulings from \nour highest Court that our Constitution guarantees an individual right \nto keep and bear arms for self-defense purposes no matter where you \nlive.\n  All of this brings us to our nominee, Ms. Kagan, and the question \nbefore the Senate with regard to her nomination. Those of us who \nbelieve in an individual's right to keep and bear arms have a \nresponsibility to ensure that hostility to the second amendment does \nnot find home in the hands of the Supreme Court.\n  With no judicial record to review, Ms. Kagan invited Senators to \nglean what we can from the body of her work, her statements, her \nacademic life, and the policies for which she has actively advocated \nduring her career, including her Supreme Court clerkship and her later \ncareer in political activism.\n  We took her at her invitation to see how her past reflected her views \non the issue of second amendment rights. After discussing this issue \nwith her personally, fully reviewing her past actions in relation to \nthe second amendment, and evaluating her statements before the \nJudiciary Committee, I am convinced she does not believe the second \namendment reserves to all Americans a strong and broad right to bear \narms.\n  To cite some well-known examples, as a Supreme Court law clerk, Ms. \nKagan wrote that she was ``not sympathetic'' to a challenge to \nWashington, DC's, ban on firearms. After the Supreme Court struck down \ncertain provisions of the Brady law in Printz v. United States, Ms. \nKagan, who was then serving on President Clinton's staff, worked to \nreimpose those unconstitutional provisions by Executive order, without \nthe approval of Congress and contrary to the ruling of the Court. When \nthe McDonald case came before the Supreme Court, Ms. Kagan, who was \nthen the Solicitor General of the United States, did not even see it \nnecessary to file a brief in support of the second amendment.\n  When asked about her position, Ms. Kagan has stated that she accepts \nthe Heller and McDonald cases as settled law. But she has also made it \nclear that in her opinion these two cases leave much of the detail as \nto what this right entails to future court interpretation. This is very \nsimilar to what now Justice Sotomayor said when she was before the U.S. \nSenate for confirmation.\n  As a judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, then-Judge \nSotomayor ruled on a case that was very similar to and, in fact, was \nlater incorporated into the Chicago case, Maloney v. Cuomo. In that \nruling, then-Judge Sotomayor ruled that Heller only guaranteed an \nindividual right to keep and bear arms for residents of Federal \nenclaves. Her explanation was that Heller answered ``a different \nquestion'' than Maloney and relied on a precedent from 1886 to do so.\n  Pressed about Heller at her Senate hearings, Judge Sotomayor stated \nthat she accepted that Heller was now ``settled law.'' Yet when the \nMcDonald case came before the Supreme Court, Justice Sotomayor voted \nagainst it, joining with the dissenting opinion, stating that ``in sum, \nthe framers did not write the Second Amendment in order to protect a \nprivate right of self defense.''\n  The Supreme Court's decisions in Heller and McDonald were important \nmilestones for establishing the second amendment right to bear arms, \nbut they were long overdue. Countless law-abiding Americans were denied \ntheir constitutional rights to keep and bear arms for way too long. It \nis imperative that the next Supreme Court Justice fully understand and \naccept and support these rights. I am not convinced that Ms. Kagan \ndoes, and that causes me great concern.\n  Similar to now Justice Sotomayor, Ms. Kagan has stated that she \naccepts Heller and McDonald as settled law. But that does not mean she \nwould not vote to overrule them if an opportunity presented itself. As \nshe herself has said, that also does not define the scope and breadth \nof this right, which will fall to future Court decisions. A Supreme \nCourt hostile to the Heller and McDonald decisions or a Supreme Court \nwith a narrow view of the right to bear arms protected by the second \namendment could severely limit or restrict that right. As I have said, \nI do not believe Ms. Kagan believes in the strong and broad right to \nbear arms that I do or that the majority of Idahoans do.\n  These concerns have also been expressed by our ranking member on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Senator Sessions, who noted:\n\n       Ms. Kagan's record regarding the Second Amendment leaves \n     little doubt that she will be hostile to the rights of law-\n     abiding citizens to own and possess firearms.\n\n  For these reasons--her activist philosophy and her position that I \nexpect we will see on the second amendment right to bear arms--I cannot \nvote to confirm her to the highest Court of our land.\n  Mr. President, I take the responsibility of confirming Supreme Court \nJustices very seriously, and my decision was not reached lightly. \nJudges take an oath to ``administer justice without respect to persons, \nand do equal right to the poor and to the rich.''\n  My review of Ms. Kagan's record gives me reason to question whether \nshe will abide by that standard. Her statements, actions, and writings \nthroughout her public life suggest a vision for the Court that is not \nrestrained by the Constitution but that has a responsibility in being \nactivist in\n\n[[Page S6744]]\n\nreaching policy goals. As such, I must vote against her nomination to \nsit on the highest Court in our country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \ncomments. He is one of the most capable lawyers in the Senate. He is a \npracticing lawyer, clerked on the court of appeals, and is scholarly \nand careful in what he says. I believe he has raised some very \ntroubling points about this nomination that should be considered.\n  I say to Senator Crapo, I notice today that a single sitting Federal \njudge in California has just wiped out proposition 8 that was passed by \na majority of the people in California. I guess there were millions \nvoting on that, which simply said a marriage should be defined as being \nbetween a man and a woman.\n  This judge struck down proposition 8 and, obviously, at some point, \nthis will get to the Supreme Court of the United States, as the Senator \nwell knows. It will go first to the Ninth Circuit, on which the Senator \nclerked, and then it will go to the Supreme Court probably. We will \nhave the nominee who is before us today who has already demonstrated at \nHarvard that her views about don't ask, don't tell and similar social \nand marriage issues involve such strong feelings on her part that she \nhas not been able to follow the law. I am worried about that. I think \nthe American people are worried about that, and I think they have a \nright to be.\n  Let me talk a little bit about today's decision by a Federal judge in \nCalifornia that was replete, in my view, with results-oriented liberal \njudicial activism. I think that is what it is, as the court explained \nin substituting its judgment, the judge's judgment and opinion, for the \njudgment of the people of California expressed in a full statewide \nreferendum. Now this is a powerful thing.\n  Was there some clear statement in the Constitution or law that would \ninvalidate the people's expression of what a marriage should be in the \nState of California? I submit not. This is what the judge said.\n\n       [W]hat remains of proponents' case is an inference, amply \n     supported by evidence in the record, that Proposition [8] was \n     premised on the belief that same-sex couples simply are not \n     as good as opposite-sex couples. Whether that belief is based \n     on moral disapproval of homosexuality, animus towards gays \n     and lesbians or simply a belief that a relationship between a \n     man and a woman is inherently better than a relationship \n     between two men or two women, this belief is not a proper \n     basis on which to legislate.\n\n  So the judge just declared that laws that are on the books in \nvirtually every State in America--and certainly by referendum in \nCalifornia--are improper. States cannot legislate in this area. It is \nnot ``a proper basis'' on which to legislate.\n  That is what activism is. It is a judge replacing the people's views \nwith his views.\n  President Obama has made similar statements. He said that judges \nshould decide cases based on ``one's deepest values, one's core \nconcerns, one's broader perspectives on how the world works, and the \ndepth and breadth of one's empathy.''\n  This was in a floor speech in the Senate delivered from right over \nthere from his desk in which he opposed Chief Justice John Robert's \nconfirmation to the Supreme Court--one of the finest nominees ever to \nbe brought before this body.\n  This is the kind of rationale, the kind of empowerment that many \njudges feel. Well, they can just use their broader perspective on how \nthe world works or the depth and breadth of their empathy or their \ndeepest values or core concerns. Whose core concerns? The judge's core \nconcerns. What does this have to do with law, I ask?\n  Indeed, I would suggest that this whole litany of matters raised by \nPresident Obama is not law. These are invitations for judges to allow \ntheir bias to influence how they decide cases, an encouragement for \njudges to use their power of defining the words of our laws and \nConstitution to promote their agenda. This is an unacceptable view. It \nis contrary to the great heritage of law this country is based on and \nshould not be tolerated by the judiciary.\n  When Justice Stevens announced his retirement, whom Ms. Kagan would \nreplace--he served 38 years; he served until age 88--if Ms. Kagan were \nto serve till that age, she would serve 38 years on the Supreme Court \nwithout ever having to answer once to the American people. She has \nnever tried a case. We have no judicial history. She has never really \npracticed law in any serious way. She has been a political lawyer most \nof her life. She has been an advocate for a lot of leftwing views and \nthat is all right.\n  You can have a view that the military's don't ask, don't tell \npolicy--law passed by Congress; it is a law not a policy--you can \noppose that. That is fine. That should not disqualify you from serving \non the bench. You can be against the death penalty and serve as a good \njudge if you understand that if the law requires the death penalty, you \nshould have to apply it. You cannot obstruct the law because you do not \nagree with it. This is basic to the understanding of the American \njurisprudence system.\n  When Justice Stevens announced his retirement, President Obama \nrephrased his empathy standard that took a lot of criticism and, \nindeed, was renounced by Justice Sotomayor in her confirmation hearings \nlast year. He said he wanted a nominee with a ``keen understanding of \nhow the law affects the daily lives of the American people.''\n  Well, I think that is what Congress is supposed to do. We are \nsupposed to be monitoring how the laws affect the daily lives of the \nAmerican people. If we do not think, as a matter of policy, it is doing \nit correctly, we should fix the law, change it, eliminate it, and do \nwhatever is appropriate. That is not the judge's responsibility. The \njudge's responsibility is to enforce the law, to follow the law, or \nelse he is a lawmaker instead of a judge.\n  When the President announced Elena Kagan's nomination, he said: ``She \nhas often referred to . . . Justice Thurgood Marshall, for whom she \nclerked, as her hero'' and ``credits him with reminding her that, as \nshe put it, `behind law there are stories--stories of people's lives.' \n''\n  Well, there are stories, and a judge should certainly be very aware \nof the facts in a case. Judges should not deny relevant evidence. But \nin the end, the judge must find the true facts, and then apply that \ntruly to the law as it is whether they like it or not. Activism arises \nwhen a judge allows their personal values, even deepest values, core \nconcerns, broader perspectives on how the world works, and the depth \nand breadth of their empathy to influence decisions. Isn't that bias? \nWho knows what these judges believe--they have a lifetime appointment \nand they get to impose their core concerns on us? No. This is a serious \nmatter.\n\n  I think the American people understand it because when you empower a \njudge to do these kinds of things, you have given him control over you. \nYou have given him the power to redefine marriage when the people of \nthe State don't want to. And you have no recourse. They have a lifetime \nappointment. Some people say nine judges can do that. Only five, \nreally. It only takes five. They meet and have tea and they go to the \ngreat salons of Europe, and they get these ideas about how to make \nAmerica a better place, and they want to come back and get itching to \nwrite it into some opinion somewhere.\n  I would say that no drafter of the Constitution or any of the \nprovisions in it at any point that those amendments were adopted would \never have imagined a Federal judge in California would declare that the \npeople of California's decision to define marriage as it has been since \nthe founding of the Republic as between a man and a woman is \nunconstitutional. Make no mistake. When a judge says something is \nunconstitutional, this is not a little bitty matter. The American \npeople have no recourse, except to pass a constitutional amendment. It \ntakes two-thirds of both the House and the Senate and three-fourths of \nthe State. They make it so because they say it is so. There is nothing \nin the Constitution that defines marriage. If it is defined--the most \nlogical argument is that when it was written, if they had wanted to \nchange the definition of marriage, they would have put it in there, \nbecause every State in America at the time the Constitution was drafted \nand every amendment to it defined marriage as between a man and a \nwoman.\n  That is what we get. Right now we have had battles over those kinds \nof\n\n[[Page S6745]]\n\nissues. They are the cause celebre of the day, but they become further \nissues in the future. Do we think maybe in the future it comes down to \nwhether a judge can require the State to raise taxes? Will it require a \nState to provide insurance to everyone or the Federal Government to do \nso because the Constitution somewhere said that everybody should have \nequal protection of the law? Does that mean everybody should have \nhealth insurance?\n  We have one nominee President Obama has submitted, Mr. Liu, who says \neverybody in America is entitled to constitutional welfare rights. \nPresumably, if you file a lawsuit in front of him, he would order the \nState to provide welfare to everybody, whether we can afford it or \nwhether the legislature decided that is the right thing. This is what \nactivism is. It is a serious matter.\n  I wanted to speak of a few additional points for discussion that \nrelate to matters that have been raised in the last day or so about \nthis nomination. I am trying to be correct in what I say. I want to be \ncorrect and fair. This nominee deserves fair treatment and accuracy, \nand we should try to achieve that in the Senate. If I have said \nanything before or say anything now that is in error, I hope my \ncolleagues will call that to my attention and I will be pleased to \nadmit that I made an error, if I have, and correct it. Likewise, I am \nbeginning to wonder--I have said this before--since nobody has \ncorrected any significant matter I have stated, they must be agreeing \nto it.\n  One of our Senators defended Ms. Kagan by insisting that any \narguments she made as Solicitor General were made on behalf of her \nclient, the United States, and should not be held against her. They \nsuggest that her actions as Solicitor General should, therefore, be \nimmune from criticism. In other words, she didn't necessarily do what \nshe thought ought to be done, but she had a duty to defend the law.\n  It misses the point about the Witt case, the important case I talked \nabout in which I criticized her decisions as Solicitor General. The \nproblem with Ms. Kagan's actions in the Witt case is she did not make \nall appropriate arguments in defense of her client, the United States. \nShe declined to effectively represent her client, the United States. I \nwent into some length about that today. We are not saying that she must \nagree with every argument she made as Solicitor General in terms of \npolicy. Solicitors General are required by their duty to defend the \nlaws Congress passes. They don't have to agree with the law, but they \nhave a duty to defend it if it is challenged as being unconstitutional \nor in some other fashion improper.\n  What is most important about this is that in the Witt case, it dealt \nwith the military's don't ask, don't tell policy. People can disagree \non that, as I indicated, but it was the law passed by Congress and \nsigned by President Clinton. She spent 5 years in the Clinton White \nHouse. She never complained to him about the law, to my knowledge. She \ndidn't protest or quit working for him. She goes to Harvard, however, \nand bars the military from being able to enter the Career Services \nOffice and recruit students because she didn't like the law Congress \npassed and her former boss signed. She punished the military officers \nwho were there on campus to recruit Harvard students to be JAG officers \nin the military. Maybe those officers just got back from Iraq and \nAfghanistan--we were in two wars at the time--yet they were treated as \nsecond-class citizens, not allowed to enter the career services office.\n  Oh, they could call the little veterans group on campus and they \ncould ask them and they could help them. One officer wrote in a memo \nthat was produced by the Defense Department: We were relegated to \nwandering the halls hoping somebody would stop and speak to us. They \nweren't able to recruit properly on the Harvard campus. Her suggestion \nthat this was nothing she was doing and unimportant is not accurate. It \nwas a misrepresentation of the grave circumstances that occurred at \nHarvard when she was dean. She led this effort. She personally led the \neffort to reverse Harvard's policy and deny the military the right to \nenter the Career Services Office. They said, Well, it is OK, they can \ncall the veterans groups. They were offended by it. They sent out an e-\nmail and said we are not able to arrange for these kinds of meetings. \nWe are law students here who happen to be veterans. We can't do what \nthe career services can do to provide assistance to the military. It \nwas plainly against the Solomon amendment which was in effect at all \ntimes when she reversed Harvard's policy and began to bar the military \nfrom coming on campus.\n  When she came up for confirmation last year to be Solicitor General \nof the United States and there were cases filed around the country \nchallenging the constitutionality of don't ask, don't tell, it was \nclear it might fall to her duty to defend that law, and she was asked \nin committee about it. She was asked: Will you defend the law? She \nsaid: Absolutely, she would. She committed to it. Generally she would \ncommit to defending all laws of the United States and, specifically, in \nanswer to a written question, she committed to defending don't ask, \ndon't tell.\n  What I wish to say is that my colleagues were in error in their \nstatements about this because it wasn't that she made arguments to the \nCourt that she didn't believe in and that somehow we are unfairly \ncriticizing her for doing that. What I am saying is there were \narguments she did not make that she was duty bound to make to defend \nthe law and actions that she was duty bound to take.\n  It has been said by one of our colleagues that it is ``Lawyer 101'' \nthat an attorney will take positions on behalf of the client even when \nthe lawyer disagrees with it. Well, that is exactly right. An attorney \ndoes have an obligation to vigorously defend his or her client, but Ms. \nKagan refused to do that. Her client was the United States of America. \nWhen the Solicitor General of the United States stands before the U.S. \nSupreme Court or any lawyer--as I had the privilege to do for 15 \nyears--in the Department of Justice stands up in a Federal court, do \nyou know what they say? The first thing they are asked is, Counsel, the \njudge will say, is the government ready? And the lawyer says, The \nUnited States is ready, Your Honor. The United States is ready. That is \nwho the lawyer's client is: the United States of America. It is not her \npersonal view of don't ask, don't tell. It is not President Obama's \ninterests or idea of what should be don't ask, don't tell; not his \nviews. It is the United States of America. And what is the position she \nwas defending? The lawfully passed statutes of this Congress signed by \nher former boss, President Clinton, passing the law don't ask, don't \ntell that was being challenged.\n\n  I am of the view that in failing to properly defend that case, as I \nsaid earlier, she violated a direct, specific commitment she made to \nthe Congress and violated her duty even if she hadn't made that \ncommitment as Solicitor General to defend the laws of the United \nStates.\n  One of my colleagues made reference to Justice Souter, saying:\n\n       Justice Souter pointed out in a recent commencement address \n     recently [that] different aspects of the Constitution point \n     in different directions toward different results, and they \n     need to be reconciled.\n\n  Judges do have to do that.\n\n       Acknowledging these inherent tensions is not only Main \n     Street, it is as old as the Constitution.\n\n  Well, there is some truth to that, but Justice Souter's speech and \nothers in his philosophical mold are very troubling. In fact, Justice \nSouter's speech intellectually followed on to Justice Brennan's 1985 \nGeorgetown speech which is clearly the playbook for judicial activism. \nIn it, Justice Brennan, former Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, \nstated:\n\n       For the genius of the Constitution rests not in any static \n     meaning it might have had in a world now dead and gone, but \n     in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with \n     current problems and current needs. What the constitutional \n     fundamentals meant to the wisdom of other times cannot be \n     their measure to the vision of our time.\n\n  So if the Constitution's drafters decided that every American from \ntime immemorial, unless the Constitution was specifically amended, had \na right to keep and bear arms, Justice Brennan would say, Well, we can \nlook at that. We need to see what the vision for our time is. Maybe we \nneed to consult the Europeans as they did in this recent case, the \ndissenters in a 5-to-4 vote that narrowly upheld the right to keep and \nbear arms.\n\n[[Page S6746]]\n\n  Allowing judges to determine the vision of our time is a recipe for \nlegislating by unelected judges. What is the vision of our time is \ndecidedly in the eye of the beholder. It is the job of the elected \nbranches of government to make these calls in our constitutional \nsystem, not the unelected judiciary. The job of the judiciary is to \ninterpret the law, not make the law. That is so basic. Don't we all \nknow that?\n  As Professor John Baker of LSU put it:\n\n       The choice is between two distinct modes of decision-\n     making.\n       Legislators make laws; they do not write opinions. \n     Legislators can legitimately make laws to govern future \n     conduct only. . . . Legitimate judging, on the other hand, \n     concerns the existing law. Interpretation of the existing \n     law, contrary to lawmaking, focuses on the past. Legitimate \n     interpretation of existing law explains the result in a well-\n     reasoned opinion.\n\n  I think that was nicely said. Judges are not empowered to amend laws, \nto promote their vision. They are not empowered to alter the meaning of \nthe words of laws or the Constitution to promote their core values.\n  What is Ms. Kagan's view about that? She wrote a law review article \nentitled ``Confirmation Messes, Old and New.'' It is kind of \ninteresting. She has said nominees should be far more forthcoming when \nthey testify. Most people think she failed to meet the standard in her \nown law review article. She also quoted Stephen Carter's book, with \napproval, saying:\n\n       In every exercise of interpretive judgment, there comes a \n     crucial moment when the [judge's] own experience and values \n     become the most important data.\n\n  The judge's own experience and values become the most important data? \nThat is not law. I don't know what that is, but it is not law.\n  In a 2004 interview in Metropolitan Corporate Counsel, she said:\n\n       The attitudes and views that a person brings to the bench \n     make a difference in how they reach those decisions.\n\n  Is that not biased? Is that not an affirmation that a judge can bring \nto the bench their attitudes and views, instead of being a neutral \numpire, putting on that black robe to symbolize impartiality? I think \nit is. This is a philosophy of law that is afoot in many of our law \nschools. There is no doubt about it. It is out there. People advocate \nit. She wrote about and advocated it. Many judges are adhering to this, \nand it is wrong. They are not empowered to do these kinds of things.\n  In one interview in a magazine, in 2004, she said:\n\n       There should be a range of opinions on the [Supreme] Court; \n     it should not just be about lawyerly qualifications.\n\n  The opinions we need on the Court are that a judge should identify \nthe law and then follow it. That is what the view should be.\n  Mr. President, people are still asserting things about the Harvard \nissue that I don't think are quite accurate. I do not believe she \nhandled the Harvard military question in any way that is defensible. I \nhave looked at it very carefully. I have laid it out in some detail. \nAnd now I wish to respond to some of the statements that have been \nmade.\n  One their efforts has been to point out and to assert that Elena \nKagan treated veterans at Harvard Law School with great respect, \nhosting them for private dinners in her home, publicly recognizing them \nand thanking them for their service to our country. She has been \npraised by several law school veterans who have said Ms. Kagan is not \nantimilitary. Those things have some truth to them, and Senator Leahy \nhas introduced some letters.\n  But, for the most part, Dean Kagan's outreach to Harvard Law veterans \nbegan after all this brouhaha and the resistance to military recruiting \noccurred on campus and things got tense.\n  It was not such a pleasant time. The military veterans were not \ncomfortable. She talked about other students being uncomfortable with \nthe military on campus. She said that herself. So the annual veterans \ndinner I referred to began in 2006, after the university president, \nLarry Summers, had instructed the law school to restore equal access to \nmilitary recruiters and after the Supreme Court had rejected her \nargument that the Solomon Amendment, which Congress passed to make sure \nthese law schools either admitted the military or ceased getting \nFederal money--her argument that the Solomon amendment did not require \nHarvard to give the military access to the career services office was \nrejected by the U.S. Supreme Court 8 to 0.\n  According to the military veterans who attended Harvard Law School \nduring this period, 2004 to 2006, the dinners were actually initiated \nat the suggestion of the school--the university's dean of students, \nEllen Cosgrove, to whom the military veterans had expressed their \nconcerns about the hostile campus environment toward the military. In \nother words, they had gone to Dean Cosgrove and complained about the \nhostile environment on campus toward the military, and she started some \nof these dinners. It was only later that Dean Kagan--who was speaking \nat one time to a protest rally while the military recruiter was in the \nnext building trying to recruit students--she was out there speaking to \na protest rally about the military being on campus, saying how wrong \nshe thought the military was.\n  Most law school veterans who have praised Dean Kagan were either not \npresent at the law school during the height of the controversy or were \nnot then even in the military. Almost all of them were more recent \ngraduates or current students at Harvard, people who liked her outreach \nefforts at that time. But that was after she was forced to let the \nrecruiters back on campus by the President of the school and by the \nSupreme Court. None of the individuals who have written and said \npositive things were members of the student veterans association that \nshe tried to conscript to take care of the needs of the military \nrecruiters. None of them wrote any such letter.\n  I wished to share a few of those thoughts and again challenge my \ncolleagues to be as accurate as they can in what they say, either for \nor against this nominee. She is entitled to fair treatment, but these \nmatters are very serious. The American people want judges who are \ncommitted to their oath, and their oath says they are to be impartial, \nthat they are to do equal justice to the poor and the rich, and that \nthey are to serve under the Constitution and laws of the United States, \nnot above it. That is the commitment they must have.\n  We, the Senate, should never vote to confirm any judge--liberal \nactivist or conservative activist--who, once they put on that robe, \nwill not be impartial or provide equal justice but will allow personal \nbiases, core beliefs, prejudices or politics to influence how they \ndecide cases. That is a disqualifying factor.\n  We must know that any nominee is committed to the ideal of impartial \njustice. I don't believe this nominee has ever demonstrated that she \nwould be unbiased in these situations, and, indeed, the record \nindicates she has consistently allowed her personal feelings to \noverride the law and her duties. Therefore, I will oppose the \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about S. 729, known as the \nDREAM Act. This is bipartisan immigration legislation that I have \nintroduced with Republican Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana.\n  Immigration is a controversial issue, but I hope there is one aspect \nof this debate that does not divide us: Innocent children should not be \nvictims of our broken immigration system.\n  That is why I introduced the DREAM Act almost 10 years ago. The DREAM \nAct would give a select group of immigrant students the chance to earn \nlegal status if they grew up in the United States, have good moral \ncharacter, and attend college or enlist in the military of our country.\n  The DREAM Act has broad, bipartisan support. The last time the Senate \nconsidered the DREAM Act, it received 52 votes, including 11 \nRepublicans, but\n\n[[Page S6747]]\n\nwe needed 60 votes under the Senate rules. It is clear, though, that a \nbipartisan majority in the Senate supports the DREAM Act.\n  Since then, support for the DREAM Act has only grown, and the bill \nnow has 40 cosponsors. The DREAM Act also is the only immigration bill \nthat the Obama administration has officially and publicly endorsed. \nJust this month, President Obama said:\n\n       We should stop punishing innocent young people for the \n     actions of their parents by denying them the chance to stay \n     here and earn an education and contribute their talents to \n     build the country where they have grown up. The DREAM Act \n     would do this, and that is why I supported this bill as a \n     State legislator, as a U.S. Senator, and I continue to \n     support it as President.\n\n  The DREAM Act is also supported by a broad coalition of education, \nlabor, business, civil rights, and religious leaders, including the \nAFL-CIO, the American Jewish Committee, the Leadership Conference on \nCivil Rights, the National PTA, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops.\n  It also has the support of the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, such as \nMicrosoft and Pfizer, and dozens of colleges and universities.\n  The DREAM Act also has broad support from the American people. \nAccording to a recent poll by Opinion Research Corporation, 70 percent \nof likely voters favored the DREAM Act, including 60 percent of the \nlikely Republican voters.\n  Here is how it works. A student would have the chance to qualify only \nif he or she meets the following requirements: came to the United \nStates as a child; has lived here for more than 5 years; has good moral \ncharacter; has not engaged in criminal activity; does not pose any \nthreat to national security; passes a thorough background check; and \ngraduates from an American high school. If a student fulfills all of \nthese requirements, he or she would receive temporary legal status. \nNext, they would be required to serve in the military or attend a \ncollege for at least 2 years. After 6 years, if this requirement is \ncompleted, the student could apply for permanent legal status. If this \nrequirement is not completed, that student would lose their legal \nstatus and be subject to deportation.\n  Students who obtain conditional legal status under the DREAM Act \nwould not be eligible for Pell grants. They also would be subject to \ntough criminal penalties for fraud. The DREAM Act would not allow what \nis known as chain migration. In fact, DREAM Act students would have \nvery limited ability to sponsor family members for legal status.\n  Let me tell you why I first introduced the DREAM Act almost a decade \nago. I was contacted in my office by a Korean woman living in Chicago. \nShe told me she had several children. Her oldest daughter turned out to \nbe an accomplished classical pianist. Her daughter finished high school \nand was accepted to the Juilliard music school in New York. It is \namazing because so few are accepted there--several hundred each year. \nShe was so proud of her daughter.\n  She said when they were completing the form for Juilliard, there was \na question about her daughter's nationality or citizenship. Her \ndaughter turned to her mother and said: American, right?\n  Her mom said: We brought you here at the age of 2, but we never filed \nany papers.\n  The girl said: What should we do?\n  The mother said: Let's call Durbin.\n  They called my office. It is the first time I can ever recall ever \nfacing something quite like this. My staff said: Let's look into it and \nfind out what the legal situation is.\n  After telling the facts to the immigration agency of our government, \nwe were informed that the girl's choice was obvious. She had to return \nto Korea, a place she had never been for 16 years, with a language she \ndid not speak. The rest of her family--her mother, all of her \nsiblings--were American citizens. She was not. Her parents failed to \nfile the paperwork.\n  She had made a choice about her career and knew that she was \nineligible for a lot of the student assistance available to those who \nare legal residents of the United States.\n  I thought to myself: That is fundamentally unfair. I reflected on my \nown story. My mother was brought to this country at the age of 2 as an \nimmigrant. Her mother came from Lithuania. She came in her mother's \narms and arrived in 1911 with a brother and a sister. They made it to \nEast St. Louis, IL, where other Lithuanians were waiting, as well as my \ngrandfather. My mother did not have any vote in that family decision to \nget on the boat and come to America. I am glad she did because her son \nnow gets to serve as a Senator from the State of Illinois, where they \nemigrated.\n  I thought of this poor little girl, 2 years of age, brought to this \ncountry from Korea, now being told at age 18: Go back to Korea.\n  That is what the laws of America say, and that is why I introduced \nthe DREAM Act.\n  When I first introduced the DREAM Act, I started telling the story \nabout the Korean girl, and I noticed something interesting was \nhappening as I told the story: there would be young people waiting \nafter the speech asking if they could speak to me privately. Many of \nthem were Hispanic, some were Polish. They were from all over. They \nwould take me aside, look around to make sure no one was there, and \nsay: I was one of those kids. I was brought here illegally by my \nparents who were legal at the time, and I am illegal today. But this is \nthe only country I have ever known, gone to school here, this is where \nmy friends are, this is where my future is. Help me. That is what the \nDREAM Act is all about.\n  Over the years, these people who used to wait nervously in the \nshadows have started coming out of the shadows and telling their \nstories. They are student council presidents, they are valedictorians, \nthey are junior ROTC leaders, star athletes. They are tomorrow's \nscientists, soldiers, and teachers in America. They were brought to the \nUnited States when they were so young that they did not understand what \nwas going on. They grew up here. It is the only home they ever knew.\n  The fundamental premise of the DREAM Act is that we should not punish \nthe children for the parents' actions. That is not what America is \nabout. Instead, the DREAM Act says to these students: America will give \nyou a chance with strict requirements, but we will give you a chance.\n  Nine years after I introduced this legislation, I have noticed the \nDREAM Act students are not whispering in the shadows anymore. Recently, \nI met with four young people who would qualify for the DREAM Act: \nFelipe Matos, Carlos Roa, Gaby Pacheco, and Carlos Rodriguez. These \nfour students walked from Miami, FL, to Washington, DC--1,500 miles--in \norder to build support for the DREAM Act. Along the way, they were \njoined by hundreds of supporters, young students and young people in \nthe same situation they were in but other young people who understood \nthe injustice that is being perpetrated on these people. They called \nthis trip, this long 1,500-mile hike, ``the trail of dreams.''\n  I also would like to update the Senate on two DREAM Act students \nabout whom I have spoken in the past.\n  This is Tam Tran. Tam was born in Germany and was brought to the \nUnited States by her parents when she was 6 years old. Tam's parents \nare refugees who fled Vietnam as boat people at the end of the Vietnam \nwar. They moved to Germany, and then they came to the United States to \njoin relatives. An immigration court ruled that Tam and her family \ncould not be deported to Vietnam because they would be persecuted by \nthe Communist government. The German Government refused to accept them. \nTam literally had nowhere else to go, so she grew up in America. She \ngraduated with honors from UCLA with a degree in American literature \nand culture. She was studying for a Ph.D. in American civilization at \nBrown University. But 2 months ago, Tam was tragically killed in an \nautomobile accident.\n  Three years ago, Tam was one of the first ``dreamers''--that is what \nI call these students--to speak out when she testified before a House \nJudiciary Committee. This is what she said:\n\n       I was born in Germany, my parents are Vietnamese, but I \n     have been American raised and educated for the past 18 years. \n     . . .Without the DREAM Act, I have no prospect of overcoming \n     my state of immigration limbo; I'll forever be a perpetual \n     foreigner in a country where I've always considered myself an \n     American.\n\n  Tam was sitting right up here in the gallery when the DREAM Act \nreceived\n\n[[Page S6748]]\n\n52 votes on the Senate floor. After the vote, I met with Tam and \nseveral other DREAM Act students. Tam was hopeful, even though we lost \nthe vote. She knew we had 52 and realized we needed 60, but she would \nnot give up hope. She talked about the need to pass the DREAM Act so \nshe would have a chance to contribute more fully to this country--the \ncountry she loved so much.\n  I wish to use this moment to offer my condolences to Tam Tran's \nfamily and friends and assure them I will do everything I can to honor \nher memory by working to pass the DREAM Act.\n  Let me tell you about another DREAM Act student. This is Oscar \nVasquez. Oscar was brought to Phoenix, AZ, by his parents when he was a \nsmall child. He spent his high school years in Junior ROTC and dreamed \nof enlisting in the military. But at the end of his junior year, a \nrecruiting officer told Oscar he was ineligible for military \nservice because he was undocumented.\n\n  Oscar found another outlet. He entered a robot competition sponsored \nby NASA. Oscar and three other DREAM Act students worked for months in \na storage room in their high school. They were competing against \nstudents from MIT and other top universities, but Oscar's team won \nfirst place.\n  The story does not end there. Last year, Oscar graduated from Arizona \nState University with a degree in mechanical engineering. Oscar was one \nof only three Arizona State University students who were honored during \nPresident Obama's commencement address at that university.\n  Following his graduation, Oscar did an extraordinary thing: he \nvoluntarily returned to Mexico, a country he had not lived in since he \nwas a child. He has now applied to reenter the United States. Oscar \nsaid:\n\n       I decided to take a gamble and try to do the right thing.\n\n  But there is a problem. Unless Oscar is granted a waiver, he will not \nbe able to enter the United States for at least 10 years, if not \nlonger. In the meantime, he is going to be separated from his wife \nKarla, who is here in the United States, and their 2-year-old daughter \nSamantha, who are both American citizens.\n  This extraordinary young man--a mechanical engineer who won a \nnational competition, a person who can add something to America, who \nhas a wife and family here, who is doing the right thing by going back \nto the country of his origin even though he has little connection with \nit anymore--is being told: America doesn't need you. Wait for 10 years, \nseparated from your family.\n  It is not fair.\n  There are so many other stories of young people who would be eligible \nfor the DREAM Act. Every week--every single week--I receive calls, e-\nmails, and letters from these dreamers. Let me tell you about two \nothers.\n  This is Benita Veliz. Benita Veliz was brought to the United States \nby her parents in 1993. She was 8 years old. Benita graduated \nvaledictorian of her high school class at the age of 16. She received a \nfull scholarship to St. Mary's University. She graduated from the \nhonors program with a double major in biology and sociology. Benita's \nhonors thesis was written about the DREAM Act.\n  Benita sent me a letter recently, and I am going to read into the \nRecord what she said. Benita said:\n\n       I can't wait to be able to give back to the community that \n     has given me so much. I was recently asked to sing the \n     national anthems for both the U.S. and Mexico at Cinco de \n     Mayo community assembly. Without missing a beat, I quickly \n     belted out the Star Spangled Banner. I then realized that I \n     had no idea how to sing the Mexican national anthem. I am \n     American. My dream is American. It's time to make our dreams \n     a reality. It's time to pass the DREAM Act.\n\n  Let me show one other. This is Minchul Suk. Minchul was brought to \nthe United States from South Korea by his parents in 1991 when he was 9 \nyears old. Minchul graduated from high school with a 4.2 GPA. He \ngraduated from UCLA with a degree in microbiology, immunology, and \nmolecular genetics. With support from the Korean American community, \nMinchul was able to graduate from dental school. He has passed the \nnational boards and licensing exam to become a dentist, but he cannot \nobtain a license because he does not have legal status.\n  Minchul sent me a letter recently. Here is what he wrote:\n\n       After spending the majority of my life here, with all my \n     friends and family here, I could not simply pack my things \n     and go to a country I barely remember. I am willing to accept \n     whatever punishment is deemed fitting for that crime; let me \n     just stay and pay for it . . . I am begging for a chance to \n     prove to everyone that I am not a waste of a human being, \n     that I am not a criminal set on leeching off taxpayers' \n     money. Please give me a chance to serve my community as a \n     dentist.\n\n  The DREAM Act is not just the right thing to do, it is the right \nthing for America. Wouldn't America be a better place if someone such \nas Minchul Suk would be able to serve his community as a dentist? \nCouldn't our military use someone such as Oscar Vazquez, a mechanical \nengineer who has overcome so many obstacles in his young life? Wouldn't \nwe all be better off if these talented young immigrants were able to \ncontribute more fully to the country they love?\n  Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City, knows something about \neconomic development. He sent me a letter supporting the DREAM Act. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       Why shouldn't our economy benefit from the skills these \n     young people have obtained here? It is senseless for us to \n     chase out the home-grown talent that has the potential to \n     contribute so significantly to our society. They're the ones \n     who are going to start companies, invest in new technologies, \n     pioneer medical advances.\n\n  Michael Bloomberg is right.\n  Our country would also benefit from thousands of highly qualified, \nwell-educated young people who are eager to serve the United States of \nAmerica in our armed services. I know. I have spoken with those who \nwork at the Pentagon. Diversity is important in our military. There are \nnot enough, primarily from Hispanic populations, currently \nenlisting. This is a good way to change that, to make sure the next \ngeneration of leadership in the military truly reflects the United \nStates of America.\n\n  Immigrants have an outstanding tradition of military service. More \nthan 65,000 immigrants are currently on Active Duty. The Center for \nNaval Analysis has concluded that ``noncitizens have high rates of \nsuccess while serving--they are far more likely, for example, to \nfulfill their enlistment obligations. . . .''\n  Many DREAM Act students come from a demographic group that is already \npredisposed toward military service. The RAND Corporation found that \n``Hispanic youth are more likely than any other groups to express a \npositive attitude toward the military'' and ``Hispanics consistently \nhave higher retention and faster promotion speeds than their white \ncounterparts.''\n  The Army says high school graduation is ``the best single predictor'' \nof success in the military. However, in recent years, the Army has \naccepted more applicants who are high school dropouts, have low scores \non the military aptitude test, and even some with criminal backgrounds. \nIn contrast, under the DREAM Act, which I have introduced, all recruits \nwould be well qualified as high school graduates with good moral \ncharacter and no criminal record.\n  Since the Bush administration, we have worked closely with the \nDefense Department on the DREAM Act. Defense Department officials have \nsaid to me publicly and privately that it is a very appealing law. It \nwould apply to the cream of the crop of students and be great for \nmilitary readiness.\n  Military experts also support the DREAM Act. LTC Margaret Stock, a \nprofessor at West Point, wrote an article supporting the DREAM Act. She \nconcluded:\n\n       Passage of the DREAM Act would be highly beneficial to the \n     United States military. The DREAM Act promises to enlarge \n     dramatically the pool of highly qualified recruits for the \n     U.S. Armed Forces.\n\n  Mr. President, I am sorry I waited until late in the evening and held \nthe staff here for this, but this means a lot to me and it means a lot \nto literally hundreds of thousands of young people across America. I \nhave introduced a lot of bills in my career. Some of them have become \nlaw. Most of them haven't. Most of them aren't even noticed. This one \nis noticed by hundreds of thousands of young people who, when they hear \nthe name Durbin, ask the next question: When is he going to\n\n[[Page S6749]]\n\npass the DREAM Act? Our lives depend on it. I feel a special, personal \nobligation to these young people.\n  I want to take this story to my colleagues because I think they \nbelieve that America is a just and caring country, that these young \npeople can bring talent and service to our great Nation and they \ndeserve a chance. They should not be punished for any wrongdoing by \ntheir parents. They deserve a chance to prove themselves and to make \nthis a better nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "04", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/04/senate-section/article/S6749-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
