Mr. President, the manager of the Wall Street reform bill--\nat least most of it--is the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator \nDodd. As I reflect on what we have been through with him in this \nCongress, it is really incredible. We withstood seven filibusters on \nhousing legislation he was responsible for managing. At the height of \nthe housing crisis, we were trying to deal with seven filibusters. We \nhave worked our way through many different issues he has been front and \ncenter on, including health care. He has done this with such remarkable \nstrength. We have had situations he has been thrown into as a result of \nthe death of Senator Kennedy that will be written about in the history \nbooks for some time. And then, with no breathing room in store for him, \nimmediately he had to go to this very important piece of legislation \ndealing with the Wall Street crisis.\n  We started on this 2 weeks ago tomorrow. We have been stalled ever \nsince. Maybe today there will be a breakthrough and we will be able to \nlegislate. We don't have a lot of time to spend on this bill. We have \nso much important work to do that has been held up as a result of \nscores of filibusters conducted by Republicans. An indication of how \nthey treat themselves: we had amendments their Senators offered \nyesterday that we were willing to accept, and they refused to let us do \nso. But that is nothing unusual. We have had nominations they have held \nup for months that get virtually unanimous support after we go through \nall the time wasted in the cloture process to move forward.\n  Yesterday, I announced we had a really big day legislatively. I love \nclassic cars. I love to watch them. That is what we accomplished. We \nvoted on a unanimous basis to establish Classic Car Day. That was our \naccomplishment in this body.\n  We are waiting around on issues relating to the financial crisis. New \nMexico, Nevada, Connecticut--all over the country, States are desperate \nfor us to do something with this legislation so people on Wall Street \ncan't continue to take advantage of the people. We would like to move \nforward and start legislating. It would seem that after 2 weeks it \nwould be a pretty good thing to do. Basically during that 2-week time, \nwe have accomplished virtually nothing.\n  I am a little frustrated, but I understand the Republicans have made \na decision that they are going to be the party of no. You would think \nafter they established that, that would be good enough for them. I \nguess they want to underscore and underline it and have a big \nexclamation mark so no one will ever miss the fact that the Republican \nParty in this Congress has been the party of no.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader. \nHe\n\n[[Page S3120]]\n\nhas shown remarkable endurance as well as patience over the last 2 \nyears. The health care debate went on for more than a year, considering \nits beginning, and we finally ended up passing the legislation.\n  We have a lot of other matters to deal with--obviously, the economic \ncrisis. We are now on the financial reform bill. My hope is--I am not \nmaking any procedural requests--based on conversations we had late last \nevening and again early this morning--and I think Senator Shelby shares \nthis hope with me, and we are working as we speak here--that we might \nbe able to have a vote on the Boxer amendment sometime around 11, \n11:30, and a vote on Senator Shelby's proposal, on which I will join \nhim, maybe around 12:30. Then we will be able to take up--not to have \nto vote on them but agree to them unanimously--the Snowe amendments. \nThere is a Hutchison-Tester proposal that I have endorsed as well and \nthat I think all of us believe is a good addition to the bill. My hope \nis that in the next couple of hours we will move forward and start the \nprocess. There are more controversial amendments Members want to raise. \nThey should have the right to do that and have adequate time to debate \ntheir ideas.\n  I know this has been trying for people. People are exhausted. It has \nbeen a long Congress. We have taken on some major issues. People are \nunderstandably tired, and that situation can lead to the frustration \npeople feel.\n  I noticed in this morning's headlines that the market declined by 2 \npercent yesterday, not because of something that happened here but \nsomething that happened thousands of miles away in a small country in \nthe Mediterranean--again, an indication of how global our economic \nsituation is, how precarious it is, where events in one part of the \nworld can affect all of us. It is all the more important we try to \nestablish some sound rules for the 21st century. The last time we \nestablished in a broad sense any rules for the structure of our \nfinancial institutions was almost 100 years ago, coming off the 19th \ncentury and the early part of the 20th century. Here we are at the end \nof the first decade of the 21st century, and, as we painfully learned, \nwe are in desperate need to reform the financial structure of our \ncountry, having seen what occurred over the last 2 years--the job \nlosses, the home foreclosure numbers, the decline in home values as \nwell as retirement incomes, the loss of household wealth. We don't need \nto hear the numbers. We have lived it.\n\n  The majority of Americans are still struggling today as we speak. \nThey are anxious for us to respond to the situation with as much \nthought and care as we possibly can, to see to it that we don't leave \nour Nation vulnerable once again to the kinds of economic decisions and \nfailures that caused our Nation to come to the brink of a meltdown \nfinancially. These are challenging times. I know it is difficult, and \nthere are strong feelings about how to proceed. But that should not \nserve as a barrier to us doing our job, to making the decisions each of \nus was elected to perform.\n  Again, I appreciate immensely the patience of the majority leader and \nhis staff and others and of my colleagues, many of whom have amendments \nthey want to offer to this bill. I want to give them the chance to do \nthat so they can be heard, both Democrats and Republicans. I am \nparticularly grateful to Members who have sought ways to offer \namendments we can agree to and accept as part of the legislation. That \nis a very constructive way to engage in the debate. There are other \namendments people believe strongly in that will not be resolvable in \nthe sense of accommodating them, in which case we will have to vote for \nor against to decide whether to include them in this financial reform \npackage. But that process ought to go forward with civility, with the \npassion people have for the issue but with the civility to respect each \nother and the needs of this institution.\n  This is not the only matter this Congress needs to deal with. I know \nthe majority leader has talked about unemployment benefits. They will \nstill be needed in the coming weeks. We have the tax extenders which \nare critically important. We may have a Supreme Court nomination coming \nalong. The President has sent up the names of three people to serve on \nthe Federal Reserve Board, which will be very important as well \nconsidering the economic implications. We have appropriations bills. \nThis is an important bill, but it isn't the only work the Senate needs \nto accomplish before we adjourn in the fall. My hope is that people \nwill come, engage in the debate, allow for adequate time to be heard, \nand then decide to move yes or no on these matters.\n  Again, I am hopeful that within the next hour or so we will be able \nto get this process moving where we can actually start casting votes on \nideas, particularly the one Senator Shelby and I will be offering.\n  I hope that in the minds of most, if not all, the too-big-to-fail \nproposition is no longer a question on this bill. I don't believe it \nis, anyway, but there are those who do. To the extent we can satisfy \nthem with additions to the bill that will make that more clear, that is \na great step forward. I am confident that can be done in the next hour \nand a half or so and then move on with the various other amendments \npeople have on the bill.\n  In the meantime, I urge Members who do have amendments to come over, \nmaybe start talking about their amendments, start educating the offices \nabout what they want to do with their proposals. I have members of our \nstaff here as well to look at the amendments and, where possible, if we \ncan accept the amendment or modify the amendment and make it acceptable \nto us, certainly I reach out to my Republican colleagues to see how \nthey feel about it, that might even move the process further along. \nBetween now and the votes, this time ought not to be dead time but time \npeople use as well to help us advance the cause of this piece of \nlegislation.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, all Americans are relieved that Federal \nand local law enforcement officials were able to track down and \napprehend Faisal Shahzad, the man they believe to have been behind the \nattempted Times Square bombing. We were especially relieved the bomb \nnever went off. Those who worked around the clock to find and capture \nShahzad and extract a confession from him deserve our respect and our \ngratitude.\n  Senate Republicans are waiting to hear from the administration to \nwhat extent Shahzad had ties to terrorist groups in Pakistan, whether \nhis efforts were part of a wider plot to strike the homeland, whether \nor not he was on the no-fly list, why he was permitted to board an \ninternational flight, and whether intelligence community interrogators \nhave had access to Shahzad.\n  It has been my consistent view that when a terrorist is captured, \nmembers of our intelligence community must be able to interrogate the \nprisoner in order to extract intelligence. This is true whether the \nsuspect is an American citizen, like Shahzad, or not an American, like \nthe Christmas Day bomber. In this case, it is my hope the \nadministration did all it could to gather all the relevant information \nit could.\n\n\n                           NYC Terror Trials\n\n  Attorney General Holder indicated yesterday that the attempted Times \nSquare bombing does not change the administration's thinking on the \ntrial of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and that the \nadministration is still considering New York City as a venue for a \ncivilian trial of KSM. The administration only shows that on this issue \nit does not get it.\n  That much was clear to anyone who watched yesterday's press \nconference.\n\n[[Page S3121]]\n\nHere was the New York Police Commissioner reminding reporters that no \nfewer than 11 terrorist plots have been directed at New York City since \n9/11 and that, as he put it, nothing has changed with respect to \nterrorists coming to New York to hurt and kill Americans.\n  To me, it was jarring, in the face of that kind of cold reality and \nthe repeated pleas of elected officials in New York from both parties, \nto see the Attorney General still stuck--still stuck--on the notion \nthat holding these trials in downtown Manhattan is anything but a bad \nidea. Trying KSM in New York City was a bad idea last year. It is a bad \nidea today. The only thing that has changed is that the American people \nhave just been reminded of how determined terrorists are to carry out \ntheir deadly plans.\n  As I have said repeatedly, Guantanamo is the right place to detain, \ninterrogate, and try terrorists such as KSM. Guantanamo is a safe and \nsecure, state-of-the-art facility where we can detain enemy combatants \nfar from our communities and without fear of onsite retaliation. Some \nwe hold indefinitely. Others we hold until we deem them safe for \ntransfer to another country. Still others we can hold until we try them \nin military commissions, and we can do that right there at Guantanamo.\n  Guantanamo was a wise investment. It was built for good reason. Let's \nuse it for the purpose for which it was built, rather than further \nendangering communities such as New York or burdening them with the \ndisorder and the massive expense that would accompany a terror trial.\n  It is precisely because of potential dangers and difficulties such as \nthese that we established military commissions in the first place. If \nwe cannot expect the very people who masterminded the 9/11 attacks to \nfall within the jurisdiction of these military commissions, then who \ncan we?\n  Americans do not want Guantanamo terrorists brought to the United \nStates, and they do not want the men who planned the 9/11 attacks on \nAmerica to be tried in civilian courts--risking national security and \ncivic disruption in the process.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McConnell pertaining to the introduction of S.J. \nRes. 29 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3121-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, what is the current status of the \nSenate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The pending business is S. 3217.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor this morning \nto talk about the current pending business before this body. This is an \nissue which obviously raised its ugly head a couple of years ago with \nthe financial meltdown that occurred in this country, and I think all \nof us in this body agree it is imperative the Senate take action to try \nto make sure what happened to the financial industry in America never \nhas the opportunity to happen again. I commend Senator Dodd and Senator \nShelby for their work on this bill. We have had our disagreements. Yet \nwe have had significant agreement on some areas.\n  We are now trying to take the base bill and make it a bill that all \nof us in this body, hopefully, will wind up being able to support \nbecause we improve the bill to the point where it addresses the real \ncause of the problem that arose during 2007, 2008, and on into 2009 and \n2010.\n  There are some provisions in the bill that I have particular \nobjection to, and there are some things that are not in the bill that I \nthink should be in the bill. For example, one of the major causes of \nthe problem--and I think it goes without saying--is the fact that the \nGSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have been authorized over the years \nto purchase mortgages from individuals who simply could not make their \npayments, and those mortgages have been bundled together and sold on \nthe market, which has been one of the root causes of the problem. I am \nnot by myself in thinking that. There are other individuals but, more \nimportant, people who know a lot more about the root cause of the \nproblem who think that. Everybody in this body agrees that is a major \nissue that has to be addressed in any overall financial reform. To \nleave any reference to the GSEs, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, out of any \nadditional regulation I think is a mistake. There are going to be \namendments with respect to that, and I look forward to that debate.\n  Another issue is, there are no mortgage standards that are \nspecifically set forth in the underlying bill. I can remember very well \ngoing in and buying my first house, making an application for a \nmortgage. I was as nervous as I could be. Even though my payment was \ngoing to be fairly minimal to the amount of money I was making, I had \nto pay 20 percent down, and it took me a couple of weeks to be approved \nby individuals in my hometown whom I knew very well. At the end of the \nday, they just wanted to make sure I was going to be able to pay that \nloan back. It is not that we need to go all the way in that direction \nbut certainly we need standards in place that will ensure that people \nwho are buying houses can afford to make the mortgage payments for \nwhich they are making application.\n  With respect to the Consumer Financial Protection Act, it appears \nthat in the underlying bill, there is an umbrella that is cast out that \nis going to require the inclusion of more nonproblem areas of the \nconsumer finance industry than are, in any way, potentially a part of \nany future financial meltdown.\n  I hope as we debate these amendments--and I know we will have a \nspirited debate on them--we can come to some agreement as to what is \nreasonable. Let's do what we need to do to provide our regulatory \nagency also with the additional oversight they need to make sure we \ngive them the tools not to allow the situation that occurred in 2007, \n2008, and 2009 to recur but that we don't go too far to where we \noverreach and exercise more control on the part of the regulators than \nwhat is absolutely necessary.\n  I wish to speak for just a minute about the derivatives section and \nsome amendments we are going to have on that particular title. The \nAgriculture Committee has jurisdiction over swaps and derivatives by \nvirtue of the fact that we have jurisdiction over the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, which in turn has jurisdiction over swaps and \nderivatives. There are some swaps and derivatives that are secured by \nsecurities themselves, and those securities--being regulated by\n\n[[Page S3122]]\n\nthe SEC--give the SEC some jurisdiction here. That has been part of the \ndiscussion and will continue to be as we go through the debate.\n  There are a couple of things I particularly wish to address which I \nthink are faulty in the base bill and need to be corrected as we go \nthrough it. We are going to have a substitute amendment for the \nderivatives title that will do several things that are of primary \nimportance to the industry that, today, is very unregulated, which will \nbring all the derivatives trades out of the shadows and into a totally \ntransparent matter and make those trades available to the regulators so \nthey can look not only at the trades themselves, to make sure entities \nthat are entering into those trades are the right kind of entities that \nought to be trading and that they are not creating systemically risky \nindustries that will have the potential to create situations similar to \nwhat we saw in 2007 and 2008 but also that the agencies--the \nregulators--will have the ability to call into play additional margin \nrequirements or other tools that they will have to ensure that those \nentities that are engaging in these practices don't ever reach that \npoint of being systemically risky.\n  There are some specific provisions we need to look at. One of those \nis an expansion of what we call the end user provision. An end user is \nan individual--an entity, whether it is a manufacturing company or it \ncould be an individual but, for the most part, it is a financial \nentity, usually a manufacturer of some sort that doesn't engage in the \nfinance end of the economy of our country but does seek to hedge its \nown particular financial issues in the more productive, more \nconventional financial industry itself. For example, manufacturers such \nas John Deere or Caterpillar or Ford Motor Company or, for that matter, \nany manufacturer across the country that seeks to have stability in the \nmarketplace with respect to interest rates because they don't look out \n90 days or 120 days, they look at years into the marketplace to ensure \nthat there is stability from an interest rate standpoint so they know \nhow to purchase items, know how to purchase what they need to make \ntheir widgets or whatever it may be. Those manufacturers engage in the \npurchase of derivatives by hedging the interest rate that they are \ngoing to pay. They also hedge the purchase of metals. Ford Motor \nCompany, for example, may hedge the purchase of steel in the steel \nmarket, so they can ensure themselves of stability in that market.\n  These are the types of derivatives we are going to be talking about \nand that we need to make sure--because they were not part of the \nproblem that caused the financial meltdown. But if we are not careful, \nthey are going to be overregulated to the point where the cost of an \nautomobile will be increased, and that is an unintended consequence of \nthis bill, I know. The cost of a John Deere tractor to one of my \nfarmers will be increased. Again, that is an unintended consequence.\n  I wish to take a minute to read a portion of an unsolicited letter I \ngot from a fairly new bank in Atlanta, which is a community bank that \nbegan in 2007. According to the chairman of the board, this bank:\n\n       . . . has built an exceptionally strong balance sheet with \n     superior asset quality, solid and stable deposit funding, and \n     robust capital levels. At quarter end, our equity to assets \n     ratio was 14.39 percent.\n\n  He also wrote:\n\n       The Bank received regulatory approval to offer and has been \n     offering interest rate derivatives to our middle market and \n     commercial real estate clients who are concerned about the \n     effects of rising interest rates on their businesses. This \n     affords our clients an opportunity to fix interest rates in \n     what would otherwise be a floating rate environment which \n     could work against them. The Bank will not take interest rate \n     risk on these derivative contracts but instead will hedge all \n     trades with one of our correspondent bank counterparties. In \n     other words, the Bank will operate a matched loan-level \n     hedging program. The Bank does not otherwise engage in any \n     derivatives activities.\n       There are three key problems from our perspective with the \n     regulation as drafted by the Senate Agriculture Committee \n     [which is part of the base bill that we are debating now]:\n       1. The Bank would likely be considered a swap dealer (under \n     section 50(A)(iii) of the proposed regulation) and would have \n     to spin off or terminate its swap activity.\n       2. There are no practical end user exemptions for our \n     clients, who would be subject to posting margin against their \n     trades with a clearinghouse.\n       3. All swap parties have to be an eligible swap \n     participant, so a real estate single project partnership \n     would not qualify.\n       It makes no sense that community and regional banks that \n     run matched loan-level hedging programs should be subject to \n     the swap dealer provisions, as such programs are fully hedged \n     and are not taking undue risk.\n\n  The letter goes on to say they hope that as we go through this \ndebate, we can fix these unintended practical issues or consequences \nthat provide practical issues in the day-to-day operation of commercial \nand community banks that are not on Wall Street but are in Atlanta and \nin Moultrie or other communities around my State and in every other \ncommunity in America.\n  Just because a bank is big does not mean that bank is risky. We need \nto remember, as we think about this, that our regulators need to have \nthe right kinds of tools to look at every single trade that comes up. \nThat is why it is important and why we agree on both sides of the aisle \nthat there needs to be 100 percent transparency in these markets. We \nare going to provide for that in our substitute.\n\n  There needs to be a fixing of the definition in the underlying bill \nof what is a major swap participant. There again, that goes to the \nissue of whether you are a big bank, you are automatically systemically \nrisky, which is not the case, but you are automatically covered by this \nprovision. Should Wall Street be covered? Yes. Will they be covered in \nthe base bill? Yes. Will they be covered in our amendment? Yes.\n  Every swap dealer on Wall Street needs to have not just 100 percent \ntransparency but all their transactions with other financial \ninstitutions go through a clearinghouse. That is done in the base bill. \nThat is also provided for in our amendment. We wish to make sure these \nend users who don't deal in these swaps on a daily basis in the kind of \nvolume the banks do are not thrown into a category of all of a sudden \nhaving to pay huge fees and costs added to the cost of doing business. \nAt the end of the day, we know who will pay for that: we consumers who \nbuy the automobiles and the widgets or whatever it may be.\n  Lastly, I wish to talk about the provision in the bill that \nrequires--it is section 106, the 716 provision. What this provision \ndoes is require all swaps dealers and financial institutions to be \nphysically moved out of the financial institution and kind of operate \non its own. Here is the practical effect of what that will do. Any Wall \nStreet bank that is a dealer in swaps and derivatives today--and every \none of them are--will simply take the swaps desk and move it across the \nstreet. Under the base bill, they are going to be required to raise \nhuge amounts of capital for that swaps dealer desk. There is no reason \nfor that to happen. If they are going to raise capital, it ought to be \nin the bank, where they can utilize it and loan that money out to \ncustomers.\n  The other truly unintended consequence of moving the swaps desk out \nis the fact that the financial institution itself--again, major banks \nwill be included in this--those individual banks are not going to be \nable to access the discount window at the Fed because they are all of a \nsudden not going to be able to borrow money from any Federal entity \nunder the language that is in the underlying bill. That doesn't make \nsense. The reason it doesn't make sense is that all these swaps and \nderivatives transactions--whether they are interest rates, metals or \nwhatever the transaction may be--have to be cleared every day. The bank \nneeds a huge amount of cash or the swap dealer needs a huge amount of \ncash in order to clear those trades.\n  If they do not have access to the Fed discount window, then they are \nsimply not going to be able to access the amount of cash they need to \nclear these transactions. The reason they need that cash is to ensure \nthe parties to that transaction are going to, in fact, be able to have \nthe assurance that the other party to the transaction is going to be \nable to live up to its rights and obligations. If they do not have \naccess to the Fed discount window, then they are not going to be able \nto access that cash they are going to need to make sure these \ntransactions are, in fact, cashed out at the end of every single day.\n  We are going to have one amendment that will be a substitute, and \nthen we\n\n[[Page S3123]]\n\nwill have a series of additional amendments that will be more in the \nway of rifle shots to address the specific issues I have talked about.\n  I talked with the chairman of the Banking Committee about these over \na period of time. Obviously, I have talked with my friend Senator \nLincoln about this. As we go through this debate, I want to make sure \nthat at the end of the day, we do exactly what all of us want to do and \ncertainly what the chairman and Senator Shelby set out to do from the \nstart, which is to protect consumers, to protect people who lost a lot \nof money in the market because of transactions of greed that took place \non Wall Street. We can do that in a bipartisan way because we all agree \nthat has to be done.\n  The thing we want to make sure of is that umbrella or that reaching \nout to accomplish that particular part of the problem that exists does \nnot look for other problems that do not exist on Main Street and that \nwe have the ability of our community banks, our Main Street banks, as \nwell as our manufacturing sector, to have access to the swaps and \nderivatives markets that they have done in a commercially responsible \nway for decades. They are not part of the problem, but yet it is going \nto be of significant consequence to every manufacturer. Not every \ncommunity bank engages in swaps and derivative transactions, but a lot \nof them do. We need to make sure we take into consideration the \ncontinued ability of those banks to operate in a normal commercial \nbanking way. Under the base bill, they are simply not going to be able \nto do that.\n  Again, I commend the chairman for his hard work. I know he and \nSenator Shelby are still trying to work out some agreements on the too-\nbig-to-fail issue. It is my understanding that some of the provisions \nin the hopeful agreement they are talking about are going to have a \ndirect impact on some of the things I have talked about today. It will \nmake our job a little bit easier trying to fix the derivatives title to \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the floor, I wish to \nthank him for his hard work as the ranking member of the Agriculture \nCommittee, with Senator Lincoln of Arkansas. I will quickly address a \nfew points my friend has raised.\n  One I think all of us acknowledge--I certainly acknowledge--is that \nthe GSE issue needs to be addressed. We reached the conclusion that it \nis such a huge issue, and there are only so many issues we can take on \nin a bill of this magnitude. Clearly, some language that would allow \nfor some studies to be done or other matters that would help address \nthe issue--I am open to some ideas such as those. To me, for us to try \nto take on the whole issue of how we reform government-sponsored \nenterprises--we need to do it. It is clearly an issue that must be \naddressed. I was concerned about how much we can actually take on in \none bill dealing with the entire financial reform structure. I assure \nmy colleague that I am prepared to at least support some ideas to get \nus moving in the right direction on GSE reform.\n  On the home mortgage area, underwriting standards, again, we are open \nto ideas. As the Senator may recall, a year or so ago we fought hard to \ninclude underwriting standards. The Federal Reserve has now actually \nwritten some. We are trying to get responsibility on both sides of that \nequation. We had lenders out there pushing a lot of stuff out the door, \na sector of our economy--the shadow economy, as it is called--luring \npeople in to take no-document loans, securitizing them and moving them \nalong. And we saw the effects of that. I know there are people working \non how we can manage to come up with good language that does not so \nrestrain the ability of a lender to have some flexibility in those \nstandards. Clearly, we want standards in place that everybody has to \nmeet--the lender and the borrower--as we move forward to avoid the \nkinds of pitfalls that have occurred.\n  On consumer protection, the last thing we want is asking the dentist, \nthe butcher, so forth--I know people have talked about being subjected \nto what we are talking about in financial products and financial \nservices. Again, not imposing any new laws at all, but how do we make \nsure the seven agencies today responsible for those laws can be \nconsolidated in a thoughtful manner?\n  Lastly, on derivatives, this is an area which is predominantly, \nalthough not exclusively, in the purview of the Agriculture Committee. \nAs the Senator points out, when we are talking about futures contracts \ninvolving securities, there is clearly SEC involvement, and thus our \ncommittee has had some strong interest in the subject matter. Senator \nJudd Gregg, as well as Senator Jack Reed, has worked on that issue. \nThere is work that needs to be done. We all understand that.\n  My hope is, on the subject matter which the Senator has explained and \ntalked about--and I appreciate his comments this morning that this is a \nbig and important area--that there be an effort to try to develop a \nbipartisan approach to all of this as we look at it. It is a \ncomplicated area of law. It would be to everyone's advantage if there \nwas communication back and forth to come up with some ideas on which we \nmight be able to achieve some strong bipartisan support. I know he is \ntrying to do that. I encourage him to keep that up as we look ahead so \nwe can end up with good answers. I am very grateful for his interest in \nthe subject matter. I am hopeful this morning that we can move along in \nthe amendment process and do our job. I thank the Senator from Georgia \nvery much.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see our colleague from Wyoming. If he is \nready to go, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I first thank the chairman for the \nacknowledgement and thank him for the opportunity to take the floor.\n  I come here because of new information that has come to light about \nthe health care bill that has been signed into law. As a physician who \nhas practiced medicine in Wyoming for 25 years, as an orthopedic \nsurgeon, I come to offer a second opinion on this bill and now this \nlaw. I went into this focused on the sorts of things the President had \ntalked about--lowering the cost of care, improving the quality of care, \nincreasing the access to care. But I come to the Senate floor today \nwith my second opinion because I think these things have not been \naccomplished by the bill that has been signed into law.\n  For many years, I have been the medical director of the Wyoming \nhealth fairs--giving low-cost blood screening to people around the \nCowboy State, giving them opportunities to learn about themselves, \ntheir health, and to focus on getting down the cost of care.\n  Today, when I come with my second opinion, it is that this bill--this \nbill now signed into law--is going to be bad for patients, bad for \nproviders--the nurses and doctors who take care of these patients--and \nbad for payers, the people who are going to be paying the bill for this \nnew law, the taxpayers of the country. I believe fundamentally that in \npassing this law, this is going to result in higher costs for patients, \nnot lower costs. It will result in less access for patients, not more \naccess. This is going to result in unsustainable spending at a time \nwhen we are looking at record unemployment and record debt.\n\n  I come today to talk about what I have seen in the new information \nthat has been coming forth since the bill was signed into law. I have \nan editorial written in the Columbus Dispatch:\n\n       Almost daily the ill effects of the health care overhaul \n     passed by Congress are becoming apparent.\n\n  The editorial in the Columbus Dispatch goes on:\n\n       As employees and government bureaucrats analyze the law's \n     effects on the bottom line for the private sector and for \n     government, the alarm bells are ringing. The tragedy is that \n     these ill effects could have been and should have been \n     calculated before the law was passed, not after.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       In fact, many of them were prophesied before passage of the \n     bill, but the prophets were ignored by President Barack Obama \n     and the Democratic majority in Congress. That is because \n     their uppermost goal was\n\n[[Page S3124]]\n\n     not to pass the best health care bill possible but merely to \n     pass anything that could be called health care reform and \n     could be claimed as a political victory by a President \n     desperate for one.\n\n  I come today with my second opinion on the high-risk pool which has \nbeen in the headlines the last couple of days. When the President and \nDemocratic Members of Congress were pushing the health care bill, they \npromised that people with preexisting conditions would receive \nimmediate relief. The bill has been signed into law, and Americans with \npreexisting conditions remain as confused as ever as to how this new \nlaw will impact them, will impact their lives and will impact their \npocketbooks.\n  Unfortunately, hundreds of thousands--that is right, hundreds of \nthousands--of Americans with preexisting conditions are going to end up \ngetting the short end of the stick. In fact, even USA Today recently \nreported that the new law is going to trap 200,000 Americans in pricey, \nState-operated, high-risk plans. Here is the front page of USA Today \nfrom last Thursday: ``Health law traps some in pricey state plans; \n200,000 hard to insure can't get federal option.'' Mr. President, \n200,000 Americans trapped. These are the folks who have been paying for \ncoverage through the State high-risk insurance programs that exist \ntoday.\n  One might say: How can that be? What is the catch? These 200,000 \npeople are not eligible for the brandnew, low-cost, high-risk program \nthat is created by the law. Are these not the people we were trying to \nhelp? The law requires that for people to get into this new plan, they \nhave to have been without insurance for the last 6 months. We have \n200,000 Americans with preexisting conditions who have been playing by \nthe rules, who have been doing what is right. What happens? They are \nnot going to have any access to the benefit the President and the \nDemocrats in this Congress promised would be available to them.\n  Don't just take my word for it. Here is what the Kansas insurance \ncommissioner had to say. She said that we have people who have \nstruggled to stay in our existing pool and take care of their existing \nhealth needs. And then this new pool comes along, and it is more \ngenerous and they are not going to be eligible for it.\n  What is the difference? With the new pool, the maximum amount someone \nis going to have to pay for an individual is $5,950; for a family, \n$11,900. That is 100 percent of the standard market rate. But many of \nthese high-risk pools across the country are at a point where they are \ncharging twice the standard market rate because these people are an \nincreased risk because of their preexisting conditions.\n  The people who have been playing by the rules, doing it right, and, \nas the insurance commissioner said, people who have struggled to stay \nin the existing pool, they are going to be left out, ignored, and \nrejected by this new law the President has signed into law.\n  This week, all 50 States were given the opportunity to tell the \nadministration whether they wanted to run their brandnew, high-risk \npool for individuals with preexisting conditions. The answer has not \nbeen positive.\n  Just yesterday, Tuesday, May 4, the Washington Post said: ``18 states \ndecline to run `high-risk' insurance pools.'' Eighteen States said to \nWashington: No, thank you. Eighteen States have refused to participate. \nWhy? Mainly, they do not know, if and when the Federal money runs out, \nhow it is going to be paid for.\n  One may say: What do you mean, the Fed money runs out? They just \npassed this health care bill that is going to cost almost $1 trillion. \nFor this high-risk pool, the amount of money that was put in, $5 \nbillion--in the Chief Actuary report of Medicare and Medicaid, they \nsaid the money is likely to run out before 2012, even though it is \nsupposed to last until 2014.\n  What is going to happen to these States? No one knows, and the \nadministration is not saying.\n  The Governor of Wyoming, Dave Freudenthal, looked at this as a \nGovernor and asked: What do I want to do? Do I want to participate or \nnot? He is one of the Governors who looked at it very carefully, and he \nis one of the Governors representing the 18 States that said, ``No, \nthank you,'' to Washington.\n  This is what he said in his letter to the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, Kathleen Sebelius. He said:\n\n       The State of Wyoming has operated a very successful high \n     risk health insurance pool for nearly 20 years, which has \n     served Wyoming citizens well.\n\n  And we have. I was involved with this when I was in the State senate, \nwhere I served for 5 years. As he said, a very successful, high-risk \nhealth insurance pool for nearly 20 years, which has served the \ncitizens of Wyoming very well. Then he goes on to say:\n\n       . . . necessary requirements have not been set out and key \n     terms have not been defined. Without such guidance, I find it \n     unwise to further consume my staff and Department of \n     Insurance with the guesswork currently necessary to implement \n     this program.\n\n  Mr. President, these Governors are just guessing--guessing if it will \nwork, guessing if it would not work--and nobody knows. That is why, in \nan interview with the Associated Press yesterday, the Governor of \nWyoming said:\n\n       . . . the $8 million the federal government offered the \n     state to run the high-risk insurance program until 2014 \n     wouldn't be enough.\n       He also said he's concerned the state wouldn't have been \n     allowed to administer the federal pool together with its \n     existing state program.\n\n  Sorry, States--this is what the Secretary is saying--we in Washington \nknow better than you. You might have a program that has worked for 20 \nyears very successfully in your home State of Wyoming, but we don't \nwant to know about it. We want you to either set up a new program and \ndo it our way or forget about it. And that is what the people of \nWyoming have decided because the Governor said: When I looked at it, it \njust didn't seem to make financial sense.\n  So, once again, the administration is saying: Trust us. They want to \nact now and ask questions later. Well, Americans and Governors across \nour country have serious questions about this new high-risk insurance \nprogram--how much it will cost the States, how much it will cost the \ntaxpayers, and why all American patients with preexisting conditions \nwould not have access to the immediate benefits they were promised.\n  Unfortunately, Washington's lack of answers clearly demonstrates that \nthis administration doesn't have its act together. The administration \nhas not delivered on the President's promise to help all Americans who \nhave preexisting conditions have access to the same affordable health \ninsurance coverage. That is why all across this country people are \nsaying: This bill, rammed through the Congress, with all the sweetheart \ndeals, and signed into law, wasn't passed for somebody like me. It was \npassed for somebody else.\n  So I come to the floor of the Senate today to say it is time to \nrepeal this legislation and replace it with legislation that delivers \npersonal responsibility and opportunities for individual patients, that \nwill get down the cost of care, that will improve the quality, and will \nimprove the access to care. We need patient-centered health care--\nsomething that will provide individual incentives, such as premium \nbreaks for people by encouraging healthy behavior; that allows people \nto take their health insurance with them when they move from State to \nState or when they change jobs; that gives the uninsured and the self-\ninsured the same relief when they buy insurance that the big companies \nget; that allows people to buy insurance across State lines; that deals \nwith lawsuit abuse; that allows small businesses to join together to \nget down the cost of their care. These are the things that will work to \nget down the cost of care, to deliver high-quality care, and improve \naccess to care. Those things are not in the health care bill that was \nsigned into law. They are not in the health care bill that passed this \nbody and passed the House.\n  So that is why I come to the Senate floor to once again offer my \nsecond opinion that it is time to repeal this bill and replace it--\nreplace it with something that will work well for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about the \nissue that is before not only the Senate--and, thankfully, we are in \nthe debating process, finally, after many days of discussion about \ndebate--I think this is also an issue that is on the front burner, so \nto speak, around kitchen tables\n\n[[Page S3125]]\n\nor wherever families are gathered or small business owners and others. \nIt is about reforming our financial system and making it more \naccountable.\n  I want to back up a second and put this in the perspective of where \nour economy is. We have an economy which has resulted in a job loss \nthat is a record of one kind or another. We have heard it over and over \nagain: The recession we are living through right now--even though we \nare recovering--is the worst economic climate we have had since the \n1930s. There are lots of ways to measure that, but, of course, the most \nimportant data point or number is the unemployment rate and the number \nof Americans who are out of work--some 15 million.\n  In Pennsylvania, over 582,000 people are out of work. Our rate is 9 \npercent. A lot of States would rather a 9-percent rate than 11 or 12 or \n13 or 14. But in our State, 9 percent means 582,000 people out of work \nthrough no fault of their own. That is the reality with which we are \nliving.\n  One of the ways to dig out of that hole, so to speak, or get the car \nout of the ditch--pick your image or analogy--is not only to put in \nplace the job creation strategies which we have put in place over the \nlast year--and even more recently in the last couple of months--but \nalso to reform our financial system to prevent the abuses that took \nplace that led to the problems that so many Americans are experiencing \nright now.\n  One of the problems we have had is the fact that we have not just big \nbanks--that was always the case in America; we always had large \ninstitutions and small institutions--but we have gone beyond big to \nwhat you might call a megacategory--megabanks--that have too much power \nconcentrated in them and too much impact on our system. So what \ndeveloped was this too-big-to-fail problem. It is a big problem we have \nto make sure we prevent from happening again, where a bank is such a \nbig institution that it has tentacles reaching far into the economy, \nand the failure of that one institution or the failure of two or three \nwrecks the economy for so many others. So one thing we are going to do \nin this legislation is to make sure that doesn't happen.\n  So how do we hold Wall Street accountable and how do we put consumers \nin control at long last? Well, first of all, we have to have strict \nregulations to stop Wall Street from engaging in reckless activities. \nWe have to stop the reckless gambling that Wall Street was engaged in \nfor far too long. We have to end the taxpayer bailouts forever. That is \none thing we have to achieve.\n  I mentioned the too-big-to-fail problem. We have to end too big to \nfail as a problem for our system. We have to have a new cop on the \nbeat. This isn't just a question of having a couple of tweaks in \nregulations, we need tough regulations and tough enforcement. Of \ncourse, the analogy we use is one of law enforcement and having a new \ncop, or a number of cops, on the street--on Wall Street in particular. \nWe have to put consumers in control with information about transactions \nthat are in plain English.\n\n  One of the problems we are experiencing now is that we got away from \nthe system we had in place. I am not just speaking of strong regulation \nand mechanisms to control powerful institutions so they can't wreck our \neconomy because of their reckless behavior and the scheming artistry \nand the fraud that took place over far too many years, but the basic \nconcept that people in a community knew the bankers and the bankers \nknew the customers, so to speak. So if you went to get a mortgage for \nyour home, you actually knew who you were dealing with. One side was \ninvested in the other. That worked very well for a long period of time. \nWe have gotten away from that.\n  I am not saying we can replicate the system we had 30 or 40 or 50 \nyears ago, but we have to borrow some of those concepts where there was \nmore accountability and more sense of investment. We know that 15 years \nago--not that long ago--the six largest banks in the United States had \nassets totaling 17 percent of the gross domestic product. Where are \nthose six megabanks today? They control not the equivalent of 17 \npercent of GDP, they control 63 percent. It changed from 17 percent to \n63 percent in 15 years, virtually unchecked.\n  So instead of supporting a small business in a community or a Little \nLeague team or a family trying to borrow money or a small business, \nthese megabanks gathered deposits from Wall Street. They sliced and \ndiced them, they leveraged them to the hilt, and then used the hard-\nearned wages and savings of Americans to make a handful--a very small, \ntiny number--of Americans incredibly wealthy. It is the kind of wealth \nthat is staggering, almost incomprehensible and almost incalculable.\n  Make no mistake about it, these megabanks profited tremendously from \nthis new model. That is an understatement. Over the last 30 years, \nprofits and compensation in the banking industry have skyrocketed. I \ndon't think wages have skyrocketed. At best, they have been flat for a \nlong time. When they have increased, it has been in very small numbers. \nSo we have megabanks and a flawed system leading to megaprofits for a \ntiny percentage of the American people, even a small percentage of the \nbusiness community, so to speak.\n  American families have been living with this problem. The big guys \ngot us in the ditch, and as we are trying to push the economy out of \nthe ditch, the American taxpayers have had to pay the freight. Well, it \nis time we made some basic changes, and this legislation gives us this \nchance. Now is not the time to slow down and delay and wait and scratch \nour heads. We know it is wrong, we know what the problem is, and we \nknow how to fix it.\n  This morning, we have the continuation of debate on the bill. We had \nan example last week where Goldman Sachs came before the Senate, not in \na situation where the Senate was a prosecutor or a law enforcement \nagency, but the Senate played an important role as it relates to \nGoldman Sachs. Chairman Carl Levin, chairman of the relevant \ninvestigative committee--said we were focused on policy and ethics, and \nI think that is an appropriate role for the Senate.\n  Now, what happened in that Goldman situation? Well, there are a lot \nof ways to describe it, but one way to look at it is this way: Goldman \nsold investors a product--in this case a derivative product--and its \nvalue was tied to the performance of a big portfolio of subprime \nmortgages. That is where it started. But it appears that Goldman worked \nboth sides of the deal. They would sell these products to investors on \nthe one hand, while also plotting with a hedge fund manager who was \nbetting against the performance of the very same mortgages. It gives \n``conflict of interest'' new meaning, and it is a disturbing, alarming \nimage for a lot of Americans--selling on one side and then going over \nto the other side and plotting and scheming to make money, not worrying \nabout what is downwind, what is downstream, the horrific consequences, \nsuch as a wrecking ball to a building, and just kind of laughing all \nthe way to the bank.\n  I know I am in overtime, so I will wrap up. I will be back to talk \nabout an amendment I will be offering, but I do want to say how much I \nappreciate the work that has been done to date. We are at the beginning \nof the debate on the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of \n2010, which will establish an early warning system; enhance those \nprotections for consumers and investors; strengthen the supervision of \nlarge, complex financial organizations; and finally regulate, at long \nlast, in a much more aggressive way, the so-called over-the-counter \nderivatives market.\n  I see our chairman of the Banking Committee, Chairman Dodd, is here. \nHe has done great work in this area not only more recently but for many \nyears, and we are grateful for his leadership. I know the debate is in \nthe early stages, but I think we are going to have a good product by \nthe end of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. If the Senator will yield for 30 seconds--I see my friend \nfrom Louisiana. I wish to give him time. But I wish to say to Senator \nCasey how much I appreciate his work. We worked together on this \ncommittee before I moved on to, I wouldn't say greener pastures, but I \nwas a member of the Banking Committee. I am very grateful to him for \nhis involvement. We\n\n[[Page S3126]]\n\ndealt with the housing issues and credit card issues and the like as \nwell. I appreciate his comments very much, and I look forward to \nworking with him, along with my colleague, the Senator from Louisiana, \nMr. Vitter, who is a member of the Banking Committee. I thank Senator \nCasey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Louisiana Oilspill\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, representing Louisiana in the Senate, \nalong with my colleague, Senator Landrieu, you can image I have been \nfocused exclusively on the ongoing oilspill, the leak, the ongoing flow \nthat we and the country are battling. Because it has been almost a week \nsince I have been in Washington and on the Senate floor, I wish to use \nthe opportunity to briefly give an update from my perspective.\n  Along with many other officials, industry folks, interested citizens, \nI have been all through and up and down the coast as well as offshore. \nI had the pleasure of traveling with several Cabinet Secretaries and \nother Members of our congressional delegation last Friday, going \noffshore to look at the site of the former rig, the site of the ongoing \nspill or leak, very closely. I also took another helicopter tour later \nthat day. I have been in all the effected coastal communities, St. \nBernard Parish, Plaquemines Parish, which encompasses the mouth of the \nMississippi River and beyond, lower Jefferson. I reached out to folks \ndaily--local elected officials and leaders, the industry, Federal \nagencies, the Coast Guard and others working on this ongoing crisis and \nthe Governor in the State--who were extremely proactively engaged.\n  Having done that, again, I wish to give a brief report to my \ncolleagues and my fellow citizens. Obviously, I think we need to start \nin remembering that this is a great human tragedy and that started with \nthe apparent loss of 11 lives. I think it is very important to start \nall our discussions and recollections about this incident with that \nhuman tragedy and with those families. As the media and others cover \nthe environmental danger which is great, the economic impact which is \nenormous, I think sometimes those families, that enormous human loss is \na little glossed over. So I certainly want to stop and reflect on that \nagain and continue to offer my heartfelt thoughts and prayers to those \n11 families who were the most impacted, who have suffered the most. I \nsay a prayer for them every day, as do so many folks in Louisiana. We \nwill continue to lift those families.\n  Second, this is an ongoing challenge and crisis because, as I said a \nminute ago, this leak, this flow continues. It has not stopped yet. Of \ncourse, priority No. 1 of everyone involved is to stop the leak, to \nstop the flow. It is a little difficult to estimate exactly what that \nflow is, but the best guesstimate--and it is an art, not a science--is \nabout 5,000 barrels a day.\n  To put that in perspective, already, as of 4 or 5 days ago, that \nmeant the product leaked surpassed all the spill, all the events \ncombined from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. That was a big event, so \nthis has already surpassed it 4 or 5 days ago. If that leak rate is \nconstant and continues, 5,000 barrels a day, then in about another 35 \ndays we will equal the volume leaked from the Exxon Valdez. That is a \nvery real threat to equal or surpass that amount of oil. It is a huge \nevent.\n  There is lots of activity going on at the wellhead in that area to \ntry to control and stop the leak. There are multiple plans. I guess \nplan A, if you will, is to close off the valves that should have been \nshut down automatically through the blowout preventer. Needless to say, \nthere was a massive failure in terms of that automatic closedown, which \nis supposed to happen at multiple levels. But there is ongoing effort \nto send underwater robots down to the floor of the gulf and shut down \nthose valves. Unfortunately, that has not worked yet.\n  Plan B is to put out a large, constructed box or dome to cover the \npart of the gulf floor where the leak is coming from and then to pipe \nup the material, to vacuum the material in a controlled way from there \nto the surface and store it. That box or dome has been constructed. It \nwill be sent out to the site in the next 48 hours. So that attempt will \nstart. This technology has been used before in other spills but never \nin anything similar to this depth of water, 5,000 feet. It has been \nused in 400 feet, 500 feet, not 5,000. That is a big difference, which \nbrings up all sorts of engineering challenges because of the enormous \npressures at that depth of water.\n  Plan C, if you will, is to drill a relief well--in fact, two relief \nwells. That work has already begun, to relieve the pressure on this \nwell and to bottle it, to put mud and cement down there to stop the \nflow from the existing well. That can work and that will work. The \nproblem is that will take 60-plus days, 60 to even 90 days. That work \nhas begun.\n  In addition to that work to stop the leak in the immediate area of \nthe leak, the Coast Guard and BP and others in the industry are using \ndispersants and other methods of trying to mitigate the ongoing flow.\n  That is one category of very important work. There is a second \ncategory of extremely important work; that is, all the work that is \nunderway to protect the Louisiana coastline and marshes, as well as \nsimilar work in neighboring States: Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.\n  I have to say, last Friday, when I took that plane ride with the \nCabinet Secretaries, I was extremely concerned that all that coastal \nprotection planning and execution had to go through BP. It was very \nevident to me that challenge and that end of the endeavor was bigger \nthan BP, and bigger than any single company. I was concerned that was a \nbottleneck. I was not arguing in any way that BP is the responsible \nparty under Federal law, that BP had enormous monetary responsibility \nthat flowed from that--nobody is arguing with that. But operationally, \nI didn't want all that crucial coastal protection, marsh protection \nactivity to be stalled or delayed because it had to fit through that \nbottleneck.\n  I think the good news from over the weekend is that old system was \nblown up and that bottleneck was relieved. I particularly wish to \ncompliment and commend ADM Thad Allen, whom the President appointed on \nSaturday to be the Federal coordinator of this entire effort. I think \nhe recognized, at my urging and that of many others, that having all \nthat coastal planning and execution flow through BP was a problem and a \nmistake. So that has been corrected.\n  As of Friday, detailed planning, in terms of coastal and marsh \nprotection efforts, was not getting done by BP. Frankly, it was not \ngetting done by the Federal authorities--the Coast Guard or anyone \nelse. But local and State leaders stepped in, the folks who know that \ncoastline and that marsh area the best stepped in and they have \nprovided those detailed plans over the last several days. So over that \ntime period, in particular from Friday on, individual parishes, in \ncoordination with the State, in coordination with many experts, have \ndeveloped parish-by-parish plans to protect the coastline and the \nmarsh. That has been a very strong effort; again, pulling together many \nresources, many levels of leadership, folks who know the coast, the \nterrain and the marsh like the back of their hands. So that void has \nbeen filled, thanks to that leadership and vision by local leaders in \nstrong coordination with Governor Jindal and the State.\n  Now those individual parish-by-parish plans are ready. They are being \ntweaked, they are being improved, but they are ready. The next step is \nfor the Coast Guard to formally approve those plans. That has been done \non a preliminary basis, the first version of those plans, but most of \nthose plans now have supplements. The Coast Guard needs to quickly and \ntimely approve those supplemental plans. I talked to the Coast Guard \nleadership yesterday afternoon and urged them to do that in a very \ntime-sensitive way, and they assured me that was happening. Once that \nhappens, BP automatically is on the hook to pay for implementation of \nthose plans. That takes no additional approval or signature from BP. \nThat is automatic under Federal law. Then the plans need to be \nexecuted, either through BP or independently by using fishermen in the \narea, by using other contractors or otherwise. That is a decision of \nthe locals and the State. I think that process is moving in a very good \ndirection and is well underway.\n  Let me close by focusing on another big category of concern that I \nshare\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\nwith so many others; that is, the concern about economic impact \nstarting with the folks who have been hit and affected the most, the \nfishermen of Louisiana, oystermen, shrimpers, and the fishery industry. \nAlready, as of at least Sunday and Monday, this is having devastating \neconomic impact on those folks. Our hearts go out to them. Our prayers \ngo out to them as well. I have been working with many others to try to \nget them the help and relief they need, in particular focusing on four \ncategories of activity. First of all, when I talk to local fishermen in \nSaint Bernard and lower Jefferson and Plaquemines, all through \nLouisiana, they all say the same thing. They don't want handouts. They \ndon't want a big Federal program. They want a job. They want a paycheck \nfor hard work. That is their lives, that is their tradition, that is \ntheir spirit. They just want that to continue. So, first of all, all \nefforts are being made to hire them, in what is called the Vessels of \nOpportunity Program, to be the backbone of this coastal and marsh \nprotection response. I have talked to both local and State leaders and \nBP, and we are all in agreement that a hyperaggressive effort needs to \nhappen to hire as many of those fishermen as possible to man that \ncoastal marsh protection effort.\n\n  Second, that is not going to take care of all the immediate need. I \nam pushing strongly to make sure BP holds to its promises of setting up \na hotline and a program of getting quick compensation into the hands of \naffected families who are suffering economic loss. I talked directly \nwith the CEO of BP yesterday about this. He assured me that was being \ndone. That would mean quick checks to people and families who needed it \nwithout any requirement that those folks sign their lives away or cap \ntheir claims or sign away future claims. I am going to work very hard \nto enforce that personal promise. In fact, today, I am setting up a \nhotline in my office. It will be advertised on my Web site, \nwww.vitter.senate.gov, to ensure that program is developing as \npromised. If anybody out there, fishermen or others who are applying \ninto that program, is treated differently, I urge them to call this \nhotline and we will get all over that immediately and try to correct \nthat situation with BP.\n  Third, in terms of helping that local industry, of course we are \nlooking medium and long term in terms of full economic damages. BP is \nthe responsible party. They are responsible for those economic damages. \nIn addition, we have an OPA trust fund under Federal law which, at \npresent, has a $1.6 billion balance, funded since the Exxon Valdez \nincident specifically to cover these sorts of direct economic impacts \nand balances. So I am very focused on that.\n  Fourth, additionally, there is an outpouring of citizen private \nsupport to help these families.\n  I am not directly involved, but I know several organizations under \nthe umbrella of the United Way are leading fundraising efforts to \ndirectly help these families.\n  But as this ongoing challenge and crisis continues, that will \ncontinue to be a prime focus of mine: the families directly impacted, \nthe fishermen, the oystermen, the shrimpers, their families who, after \nsuffering through so much with the Katrina and Rita, were sort of hit \nbelow the belt yet again.\n  I will continue obviously, with Senator Landrieu and others, to stay \nvery focused on this ongoing crisis to do all the sort of work I have \ndescribed. I would ask my colleagues to be sensitive to that and to be \naware of that. In particular, there is going to be, and there has to \nbe, enormous discussion about policy, Federal and other policy, coming \nout of this disaster.\n  We need to look at mandated technology. We need to look at \nprocedures. We need to look at the current liability cap and the OPA \ntrust fund. All of that is important. But as we begin to do that, my \nfirst request would be that we all realize that down in Louisiana off \nour coast in the gulf, in the real world, there is an ongoing crisis \nthat still continues. The leak is unabated. The flow is unabated.\n  I would ask all of us to be sensitive to that so we are not diverting \nattention or resources away from that ongoing crisis. The work needs to \nbe there right now to shut down the flow of oil and to protect our \ncoastline. Many Members, Democrats and Republicans, have offered their \nsupport to me and Senator Landrieu. We both deeply appreciate that and \nwe look forward to working with everyone in this body on this ongoing \nsituation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK 2010\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. This week, once again, we celebrate Public Service \nRecognition Week.\n  Public Service Recognition Week provides us all a chance to reflect \nupon the contribution made by those who serve in government.\n  All throughout the week, the Partnership for Public Service, a \nleading nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to honoring those \nwho work in government, will be hosting informative programs across \nWashington.\n  One of the most exciting moments during the week is the announcement \nof this year's finalists for the distinguished Service to America \nMedals, or ``Sammies.'' This year, once again, the crop of finalists is \noutstanding, and the winners will be announced at the Partnership's \nannual Service to America Gala in September.\n  During last year's Public Service Recognition Week, I delivered the \nfirst in a series of weekly speeches from this desk honoring great \nFederal employees. Now, 1 year later, I am proud to continue this \neffort today by recognizing my sixtieth great Federal employee, along \nwith a few others who have won Service to America Medals in the past.\n  Anh Duong has worked for the Naval Surface Warfare Center, in Indian \nHead, MD, for 27 years. But her relationship with the U.S. Navy goes \nback farther. She came to this country after escaping Vietnam as a \nteenager, having fled by helicopter to a Navy vessel off-shore. After \ncoming to the United States, Anh obtained a degree in chemical \nengineering and computer science from the University of Maryland.\n  After graduation, Anh began working at the Naval Surface Warfare \nCenter as a chemical engineer, and from 1991-1999, she oversaw the \nCenter's advanced development programs in high explosives. From 1999-\n2002, she worked as the head of its programs to develop undersea \nweapons.\n  After the September 11 attacks, when our Armed Forces were given the \nmission to defeat the Taliban, it was Anh who was asked to develop a \nthermobaric bomb that could be used to reach deep into Afghanistan's \nmountain caves, where Taliban fighters were hiding. She and her team \nwere only given 100 days to prepare such a weapon for use. They did it \nin 67 days.\n  Since 2006, she has been working with the Naval Criminal \nInvestigative Service to create mobile battlefield forensics labs to \nhelp quickly identify those behind terrorist attacks. Anh Duong was \nawarded the Service to America Medal for National Security in 2007.\n  Another dedicated Federal employee, who won the Service to America \nNational Security medal in 2005, is Alan Estevez. Alan is the Principle \nDeputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Military \nReadiness.\n  The old adage says that ``an army runs on its stomach.'' In fact, a \nmodern military runs on much more than that. There are thousands of \npieces of equipment and supplies that need to be transported in and out \nof an area of operations. Alan has been working since 1981 to make our \nmilitary logistics system more efficient.\n  Over the past several years, Alan has overseen efforts to implement \nradio frequency identification, or ``RFID'' technology into our \nmilitary supply chain. He saw that companies like Wal-Mart were using \nRFID to track products with a high degree of accuracy and to reduce \nwaste.\n  Alan's work over the past three decades has saved the military, and \nthe taxpayers, countless dollars and has helped ensure that our troops \nhave the supplies they need to fulfill their missions.\n  Another Service to America medalist I want to highlight today is Riaz \nAwan. He served as the Energy Department's attache in the Ukraine when \nhe won a Sammie for his work to secure the site of the 1986 Chernobyl \nmeltdown.\n\n[[Page S3128]]\n\n  Riaz won the 2003 Service to America Medal for International Affairs, \nwhich recognized the several years he spent living near the site of the \nChernobyl disaster and working with the local communities to mitigate \nits social and economic impact. As part of his work, Riaz oversaw the \nconstruction of a new concrete shelter over the former Chernobyl \nreactor, one of the largest and most complex engineering projects in \nthe world at the time.\n  Additionally, his work on nonproliferation in the Ukraine has helped \nprevent terrorists from getting their hands on nuclear materials \nleftover from the fall of the Soviet Union.\n  In the same year that Riaz won his award, the Service to America \nMedal for Call to Service, which recognizes new Federal employees, was \nwon by Alyson McFarland of the State Department.\n  Alyson had only worked at the State Department for 3 years when she \nfound herself in the middle of a tense diplomatic situation. She was \nworking as a program development officer at our consulate in the \nnorthern Chinese city of Shenyang, near the North Korean border. One \nsummer day, in 2002, three North Korean refugees jumped over the \nconsulate wall, seeking asylum.\n  Alyson was one of the only Korean-speakers working in the consulate, \nand she quickly became instrumental in communicating with the refugees \nand authorities from the Chinese and South Korean governments. By \nplaying a key role in supporting the negotiations with the refugees and \ngovernment officials, she helped enable the asylum-seekers to reach \nfreedom in South Korea. At the time of the incident, she was only 28 \nyears old.\n  The fifth and final story I want to share today is about the winner \nof the 2002 Service to America Medal for Justice and Law Enforcement. \nSpecial Agent Robert Rutherford won it for his work at the U.S. Customs \nService, which has since been renamed as U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection.\n  Robert served as the Group Supervisor for the Customs Service's Air-\nMarine Investigations Group in Miami, and his primary job was to keep \nillegal drugs from reaching American shores.\n  Starting in 1999, Robert began noticing a sharp rise in the amount of \ncocaine and other narcotics being smuggled into the country from Haiti, \nwhich was contributing to a rise in local crime.\n  On his own initiative, Robert worked with his colleagues to form \nOperation River Sweep to block the Miami River as a trafficking route \nfor drugs. As part of the operation, he led a first-of-its-kind intra-\nagency task force under the direction of the Customs Service. Between \n1999 and 2001, Operation River Sweep made over 120 arrests and \nprevented over 13,000 pounds of cocaine from reaching Florida \ncommunities.\n  As Robert's efforts met with success, the local crime rate dropped. \nIn order to stay afloat, the drug traffickers adapted their methods, \nhoping to outsmart the Customs Service.\n  However, in 2001, Robert launched a second task force, Operation \nRiver Walk, involving over 300 law enforcement personnel from local, \nState, and Federal agencies. This second task force arrested over 230 \ntrafficking suspects and seized over 15,000 pounds of cocaine and \ncannabis.\n  Though the details are different in each case, all five of these \nstories about Service to America winners send the same message. It is a \nmessage of service above self, of motivation to carry out the people's \nwork.\n  When I first spoke about Federal employees a year ago, I noted the \nimportance of the oath taken by all those who serve in Federal \nGovernment. The spirit of that oath, to ``support and defend the \nConstitution'' and ``faithfully discharge the duties of the office,'' \nundergirds the service of every man and woman who has worked as a \nFederal employee since 1789.\n  Our work in Congress today is the drafting of a blueprint for \nrecovery, security, and prosperity. The task of building and \nmaintaining these edifices we design will belong to the dedicated and \nindustrious civil servants upon whom all Americans daily rely.\n  They are the regulators who will restore stability to our financial \nsystem.\n  They are the lawyers who will prosecute terrorists detained overseas.\n  They are the doctors and nurses who will care for our returning \nveterans.\n  They are the aid workers who spread hope and healing around the \nworld.\n  They are the instruments by which we, the people, secure the \n``blessings of liberty.''\n  As we mark Public Service Recognition Week, let us all make an effort \nto thank those who have chosen the path of public service. They are all \ntruly great Federal employees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the American people are tired. They are \ntired of the government spending money that it does not have while they \nare forced to make tough decisions about their own family's budgets.\n  But more importantly, the American people are tired of the government \nstepping in, blank check in hand, to bail out giant Wall Street firms \nthat were irresponsible with their money. The American people are sick \nand tired of seeing their hard-earned taxpayer dollars squandered in \nthe name of too big to fail.\n  One of the most important lessons that we learned from this financial \ncrisis, hopefully we learned, is that the bailouts were unfair. They \nallowed the government to manipulate the market by picking winners and \nlosers, and they used taxpayer dollars to do so.\n  Republicans have made this point repeatedly during this debate. Those \non the other side of the aisle have accused us of trying to hold up \nreform. But what we have been trying to do is to listen to the American \npeople when they demand no more bailouts.\n  This bill does not address the concerns of the American people. \nDespite the enormous size of this bill, and its complexity--and believe \nme, it is truly complex--I do not believe anybody in this Chamber--as a \nmatter of fact, I do not believe anybody on Capitol Hill fully \nunderstands this bill.\n  This bill makes more explicit the ability of the government to \ncontinue to pick winners and losers when bailing out irresponsible Wall \nStreet firms. I come from a State where gambling is a big part of our \neconomy. Yet a Las Vegas casino could not get away with half of the \ngambling that Wall Street does. When people walk into a casino to \ngamble, they do so knowing that the odds are against them.\n  But Wall Street takes gambling to a whole new level. They do it \nbecause they actually manipulate the odds while someone is playing the \ngame. What is more, Wall Street then asks the government to cover their \nbets when they can no longer afford to do so on their own.\n  Can you imagine a casino booking a bad bet and losing money, and then \nasking the government to bail them out? That is basically what Wall \nStreet did. And this bill continues that ability.\n  The proof of this is self-evident because we are now debating an \namendment that tries to fix that, the Boxer amendment. If this bill did \nwhat it claimed to do, we wouldn't be here debating this amendment \nwhich, although this amendment sounds very nice, it actually does very \nlittle to address the problem of preventing future bailouts. This bill \nstill creates a new government bureaucracy for the purpose of managing \nbailed-out banks and their creditors. The language of this amendment \ndoes nothing to prevent taxpayer money from being used to pay off debts \nof failed financial institutions. For example, billions of dollars in \ntaxpayer money were used to pay AIG's obligations to Goldman Sachs \nafter the insurance giant collapsed. This amendment does nothing to \nstop the Federal Reserve from risking even more taxpayer money on these \nfirms in the future. The language of this amendment does not even \nprevent the government from imposing fees on companies that can be \nspent to bail out firms.\n  I regret this flawed bill is on the floor now instead of a bipartisan \npiece of legislation the American people have been asking for and, \nquite frankly, deserve. I hope in the process of debate, we can offer \namendments that will fix this legislation, that will finally end this \ntoo-big-to-fail concept. Instead, the American people are left dealing \nwith the reality that another partisan bill has come to the floor and \nwill probably become law. Another government bureaucracy will be \ncreated as a result of this legislation with little regard to the will \nof the people.\n\n[[Page S3129]]\n\n  Here we go again. Unfortunately, too much partisanship has gone on in \nthis body. There are several of us working on bipartisan amendments. I \nhope we can dramatically improve this bill. Both sides have the same \nobjectives. We want to clean up Wall Street. We don't want to do that \nwhile hurting Main Street. We want to hold Wall Street accountable, but \nwe don't want to do it in a way that harms people who had nothing to do \nwith the financial crisis.\n  I hope we actually can end up with a system that ends too big to \nfail. We already have several financial institutions that are already \ntoo big to fail. What to do about those firms is very difficult, very \ncomplex, and we have to do it in a way that doesn't mess up our entire \nfinancial system and system of credit. I believe we need to take our \ntime, because the expertise to get this right is difficult to get. I \ndon't believe necessarily the Senate or the House has that kind of \nexpertise. We need to take our time on this bill to get it right, to \nmake sure we are doing what we are intending to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I don't know if there has ever been a \nperfect law. Maybe the law that was written on stone tablets and \nbrought down the mountain by Senator Moses was a perfect law. Ever \nsince then, human beings have tried to write laws that are good and \nacknowledge that they are human. Maybe the laws will have to be \nrevisited and changed and revised. That humility comes with this job, \nbecause you understand this is an imperfect process. We debate, try to \nreach compromises and make concessions. Virtually every time at the \nend, you say: That isn't what I would have written, but that is what \nthe Senate decided to move forward with.\n  Now we are in the midst of debating this law, 1,407 pages long, \ncalled the Financial Stability Act. Why are we doing a bill that looks \nlike a telephone directory? We are doing it because of the recession, a \nrecession which, frankly, hit America harder than anything since the \nGreat Depression. Seventeen trillion dollars was taken out of the \nAmerican economy. That is more than the value of all the goods and \nservices produced in the United States in 1 year; $17 trillion yanked \nout of the economy, and most of us felt it. You felt it in your savings \naccount, your 401(k). You saw it when the shop down the street laid \nsomebody off or closed.\n  We know this is a real recession that hit America hard, 8 million \npeople unemployed, 6 million people sitting out there frustrated, not \neven looking for jobs. That is a real recession. How did we reach that? \nWe reached that because of some very bad decisions in Washington and on \nWall Street. The decisions in Washington related to the future of \nhousing. Are we going to expand the opportunity to own homes to people \nwho traditionally did not own them? We thought it was a good idea.\n  I can remember when my wife and I bought our first home. Our lives \nchanged. We were no longer renters. We were interested in that house \nand in our block and our neighborhood, our parish, and our community. \nIt is a different look at life. Home ownership is a real American \nvalue. We also thought it was a pretty good investment. Stretch to make \na house payment. Can we make it? Do you think we can make that monthly \npayment? If you can, you watch the value of that housing go up and say: \nPretty good decision. Nice little house for the family and a good \ninvestment.\n  So we thought in Washington, let's expand that model. There is \nnothing wrong with where we started. There was nothing selfish about it \nor outlandish that we would move in that direction. Then came Wall \nStreet. Wall Street said: If this is a good thing, we can make money on \nit. They took the mortgages people used to enter into with the bank \ndown the street or downtown and sold the mortgages downtown to some \nother bank. Pretty soon that mortgage went into the business atmosphere \nand was chopped up in pieces, sliced and diced into securities and \nderivatives, traded and sold at the highest levels of Wall Street. \nUnfortunately, it got out of hand. It got so far out of hand that at \nthe end of the day, it collapsed. Home values started coming down; \ndefaults and foreclosures started increasing. People making all the \nmoney on Wall Street were sitting in financial institutions that were \ncrumbling around them.\n  So where did they turn for help? They turned to taxpayers. They asked \ntaxpayers: Bail us out. Come to our rescue. Keep our company in \nbusiness even though we made some fundamental mistakes.\n  And we did. There is a good argument as to whether we should have. \nBut I can tell you, having sat in the room where the Secretary of the \nTreasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve said, Senators and \nCongressmen, if you don't move fast, the American economy is going to \ncollapse, what do you do? I have an education and some experience, but \nI am not sure I am ready to save the American economy singlehandedly. I \ntook their advice, as did others in bipartisan votes that led to the \nbailout that saved these institutions.\n  They showed their gratitude to American taxpayers for saving them \nfrom their own malfeasance by declaring bonuses for one another, \nmillion dollar checks they gave to one another in congratulations for \ntheir economic failure. Naturally, Members of Congress and the American \npublic said: It is disgusting that these people would make these \nmistakes. Ask the average mom-and-pop family to bail them out with \ntheir tax dollars and then give one another bonus checks to reward \ntheir misconduct.\n  That is what brought us here today. That is what this bill is about. \nThis bill is about changing financial institutions to guarantee there \nwill never be another taxpayer bailout, period. Senator Barbara Boxer \nof California has the first amendment. It is a critically important \namendment. It ought to have every vote in this Chamber. It says: No \nmore taxpayer bailouts, period. That is a good starting point.\n  But then let's proceed from there. What are we going to do about \nthese institutions to make sure they are held accountable, that they \ndon't get so big their failure jeopardizes the American economy? That \nis part of this as well, the amount of money they have to keep on hand, \nthe leverage, the liquidity, how they can loan this money, rules of the \nroad to make sure we never get into this recession mess again.\n\n  There is another provision in here too, one that I think is equally \nimportant. It says we are finally going to create one agency of \ngovernment that is going to look out for families and businesses across \nAmerica who can be duped into legal agreements that can explode on them \nat the expense of their life's savings or their home. It is a consumer \nfinancial protection law, the strongest one ever passed in the history \nof the country.\n  I heard the Senator from Nevada call it a massive bureaucracy. It is \nnot that. In fact, it is a self-enforcing agency that has the power to \nmake decisions independently of existing agencies of government with \none goal in mind: Empower consumers across America to make the right \nchoices. We can't make the final decision about whether you sign that \nmortgage paper. We shouldn't. But you ought to know when you sign it \nwhat you are getting into. What is the interest rate? What is the term \nof this mortgage? Can I prepay this mortgage without penalty? Those are \nbasic questions people need to be asked and answered. That is what this \nbill is going to guarantee through the Consumer Financial Protection \nAgency.\n  It took a long time to get to the point today where we will have our \nfirst vote on this bill. It took much longer than it should have. \nSenator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, who is chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, sat down with Republicans, Senator Shelby of Alabama, over 3 \nmonths ago and said: Let's work together. Let's make this a bipartisan \nbill. After 2 months of effort, they concluded they couldn't reach \nagreement. At that point Senator Dodd said: I will reach out to Senator \nCorker of Tennessee, a Republican, and see if I can reach agreement \nwith him for a bipartisan bill. He is on my committee.\n  They worked for a month. They could not reach agreement. So Senator \nDodd said: There comes a point where we have to move this legislation. \nHe called this bill before his Senate Banking Committee and invited \nRepublicans and Democrats on the committee to\n\n[[Page S3130]]\n\ngive their best ideas. How would they change this, improve it? What \nwould you do to this bill?\n  Republicans filed over 400 amendments to this bill. That is a lot of \nwork. Then came the day of the actual hearing on the bill. The decision \nwas made on the other side of the aisle not to offer one single \namendment, not one. Twenty minutes after it convened, it voted to pass \nthe bill out and adjourned.\n  So when Senators from the Republican side of the aisle come in and \nsay: There is not enough bipartisanship in this bill, I have to tell \nyou, it isn't because of a lack of effort by Senator Dodd and members \nof the Banking Committee. We have tried to engage our friends on the \nother side of the aisle to help us make this a better bill. We still \noffer that invitation. There will be bipartisan amendments. There \nshould be bipartisan amendments. But at the end of the day, if we don't \nmake a fundamental change in the economy and the way we manage \nfinancial institutions, we will invite another breakdown, and we can't \nlet that happen. There have been too many victims of this recession to \nlet that happen.\n  President Obama has challenged us to get this done. We do so little \naround here. It is frustrating. We spent a whole week a few weeks ago, \n1 whole week, debating whether we would extend unemployment benefits \nfor 4 weeks. One week of debate, four weeks of extension. The following \nweek we spent an entire week on the Senate floor debating five nominees \nthe President had sent to us out of the 100 sitting on the calendar. \nAll of these nominees were noncontroversial, passed with strong votes. \nWe ate up an entire week on these nominees.\n  Then we wasted last week when the Republicans mounted a filibuster to \ntry to stop debate on this bill. Three straight votes, Monday, Tuesday, \nand Wednesday of last week in favor of a filibuster. And finally, thank \ngoodness, several Republican Senators went to their leadership and \nsaid: This is a bad idea. We ought to be on the right side of history \nfor Wall Street reform, and we are not going along anymore with the \nfilibuster. At which point it ended, and we started moving to the bill.\n  Today we may take up the first amendment. I hope we do. There are a \nlot of things that need to be included in this. Let me tell you one \nthing I will offer an amendment on which most Americans are not aware \nof. If you have a credit card and you go to a local business, whether \nit is a restaurant or a flower shop or to get your oil changed, and you \npresent your credit card to pay for the service or the goods you are \nbuying, you are not only going to pay the shopkeeper, the shopkeeper is \ngoing to owe the bank that issued the credit card a percent of what you \npaid. It is called an interchange fee. It turns out to be a substantial \namount of money for retailers. They end up paying these credit card \ncompanies a percentage of the bill for the use of the credit card. \nThere is nothing wrong with that. There should be a fee associated with \nthe use of credit cards by businesses. But it has reached a point of \nunreasonableness. It has reached a point of unfairness. Let me give an \nexample.\n  If I go to a restaurant in Chicago and pay for my dinner with a \ncheck, the restaurant turns the check in to the bank. The bank contacts \nmy bank, the money transfers. There is no fee, no cost. However, if I \ngo to the same restaurant and use a debit card, which takes the money \ndirectly out of my bank account just like a check, the company that \nissued the debit card and credit card will charge a percentage of that \nrestaurant check to the owner of the restaurant. That money is coming \ndirectly out of my checking account just as a check is.\n  Why is the credit card company taking as much in a fee from a \nrestaurant as they do with a credit card, where there is at least some \nquestion as to whether ultimate payment will be made?\n  So we are going to have an amendment which addresses the interchange \nfee and tries to bring some fairness to it. I think it is long overdue. \nI hope all of the Members of the Senate who believe in small businesses \nwill call them and ask them about the Durbin amendment on interchange \nfees. You will find, as I have, this is one of the major concerns of \nretailers and businesses across the United States.\n  I talked to a CEO of a major drugstore chain yesterday, and he told \nme his top four expenses for his nationwide chain of drug stores: No. \n1, salaries; No. 2, what he called mortgages and rent; No. 3, health \ncare, No. 4, interchange fees--the amount of money his chain pays to \ncredit card companies. It is a huge expense of small business.\n  We are not saying there should not be an interchange fee. We are \nsaying it should be reasonable, and if it does not involve effort, \nservice, or liability on the part of the credit card company--such as \nthe debit card--it ought to be reflected in the fee that is charged.\n  The last amendment I submitted is one I think taxpayers across the \ncountry ought to pay attention to. More and more each year, the Federal \nGovernment is accepting payment by credit card. You can pay for your \nincome tax with a credit card. What does that men? It means Uncle Sam--\nthe taxpayers--pays an interchange fee to the credit card companies, \neven though, ultimately, those credit card companies are all being \npaid.\n  So in my estimation, it calls for an amendment which says the lowest \ninterchange fee rate should be charged to the Federal Government, so \nthe taxpayers are not subsidizing credit card companies, which they are \ncurrently doing with interchange fees that do not reflect the liability \ninvolved in the transaction.\n  This is just one of the aspects of the bill. Some will say: Well, \nwhat does that have to do with the recession? I can tell you, consumer \ndebt and personal debt had a lot to do with the recession. A lot of \npeople, in desperation, turned to their credit cards. A lot of people \nfound the interest rates on their credit cards going through the roof, \nand a lot of people did not understand why they were so expensive.\n  We are going to bring this out for debate. Once again, I hope my \ncolleagues who support small businesses, as I do, and believe they are \na lifeline to bring us out of this recession will join me in supporting \nsmall businesses to make sure we bring some sense to the interchange \nfees charged on credit cards and debit cards across America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I just spoke with Senator Shelby on the \nphone. We have been working to reach agreement on the so-called too-\nbig-to-fail sections of the bill. I spoke with him, and while he will \nbe coming over shortly and we will have a vote on this early this \nafternoon, the leaders have to set the time, I presume, that after the \nrespective lunches we will be able to vote on this and the Boxer \namendment. I will leave it to the leaders before I make a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  I want to describe briefly to my colleagues what we have agreed on \nto, hopefully, resolve this matter of too big to fail.\n  For over a year, Senator Shelby and I have been working on ways to \nend bailouts. We agree that ought to be done. We have had differences \nin other areas, but we have shared a commitment to ensure that \ntaxpayers would never again be forced to bail out giant Wall Street \nfirms that fail.\n  Last November, I asked our colleagues from Virginia and Tennessee, \nSenator Warner and Senator Corker, to produce an agreement on how best \nto resolve failed companies.\n  They did a tremendous job. I commend both of our colleagues. They \nworked hard, as did their staffs, to draft language as part of the \nunderlying bill. The package they produced would create effective \noversight for large firms and make these firms pay for the risks they \npose to our economy and country. Their agreement put a mechanism in \nplace to guarantee that when large firms fail, they fail. The \nmanagement is fired, creditors and shareholders take losses, the \ncompany is liquidated, and taxpayers aren't on the hook.\n  This is a complicated area, and a number of my colleagues on the \nother side had raised some reservations. So I\n\n[[Page S3131]]\n\nspent the last few months working with Senator Shelby to clear up any \nmisconceptions people may have had and otherwise address the concerns.\n  After weeks of negotiations--and, really, months if you consider all \nof the work that has gone on over the last year--I am proud to say the \ntwo of us have an agreement in this area. We intend to offer it as an \namendment to the bill early this afternoon.\n  Let me go over the amendment, if I can. First, most of the provisions \nstay intact because we agree on the fundamentals of this bill. There \nwill be an orderly liquidation mechanism for FDIC to unwind failing \nsystemically significant financial companies.\n  Second, shareholders and unsecured creditors will still bear losses, \nand management will be removed.\n  Third, regulators will still have the authority to break up a company \nif it poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the United \nStates. That is important.\n  Large bank holding companies that have received TARP funds will still \nnot be able to avoid Federal Reserve supervision by simply dropping \ntheir banks.\n  Most large financial companies are still expected to be resolved \nthrough the bankruptcy process. The bill will continue to eliminate the \nability of the Federal Reserve to prop up failed institutions such as \nAIG.\n  These measures represent a fundamental change in our country's \nability to protect taxpayers from the economic fallout of having a \nlarge, interconnected firm collapse.\n  These measures will end the idea that any one company is too big to \nfail.\n  These measures will prevent large failing firms from holding our \ncountry hostage, extorting giant taxpayer-funded bailouts under the \nthreat of economic disaster. So, today, we announce a few changes to \nthe larger package.\n  First, as I have said, one of the ideas proposed by some of our \ncolleagues, including our friends on the other side, was to create a \nfund, paid for in advance by the largest financial firms, to cover the \ncost of liquidating failed companies. This was not in my initial draft \noffered in November and was opposed by the Obama administration. Other \nRepublicans have now expressed concerns about that prepaid fund because \nwhether they pay in advance or after the fact, these costs will be paid \nby Wall Street, not the taxpayers. So I have no objection to dropping \nthat provision. In fact, I was rather agnostic on it, as many of my \ncolleagues were. We have the common goal to make sure taxpayers would \nnot bear any costs. That is what we tried to achieve. There are a \nvariety of ways of doing it. There were those who raised concerns about \nthe prepayment program and raised the possibility, or the specter, or \nthe optics that somehow they could be getting a preferred status. That \nwas never the intent, but because people are concerned about the optics \nof it, we agreed to have a postpayment responsibility, or fund, that \nwould be borne by creditors or the industry itself, based on whether \nthere were enough assets in the failed institution to pick up the costs \nof winding down that firm that was failing. So that is where this comes \nfrom.\n  Creditors will be required to pay back the government any amounts \nthey received above what they would have gotten in liquidation. Those \nwho directly benefited from the orderly liquidation will be the first \nto pay back the government at a premium rate.\n  Congress must approve the use of debt guarantees. The Federal Reserve \ncan only use its 13(3) emergency lending authority to help solvent \ncompanies. Regulators can ban culpable management and directors of \nfailed firms from working in the financial sector. That is an add-on. \nIt makes sense that if someone has been involved in the mismanagement \nof a company and caused this kind of disruption in the economy, then it \nrequires that they would be banned from engaging in further economic \nactivities.\n  With this agreement, there can be no doubt that the Senate is unified \nin its commitment to end taxpayer-funded bailouts.\n  There are some other provisions that I will run down very briefly: \nclawbacks of excess payments to creditors. This will allow, from \ncreditors or the failed company, any payments that exceed what \ncreditors otherwise would have received in liquidation. There is 100 \npercent taxpayer protection through assessments. It maintains the \nprotections in the bill so if the assets in the failed company and \nclawbacks from creditors are not enough to pay back all the Treasury \nborrowing with interest, FDIC will charge assessments to large firms, a \npenalty interest rate. There is a time limit on receivership. \nManagement gets paid last any salaries or other compensation owed \nexecutives. Failed companies are paid last after creditors. There is a \nban on management from going to work in the financial sector. There is \na judicial check in this amendment, IG review, which requires the \ninspector general and various agencies and Federal regulators to review \nactions taken under the orderly liquidation authority. Financial \ncompany definitions are included, reports and testimony on top of the \nrequirements in the underlying bill, the FDIC will have additional \nreporting requirements and will have to testify before Congress.\n  As I mentioned, the 13(3) lending restrictions are only applied to \nsolvent companies, as well. A congressional approval of FDIC emergency \ndebt guarantees is included in this package as well.\n  So there are a number of provisions, all of which we think basically \nmake sense. We never argued with these ideas at all and the idea of \nwhether it is prepayment or postpayment was an argument that went back \nand forth without any strong objections. Many of us were trying to \nfigure out the best way to do this so taxpayers would not be left on \nthe hook. Obviously, I want to leave time for Senator Shelby who will \ncome over to talk about it. I wanted to give my colleagues an idea of \nthe agreement that I am prepared to support when Senator Shelby offers \nthis as an amendment.\n  I see my friend from New Hampshire on the Senate floor. I will be \nglad to share this information and the other parts of the bill with my \ncolleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about another part of the \nbill. I congratulate the chairman for the work he and Senator Shelby \ndid on reaching this resolution on too big to fail. It is an important \nstep forward on a critical part of the legislation. I think it shows \nthat there are a lot of places where we can reach a bipartisan \nconsensus in this bill.\n  It is my sense that the great and very positive work done on \nresolution authority will--I would hope it will carry over to things \nsuch as the derivatives issue, which needs to be worked on, and issues \nsuch as underwriting standards and how the regulatory structure is \ncreated and how the chairs are moved around in that area. I think all \nof these issues are fertile ground for reaching consensus. I know the \nSenator from Connecticut has been constructive in his efforts to reach \nacross the aisle.\n  This bill can be a very strong and positive piece of legislation. I \nhope it ends that way. I think this is a strong and good step in that \ndirection, with the announcement by the chairman on the agreement of \nresolution authority.\n  I want to speak about a part of the bill that has been ignored \nbecause there have been so many big issues. That is what happens when \nyou bring a bill this large to the floor. It is 1,400 pages, and it has \na lot of language in it. It had to be a large bill because it deals \nwith a complex issue. Included in the bill is language that was sort of \nbaggage thrown on the train--that is the way I describe it--in the area \nof corporate governance. To a large degree, by its own definition, it \nhas virtually nothing to do with financial regulatory reform. This \nlanguage does a series of things: It primarily federalizes corporate \nlaw relative to the manner in which stockholders and directors and \nexecutives of corporations are treated.\n  It is not limited to financial institutions but to any publicly \ntraded company. It guarantees what is known as proxy assets under \nFederal law. That is a right traditionally set up by States. It sets up \nstandards for how directors are elected under Federal law for all \ncompanies. That is a right that has usually been reserved to the \nStates. It even puts in place a requirement that corporations disclose \ncertain information that has absolutely no relevance at all to \nfinancial reform because it deals with every company in America\n\n[[Page S3132]]\n\nthat is publicly held, such as the ratio of compensation between \ndifferent workers within a company and the manner in which boards of \ndirectors are elected, whether it is all at once or under staggered \nterms.\n  It is a major push by the Federal Government into an arena that has \nalways, historically, been primarily the role of States. It steps all \nover States rights, in my opinion--the right of shareholders to have \ncompanies they are comfortable with and are being well managed for the \npurpose of returning a reasonable return to the shareholders. It will \nundermine shareholders' rights, in my opinion, not increase them.\n  If we look at the proposal specifically, let's take proxy assets. \nThis is a term of art that essentially says that any group of \nshareholders will be able to put on a proxy statement a proposal for \nhow the company should be run. If someone wants to balkanize a company, \nthere is probably no quicker way to do it than to have unilateral proxy \nassets for any issue that is of concern or interest to some group that \nbuys shares. This type of language is essentially put in to promote \nspecial interest activity. We all hear about how terrible special \ninterests are. This language is special interest language for the \npurpose of promoting special interest groups--starting with the trial \nlawyers, of course, but followed up by various people who have a social \njustice purpose relative to some corporation.\n  Let's take a group or a company such as McDonald's. Say a group \nbelieves they are selling too much food that creates the opportunity \nfor people to eat too much and causes obesity.\n  You could have a special interest group that was concerned about that \nbuy stock and force a proxy statement on what type of food McDonald's \nshould sell. It does not stop there. Of course, there are all sorts of \nissues about which special interest groups want to promote and change \ncorporate governance.\n  How you manage a corporation is supposed to be primarily in the hands \nof the boards of directors who are answerable to the stockholders. The \npurpose, of course, is to increase the value of the stockholders as a \nwhole and their return on their investment. In most instances, that is \nthe primary purpose of a corporation. But this Federal access, this \nproxy access is all about the opposite. It is about pushing agendas \nonto the management of corporations, through the boards of directors, \nthrough the proxy process that is very special-interest oriented and \nvery narrow in its purpose and is not necessarily directed at return on \nthe investment for the stockholders. It has just the opposite effect.\n  Short-term objectives become the standard of the day under this type \nof approach rather than a long-term view, which is what most of our \nboards of directors are supposed to take relative to these decisions. \nThe cause of the day, the cause du jour, could be any number of things. \nIf it happens to be the activist view of the day, it becomes the issue \nunder corporate governance versus the purpose of managing the \ncorporation well over the long term in order to get adequate return to \nthe shareholders.\n  It is an inappropriate idea, especially inappropriate for the Federal \nGovernment to bury it in this bill. This language applies to every \npublicly traded corporation in America, not just the financial \ninstitutions. Why is it buried in this bill? It should not be in there.\n  The same can be said of the way this bill, this language approaches \ndirectors and what the shareholders' rights are relative to directors. \nThese have historically been State decisions. In fact, the State of \nDelaware, which is obviously the leading State on the issue of \ncorporate governance and has developed a uniform corporate governance \nstructure which a lot of States have adopted, including my State of New \nHampshire, which basically tracks Delaware to a large degree--that has \nbeen the law of the land for all intents and purposes, settled law, \npredictable law, the purpose of which is to have fair and adequate \ncorporate governance, where the directors are responsible to the \nshareholders under a structure that everybody knows the rules and which \nis controlled by the States.\n  Yet this bill comes in and does fundamental harm to that. For what \npurpose? Because there is an agenda in this Congress to usurp States \nrights to be able to manage corporate law and to put in place of it \nopinions and ideas which are only supported by a very narrow group of \nspecial interests that basically have gotten the ear of people in this \nCongress. That is the ultimate special interest legislation.\n  The implications for these companies is, it is going to be darn \nexpensive, if you are a small- or middle-sized company, to deal with \nthis type of Federal interference with the management of the company \nand the proxy process. It is a very inappropriate initiative.\n  Furthermore, this creates an atmosphere where nobody is going to know \nwho is governing what because you are going to now have State law and \nyou are going to have Federal law and you are going to have the SEC \nwhose responsibility will increase dramatically. We already know the \nSEC is strained to do what we have asked them to do. They have some big \nresponsibilities. They have big responsibilities in the financial \nreform area. They have big responsibilities in corporate governance, \ngenerally. To push this further burden on them is going to be very \ndifficult for them to meet. I happen to be a very strong supporter of \nhaving a robust SEC, but we should not burden them unnecessarily with a \nwhole new set of corporate governance rules, which are already \nadequately and appropriately addressed by State law, primarily Delaware \nState law but other States which have their own corporate rules.\n  More important, we should not undermine the rights of stockholders \nacross this country to be able to get a reasonable return on their \ninvestments by being reasonably assured that their management--\nspecifically, the directors of the company--are working for the \npurposes of the company's financial return and strength versus for the \npurpose of some special interest group that comes in and wants to put \nspecial interest legislation in the middle of the corporate governance \neffort, which is exactly for which this language is proposed. That is \nwhy it is here.\n  The reason this language is put forward is because there are a lot of \nself-proclaimed social justice groups in this country that decided they \nwant better access to corporate boards and have this Federal proxy \naccess which will basically balkanize, as I said earlier, the process \nof governing and leading these businesses in which most Americans are \ninvested.\n  The vast majority of Americans in this country either have a pension \nfund, IRAs, 401(k)s or are personally invested in the stock market. Why \ndo they invest? They invest to get a reasonable return on that \ninvestment, either in the way of appreciation or in the way of \ndividends or maybe a combination. That is what they do. Most of the \nsavings--a lot of the savings in this country are tied up in that.\n  Why would this language appear which will basically undermine those \nstockholders' rights and ability to presume and expect that their \ndirectors are going to be managing for the purposes of the \nstockholders-at-large versus for a single interest group within the \nstockholder group that happens to want to put a social justice agenda \ninto the management of that corporation? It makes no sense at all, \nunless you happen to be a special interest group.\n  We rail around here all the time. I hear, ironically, from a lot of \ngroups that are sponsoring this language, such as Public Citizen, that \nthey are against special interests. Yet here we have the most \nsignificant piece of special interest legislation in this whole bill, \nan attempt to bootstrap special interest groups' social agenda and \nforce them on corporations and stockholders who would otherwise not \npursue their agendas because they are interested in getting a return on \ntheir investment. It is going to, as I mentioned earlier, make it much \nmore difficult for us to have a vibrant stock market and a corporate \nstructure in this country which is rational, and it certainly will \nundermine significantly States rights in the area of corporate \ngovernance, which historically had primary responsibility for setting \nup the rules by which our corporations operate.\n  I hope that as this bill moves down the road, this type of language, \nwhich is extraneous--totally extraneous--to the financial reform effort \nbecause it affects all public corporations and,\n\n[[Page S3133]]\n\nironically, the three financial corporations which are at the core of \nthe problem we had in 2008 relative to visibility--AIG, Lehman, and I \nbelieve one other, maybe Citibank--had a couple of these rules in place \nanyway. Obviously, they had nothing to do with reducing the \nimplications of the event. Rather, this language is simply put in \nbecause some group got somebody's ear. I hope it will be taken out \nbefore we get to the end of the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, roughly 2 years ago, the American \neconomy stood on the verge of collapse. After years of growth and \nseemingly endless prosperity, the honeymoon was suddenly over. The \nbubble burst. The world was plunged into recession. Banks began to \nfail, foreclosures skyrocketed, businesses struggled, and many \nAmericans lost their jobs. Working families saw their hard-earned \neconomic security evaporate almost overnight. Some of our largest and \nmost respected financial institutions were forced to close their doors \nand others were in imminent danger.\n  In Washington, policymakers found themselves face to face with the \nworst economic crisis since the Great Depression. They took action. \nThey were forced to make some difficult decisions, but they stopped the \nbleeding and set America back on the road to recovery.\n  It is well known that reckless actions by large Wall Street firms \nhelped get us into this economic mess. These companies skirted rules \nand regulations. They gambled with the securities of the entire \nfinancial system, and they lost.\n  But my colleagues knew that if these large institutions collapsed, \nthey would bring down the rest of our economy with them. They had \nbecome, as we say on this floor, too big to fail.\n  In the face of the potential catastrophe, many of my colleagues \nsummoned the kind of political courage that is rare in this town. They \nbit the bullet and voted to bail out these large firms, not because the \nfirms deserved government help but because it was the only way to stop \nthis recession from turning into a depression.\n  It must have been a painful decision, but it provided stability at a \nvolatile moment. It propped up ailing markets all over the world and \nhelped pull this country out of an economic tailspin.\n  Today, our recovery remains fragile, but we are moving in the right \ndirection. Too many Americans remain unemployed, but the economy is \nstarting to grow again. Key indicators are finally turning around.\n  As this Chamber considers Wall Street reform, I believe it is time to \nmake sure this can never happen again. Let's protect our financial \nsystem from the kind of recklessness and abuse that has cost us so \nmuch. Let's make sure we never again will be forced to prop up big \nbanks or risk total collapse. Let us end too big to fail.\n  As a former banker, I have a deep understanding of the role our \nfinancial institutions play. Banks help direct investment to local \ncommunities. They provide credit to small businesses and security to \nworking families. When they make bad decisions, they deserve to suffer \nthe consequences of those decisions. That is how our free market system \nworks.\n  When big banks try to get around these responsibilities, when they \npackage these risk investments and sell off the risk to someone else, \nthat is not banking, that is gambling. Without commonsense regulations \nand vigorous oversight, Wall Street becomes a casino. I heard my \ndistinguished colleague from Nevada mention that Nevada is the gambling \ncapital of the world. But Nevada would not even buy some of these odds \nin which some of these banks are involved.\n  Sometimes these companies get lucky and their bets may pay off. But \nother times they are not so lucky. That is when they look to working \nfamilies to either bail them out or suffer a second Great Depression.\n  We need to make sure Americans never have to face this choice again. \nWe have to prevent firms from growing so large and reckless that they \nthreaten our entire economy. That is why I support the bill introduced \nby Chairman Dodd and say that it is a good bill, it is a strong bill \nwhich will end taxpayer bailouts, restore oversight, and set basic \nrules of the road so we can make sure too big to fail is a thing of the \npast.\n  This bill will institute the Volcker rule, which will both restore \nand modernize some of the key protections of the Glass-Steagall Act of \n1933. I am also cosponsor of an amendment that is coming forward in \nthis regard. I really support us going back to Glass-Steagall, having \nbeen a banker during those days when you couldn't invest in insurance \ncompanies, you couldn't invest in mortgage banking activity, and you \nhad to be a commercial bank that took in the lending and the security \nof people's assets and made loans in that regard. So this would help \nprevent fraud, discourage conflict of interest, and keep banks from \ngrowing so large they threaten our economic security.\n  The bill would also give us the tools to monitor big banks for risky \nbehavior so that we could crack down on the irresponsible practices \nthat caused this mess in the first place.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill as it will be amended, and I \ncall upon them to join my good friend Senator Boxer in passing her \namendment, which will help us bring down large unstable institutions \nwithout taxpayer bailouts. Taxpayers aren't going to take it anymore. \nWe aren't going to be bailing out these big institutions only to have \nthem turn around and pay huge bonuses to their top officials.\n  Over the past 2 years, we have made great strides in helping to turn \nour economy around. In the last Congress, Members of both parties did \nwhat was necessary to stop the recession from deepening. Then, a little \nmore than a year ago, I was proud to join many Members of this body in \npassing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act--a landmark bill \nthat continues to bring prosperity back to communities all across this \ncountry. As a result of these bold actions, our economy is finally on \nthe right track.\n  So let us in this body, at this time, finish this job. Let's pass \nthis Wall Street reform bill, as amended, so that we can establish the \nbasic rules of the road and allow our free markets to thrive again. \nLet's end too big to fail so no large bank will be able to gamble away \nour economic security. Let's do it now because the time is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                        Passing of Ernie Harwell\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wish to start with a poem in honor of \nErnie Harwell, who passed away yesterday. This is the way, for decade \nafter decade, the great broadcaster of the Detroit Tigers started when \nthe first game of the season came along.\n\n     For, lo, the winter is past,\n     The rain is over and gone;\n     The flowers appear on the Earth;\n     The time of the singing of birds is come,\n     And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land.\n\n  Well, for four decades a man named Ernie Harwell would recite those \nwords. He would recite them at the beginning of the first baseball \nbroadcast of spring training, and those are the words that would tell \nour people the long, cold winter was over.\n  Ernie was the radio voice of the Detroit Tigers for 42 years. During \nthat time, there may have been no Michiganian more universally beloved. \nOur State mourns today at his passing yesterday evening, after a long \nbattle with cancer. He fought that battle with the grace and good humor \nand the wisdom Michigan had come to expect and even depend on from a \nman we came to know and love.\n  This gentlemanly Georgian adopted our team and he adopted our State \nas his own, as did his family. His career would have been worthy had he \ndone nothing more than bring us the sound of summer over the radio, \nrecounting the Tigers' ups and downs with professionalism and wit, as \nhe did for all those years.\n  Without making a show of it, Ernie Harwell taught us in his work and \nhis life the value of kindness and respect. He taught us that in a city \nand a world too often divided, we could be united in joy at a great Al \nKaline catch or a Lou Whitaker home run or a Mark Fidrych strikeout. He \ntaught us not to let life pass us by, in his words, ``like the house by \nthe side of the road.''\n  In 1981, when he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, Ernie told the \nassembled fans what baseball meant to him, and these were his words:\n\n\n[[Page S3134]]\n\n\n       In baseball, democracy shines its clearest. The only race \n     that matters is the race to the bag. The creed is the \n     rulebook. Color merely something to distinguish one team's \n     uniform from another.\n\n  The was a lesson he taught us so well in everything he did in his \nlife.\n  I will miss Ernie Harwell personally and deeply and fondly. All of us \nin Michigan will miss the sound of his voice telling us that the winter \nis past, that the Tigers had won a big game or that they would get \nanother chance to win one tomorrow. We will miss his Georgia drawl, his \nhumor, his humility, his quiet faith in God, and the goodness in the \npeople he encountered. But we will carry in our hearts always our love \nfor Ernie Harwell, our appreciation for his work, and the lessons that \nhe gave us and left us and that we will pass on to our children and to \nour grandchildren.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, today I pay tribute to an \nextraordinary man who passed away yesterday at the age of 92 years old: \nErnie Harwell.\n  For 42 years, families throughout Michigan tuned into their radios \nand welcomed Ernie's signature voice into their homes as they listened \nto him call Detroit Tigers games. When he retired in 2002, Senator \nLevin and I submitted a resolution, which the Senate passed, \ncelebrating his achievements and congratulating him on his many years \nof service. Today, I join with millions of people in Michigan and \naround the Nation in wishing Ernie a final farewell.\n  His accomplishments were many, and he will always hold a special \nplace in our hearts and in our memories. He was the first active \nbroadcaster inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, and for good \nreason. In 1948, when he was calling games for a Minor League team in \nAtlanta, they actually traded Ernie--their announcer!--for a backup \ncatcher from the Brooklyn Dodgers. He joined the Detroit Tigers in 1960 \nand during his tenure, he missed only two games--one for the funeral of \nhis brother and another when he was inducted to the National \nSportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame.\n  His most memorable broadcasts include the broadcasting debut of \nWillie Mays in 1951, Bobby Thomson's ``shot heard 'round the world'' \nthat same year, and Hoyt Wilhelm's no-hitter against the New York \nYankees in 1958. Ernie brought to life, through the medium of radio, \nthe performances of some of baseball's greats, such as Sparky Anderson, \nKirk Gibson, Al Kaline, Denny McLain, Alan Trammell, and so many \nothers.\n  He loved the people of Michigan, and we surely loved him back. In \n2009, he said, ``I deeply appreciate the people of Michigan. I love \ntheir grit, I love the way they face life, I love the family values. \nAnd you Tiger fans are the greatest fans of all. No question about \nthat.''\n  Today, Tigers fans everywhere mourn the loss of the great man who \ngave us so many wonderful memories over the years. I offer my deepest \ncondolences to his beloved wife of 68 years, Lulu, his two sons and two \ndaughters, and his many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Although \nErnie has left us in this world, I know that he will live on in the \nmemories of every Tigers fan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask consent I be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Oilspill Threat\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, we have a huge potential \neconomic and environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that is \noccurring as we speak. It was on an exploratory rig. It is almost \nunbelievable how far they can now drill beneath the surface of the \nwater. In this case it was 5,000 feet, and then, at the ocean bottom, \nthey were able to drill another 13,000 feet down to find a pocket of \noil, all of which caused this explosion because of the pressure of the \noil and the gas, the natural gas, creating such an overpressure that it \nexploded at the wellhead at the sea bottom. A device, a so-called \nblowout preventer, that had three safety mechanisms in order to stop \nthe flow of oil in the case of a blowout--none of those three safety \nmechanisms have worked.\n  The first was a mechanism that would be activated by a switch 5,000 \nfeet up from the sea bed on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico on the \nfloating exploratory rig. There were actually two switches. One was \nflipped closer to the surface by workers on the rig, who unfortunately \nlost their lives and they have not been found. The second switch was at \na higher level. I think they refer to it as the bridge. Those workers \nwere rescued. They confirm that switch was flipped, which was to \nautomatically cause the first safety device to go into activation, \nwhich was to drive metal plates like pistons together over the wellhead \nto cut off the flow of oil as it was gushing upwards from the pressure \nbeneath. That activation mechanism did not work.\n  The second safety mechanism was one called a dead-man switch; that \nis, whenever power was interrupted, automatically the second safety \nmechanism was to activate, driving those metal plates together to shut \noff the flow of oil. That did not work, as well.\n  The third safety mechanism was to use robotic submersibles that are \nquite sophisticated, that have manipulator capability even at that \ndepth, the depth of a mile, to go in and physically get hold of a \nhandle, an actuating device that would literally pump a hydraulic pump \nto drive the plates together to shut off the well. That third safety \ndevice did not work either.\n  This safety device, referred to as a blowout preventer, was designed \nand built by a company that was contracted to BP, British Petroleum, \ncalled Transocean. We now know from the Times of London, in a published \narticle over the weekend, that as far back as 10 years ago, in the year \n2000, British Petroleum had been concerned with the safety devices \nworking and had asked Transocean, which built the devices, about this. \nI asked the CEO yesterday, the CEO of British Petroleum, what occurred \n10 years ago. You were put on notice there was a safety mechanism that \nmaybe was not working. He said that was raised and they worked it out.\n  Apparently, 10 years later, these safety devices did not function--so \nthat they worked it out.\n  As you know, what is happening, the initial results provided by BP \nare that it was 1,000 barrels of oil a day. The Coast Guard has \nestimated that it is now five times that much and we are waiting for \nupdates. So what is gushing from the ocean floor below is 5,000 barrels \nof oil a day. That is in excess of 220,000 gallons of oil a day that \nare coming into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. It has created this \nslick that is now, because of the southeasterly winds, to start \nencountering the Barrier Islands off the southeast coast of Louisiana.\n  Lord knows where this is going to go. So what do they do now? Right \nnow, they are constructing a fancy dome. This is a multistory \nstructure, probably 10 times my height, that has worked in other \nblowouts but only at depths of 300 and 400 feet.\n  They have to try to place this dome 5,000 feet deep, over the \nwellhead, to see if they can then collect that escaping oil into this \ndome and then run it up a pipe to a transport and collect the oil \nthere.\n  But, by the way, we do not know that it is going to work at 5,000 \nfeet because of the pressure. We do not know if they can actually \nlocate it 5,000 feet over the wellhead. What comes up if they do--and \ncollect it--is not just oil, but there would be a rush of oil, then \nthere would be a rush of natural gas, there would be a rush of \nseawater, and all along having sand corroding the inside of that pipe \nlike sandpaper as it rushes up the pipe 5,000 feet to the surface \ntanker.\n  Let's hope it works. Because if it does not, then we have to wait 3 \nmonths for the rescue well that is presently being dug from the side, \nto go down 13,000 feet to the pocket of oil, to start sucking the oil \nout through the rescue well, thereby relieving the pressure up through \nthe defective well that exploded. They will have to, in fact, drill not \none but two rescue wells from the side.\n\n[[Page S3135]]\n\n  But the estimates are that will take 90 days. If this dome does not \nwork, which they are to insert in the ocean in the next few days, then \nwe are looking at the possibility of that oil continuing to gush for 3 \nmonths. You can see after 2 weeks how much of an oil slick there is out \nthere.\n  You can imagine, if you go on for another 13 weeks, how that could \nstart to cover the Gulf of Mexico and much worse as the prevailing \nwinds from the south would carry it onto some of the world's most \nbeautiful beaches, those along the northwest coast and the gulf coast \nof Florida.\n  But, oh, by the way, there is another threat now. That is something \nMother Nature has designed, known as the Loop Current. The Loop Current \nis a current of water that comes up the western side of Cuba, in \nbetween Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, up into the northern \nGulf of Mexico, loops and comes to the south, off the southwest coast \nof Florida, loops down around the Florida Keys and turns northeast and \nnorthward, hugs the Florida Keys, becomes the Gulf Stream, which hugs \nthe Keys. Those delicate coral reefs, 85 percent of North America's \ncoral reefs are in the Keys. And then it hugs the shore of Florida \nalong the southeast coast all the way up to central Florida, to Fort \nPierce, where it then leaves the coast of Florida, goes across the \nAtlantic Ocean and ends up over close to Scotland. That is the Gulf \nStream. That was the stream that 500 years ago used to carry the \nSpanish Galleons, along with the wind, back from their discoveries of \nthe New World as they went back to Europe.\n  You can imagine, if the spill gets so big in the Gulf of Mexico that \nthen it encounters the Loop Current and that spill then starts carrying \nthat oil down the southwest coast of Florida, around the Florida Keys, \nhugging the Florida Keys and the coral reefs and up the east coast of \nFlorida, we are looking at potential major economic and environmental \nloss.\n  So the question is: What do we do? Well, first of all, I have not \nonly requested but, in my kind of mild way, have strongly suggested \nthat we stop all exploratory drilling, at least until the investigation \nthat many of us in this Chamber have asked for, until that \ninvestigation is over, as to what went wrong and what we can do to \nprevent it in the future.\n  Oh, by the way, that is not going to be a few weeks' investigation. \nBy the time you get through with all this, it is going to be months. So \nwe should not be doing any more exploration with the possibility of \nmore explosions such as this. I did not say production wells; they need \nto keep producing.\n  This risk, this blowout, was in an exploratory rig. That ought to be \nstopped. I asked the CEO of BP yesterday: Have you stopped exploratory \ndrilling?\n  He says: Yes.\n  I said: Where?\n  He said: In the Gulf of Mexico.\n  I said: How about worldwide?\n  He said: No; only in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Well, what should the President do, other than what he is doing; that \nis--and I give credit where certainly credit is due--the operation \nbeing taken over by the top four-star Admiral of the Coast Guard, since \nthey have the lead. I have talked to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs; \nthe U.S. Navy is fully supporting the lead, which is the Coast Guard; \nall the agencies of Government; NOAA, Dr. Lubchenco; the Department of \nInterior, our former colleague from the Senate, Secretary Ken Salazar. \nI mean, you can go on down the list. They are all pouring in to try to \nhelp because we have a disaster of monumental proportions that is in \nthe making and ruining peoples' lives, their livelihoods, their \nincomes, their way of life, their culture. We are talking about all of \nthe above.\n  So I strongly suggest to the President that he ought to abandon his \n5-year plan that was for offshore drilling in the Outer Continental \nShelf, but which he proposed, at least in the Continental United \nStates, he proposed it only in the Gulf of Mexico and off the mid-\nAtlantic coast. I suggest he withdraw that. If he does not, I believe \nit is dead on arrival.\n  Where do we go from here in the future? Potentially, we are looking \nat extraordinary financial loss. So I asked the chairman and CEO of \nBritish Petroleum yesterday afternoon, I said: You realize the existing \nlaw on liability says you handle the cleanup costs but that the \nexisting law has a cap on your liability after $75 million. Do you \nagree that the economic loss is going to exceed $75 million?\n  He said: Yes.\n  I said to him: You have been saying on TV that you think British \nPetroleum will be the responsible party and take care of this. When it \nexceeds $75 million, are you going to accept all that liability?\n  He said: We will work that out.\n  I said: Well, if I understand that, as far back as 2000, your company \nhad a problem with Transocean and their safety devices and the blowout \npreventer. Are you not going to have some considered lawsuit against \nTransocean for a defective piece of equipment?\n  He said: We are going to work that out.\n  So I suspect what we are going to see is some of the most enormous \nand complicated lawsuits you have ever seen, with a lot of finger-\npointing that is going to be going around many different circles, and \nthe question of liability for all those people who are going to be \nlosing their jobs and their livelihood and their cultures if this \ngusher, this underwater volcano, is not cut off. I suspect what we are \ngoing to see is an attempt to avoid that economic liability. Therefore, \nthat is why Senator Menendez and Senator Lautenberg and I filed, Monday \nnight, a bill that will lift that liability cap from a meager $75 \nmillion to $10 billion, because you can see that $10 billion economic \nloss is not an unrealistic figure and is what could happen if this oil \ncontinues to gush for another 3 months.\n  Well, let me complicate things a little bit. Because if the gusher \ncontinues for 3 months, you know what starts on June 1? Hurricane \nseason. Do you know it has been historically a fact that several \nhurricanes brew in the month of June in the Gulf of Mexico? So can you \nimagine a big part of the Gulf of Mexico being polluted with oil and \nsuddenly having that all stirred up with the complications of a \nhurricane.\n  This is not a pretty picture. It is a major environmental and \neconomic disaster of the most gargantuan proportions that we can ever \nimagine.\n  For my final comments, let me say, I have, this Senator, often been \nderided, derided for standing for the economic and environmental \ninterests of my State, my State of Florida, which has more coastline \nthan any other State, save for Alaska, and certainly has more beaches \nthan any other State, for trying to protect those interests as well as \nthe interests of the U.S. military, since most of the Gulf of Mexico \noff Florida is the largest testing and training area for the U.S. \nmilitary in the world.\n  From two successive Department of Defense Secretaries, Rumsfeld and \nthen Gates, I have in writing that the policy of the Defense Department \nis in place that oil activities and oil structures are incompatible \nwith the testing and training necessities of the Department of Defense \nin preparation for our national security interests. This Senator will \ncontinue to protect all of those interests.\n\n  It is my hope people will understand that the tradeoffs of drilling \nclose to Florida are simply not worth the risk. Why is that? Because of \nthe statistics of the Department of the Interior concerning \nundiscovered oil in the Gulf of Mexico. Ninety percent of that oil is \nnot off of Florida; it is in the central and western gulf. From the \nstatistics of the Department of the Interior, only 10 percent of that \nundiscovered oil is off Florida. Is it worth the risk for that de \nminimis oil to have future potential economic and environmental \ndisasters? Clearly, the answer from this Senator is as it has been for \nover 30 years that I have been waging this battle, first as a young \ncongressman and now in the position of representing all of Florida: The \ntradeoff risk is not worth it.\n  I wanted to bring this to the attention of the Senate. Unfortunately, \nthis story is a continuing one because although this story began over \nthree decades ago, it is still a drama that continues to unfold with \ntragic consequences.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, as soon as I possibly can, I intend to \nbring\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\nup an amendment which calls for transparency at the Fed. I must tell my \ncolleagues that this amendment is one of the more unusual amendments \nthat has been brought up in the Senate, I suspect for many years, \nbecause of the rather strange coalition that has come together around \nit. How often do we have the AFL-CIO, a progressive organization, and \nFreedom Works, a very conservative organization, supporting the same \neffort? How often are the SEIU, the largest union in America; \nmoveon.org, 5 million members as a progressive organization; and Public \nCitizen, another progressive organization, striving for the same goal \nas the National Taxpayers Union or the Eagle Forum or Americans for Tax \nReform, very conservative organizations? How often do we have some of \nthe most progressive Members in Congress--and I include myself within \nthat fold--working with some of the more conservative Members? It \ndoesn't happen every day, but that is what is happening on this \namendment.\n  I rise to talk about the amendment, what it does, and why so many \ndiverse groups, representing tens of millions of Americans, are coming \ntogether in support of it. I also wish to suggest what it does not do \nand some of the ways it has been distorted by the Fed and other groups \nthat are opposed. I have seen some of the statements made by the Fed \nwhich are absolutely untrue in terms of what this amendment does and \ndoes not do.\n  For me, the origin of this amendment came on March 3, 2009, when, as \na member of the Budget Committee, I asked the Chairman of the Fed, Ben \nBernanke, a very simple question. I asked him if he would tell me, the \ncommittee, and the American people which financial institutions \nreceived over $2 trillion in zero interest or near zero interest loans \nduring the start of the economic crisis. During the bailout period, \nsome $2 trillion of taxpayer money was lent. My question was: Mr. \nChairman, who received that money? I don't think that is an unfair \nquestion. We have heard great debates here on the Senate floor about $5 \nmillion or $10 million. To ask who received over $2 trillion in zero or \nnear zero interest loans is something I believe should be answered by \nthe Fed, and they should make that information public. But Bernanke \nsaid no. He gave his reasons.\n  On that very day, I introduced legislation that would require the Fed \nto put this information on its Web site, make it public, just as \nCongress required the Treasury Department to do with respect to the \n$700 billion TARP money. Some may like TARP; some may not. Some may \nhave voted for it; some may not have. But the information about who \nreceived the money, when it was paid back, et cetera, is right there on \nthe Web site of the Treasury Department.\n  This $2 trillion in zero or near zero interest loans does not belong \nto the Fed. It belongs to the American people, and the American people \nhave a right to know where trillions of their taxpayer dollars are \ngoing. It is not complicated. One doesn't need an MBA from Wharton to \nknow that. That is why millions of Americans, whether conservative or \nprogressive or in between, have come together to say we need \ntransparency at the Fed.\n  This amendment not only requires that the Fed tell us who has \nreceived the $2 trillion it lent out, but, similar to the language \nincorporated in the House bill, it calls for an audit of the Fed by the \nGAO. As we all know, the GAO is the nonpartisan Government \nAccountability Office that does a great job in trying to figure out \nwhere there is waste and fraud within the government. That is it. This \nis a very simple, short amendment. It is five pages. It calls for \ntransparency at the Fed and a straightforward audit. Who got what? When \ndid they get it? On what basis and on what terms? Who was at the \nmeetings? Who made the decisions and were there conflicts of interest? \nSimple, factual questions the American people deserve answers to. That \nis what it is; it is not complicated.\n  I understand this amendment will not be supported by everyone. Some \nmay suggest, inaccurately--and I have heard these statements--that this \namendment ``takes away the independence of the Federal Reserve and puts \nmonetary policy into the hands of Congress.'' Let me address those \nconcerns by simply reading exactly what is in the amendment. It is not \ncomplicated. I quote from page 4 of the amendment. This is what it \nsays. I don't think I can be more straightforward than this:\n\n       Nothing in this amendment shall be construed as \n     interference in or dictation of monetary policy by the \n     Federal Reserve system, by the Congress, or the Government \n     Accountability Office.\n\n  It can't be more simple. It can't be more straightforward than the \nlanguage in this amendment. So when people tell us this amendment is \ngoing to interfere and have Congress dictate monetary policy, it is \nsimply not true. In other words, this amendment does not take away the \n``independence of the Fed'' and it does not put monetary policy into \nthe hands of Congress. This amendment does not tell the Fed when to cut \nshort-term interest rates or when to raise them. It does not tell the \nFed what banks to lend money to and what banks not to lend money to. It \ndoes not tell the Fed which foreign central banks it can do business \nwith and which ones it cannot. It does not impose any new regulations \non the Fed, nor does it take any regulatory authority away from the \nFed. It does none of those things, no matter what anybody coming to the \nfloor may say.\n  What the opponents of this amendment are doing is equating \nindependence, which we support, with secrecy, which I do not support. \nAt a time when our entire financial system almost collapsed, we cannot \nlet the Fed continue to operate in the kind of secrecy they have \noperated in for years. The American people have a right to know.\n  Very often, we see Senators coming down here to the floor to make the \npoint that working people have to play by the rules. How often have we \nheard that rhetoric? What are the rules governing the Fed? Who makes \nthose rules or do they just make them up as they go along?\n  Let me list a few of the questions millions of Americans and Members \nof Congress are asking that a GAO audit might help to answer. I am sure \nthere are many more.\n  Question: Why was Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, invited \nto the New York Federal Reserve to meet with Federal officials in \nSeptember of 2008 to determine whether AIG would be bailed out or \nallowed to go bankrupt? I wasn't invited to that meeting. Other \nSenators were not invited to that meeting. Lloyd Blankfein was invited \nto that meeting.\n  When the Fed and Treasury decided to bail out AIG to the tune of $182 \nbillion, why did the Fed refuse to tell the American people where that \nmoney was going? Why did the Fed argue that this information needed to \nbe kept secret ``as a matter of national security''?\n  When AIG finally released the names of the counterparties receiving \nthis assistance, how did it happen that Goldman Sachs received $13 \nbillion of this money, 100 cents on the dollar on what AIG owed them? \nHow did that happen? I don't know. We don't know. The American people \ndon't know. But I think we have a right to know.\n  Did Goldman Sachs use this money to provide $16 billion in bonuses to \nits top executives the next year? All over this country, Americans have \nlost their jobs. They have lost their homes. They have lost their \nsavings. They have lost their ability to send their kids to college \nbecause of this recession caused by Wall Street. Yet Goldman Sachs gets \n$13 billion--100 cents on the dollar--after AIG is bailed out at a \nmeeting in which Lloyd Blankfein is in attendance.\n  I think it is an interesting question. I don't know the answer, but I \nthink the American people have a right to know. A GAO audit of the Fed \nmight help explain to the American people if there were any conflicts \nof interest surrounding that deal. Who got what? On what basis? On what \nterms? Who was at the meetings? Who made the decisions? And were there \nconflicts of interests?\n\n  In 2008, it seems to me--I did not go to Harvard Business School, but \nit does seem to me--there was an apparent conflict of interest at the \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York when Stephen Friedman, the head of the \nNew York Fed--who also served on the board of directors of Goldman \nSachs--let me repeat that: He was the head of the New York Fed; he also \nserved on the board of directors of Goldman Sachs--and the New York Fed \napproved Goldman's application to become a bank holding\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\ncompany, giving it access to cheap loans from the Federal Reserve.\n  Let me quote from an article published in the Wall Street Journal on \nMay 9, 2009, and let the American people determine whether this \ndeserves a GAO audit. Quoting the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Goldman Sachs received speedy approval to become a bank \n     holding company in September of 2008. . . . During that time, \n     the New York Fed's chairman, Stephen Friedman, sat on \n     Goldman's board and had a large holding in Goldman stock, \n     which because of Goldman's new status as a bank holding \n     company was a violation of Federal Reserve policy. The New \n     York Fed asked for a waiver, which after about 2\\1/2\\ months, \n     the Fed granted. While it was weighing the request, Mr. \n     Friedman bought 37,300 more Goldman shares in December. They \n     have since risen $1.7 million in value. Mr. Friedman, who \n     once ran Goldman, says none of these events involved any \n     conflicts.\n\n  That was from the Wall Street Journal of May 9, 2009.\n  Well, maybe Mr. Friedman is right. Maybe there is not a conflict of \ninterest. It seems to me there is a very apparent conflict of interest, \nbut that is an issue that maybe a GAO audit might want to look at.\n  As a result of the bailout of Bear Stearns and AIG, the Fed now \nowns--this is pretty amazing--now owns credit default swaps betting \nthat California, Nevada, and Florida will default on their debt. Let me \nrepeat that. Senators from California and Nevada and Florida might be \ninterested in this. As a result of the bailout of Bear Stearns and AIG, \nthe Fed now owns credit default swaps betting that California, Nevada, \nand Florida will default on their debt.\n  So the Federal Reserve stands to make money if California, Nevada, \nand Florida go bankrupt. What can I tell you? This is the reality. I \nknow it will seem strange to the American people that the Fed makes \nmoney and is betting that three of our great States go bankrupt. This \nmay make sense to the Fed. It may make sense to some of my colleagues \nin the Senate. It does not make sense to me. Frankly, I do not believe \nit makes sense to the American people. But this is what an audit of the \nFed will allow us to better understand: whether we want the Fed to be \nbetting against some of our great States, that they will go bankrupt.\n  It has been reported that the Federal Reserve pressured Bank of \nAmerica into acquiring Merrill Lynch--making this financial institution \neven bigger and riskier--allegedly threatening to fire its CEO if Bank \nof America backed out of this merger. When the merger went through, \nMerrill Lynch's employees received $3.7 billion in bonuses. Was this a \ngood deal or a bad deal for the American taxpayer? Perhaps a GAO audit \ncan help us find out.\n  When the Fed provided a $29 billion loan to JPMorgan Chase to acquire \nBear Stearns, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Diamond, served on the \nboard of directors at the New York Federal Reserve. Let me repeat that. \nWhen the Fed provided a $29 billion loan to JPMorgan Chase to acquire \nBear Stearns, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Diamond, served on the \nboard of directors at the New York Federal Reserve.\n  Did this represent a conflict of interest? To my mind, it does. Maybe \nI am wrong. But that is what a GAO audit can help explain to the \nAmerican people.\n  Again, I know we are going to have Senators running down here saying: \nOh, we are trying to break the independence of the Fed.\n  We are not trying to do that. What we are trying to do is allow the \nAmerican people to get a glimpse and an understanding of some of the \nactions of the Fed involving huge sums of money.\n  Currently, some 35 members of the Federal Reserve's board of \ndirectors are executives at private financial institutions which have \nreceived nearly $120 billion in TARP funds, but we do not know how much \nthese big banks received from the Fed. A GAO audit could answer that \nquestion.\n  Here is a very interesting point I know a lot of Senators have raised \nin different context: If the goal of the huge amounts of money in Fed \nloans--trillions of dollars in Fed loans--to large financial \ninstitutions was to achieve the goal of getting credit flowing to \nsmall- and medium-sized businesses that were cash starved--they were \ncrying out for credit--why is small business lending in freefall? What \nhappened? We gave the large financial institutions trillions of \ndollars, presumably to get it out to the small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses. They have not gotten it. Question--I think it is a \nreasonable question, and I am not the only one who is asking it--how \nmuch of those zero interest or near zero interest loans that these huge \nfinancial institutions received from the Fed were simply invested in \nFederal Government bonds, earning an interest rate of 3 or 4 percent?\n  In other words, are we looking at a huge scam? I cannot think of a \nbetter word. You give these large financial institutions trillions of \ndollars in zero interest loans in order to enable them to provide \ndesperately needed loans to small- and medium-sized businesses, so \nthose businesses can expand and create jobs. Yet that appears not to be \nhappening.\n  Question: How much of those--those several trillion dollars in \nloans--simply went from the Fed to the financial institutions in order \nto purchase government-backed obligations at 3 or 4 percent? If that is \nthe case, that is just giving away money. You have zero interest coming \nin; you get 3 or 4 percent guaranteed by the faith and credit of the \nUnited States of America.\n  Well, do you know what. I do not know. I do not know how much. I \nsuspect, other people suspect, that was done. How much, I do not know. \nMaybe the GAO can tell us.\n  This amendment is virtually identical to legislation I have \nintroduced on this subject that has 33 cosponsors. Just as we have a \nvery broad spectrum of political ideology from grassroots organizations \non the left and the right--conservative, progressive; Democrat, \nRepublican--supporting this amendment, so we have had widespread--\nacross ideology--support for this legislation.\n  Let me mention who the 33 cosponsors are. You will see how people \nwith very different political ideologies have come together. The names \nof those people are: Senators Barrasso, Bennett, Boxer, Brownback, \nBurr, Cardin, Chambliss, Coburn, Cochran, Cornyn, Crapo, DeMint, \nDorgan, Feingold, Graham, Grassley, Harkin, Hatch, Hutchison, Inhofe, \nIsakson, Landrieu, Leahy, Lincoln, McCain, Murkowski, Risch, Sanders, \nThune, Vitter, Webb, Wicker, and Wyden. Those are the people who have \nsupported the legislation.\n  This amendment coming to the floor has 20 cosponsors--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--and I want to thank all of those Senators for their \nsupport.\n  In terms of progressive grassroots organizations, this amendment \nenjoys the strong support of the AFL-CIO; the SEIU, the largest union \nin America; the United Steelworkers of America; Public Citizen; the New \nAmerica Foundation; the Center for Economic Policy and Research; the \nRoosevelt Institute; the U.S. Public Interest Research Group; and \nAmericans for Financial Reform, which in itself is a coalition of over \n250 consumer, employee, investor, community, and civil rights groups.\n  Let me read you a letter of support I received for this amendment \nfrom Bill Samuel, the legislative director of the AFL-CIO. This what \nthe AFL-CIO said:\n\n       On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I am writing to urge you to \n     support--\n\n  This is a letter going out to other Senators--\n\n     the Sanders, Feingold, DeMint, Leahy, McCain, Grassley, \n     Vitter, Brownback amendment to increase transparency at \n     the Federal Reserve. . . . Working people want to know who \n     benefitted from the liquidity provided by taxpayers during \n     the crisis and this amendment will ensure that we receive \n     this information.\n\n  Let me also quote from a letter I received from Andy Stern, the \npresident of the SEIU, the largest union in the country; and also from \nLeo Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers of America; and a \nnumber of other academics and economists. This is what they write:\n\n       Since the start of the financial crisis, the Federal \n     Reserve has dramatically changed its operating procedures. \n     Instead of simply setting interest rates to influence \n     macroeconomic conditions, it rapidly acquired a wide variety \n     of private assets and extended massive secret bailouts to \n     major financial institutions. There are still many questions \n     about the Fed's behavior in these new activities. The Federal \n     Reserve balance sheet expanded to more than $2 trillion, \n     along with implied and explicit backstops to Wall Street \n     firms that could cost even more. Who\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\n     received the money? Against what collateral? On what terms \n     and conditions? The only way to find out is through a \n     complete audit of the Federal Reserve. That's why we support \n     the Sanders, Feingold, DeMint, Leahy, McCain, Grassley, \n     Vitter, Brownback amendment to increase transparency at the \n     Fed.\n\n  That is what leading progressive economic and social justice \norganizations are saying about this amendment.\n  Let me briefly, if I might, quote from some of the conservative \norganizations. One of the larger ones is the National Taxpayers Union. \nI do not usually quote from the National Taxpayers Union. I think I am \nnot rated very highly on their chart. But this is what they say in \nsupport of this amendment:\n\n       The National Taxpayers Union urges all Senators to vote \n     ``YES'' on S. AMDT 3738 to the financial regulatory reform \n     legislation. This amendment, introduced by Senators Sanders \n     and DeMint, would require the Government Accountability \n     Office to conduct an audit of the Federal Reserve. . . . \n     Transparency is not a Democrat or Republican issue, but \n     rather an issue of right or wrong. If the Senate insists on \n     further expanding the Fed's reach, Americans deserve to know \n     more about the workings of a government-sanctioned entity \n     whose decisions directly affect their economic livelihood. A \n     ``YES'' vote on S. AMDT 3738 will be significantly weighted \n     as a pro-taxpayer vote in our annual Rating of Congress.\n\n  We also have support from other conservative organizations, including \nAmericans for Tax Reform, the Campaign for Liberty, the Rutherford \nInstitute, the Eagle Forum, FreedomWorks, and the Center for Fiscal \nAccountability. In a letter of support I received from them they write:\n\n       We urge you to vote for Senators Sanders, Feingold, DeMint, \n     and Vitter's Federal Reserve Transparency Amendment . . . \n     This amendment does not take away the ``independence'' of the \n     Fed. It simply requires the GAO to conduct an independent \n     audit of the Fed and requires the Fed to release the names of \n     the recipients of more than $2 trillion in taxpayer-backed \n     assistance during this latest economic crisis. Any true \n     financial reform effort will start with requiring \n     accountability from our nation's central bank.\n\n  Let me conclude by saying this amendment is not a radical idea. I \nhave just indicated to you that we have progressive groups, \nrepresenting millions of people, and we have conservative groups, \nrepresenting millions of people. We have the AARP, the largest senior \ngroup, representing, I think, tens of million of Americans.\n  I should also mention to you that as part of the budget resolution \ndebate in April of 2009, the Senate voted overwhelmingly in support of \nthis basic concept, by a vote of 59 to 39.\n  In the House of Representatives, this concept passed the House \nFinancial Services Committee by a vote of 43 to 26 and was incorporated \ninto the House version of Wall Street reform that was approved by the \nHouse last December.\n  In other words, a lot of what I am talking about is in the House \nbill--not a radical concept. This idea has the support of the Speaker \nof the House, Nancy Pelosi, who said Congress should ask the Fed to put \nthis information ``on the Internet like they've done with the recovery \npackage and the budget.'' That is what this amendment does.\n  This concept has also been supported--and this is important. I know \nmy friend from Texas wants to speak. I am winding down and I apologize \nfor going on this long. But it is important to point out that this \nconcept has also been supported by two Federal courts that have ordered \nthe Fed to release all of the names and details of the recipients of \nmore than $2 trillion in Federal Reserve loans since the financial \ncrisis started as a result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit \nfiled by Bloomberg News.\n  The Fed has argued in court that it should not have to release this \ninformation citing, according to Reuters: ``an exemption that it said \nlets federal agencies keep secret various trade secrets and commercial \nor financial information.'' That is what the U.S. Appeals Court in New \nYork said in disagreeing with the Fed. It was a unanimous three-judge \nappeals court. This is what they wrote in their opinion:\n\n     to give the [Fed] power to deny disclosure because it thinks \n     it best to do so would undermine the basic policy that \n     disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective. If the \n     board believes such an exemption would better serve the \n     national interests, it should ask Congress to amend the \n     statute.\n\n  Let me conclude by saying this: We now have 59 Senators having voted \nfor this transparency, 320 Members of the House, and 2 U.S. courts. All \nwe want to know is who got trillions of dollars. That is what we want \nto know. We also want to know on what basis, on what terms, and who was \nat the meetings where key decisions were made.\n  This is an important amendment, and it is an amendment that millions \nof people want to see pass. I hope we will have an opportunity to offer \nit as soon as possible, and I hope it is passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate hearing the Senator from \nVermont describe his amendment. I haven't seen the text of the \namendment, but I am a cosponsor of the bill that would do exactly what \nhe says. I think transparency at the Fed is something we can agree on. \nSo I look forward to seeing the rest of the amendment, and if it is \njust that, I will be very pleased to work with him for passage.\n  I rise to speak today on the Hutchison-Klobuchar amendment. My \ncolleague, Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota, is also on the floor. We \nwish to take a moment to talk about our amendment, which will assure \nthat community banks have a more level playing field than could be the \ncase if the bill that is before us, the Dodd bill, passes without our \namendment.\n  Our debate to reform our financial regulatory structure should focus \nfirst and foremost on filling the gaps in regulation that led to our \nfinancial crisis. I am encouraged by the good-faith efforts of Senators \nDodd and Shelby to end too big to fail, and I certainly hope we will \nsee language on that so it is put aside, because I think that is the \nmost important area of this bill. We must end too big to fail. When \nSenator Dodd and Senator Shelby produce the language they have agreed \non, I think that will open the rest of this bill for amendments such as \nthe Hutchison-Klobuchar amendment we are discussing now that I think \nshould be part of overall reform.\n  We have to look at other areas of concern besides too big to fail \nsuch as the lax underwriting standards and the lack of transparency \nover our derivatives markets. Those are amendments that will also be \ncoming to the floor to assure we address those key issues in financial \nreform. One area on which we can find agreement is that our Nation's \ncommunity banks were not a cause of the financial collapse we have seen \nin the last 18 months. They didn't have risky loans and financing \nschemes that sent our economy into a downward spiral. Financial reform \nshould not punish the financial institutions such as community banks \nfor faults they did not commit. If anything, financial reform should \nreflect what we learned from the safe and sound practices that are used \nby community banks.\n  We should learn from the example of Texas First Bank, Galveston \nCounty's largest locally owned family of community banks. On September \n13, 2008, Hurricane Ike made landfall over Galveston, TX, packing \nstrong winds and a high storm surge that ravaged much of Texas's gulf \ncoast. Two days later, on Monday, September 15, 2008, Texas First Bank \nwas open for business and many of its locations provided ``Hurricane \nIke Relief Loans'' and other services to area families and small \nbusinesses reeling from Ike's damage.\n  Senator Mary Landrieu and I visited Galveston several weeks later. I \nwas there a day or so after the surge that came over Galveston in a \nhelicopter, but I couldn't get on the ground at that point. So we came \nseveral weeks later, Senator Landrieu and I, because we wanted to look \nat the recovery, because Senator Landrieu of course has had so much \nexperience with Hurricane Katrina. We wanted to do everything we could \nto get help to people. We had a press event at a small neighborhood \nrestaurant. The community banker from Hometown Bank was there and was \napplauded by the owner of the little Italian restaurant. He said: The \nbanker was in there helping us clean up the restaurant and made sure \nthat we had the liquidity to open our doors, because there was no food \nto be had on Galveston Island at that time. They wanted to serve their \ncustomers, and their community banker was right there with them.\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\n  President Obama himself has said that community banks are intimately \nwoven into the fabric of the community. Banks such as Texas First Bank \nand Hometown Bank in Galveston County are examples of this.\n  In uncertain financial times, community banks worked hard to steady \nthe financial hands at the wheel. Community banks provide depository \nand lending services critical to America's families and small \nbusinesses. Despite holding just 23 percent of the banking assets in \nour Nation, they make two-thirds of the loans to small businesses. \nSmall businesses must have support from community banks to invest, to \nexpand, and to create jobs.\n  Despite the widespread recognition of the importance of community \nbanks, the current bill imposes on them a regulatory structure that \npunishes them. I am particularly concerned about a provision in the \ncurrent bill under which the Federal Reserve will only retain \nsupervisory authority over bank holding companies that have over $50 \nbillion in assets. Republicans and Democrats agree that we don't want \ntoo big to fail anymore because too big to fail means taxpayer \nbailouts. So what does a bill say that says large banks over $50 \nbillion will have the implicit backing of the government? It means they \nwill be too big to fail. Creditors expecting to be made whole through \nthis backing will offer cheaper credit to the large banks, putting \ncommunity banks at a competitive disadvantage through no fault of their \nown. That is the first reason we need to pass the Hutchison-Klobuchar \namendment.\n  The second reason is that this provision arbitrarily shifts many \ncommunity banks out of their current prudential regulator: the Federal \nReserve. The Federal Reserve supervises more than 6,500 banks of all \nsizes in all parts of the country. These banks include large bank \nholding companies such as Bank of America, Chase, and J.P. Morgan. The \nFed also supervises smaller community banks: Citizens National Bank of \nNacogdoches my bank--in addition to Texas First Bank in Galveston \nCounty, First State Bank of Mineral Wells, and 32 other State-chartered \nbanks that are members of the Federal Reserve in Dallas.\n  I have heard from the president of the Federal Reserve Bank in \nDallas, Richard Fisher, as well as the presidents of Federal Reserve \nBanks of Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and Richmond, all of \nwhom are in town today and all agree stripping the Fed of its \nsupervisory authority will drastically reduce the Fed's ability to \nachieve its objective of maintaining sound monetary policy for our \ncountry. Under the Federal Reserve Act, the Fed is mandated to \neffectively promote goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and \nmoderate long-term interest rates. Implicit to this mandate is a goal \nof fostering stable, long-term economic growth, which requires \nstability in the banking and financial system.\n  For the Fed to have proper insight into the banking system, it must \nmaintain supervision over a wide breadth of banks located across the \ncountry. In curtailing the scope of the Federal Reserve's supervisory \nauthority, Senator Dodd's bill does the opposite. The Fed will lose its \n845 State member banks which are so vital in providing a good sense of \nunderlying economic forces in their respective localities. This will \nleave the Fed to cull information about the state of our economy from--\nwhere? From the banks with $50 billion and above in assets, meaning \nmonetary policy going forward will be a reflection of our largest \nfinancial institutions.\n  Well, monetary policy cannot and should not be geared toward the New \nYork banks and the Washington policymakers. The Federal Reserve needs \ninsight into the health of our banking system and economy as a whole. \nThat is why we have regional Fed banks. It is important that they have \nthe supervisory authority of banks of all sizes and in all parts of our \nNation.\n  I wish to ask my colleague Senator Klobuchar--who has stepped up to \nthe plate to be a cosponsor of this amendment so we have bipartisan \nsponsors--to say a word. I wish to yield to the Senator from Minnesota \nfor a few minutes to have the Minnesota perspective and to make sure \nthe people know that the community banks of this country should not \nspeak in a whisper to the ``on high'' in Washington and New York. No. \nThey should be speaking in a loud voice to all of us through their \nFederal Reserve banks, which means the Hutchison-Klobuchar amendment \nshould pass.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I say thank you so much to my friend from Texas. I \nwish to thank her for her leadership on this issue.\n  As she mentioned, our amendment seeks simply to preserve the Federal \nReserve's authority to supervise community banks and bank holding \ncompanies as well as to preserve a system that ensures the institution \ncharged with our Nation's monetary policy has a connection to not just \nWall Street but to Main Street.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, for the most part, our mid-sized \nbanks, small banks in the States throughout this country--Texas and the \nMidwest--stayed out of these risky deals. They stayed away from these \nhigh-flying, way too risky deals of the past decade. They made meat-\nand-potatoes loans to consumers and businesses in their communities. \nThey did well for their customers.\n  These Main Street banks did not dance down the yellow brick road to \nWall Street dealmaking or Washington hobnobbing. When the pavement on \nWall Street began to buckle and collapse, these community banks did not \npanic and run to Washington with tin cups in outstretched hands. They \ncontinued to conduct their business, behaving the way--well, the way \nbanks are supposed to behave.\n  The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, along with 11 other regional \nbanks, provides a presence across this country that gives the Fed \ngrassroots connections, insights into the local economies, as well as \nlegitimacy when they have to make tough decisions that affect not just \nWall Street but the small local banks that serve so many of our \ncommunities. Through their working relationships with community banks, \nthe regional Federal Reserve banks also collect and analyze important \ninformation about the movements and trends in local economies. This \nrelationship is a two-way street as it also provides a voice for \ncommunity banks that would be lost if the Federal Reserve were to only \nsupervise the largest banks.\n  As the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis noted, it \nwould be shortsighted to conclude that the Federal Reserve: ``can \nsafely be stripped of its role as a supervisor of all banks.''\n  As he noted, disruptions in the financial system can come from all \nsectors, and the connection the regional Federal Reserve banks provide \nto local economies can be vital in ensuring the stability of the entire \nfinancial system.\n  I say to my friend from Texas, just this morning Noah Wilcox, \npresident of the Grand Rapids State Bank in Grand Rapids, MN--a part of \nthe country most hurt by this economic downturn caused by Wall Street--\nwrote to me and said this:\n\n       All Senators should be reminded that the Federal Reserve \n     System was created to serve all of America, not just Wall \n     Street.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for her leadership, and I look forward \nto working with her on this amendment. I was glad that Senator Murray \njoined us on our amendment, and we have a number of other cosponsors. \nAgain, I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I \nappreciate the bipartisan nature of the amendment. I think when people \nlook at this amendment on both sides of the aisle, it will be clear \nthat the community banks need this amendment to keep a level playing \nfield and to assure that there is no concept left in this country of \ntoo big to fail. I thank my colleague from Minnesota, Senator \nKlobuchar, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, as drafted, the bill we are considering \nthis week allows for bailouts. As a result, what my friends on the \nother side like to call Wall Street reform is actually a Wall Street \ndream and a Main Street nightmare for all of us.\n  Over the last several weeks, I have clearly articulated what needs to \nbe changed in the underlying bill because\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\nwe must do everything we can to create a credible resolution regime \nthat protects not only our financial system but, more importantly, the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Fortunately, the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Chris \nDodd, and I have worked through a number of issues and resolved to my \nsatisfaction the concerns that some of us have expressed about \ngovernment bailouts.\n  I believe it is simply unacceptable to expose innocent taxpaying \nAmerican families to the excessively risky practices of Wall Street \ngamblers who are happy to enjoy the upside but want to socialize the \ndownside.\n  Mr. President, taxpayers should not incur losses from the bad outcome \nof private risks they did not undertake. In order to achieve this, the \nDodd-Shelby amendment that we will offer eliminates the $50 billion \nbailout fund--some people have called it the ``honey pot.'' It would \nsignificantly tighten up language in the bill dealing with the Federal \nReserve's ability to provide liquidity to the financial system in times \nof severe market distress. It requires the approval of the Treasury \nSecretary before the Federal Reserve can undertake any emergency \nlending. It also establishes strict solvency and collateral \nrequirements for any emergency Fed lending. It establishes strict \naccountability standards for any emergency Federal lending.\n  All of this is something we didn't have 18 months ago when the \nfinancial crisis came upon us. Together, we have tightened the \nresolution language to ensure that the creditors of failing firms will \nreceive bankruptcy-like treatment.\n  A resolution regime for large failing financial institutions is \nsimply not credible unless we make clear in language that backdoor \nbailouts are impossible. In this amendment we will be offering, we have \nsignificantly tightened up language in the bill dealing with the \nprovision of debt guarantees by the FDIC and the Treasury. Any such \nguarantee will now require prior congressional approval.\n  We have also clarified and tightened the language in the bill \nregarding resolution and the powers of the Fed, Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation, the Treasury, and others to prevent bailouts. We \nhave included provisions requiring postresolution reviews to determine \nwhether regulators did all they were supposed to do to prevent the \nfailure of a systemically significant institution. Such a review, I \nbelieve, is essential to hold regulators accountable for their actions, \nor inaction, as the case may be.\n  I believe we must put an end to the ad hoc responses of the Federal \nGovernment, which only lead to fear and panic. I believe these changes \nwill help us do that.\n  I thank the committee chairman, Senator Chris Dodd, for working with \nme to tighten the language in this part of the bill. I also thank our \nrespective staffs who have worked day and night and weekend after \nweekend to get us where we are this afternoon.\n  All of these changes are important and necessary to make bailouts a \nthing of the past. With these changes, I believe we have done what \nCongress can do to prevent any future bailouts. It will now be up to \nthe regulators to follow the law and do what we expect them to do.\n  I strongly support these changes, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthem as well. However, I don't want to leave the impression that I \nsupport the entire bill at this time because we are making these \nnecessary changes. We are not there yet.\n  Beyond resolution and government powers in a crisis, this over 1,500-\npage bill contains a broad reach into the global financial system and \nthe American economy. Now that we are over this particular hurdle, we \nwill be addressing many additional concerns we have in the coming days. \nFor now, this afternoon, I am pleased to join with Chairman Dodd in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my colleague from Arkansas will speak soon. \nI want to say to the former chairman of the Banking Committee, my \nfriend, I appreciate his comments. There are four major parts of this \nvery large bill. They are too big to fail, the early warning system, \nconsumer protection, and dealing with exotic instruments. There is a \nlot in the bill besides those major points, but those are the four \nmajor thrusts of the legislation.\n  I hope our colleagues will support this amendment as we vote shortly \non it, and that it will help us reach agreement on what I argue is a \nmajor part, which is that we never want to see taxpayers again \nconfronted with having to underwrite a failed institution. There has \nbeen a lot of hard work and negotiation to get here, and not just over \nthe last couple of days, but weeks.\n  I particularly thank Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Senator Bob \nCorker of Tennessee. They spent a lot of time on this issue, literally \ngoing back months on it. We would not be in this position today were it \nnot for their labor and effort.\n  My colleague from Virginia is on the Senate floor, and he will want \nto say a few words. I thank Senator Shelby and our staffs for their \nefforts. I thank Senator Boxer too. She will have an amendment that \nstrengthens this issue on too big to fail and taxpayers. We have more \nwork to do, but this is a good beginning. I thank Senator Shelby.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, first, I rise to speak in support of the \nBoxer amendment, which sends a strong statement that no taxpayer funds \nwill ever again be used to bail out the risky gambles that too many on \nWall Street have conducted. It should pass with 100 votes.\n  Also, I want to speak about the derivatives title, which is a \nbipartisan product that was reported out of the Agriculture Committee 2 \nweeks ago. Specifically, there have been statements in the press and in \nthe Senate Chamber that I believe need to be corrected regarding \nsection 716.\n  As chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I am proud to have included \nthis provision in the Wall Street reform legislation approved on a \nbipartisan vote by our committee 2 weeks ago. I am also proud that it \nis included in the Dodd-Lincoln legislation that we are now considering \ntoday.\n  This provision seeks to ensure that banks get back to the business of \nbanking. Under our current system, there are a handful of big banks \nthat are simply no longer acting like banks. By this time, surely every \nMember of this body is aware that the operation of risky swaps \nactivities was the spark that lit the flame that very nearly destroyed \nour economy in this great country.\n  In my view, banks were never intended to perform these activities, \nwhich have been the single largest factor to these institutions growing \nso large that taxpayers had no choice but to bail them out in order to \nprevent total economic ruin.\n  My provision seeks to accomplish two goals: first, getting banks back \nto performing the duties they were meant to perform--taking deposits \nand making loans for mortgages, small businesses, and commercial \nenterprise; second, separating the activities that put these \ninstitutions in peril.\n\n  This provision makes clear that engaging in risky derivatives dealing \nis not central to the business of banking. Under section 716, the \nFederal Reserve and FDIC will be prohibited from providing any Federal \nassistance and funds to bail out swap dealers and major swap \nparticipants.\n  Currently, five of the largest commercial banks account for 97 \npercent of the commercial bank national swap activity. That is a huge \nconcentration of economic power, which is why I am in no way surprised \nthat several individuals are seeking to remove it from the bill.\n  This provision will ensure that our community banks on Main Street \nwould not pay the price for reckless behavior on Wall Street. Community \nbanks are the backbone of economic activity for cities and towns \nthroughout this great land. They don't deal in risky swaps that put the \nwhole financial institution in jeopardy. Instead, they perform the day-\nto-day business of banking, making the smart, conservative decisions \nthat banking institutions should be making.\n  Unfortunately, we saw the five largest banks begin to fail in part \nbecause of that risky swap activity--activity\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\nthat should never have been part of their operation in the first place. \nSadly, it was community bankers and their depositors who were left \nfooting the bill.\n  Community banks were forced to pay for a problem they didn't create. \nSmall banks are still paying that price. In 2009, we saw 140 bank \nfailures, and now the cost of the FDIC insurance premiums are \nskyrocketing for our community banks all across the country. Higher \ninsurance rates means less lending.\n  Less lending means that now individuals and small businesses are also \npaying the price. The FDIC reported that in 2009 the banking industry \nreduced lending by 7.4 percent, the biggest decrease since 1942.\n  I am a strong believer that you build an economic recovery from the \nground up. If small and medium-sized businesses aren't getting the \ncapital they need to grow their businesses, something is wrong. The \neconomy simply will not recover unless we free up lending.\n  Unfortunately, Wall Street lobbyists are doing everything they can to \ndistort this provision--spreading misinformation and untruths. The \nsuggestion that this provision will force derivatives into the dark \nwithout oversight is absolutely false. The Dodd-Lincoln bill makes it \nabundantly clear all swaps activity will be vigorously regulated by the \nFed, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Securities and \nExchange Commission.\n  My good friend from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, my friend from \nTennessee, Mr. Corker, Wall Street lobbyists, and others in recent days \nhave somehow argued that by pushing out risky swaps from the Nation's \nlargest banks, such as J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, \nGoldman Sachs, and Citigroup, somehow swaps will no longer be \nregulated. This is just plain wrong.\n  Just because these swaps desks will no longer be overseen by the FDIC \ndoes not mean that they will not be subject to this bill's strong \nregulation by the market regulators--the SEC and the CFTC. In short, \nthey ignore the strong provisions included in the rest of the \nunderlying bill. That is convenient for their argument but not so \nconvenient when seeking the truth.\n  Let me reiterate: Every swaps dealer and major swaps participant will \nbe subject to strong regulation.\n  Wall Street lobbyists have also argued that this will prevent banks \nfrom using swaps to hedge their risks. Again, that is completely false. \nBanks that have been acting as banks will be able to continue doing \nbusiness as they always have. Community banks using swaps to hedge \ntheir interest rate risk on their loan portfolio will continue to be \nable to do so. Most important, we want them to do so. Community banks \noffering a swap in connection with a loan to a commercial customer are \nalso still in the business of banking and will not be impacted.\n  Using these products to manage risk or designing exotic swaps which \nhave led to the financial demise of places such as Jefferson County, \nAlabama; Orange County, California; and the country of Greece are two \nvery different things. Hopefully, this is something my colleagues will \nunderstand.\n  Wall Street lobbyists have also said this provision will move $300 \ntrillion worth of swap activities outside of the banks. My question is, \nWhy is this activity there in the first place? I agree that regulated, \ntransparent swap activity is a necessary part of our economy in \nmanaging risk. It just has no place inside a bank where too many \ninnocent bystanders are put at risk.\n  Despite what those on Wall Street may be saying, this provision is an \nimportant part of real Wall Street reform. It has broad support from \nthe Independent Community Bankers of America, the Consumer Federation \nof America, the AARP, labor unions, and leading economists, such as \nNobel Prize-winning Joseph Stiglitz, among others.\n  Let me read what a few of these groups and individuals are saying \nabout this provision.\n  Americans for Financial Reform, which includes groups such as the \nAFL-CIO, NAACP, and Consumers Union, writes:\n\n       The over 250 consumer, employee, investor, community and \n     civil rights groups who are members of the Americans for \n     Financial Reform write to express strong support for section \n     716 (\"Prohibition Against Federal Government Bailouts of \n     Swaps Entities'') as part of the Dodd-Lincoln substitute to \n     the Restoring Financial Stability Act of 2010.\n\n  It is now almost universally recognized that the fuse that lit the \nworldwide economic meltdown in the fall of 2008 was the $600 trillion \nseverely undercapitalized and unregulated and opaque swaps market \ndominated by the world's largest banks. Section 716 is designed to \nensure that the American taxpayer is not the banker of last resort, as \nwas true in the bank bailouts in 2008 and 2009, for casino-like \ninvestments marketed by large Wall Street swap dealer-banks. Section \n716 is a flat ban on Federal Government assistance to ``any swap \nentity,'' especially in instances where that entity cannot fulfill \nobligations emanating from highly risky swaps transactions.\n  By quarantining highly risky swaps trading from banking altogether, \nfederally insured deposits will not be put at risk by toxic swaps \ntransactions. Moreover, banks will be forced to behave like banks, \nfocusing on extending credit in a manner that builds economic strength \nas opposed to fostering worldwide economic instability.\n  The Nobel Prize-winning economist and former Chairman of the Council \nof Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration, Joseph \nStiglitz, writes:\n\n       One provision holds particular promise--and has the banks \n     especially riled up. This is the idea that the government \n     should not be responsible for the ``counterparty risk''--the \n     risk that a derivatives contract not be fulfilled. It was \n     AIG's inability to fulfill its obligations that led the U.S. \n     Government to step into the breach, to the tune of $182 \n     billion.\n       The modest proposal of the Agriculture Committee is that \n     the U.S. Government (the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation) stops underwriting these risks. If banks wish to \n     write those derivatives, they would have to do so through a \n     separate affiliate within the holding company. And if the \n     bank made bad gambles, the taxpayer wouldn't have to pick up \n     the tab.\n\n  Here is another from the Independent Community Bankers of America:\n\n       ICBA strongly supports section 106--\n\n  Which is a section in our bill--\n\n     of the derivatives bill. This section prohibits federal \n     assistance, including federal deposit insurance and access to \n     the Fed's discount window, to swaps entities in connection \n     with their trading in swaps or securities-based swaps.\n       Main Street and community banks have suffered the brunt of \n     the financial crisis, a crisis caused by Wall Street players \n     and not community banks. Assessments to replenish the Deposit \n     Insurance Fund have increased dramatically for community \n     banks. Large financial players have received hundreds of \n     billions in financial assistance while community banks have \n     been allowed to fail.\n       Section 106 of Senator Lincoln's derivatives legislation \n     would be an important provision to help ensure that taxpayers \n     and community banks are not on the chopping block should \n     another financial crisis occur. We strongly urge retention of \n     this provision during markup this week. Thank you for keeping \n     the views of the community bankers in mind.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these three \nletters from the Americans for Financial Reform, Professor Stiglitz, \nand the Independent Community Bankers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Americans for Financial Reform,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2010.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Re Letter of support for the Prohibition against Federal \n         Government Bailouts of Swaps Entities.\n\n       Dear Senator: The over 250 consumer, employee, investor, \n     community and civil rights groups who are members of \n     Americans for Financial Reform (AFR) write to express strong \n     support for Section 716 (``Prohibition Against Federal \n     Government Bailouts of Swaps Entities'') as part of the Dodd-\n     Lincoln substitute to the Restoring Financial Stability Act \n     of 2010. It, along with other structural reforms under \n     consideration such as a statutory Volcker Rule and limits on \n     bank size and leverage (the Merkley-Levin and Brown-Kaufman \n     amendments), will sharply reduce the possibility of taxpayer \n     bailouts for speculative activity that does not serve the \n     real economy.\n       It is now almost universally recognized that the fuse that \n     lit the worldwide economic meltdown in the fall of 2008 was \n     the $600 trillion, severely under-capitalized and unregulated \n     and opaque swaps market, dominated by the world's largest \n     banks. Section 716 is designed to ensure that the American \n     taxpayer is not the banker of last resort, as was true in the \n     bank bailouts in 2008-2009, for casino-like investments \n     marketed by large Wall Street swap dealer-banks. Section 716 \n     is a flat ban on federal government assistance to ``any swap \n     entity,'' especially in instances where that entity cannot \n     fulfill obligations\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\n     emanating from highly risky swaps transactions. Specifically, \n     Section 716 bars ``advances from any Federal Reserve credit \n     facility, discount window . . . or [loan or debt guarantees \n     by the] Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.''\n       Section 716 will require, inter alia, the five largest \n     swaps dealer banks to sever their swaps desks from the bank \n     holding corporate structure. Those five banks are: Goldman \n     Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup, and Bank \n     of America, the institutions involved in well over 90 per \n     cent of swaps transactions. Under Section 716 a ``swap \n     entity'' and a banking entity could not be contained within \n     the same bank holding company, if the bank holding company \n     has access to federal assistance.\n       By quarantining highly risky swaps trading from banking \n     altogether, federally insured deposits will not be put at \n     risk by toxic swaps transactions. Moreover, banks will be \n     forced to behave like banks, focusing on extending credit in \n     a manner that builds economic strength as opposed to \n     fostering worldwide economic instability. Finally, the \n     spun off swaps entity will be sufficiently isolated to \n     permit the kind of careful prudential oversight mandated \n     by Title VII of the Act as a whole. Title VII ensures that \n     the spun-off entities will both be regulated as \n     institutions under the most rigorous prudential standards, \n     and that almost all of the swaps instruments will be \n     subject to standards for capital adequacy, full \n     transparency, anti-fraud and anti-manipulation.\n       We understand that the largest banks which are the major \n     dealers and their allies are arguing that taking swaps \n     trading out of the banks will raise the price of hedging for \n     customers and reduce market liquidity. They are wrong. Purely \n     speculative financial derivatives now represent $78 for every \n     $1 in true hedging by businesses and farmers. Regulation that \n     reduces de-stabilizing speculative hedging will actually \n     benefit legitimate commercial hedgers. The ``cost argument'' \n     promulgated by the ``Too Big to Fail'' banks begs the \n     question: why does attaching derivatives desks to our large \n     banks result in cheaper derivatives products? The co-mingling \n     of derivatives desks and other banking activities produces \n     the formerly implicit, and now all-too-explicit, guarantee of \n     the federal taxpayer. In the current high-risk environment, \n     availability and pricing for hundreds of trillions of dollars \n     in swaps can be maintained only if counterparties are assured \n     that the Fed's backup liquidity will continue. On their own, \n     these banks cannot create the liquidity that a market with \n     such high levels of risk would require to sustain a \n     disruption. That is why the banks must not be allowed to \n     continue to deal in risky transactions that threaten \n     deposits, the taxpayer backstop, and banks' core lending \n     function.\n       Opponents of Sec. 716 also argue that it will force swaps \n     activity into non-regulated entities or into the overseas \n     market. The Europeans' experience with credit default swaps \n     on Greece's government debt suggests that no central bank \n     going forward will want to face this level of risk to its \n     banking systems. There is every indication that the G-20 \n     countries and many other sovereigns are prepared to constrain \n     reckless and abusive swaps activity. The idea that \n     systemically risky swaps-trading will migrate abroad is \n     belied by the hostility to such trading by, for example, the \n     European Commission and other G-20 countries. In the wake of \n     the havoc on the Euro wrought by currency and credit default \n     swaps, the European Commission is not eager to leave these \n     instruments unregulated.\n       Section 716 is critical to ending our ``too interconnected \n     to fail'' economy. We ask that you support the bill, and \n     oppose any attempts to weaken Section 716 or to widen any \n     loopholes in the derivatives title of the bill.

Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Senator Shelby: I am writing to you \n     on behalf of the Independent Community Bankers of America, an \n     association of 5,000 community banks across the nation. We \n     believe that the recent financial crisis has demonstrated the \n     urgent need for a new system to resolve large, interconnected \n     financial firms before they create widespread damage to the \n     financial system. A robust resolution mechanism must include \n     an adequate resolution fund that would allow for the rapid, \n     orderly takeover and wind down of the largest financial \n     firms. Properly constructed, the fund would help shield both \n     the U.S. taxpayer and community banks from the consequences \n     of a large firm failure.\n       Further, prefunding the fund is vitally important to the \n     speed with which resolution must be effected in order to \n     prevent contagion and to ensure that the cost of resolution \n     is borne by the Too-Big-To-Fail firms, including hedge funds \n     and insurers, that create risk for our financial system, not \n     by taxpayers or community banks.\n       The resolutions facilitated by this fund should not be \n     characterized as ``bailouts''; rather, they would be orderly \n     liquidations in which management would be removed and \n     shareholders and unsecured creditors would be wiped out. The \n     fund would function in much the same way the FDIC's Deposit \n     Insurance Fund (DIF) has functioned since 1930s, allowing the \n     FDIC to regularly close banks and protect insured depositors \n     while terminating senior management without compensation and \n     imposing losses on stockholders and uninsured creditors.\n       The DIF is funded by banks through deposit insurance \n     premiums, and has allowed the FDIC to weather financial \n     crises without resorting to a taxpayer bailout. Because the \n     DIF is prefunded, the failed banks as well as the survivors \n     share the costs. Without a fund, the survivors, the prudent \n     investors, pay for the profligate. This is not a model we \n     subscribe to.\n       The Dodd bill would create a $50 billion prefunded \n     ``orderly liquidation fund'' and would prohibit any \n     assistance to stockholders or unsecured creditors of large \n     financial firms. Both of these elements are critical to \n     ending Too-Big-to-Fail. Without an obvious source of funds to \n     effect the orderly unwinding of these large firms, rational \n     investors and creditors will conclude that in a crisis the \n     government will blink and again guarantee large failing \n     firms. This will confer a competitive advantage on the large \n     firms in the form of cheaper debt and equity funding, which \n     they will use to steadily acquire more and more business \n     customers, to the detriment of small banks. Further, the lack \n     of effective resolution authority will undoubtedly encourage \n     these large firms to take on excessive risk once again, \n     without the pain that should accompany such risks.\n       To level the financial and regulatory playing field we need \n     to have the ability impose losses on the stock and bond \n     holders of the giants of finance in ways similar to those \n     applied to ninety-nine percent of smaller banks.\n       Every Friday, Community banks face the market discipline \n     imposed by an orderly wind down by the FDIC and its industry \n     funded deposit insurance fund. Let's level the playing field \n     and subject our biggest and riskiest institutions--the ones \n     that caused this economic catastrophe we are just now digging \n     out from--to the same discipline.\n       As a further means of protecting taxpayers and community \n     banks from the risky activities of unregulated players, we \n     strongly support a provision of Chairman Lincoln's \n     derivatives bill that would protect the DIF. Section 106, the \n     ``Prohibition against Federal Government Bailouts of Swaps \n     Entities,'' prohibits federal assistance (including federal \n     deposit insurance, and access to the Federal Reserve discount \n     window) to swaps entities in connection with their trading in \n     swaps or securities-based swaps. This provision is targeted \n     at the AIGs of the world--both large and small--whose swaps \n     activities played a key role in triggering the credit crisis \n     and subsequent economic downturn and resulted in over $180 \n     billion in taxpayer assistance. Our support for the Dodd \n     prefund and for Section 106 of the Lincoln bill are borne out \n     of the same concern.\n       The cost of the financial crisis has been huge for Main \n     Street and community banks and our nation. Both the Dodd and \n     the Lincoln provisions will go a long way toward ensuring \n     that the costs of any future crisis--should we be so \n     unfortunate--are borne by the reckless parties who brought it \n     about.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Camden R. Fine,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                Protect Taxpayers From Wall Street Risk\n\n                        (By Joseph E. Stiglitz)\n\n       CNN.--As legislators continue to trade loud barbs over the \n     details of the bill that seeks to overhaul our financial \n     system, we risk losing a crucial aspect of reform in the din.\n       We now have an important opportunity to fix the regulation \n     of derivatives--those controversial mechanisms that played a \n     central role in the downfall of insurance giant AIG, and \n     helped spark the Great Recession.\n       The current finance bill contains reasonable proposals, \n     developed by the Senate agriculture committee, under the \n     leadership of Blanche Lincoln, that would rein in the most \n     egregious abuses of these instruments.\n       The AIG experience should have made clear that derivatives \n     can create enormous risks--risks that ended up being borne by \n     taxpayers. In addition, derivatives have played an important \n     role in all kinds of nefarious activities--from trying to \n     obfuscate Greece's real financial position, to vast tax \n     evasion.\n       Derivatives are not inherently bad. They can play a \n     positive role in risk management, but they are only likely to \n     do that if there is the right regulatory framework.\n       Without the appropriate legal and regulatory framework, \n     they will almost surely contribute, on balance, to the \n     creation of risk--as they did in this crisis, and as they did \n     a decade ago in the infamous Long-Term Capital Management \n     bailout.\n       The provisions reported out of the agriculture committee \n     are an important step in the right direction. But derivatives \n     have been an enormous profit center for a few big banks \n     (about $20 billion last year), so we should not be surprised \n     that there is resistance to anything that is a real change to \n     the status quo.\n\n[[Page S3143]]\n\n       Derivatives have been advertised as an ``insurance \n     product,'' insuring bondholders, for instance, against the \n     risk of a loss. But if they were really insurance products, \n     they should have been regulated as insurance, with insurance \n     regulators making sure that there was adequate capital to \n     meet their obligations.\n       In reality, in many cases derivatives are more accurately \n     described as gambling instruments. But gambling should be \n     subject to gaming laws, and derivatives aren't.\n       Remarkably, in fact, derivatives have been left totally \n     unregulated--a mistake that President Clinton, who failed to \n     introduce regulations when he had the chance, now \n     acknowledges. Congress's current proposal is the opportunity \n     to rectify that mistake.\n       One provision holds particular promise--and has the banks \n     especially riled up. This is the idea that the government \n     should not be responsible for the ``counterparty risk''--the \n     risk that a derivatives contract not be fulfilled. It was \n     AIG's inability to fulfill its obligations that led the U.S. \n     government to step into the breach, to the tune of some $182 \n     billion.\n       The modest proposal of the agriculture committee is that \n     the U.S. government (the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation) stop underwriting these risks. If banks wish to \n     write derivatives, they would have to do so through a \n     separate affiliate within the holding company. And if the \n     bank made bad gambles, the taxpayer wouldn't have to pick up \n     the tab.\n       This change would help fix the current system, where those \n     who buy this so-called ``insurance'' enjoy the subsidy of the \n     essential, free government guarantee; and where competition \n     among the few issuers of these risky products is sufficiently \n     weak that they enjoy high profits.\n       This arrangement is economically inefficient--firms should \n     pay for the costs of their insurance. If the government \n     guarantee is removed, the banks might have to put more money \n     into their derivatives subsidiaries. This will reduce the \n     banks' profitability, and it might force up prices of this \n     ``insurance.'' But that is as it should be. The government \n     shouldn't be subsidizing ``insurance''--and it certainly \n     shouldn't be in the business of subsidizing gambling.\n       The Fed and the Treasury seem to object to the agriculture \n     committee's proposals. These objections show once again the \n     extent to which the Fed and the Treasury have been captured \n     by the institutions that they are supposed to regulate, and \n     reemphasize the need for deeper governance reforms of the Fed \n     than those on the table.\n       To be sure, banks' high profits from derivatives would help \n     with recapitalization, offsetting the losses they incurred \n     from the risky gambles of the past. But that doesn't mean \n     that the policy of allowing banks to issue derivatives--and \n     laying the risk of failure onto the taxpayer--is right.\n       Bank recapitalization should be done in an open and \n     transparent way, consistent with sound economic principles. \n     Abusive credit card practices could also help recapitalize \n     the banks, but fortunately we have curtailed some of these. \n     We should now do the same for derivatives.\n       We should recognize that the agriculture committee \n     provision is already a compromise. Many worry that if the \n     affiliate within the holding company that writes the \n     derivatives gets into trouble, Uncle Sam will still come to \n     the rescue.\n       The bill, for instance, includes a ``strong presumption'' \n     of losses for creditors and shareholders. What should be \n     required is that creditors (other than depositors) and \n     shareholders bear all the losses before the government is \n     asked to pony up any money. But ultimately, in a crisis, \n     worries about the consequences of such strong medicine will \n     almost surely mean a bailout for the bank holding companies \n     as well as the banks--as happened in this crisis.\n       In a crisis, the government will not only bail out the \n     banks, but also the bankers, their shareholders, and their \n     bondholders--if not totally, at least partially.\n       So if we are to protect American taxpayers, we must also \n     bar any too-big-to-fail institutions from writing \n     derivatives.\n       But right now, the institutions who write the vast majority \n     of these derivatives are too big to fail. Ideally, \n     responsibility for writing derivatives should be spun out to \n     a totally independent entity. The agriculture committee bill \n     does not go this far; rather, it strikes a reasoned \n     compromise between political expediency and economic good \n     sense.\n       It would be a major mistake to walk away from this \n     compromise by allowing FDIC-insured institutions to continue \n     to write these risky products. To allow them to do so would \n     simply generate more political cynicism: It would show that \n     the big banks have succeeded in their ambition of returning \n     to the world nearly as it was before the crash.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to ensure this legislation remains strong and new loopholes \nare not created on behalf of Wall Street.\n  This is a legislative body. It is designed for debate, and I welcome \nthat debate and welcome the debate of my colleagues in terms of what we \nare trying to do here.\n  We have seen a historic economic crisis. Banks no longer look like \nbanks, and for people in my hometowns across Arkansas, that is a \nfrightening thing. The status quo is certainly not acceptable.\n  We all have to look at what it is we can do to come together with \nsome type of assurance and confidence for the people of our States that \nwe are not going to let the status quo remain. I believe we need to \ntake the necessary steps to create that confidence for investors and \nconsumers that what we experienced will not be able to happen again; \nthat these financial entities cannot become so big that they cannot \nfail or that we would not allow them to fail or, worst of all, that \ntaxpayers will have to bail them out again.\n  I say to my colleagues, I am a very pragmatic person, pretty \nsimplistic in what it is I want to achieve and what we have worked to \nachieve. I hope all of my colleagues will continue to work together to \nfind out what it is we can responsibly hand to the people of this great \ncountry and say to them: We not only have seen what has happened, but \nwe are going to dare to produce something that will ensure it does not \nhappen again. As I said, working in a pragmatic way, I think we can \ncome up with a good, strong piece of legislation, that all of us--\nDemocrats and Republicans, no matter what regions of the country we \ncome from--will actually say to the American people: We saw what \nhappened, and we are going to make sure it does not happen again.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank our colleague, the chairperson of \nthe Agriculture Committee, for her work and the work of her staff and \nothers and for her statement today inviting all of us to be involved in \nthis process. I commend her. I thank her for the fine work.\n  I am going to propose a unanimous consent request that has been \ncleared by our respective leaders.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:45 p.m. today, the \nSenate proceed to executive session to consider the following calendar \nnumbers: 728, 701, and 702; that prior to each vote, there be 2 minutes \nof debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form; that upon \nconfirmation of the nominations, the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table en bloc; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action; that the Senate then \nresume legislative session; that upon resuming legislative session, \nthere be 4 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the Boxer \namendment No. 3737; that upon disposition of the Boxer amendment, the \nSenate then proceed to a vote in relation to the Shelby-Dodd amendment, \nwhich is at the desk, with 4 minutes of debate prior to a vote in \nrelation to the amendment, with all time divided in the usual form, \nwith no amendments in order to the amendments covered in this \nagreement, prior to a vote in relation thereto; further, that the \nSenate then consider en bloc the Snowe amendments Nos. 3755 and 3757, \nwith no further debate in order with respect to the Snowe amendments \nand with no amendments in order to the Snowe amendments; that the next \namendments in order be one from the Republican leader or his designee \nregarding consumer protection, and the Tester-Hutchison amendment No. \n3749.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see two of my colleagues who have been \ndeeply involved. I mentioned them earlier in their absence. I thank \nSenator Corker and Senator Warner for their hard work. As I said, this \ngoes back months, title I and title II of the bill. I have thanked them \na lot already. They put in a tremendous amount of time with an awful \nlot of people on how best to draft this legislation. Everybody always \nhas ideas and thoughts about all of it. I am grateful to both of them \nfor their tireless efforts, and their staffs.\n  I yield the floor so each can comment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I \nwill be brief.\n  My friend from Virginia, Mark Warner, is here. Senator Dodd and \nSenator Shelby allowed us to work on this portion of the bill. I thank \nSenator Warner for being such a great partner.\n  One of the things you learn around this body very quickly is you \ncertainly\n\n[[Page S3144]]\n\ndo not end up getting everything the way you would like. I thank both \nSenator Shelby and Senator Dodd for the way they have worked together \nover the last week or so to improve this bill.\n  Look, I think Senator Warner and I--I will speak for myself. \nObviously, there are pieces I wish were a little different. I wish the \nlength of receivership was not 5 years but that it was a much shorter \nperiod to wind these companies down more quickly. I wish we had \njudicial review so if a company is placed into this type of resolution, \nthey actually have the opportunity to have that reviewed in a much \nbetter way. We have a bankruptcy court title. I know Senator Shelby, \nSenator Warner, and others would like to see that happen. I am hoping \nover the course of the amendment process that will happen. Judicial \nreview of claims--I wish that were occurring. I know that is not part \nof this title. I also wish there was judicial review of the valuation \nprocess. There are a number of provisions I wish were better, but I \nwill say that I think the work Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby have \ndone to date is good. I plan to support this.\n  I say to my colleagues on this side of the aisle who want the \nbankruptcy process to be the process, I think they should still support \nwhat Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby have done because they have \ntightened this resolution title to make it much better.\n  I defer to my friend from Virginia because I know he is going to talk \nabout aspects of this bill that are not talked about much. They are \npreventive measures--at least of this title--to keep us from being in a \nsituation where resolution is even necessary because of precautionary \nissues that are put in place.\n  I thank Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby. I thank them for their \ninvolvement. I thank them for the way they have worked together to make \nthis bill better with the process that has taken place over the last \nweek.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me follow on my colleague's comments. \nHe is my colleague and my friend and my partner for the last year. I \nthink we've both, as former business guys, said this is not an issue \nthat should be partisan. We need to check our ``D'' and ``R'' hats at \nthe door and find a way to sort through a new set of financial rules so \nwe never have to face what we faced in 2008.\n  I think some of the original approaches that we had might have been \ntighter. I know we talked a little bit off the floor about the notion \nthat actually some of the borrowing authority that now exists might be \nlarger than what we had initially proposed. But at the end of the day, \nwhat is important is that, one, the taxpayers are protected--and that \nis what the Shelby-Dodd approach has; it has no recoupment from the \nfinancial industry--and two, to make sure there is money to wind these \nfirms down in an orderly fashion.\n  We have seen with Lehman, a year and a half after the fact, literally \nhundreds of millions, close to billions of dollars, that are being used \nto unwind. That process takes time and money. I again share the concern \nof the Senator from Tennessee that we ought to do this in as limited \ntime as possible.\n  Let me take 2 more quick minutes and say that, if we have done our \njob right, we are never going to have to get to resolution because \nbankruptcy should always be the preferred process.\n  We have put the appropriate speed bumps on these firms that become \nlarge and systemically important: higher capital requirements, better \nreview of their leverage, making sure they have good risk management \nplans. And we have created two new tools that have not gotten any \ndiscussion but I know, in our hundreds of meetings we had, kept coming \nback time and again. One was the creation of a whole new set of capital \nthat would convert from debt into equity if a firm ever gets into a \nproblem. And second, a funeral plan that has to be blessed by the \nregulator that would show how these large firms, particularly firms \nwith international operations all around the world, can wind themselves \ndown through bankruptcy. If the plan is not approved, the regulators \ncan take more dramatic action.\n  I think the heart and soul of our challenge, which has been to end \ntoo big to fail and make sure taxpayers were not exposed, has been \naccomplished. I thank the chairman and Ranking Member Shelby for their \nwork on this. I look forward to support this--and I look forward to \nsupport this amendment as well.\n  I want to conclude with my thanks to my colleague and friend from \nTennessee. I think we did check our hats and put a business approach on \ntrying to get these titles right, and I agree with his comments that we \nappreciate any improvements made by both the chairman and the ranking \nmember. I look forward to supporting this part of the legislation and I \nhope we can continue to work through on the balance of the titles in \nthis same way.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use my leader \ntime right now.\n  First, I want to express my appreciation to Senators Warner and \nCorker for working to improve this bill. They are very fine Senators. \nMy friend, the Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, has been such a \ngreat addition to the caucus, the Senate, and the country. His \nexperience as Governor of the State has served him well. He does a \nwonderful job for the people of Virginia and, of course, our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3144-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3144-S3147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATIONS OF GLORIA M.

Mr. President, it is my understanding there is a consent \nagreement now in effect that has three votes for three judges, and then \ntwo other matters related to the banking bill; is that true?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that agreement be modified to have \nthe first vote be 15 minutes and the next four 10-minute votes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Nomination of Gloria M. Navarro\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will say a few words about the first vote \nwe are going to have today.\n  I am very happy I had the opportunity and the privilege to nominate \nGloria Navarro to be a Federal judge for the District of Nevada. What a \nwonderful addition she will be to the Federal Judiciary. She has a \nnumber of outstanding qualities.\n  First, she is such a fine human being. She has a wonderful family--a \nhusband who supports her entirely in this terrifically important job \nshe is going to take. He is an accomplished lawyer himself. She has \nwonderful children and a mom who supports her. She is a Nevadan who has \nbeen educated in the Nevada school system. She has attended some of the \nfinest universities in the country--the University of Southern \nCalifornia and Arizona State.\n  In my interviews with her, I was very impressed. She has proven \nthroughout her personal and professional life that she embodies the \nvalues of our country--hard work, discipline, and respect for the rule \nof law. I have been impressed time and time again by this Nevadan's \nrecord and her commitment to public service in all areas of her life. \nShe has worked for two decades in both\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\nthe private and public sectors and has experience in every aspect of \nthe law--complex litigation at both the Federal and State levels; \nmurder cases.\n  She is currently the chief deputy district attorney in the Office of \nCounty Counsel, providing legal counsel and litigation defense to the \nClark County Board of Commissioners. She has worked as a public \ndefender, and in 2002 she received the Nevada State Bar Access to \nJustice Pro Bono Public Lawyer of the Year award. She has also worked \nin private practice, representing clients in Federal and State \nlitigation relating to criminal, civil, and family law. In 2001, she \nwas awarded the very prestigious Louis Wiener Pro Bono Service Award.\n  She is committed to the State of Nevada. She is committed to her \ncommunity. Among other things, as president of the Latino Bar \nAssociation, she created a mentoring program pairing high school, \ncollege, and law school students with community lawyers.\n  It is my pleasure to have recommended her to be a judge, and everyone \ncan rest assured that she will do an outstanding job for the people of \nNevada in dispensing fair, equal justice under the law.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senate Republicans have not allowed the \nSenate to act on a judicial nominee for almost 2 weeks. They have \ncontinued to stall the almost two dozen judicial nominees reported \nfavorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee, dating back to last \nNovember. These 23 judicial nominees awaiting final Senate action \ninclude 17 who were reported without any negative votes. That is \nright--Senate Republicans continue to block Senate consideration and \nconfirmation of nominees, including judicial nominees, who are not only \ngoing to be confirmed, but will likely be confirmed unanimously.\n  The majority leader has had to file cloture petitions to cut off the \nRepublican stalling by filibuster votes on President Obama's nominees \n22 times. Twice he has had to file cloture to proceed with judicial \nnominees, only to eventually see those nominees confirmed unanimously. \nThis stalling and obstruction is wrong.\n  Senator Whitehouse, Senator McCaskill, and a number of other Senators \nhave taken up the cause against these delays and secret holds. I thank \nthem. They made live requests for action on the Senate floor to bring \nthese matters into the light. Regrettably, those Republican Senators \nwho had objected did not come forward to identify themselves or the \nreasons for their objections in accordance with Senate rules.\n  By this date in George W. Bush's Presidency, the Senate had confirmed \n52 Federal circuit and district court judges. As of today, only 20 \nFederal circuit and district court confirmations have been allowed by \nSenate Republicans. As I have noted there remain another two dozen \nadditional judicial nominations stalled before final Senate action by \nRepublican obstruction. It should not take 2 weeks to work out time \nagreements on three noncontroversial nominees. Nominees reported \nwithout a single negative vote in committee should not be stalled for \nmonths for no good reason.\n  Despite the fact that President Obama began sending judicial \nnominations to the Senate 2 months earlier than President Bush, the \nSenate is far behind the pace we set during the Bush administration. In \nthe second half of 2001 and through 2002 the Senate confirmed 100 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees. Given Republican delay and \nobstruction this Senate may not achieve even half of that. Last year \nthe Senate was allowed to confirm only 12 Federal circuit and district \ncourt judges all year. That was the lowest total in more than 50 years. \nMeanwhile, judicial vacancies have skyrocketed to more than 100, more \nthan 40 of which have been declared to be ``judicial emergencies'' by \nthe Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n  There is no explanation or excuse for what continues to be a practice \nby Senate Republicans of secret holds, and a Senate Republican \nleadership strategy of delay and obstruction of this President's \nnominations. That is wrong.\n  Throughout the past month, a number of Senators have come before the \nSenate to discuss this untenable situation and to ask for consent to \nproceed to scores of noncontroversial nominations. Republicans objected \nanonymously and without specifying any basis whatsoever.\n  These long delays unfortunately continue to be part of a pattern of \nRepublican obstructionism that we have seen since President Obama took \noffice. In a dramatic departure from the Senate's traditional practice \nof prompt and routine consideration of noncontroversial nominations, \nSenate Republicans have refused month after month to join agreements to \nconsider, debate and vote on nominations. This unprecedented practice \nhas led to a backlog of nominations and a historically low number of \njudicial confirmations.\n  We should restore the Senate's tradition of moving promptly to \nconsider noncontroversial nominees pending on the calendar, with up-or-\ndown votes in a matter of days, not weeks, and certainly not months. \nFor those nominees Republicans wish to debate, we should come to \nagreements for when to have those debates and votes. It should not take \ncloture in order for the Senate to get its work done and fulfill its \nconstitutional advice and consent responsibilities.\n  I, again, urge the Senate Republican leadership to abandon its \ndestructive delaying tactics and allow the Senate to act on the backlog \nof nearly two dozen judicial nominees reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee over the last 6 months that they have stalled for no good \npurpose.\n  The three nominations we consider today should have been confirmed \nmonths ago, and I predict will each be confirmed overwhelmingly. Nancy \nFreudenthal has been nominated to fill a vacancy on the District of \nWyoming. She has decades of experience as a public servant and a lawyer \nin private practice, and she currently serves as Wyoming's First Lady. \nMs. Freudenthal has been rated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar \nAssociation's, ABA, Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary and, \nwhen confirmed, she will be that state's first female Federal judge. \nThe Judiciary Committee favorably reported Ms. Freudenthal's nomination \nby voice vote without dissent on February 11--nearly 3 months ago--and \nher nomination has the support of both of Wyoming's Republican \nSenators, Senator Enzi and Senator Barrasso.\n  Judge D. Price Marshall has been nominated to fill a vacancy on the \nEastern District of Arkansas. The Judiciary Committee also favorably \nreported his nomination by voice vote without dissent nearly 3 months \nago, on February 11. Judge Marshall is currently a well-respected judge \non the Arkansas Court of Appeals, and he spent 15 years in private \npractice in Jonesboro, Arkansas. He also served as a law clerk to \nSeventh Circuit Judge Richard S. Arnold. Judge Marshall has earned the \nhighest possible rating, unanimously ``well qualified'' from the ABA \nStanding Committee, and he has the strong support of both of his home \nState Senators, Senator Pryor and Senator Lincoln.\n  Gloria Navarro has been nominated to serve as a Federal district \ncourt judge in Nevada. The Judiciary Committee reported her nomination \nby voice vote without dissent 2 months ago, on March 4. When the Senate \nfinally confirms her, Ms. Navarro will become the only woman, and the \nonly Hispanic, on the Nevada district court. Ms. Navarro, who has been \nrated ``qualified'' by the ABA's standing committee has gained valuable \nexperience as a chief deputy district attorney in Clark County, NV, as \na public defender and as a lawyer in private practice. Her nomination \nhas the support of both of her home State Senators, Senator Reid and \nSenator Ensign.\n  The three judicial nominees the Senate considers today have each been \nstalled by Republican objection for months. Each has the support of his \nor her home State Senators. In one case, that is two Republican \nSenators, in another that is two Democratic Senators, and in the third \ncase that is one Democratic Senator and a Republican Senator. Each of \nthese confirmations is long overdue. I congratulate the nominees and \ntheir families on their confirmations today.\n  I urge the Republican leadership to agree to prompt consideration of \nthe additional 20 judicial nominees they continue to stall.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there any debate in opposition \nto the nomination?\n\n[[Page S3146]]\n\n  If not, the question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of Gloria M. Navarro, of Nevada, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the District of Nevada?\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Freudenthal\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, evenly \ndivided, on the nomination of Nancy D. Freudenthal, of Wyoming, to be \nU.S. circuit judge.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the \nnomination of Nancy Freudenthal to serve as a judge for the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Wyoming. I want to thank Chairman \nLeahy and Senator Sessions and the Judiciary Committee staff for their \nassistance moving this nomination through the process.\n  Nancy is a Wyoming native, born in Cody, and received both her B.A. \nand her J.D. from the University of Wyoming.\n  After being admitted to the Wyoming State Bar in 1980, Nancy took a \nposition with Governor Ed Herschler as his attorney for \nintergovernmental affairs for 8 years. She then served in the same \nposition for Governor Mike Sullivan for 2 years. In this capacity, \nNancy served as the Governor's representative on numerous boards, \nworked extensively with the State legislature, taught at the University \nof Wyoming College of Law, and served as acting administrator of the \nDepartment of Environmental Quality in the Land Quality Division.\n  In 1989, Nancy was appointed by Governor Sullivan to the Wyoming Tax \nCommission and State Board of Equalization, where she served as \nChairman for a 6-year term. While the State board of equalization is \ntasked with the annual process of equalizing valuation of property in \nWyoming counties, the board has a main function of listening to \ndisputes between taxpayers and the Department of Revenue and reviewing \nappeals. Nancy's experience as chairman of this board will greatly \nenhance her abilities as a judge.\n  Since joining Davis & Cannon, LLP in 1995, Nancy has handled a wide \nvariety of matters, including complex mineral tax litigation, \nenvironmental and natural resource disputes, public utility law, oil \nand gas litigation, employment litigation, and commercial transactions. \nShe has experience at both the trial and appellate levels. Nancy is \nwell respected among her peers and judges in Wyoming.\n  I also want to mention how important this judgeship is for Wyoming. \nWhile Senators disagree at times about specific nominees, we can all \nagree that without judges in place our legal system slows down and does \na disserve to the people we represent.\n  Nancy Freudenthal's experiences as a private attorney and in State \ngovernment will serve her well as a district court judge. I am pleased \nthat her nomination has received the strong support of my Senate \ncolleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will support this nominee, but I should \nmention again that Senate Republicans have not allowed us to vote on a \njudicial nominee for almost 2 weeks.\n  By this date in George W. Bush's Presidency, the Senate had confirmed \n52 Federal circuit and district court judges. As of today, we had only \nbeen allowed only 20 by the Senate Republicans. Counting the recent \nvote on Gloria M. Navarro this brings us just up to 21 confirmations.\n  There are nearly two dozen additional nominations stalled. It should \nnot take 2 weeks to try to get through these secret holds. When we have \npeople who are confirmed unanimously in the committee, then confirmed \nunanimously on the floor, it is unconscionable to hold them up week \nafter week after week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am rising in support of the nominee. Any \ndelays that there have been have not been for this particular nominee, \nnor by the Wyoming delegation at all.\n  This is a position that has been open now for over 2 years. The first \nnominee for this position got a hearing but could not get a vote in \ncommittee. The nomination ran out and we now have a new nominee, who is \nMrs. Freudenthal, Nancy Freudenthal, who is also the first lady of \nWyoming.\n  But she, in her own right, has been an attorney, has served with \nthree different Governors in the State of Wyoming, and does a \nphenomenal job. She has her law degree from the University of Wyoming \nand would make an outstanding person to fill in this roll. Both Senator \nBarrasso and I are strongly in support of her and have been pushing for \nher nomination since we first started.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator yield? The Senator is absolutely right. \nThe Wyoming Senators did not hold up this nominee, but the Republican \nside did.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Republican side may have been doing \nthings to be sure we had votes on judges, which is the same thing the \nDemocrats did when we were in the majority.

Mr. President, I am so pleased to rise in support of \nJudge Price Marshall who has been nominated to fill the Federal \njudicial vacancy in the Eastern District of Arkansas.\n  Judge Marshall has enjoyed an impressive and lengthy legal career in \nArkansas, where he has served as a judge on the Arkansas Court of \nAppeals since 2006.\n  Previously, Judge Marshall practiced law in his hometown of \nJonesboro, for 15 years, as a principal at the firm Barrett & Deacon. \nHe also clerked for U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Arnold from 1989 to \n1991.\n  He graduated from Arkansas State University in Jonesboro in 1985, \nwhere he currently serves as an adjunct professor of political science.\n  Judge Marshall also received a degree from the London School of \nEconomics, and graduated with honors from Harvard Law School in 1989.\n  He has done a tremendous job. He is very well known in Arkansas as a \ngifted appellate advocate, brilliant legal mind, and well-respected man \nof integrity. I am so pleased the Senate is taking the role of moving \nhim forward in this capacity. I thank Chairman Leahy and the Judiciary \nCommittee for moving the nomination forward. I have full faith and \nconfidence in Judge Marshall's ability and encourage Members to support \nhim.\n  I yield to my colleague from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I don't think it is an exaggeration to say \nthat when our Founding Fathers laid out article III of the \nConstitution, they had people such as Price Marshall in mind. He is \nsmart. He is hard-working. He is a family man. He is involved in his \ncommunity. He is involved in his church and in his legal profession. He \nis an elected member of the Arkansas Court of Appeals. When he was in \nprivate practice, he had a reputation as a lawyer's lawyer. I join \nSenator Lincoln in giving him my highest recommendation.\n  I appreciate all my colleagues voting yes on Price Marshall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Denzil Price Marshall, Jr., of Arkansas, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The motion to reconsider is considered as made and tabled.\n  The President shall be notified of the Senate's action.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the \nvotes on the nomination of Nancy D. Freudenthal to be U.S. District \nJudge for the District of Wyoming and Denzil Price Marshall Jr. to be \nU.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas. If I were \nable to attend today's session, I would have supported both \nnominees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3147-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like everyone to take a look at \nthese headlines from September 2008: ``Nightmare on Wall Street, Where \nDo We Go From Here?'' All of us who went through this, whether we were \nin the Senate or we were looking at what was happening to our \ninvestments on Wall Street, we saw over 3 short days in September of \n2008, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and AIG collapsed and the stock \nmarket plunged. Seniors lost their retirement savings, and families \nlost their jobs and homes. Small businesses stopped hiring. It was a \nnightmare. That is what it was. If there is one thing we should all be \nable to agree on, it is this: The American taxpayer should never again \nhave to bail out Wall Street firms that gambled away our savings and \nwreaked havoc on our economy.\n  My amendment is very clear. It is not a sense of the Senate. It has \nthe force of law. It is straightforward. It is an ironclad assurance \nthat a failing, insolvent Wall Street firm must be liquidated, and the \ncost of that liquidation must come either from selling off the firm's \nassets or from industry assessments of the big Wall Street firms.\n  I will retain the remainder of my time in case there is a debate. I \nhope this is close to a unanimous vote. It is clear, and I hope we will \nagree.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, I rise to bring up amendment No. 3826, the \nRepublican consumer protection alternative. This amendment has been \ncosponsored by 14 of my colleagues. It is amendment No. 3826.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], for himself, Mr. \n     McConnell, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Corker, Mr. Johanns, \n     Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. \n     Cornyn, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Enzi, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3826 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before they begin debate on the next \namendment, I thank my colleagues. This has been a difficult time even \ngetting to this point. I thank Senator Shelby and his staff and my \nstaff and others. We have had a vote on the Boxer amendment, 96 to 1. \nWe had a vote, 93 to 5, on the Shelby-Dodd amendment. We adopted two \nSnowe amendments in the last hour. That is a pretty good beginning on \nthis bill.\n  I want to tell my colleagues I have received about 95 amendments to \nthe bill that people will propose. I believe Members ought to be able \nto be heard on their amendments. This is something that will have to be \nself-imposed discipline, to some degree, but if Members will restrain \nthemselves on time, more colleagues will get a chance to be a part of \nthe bill and to be heard. If you ask for too much time, it will make it \ndifficult. I just ask people to be considerate of each other. Most \ntimes, an amendment can be made--a big amendment--with an hour or two \nof debate and others less than that, maybe 20 minutes or 30 minutes \nequally divided. Again, I am not suggesting some amendments are more \nimportant than others. If you bring the amendments to us for review, \nperhaps we can adopt some or make them part of a managers' amendment. \nWe will both have to check them out. If we can do that, we can reduce \nthe number significantly. I think we have some smart proposals. I \ncannot do that alone. My colleague will have to agree with that.\n  It would help us a great deal if we can move this along, and I say \nthat respectfully. I don't know whether we have an agreement on when we \nmight vote on this amendment. I will ask my colleague to give us some \nidea. I would like you to think about how much time you would like, and \nkeep in mind your fellow colleagues who would like to be heard on their \namendments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think it is commendable that there has been a burst of \nactivity on the Senate floor in the last couple of hours. We have had a \nnumber of votes. It took some while to wait for this to happen. I agree \nwith the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Alabama that to \nthe extent we can accommodate votes on a wide range of subjects--this \nis an issue that is very consequential to the future of the country, \nand we want to get it right.\n  From my standpoint, I have a couple of amendments I think are very \nimportant. Time agreements are not a problem for me. I am interested in \nhaving the opportunity to explain an amendment and have a short debate \nand then have the Senate register its judgment. I appreciate what the \nSenator just said. He would like to see us move along and be able to \noffer amendments. There are a lot of them on too big to fail and credit \ndefault swaps. I will talk to the managers. I hope I will have an \nopportunity to get them on the floor and get them offered.\n  Mr. DODD. I hope we can stay away from filibusters and get everybody \nto have an up-or-down vote. This is a very important bill, and it is \nalso about how this institution functions and whether we trust each \nother to be able to offer an amendment, have an adequate amount of time \nto debate, and then vote up or down. That is how we ought to function.\n  I hope this bill will not only produce a good product in the end but \nwill also have the healing quality this institution needs. We have been \nthrough a lot in this Congress. We need to get back to acting like \ncolleagues, respecting each other's opinions, having a good partisan \ndebate but doing it in a civil fashion, having the consideration each \nperson deserves to be heard, and having a vote up or down. I offer that \nas a suggestion on how we might proceed.\n  Mr. SANDERS. If the Senator will yield, do we have any sense of what \nis happening this afternoon?\n  Mr. DODD. I will find out from my colleague.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Connecticut. We \nhave had a burst of activity this afternoon. I think we are off to a \ngood start. We have to remember that this bill is\n\n[[Page S3149]]\n\nabout 1,500 pages. This doesn't only affect a little bit of our \neconomy, it affects all of our economy in one way or the other.\n  I have just laid down an amendment--the Republican alternative to the \nconsumer products--and a lot of people are going to want to debate it \non both sides. We are not here to delay this bill in any way. I think \nit is so important and it is so comprehensive that we are going to have \na healthy debate. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from \nConnecticut. I believe he understands that very well.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague from Montana wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I inquire of Senator Dodd, at this point \nin time, does he want me call up my amendment No. 3749 or just talk \nabout it?\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator can call it up.\n  Mr. DODD. My friend can call up his amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3749 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, and I call up amendment No. 3749.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Tester], for himself, Mr. \n     Conrad, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Burris, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3749 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Corporation to amend the definition of the \n                       term ``assessment base'')\n\n       On page 368, strike line 3 and all that follows through \n     page 369, line 14, and insert the following:\n       (b) Assessment Base.--The Corporation shall amend the \n     regulations issued by the Corporation under section 7(b)(2) \n     of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1817(b)(2)) \n     to define the term ``assessment base'' with respect to an \n     insured depository institution for purposes of that section \n     7(b)(2), as an amount equal to--\n       (1) the average consolidated total assets of the insured \n     depository institution during the assessment period; minus\n       (2) the sum of--\n       (A) the average tangible equity of the insured depository \n     institution during the assessment period; and\n       (B) in the case of an insured depository institution that \n     is a custodial bank (as defined by the Corporation, based on \n     factors including the percentage of total revenues generated \n     by custodial businesses and the level of assets under \n     custody) or a banker's bank (as that term is used in section \n     5136 of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 24)), an amount that \n     the Corporation determines is necessary to establish \n     assessments consistent with the definition under section \n     7(b)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. \n     1817(b)(1)) for a custodial bank or a banker's bank.\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nthe Tester-Hutchison amendment. My colleague from Texas and I came to \nthe floor yesterday to talk about this bipartisan, commonsense \namendment to hold banks accountable for their behavior and to preserve \nthe integrity of the FDIC deposit insurance fund.\n  Our amendment would force big banks to pay their fair share of \ninsurance by basing assessments on assets rather than deposits. It \nwould fix the lopsided assessment system that we have now, which \nunfairly burdens our community banks. It would ensure that the FDIC has \nthe necessary resources to maintain the health of the deposit insurance \nfund.\n  Senator Hutchison and I think this amendment makes a good deal of \ncommon sense. I am pleased this is one of the first amendments up for \nconsideration because it highlights the fact that Democrats and \nRepublicans do agree on ways we can strengthen what is already a very \ngood bill. Senator Hutchison and I are joined by Senators Conrad, \nMurray, Burris, Brown of Massachusetts, Harkin, Shaheen, Cornyn, \nJohanns, Nelson of Florida, and Nelson of Nebraska in offering this \nimportant bipartisan amendment.\n  After working on this bill for months with the good Senator Dodd and \nthe Banking Committee, I am pleased we are finally getting an \nopportunity to debate this bill and move it forward.\n  I know there are a number of other bipartisan amendments like this \none where Members can join together to work to improve this bill. I \nlook forward to considering them also.\n  With that, when the time is right, when leadership has agreed, I hope \nwe can get a vote on amendment No. 3749.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Rhode Island \nspeaks, let me just ask if he will yield so that I may ask a question.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Montana has offered an \namendment. I am trying to determine if there is a list and how I might \nget on the list. I might propound the question to the Senator from \nConnecticut. There has been a Republican amendment offered, and that \nwas set aside and the Senator from Montana offered one. I would like to \ntalk to whoever is making a list.\n  Mr. DODD. There isn't one. This amendment will be agreed to. It is \nnot going to require a vote. Other matters will require debate and \ndiscussion. That was the only reason to do this--to get it in the \nqueue--and at some point today there will be an agreement to accept \nthat amendment. They just didn't do it yet. I don't have a particular \nqueue lined up.\n  It is my intention to ask Senator Sanders to offer his, once we \ncomplete this--to be the next in line. I ask my colleagues to, instead \nof jumping up one after another trying to get in the queue, come and \ntalk to us and let us orchestrate it in a way that will allow for \nconsideration of various parts of the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for \nhis courtesy, and I thank Senator Dodd. I was here earlier. I will come \nand talk about that queue as it exists. I hope my amendment on too big \nto fail will be part of the early amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I was delighted to give the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota a chance to clarify that.\n  I will speak just for a minute about amendment No. 3746, which I will \nnot be calling up right now but which I intend to work with Chairman \nDodd on to call up later.\n  I wanted to mention that this afternoon this amendment received the \nendorsement of Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of dozens of \nnational and State consumer groups that are working to help pass the \ncritical legislation we are debating today.\n  In addition to the coalition as a whole, the amendment has been \nendorsed by individual members as well, including the AARP, the \nConsumer Federation of America, Consumers Action, Consumers Union, and \non behalf of its low-income clients, the National Consumer Law Center.\n  These groups have sent a letter to each of my colleagues which reads \nin part:\n\n       On behalf of consumers, AFR strongly urges you to support \n     Whitehouse's Interstate Lending Amendment. By reinstating \n     protections that existed prior to the U.S Supreme Court's \n     decision in Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First \n     of Omaha Service Corp (1978), Congress will take a step in \n     the right direction toward protecting consumers and leveling \n     the playing field between national credit card companies and \n     their local and community oriented counterparts.\n       The Whitehouse Interstate Lending Amendment takes a strong \n     step towards restoring to each state the ability to protect \n     its citizens from lenders based in other states. We strongly \n     urge you to vote in favor of this Amendment and in favor of \n     the consumer protections this Amendment promotes. By leveling \n     the playing field between national banks and local lenders, \n     you will send a strong signal to Main Street that their \n     interests count. We urge adoption of this modest, yet \n     tremendously helpful amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis letter dated today from Americans for Financial Reform.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Americans for\n\n\n                                             Financial Reform,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2010.\n     Re Support for Whitehouse Interstate Lending amendment to S. \n         3217.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The consumer, employee, investor, community \n     and civil rights groups\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\n     who are members of Americans for Financial Reform (AFR) write \n     to express strong support for the Whitehouse Interstate \n     Lending Amendment that will be offered during floor debate on \n     S. 3217, the ``Restoring American Financial Stability Act.''\n       This amendment will restore to the states the ability to \n     enforce interest rate caps against out-of-state lenders. By \n     so doing, the amendment will help level the playing field so \n     that intrastate lenders such as community banks, local \n     retailers, and credit unions no longer are bound by stricter \n     lending limits than national credit card companies.\n       Under current law, national banks are bound only by the \n     lending laws of the state in which the bank is based. As a \n     result, the current system gives lenders an incentive to \n     locate in states with weak or non-existent interest \n     restrictions. A handful of states, eager to attract lucrative \n     credit card business and related tax revenues, have all but \n     eliminated their consumer protections.\n       On behalf of consumers, AFR strongly urges you to support \n     Whitehouse's Interstate Lending Amendment. By reinstating \n     protections that existed prior to the U.S. Supreme Court's \n     decision in Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First \n     of Omaha Service Corp (1978), Congress will take a step in \n     the right direction toward protecting consumers and leveling \n     the playing field between national credit card companies and \n     their local and community oriented counterparts.\n       The Whitehouse Interstate Lending Amendment takes a strong \n     step towards restoring to each state the ability to protect \n     its citizens from lenders based in other states. We strongly \n     urge you to vote in favor of this Amendment and in favor of \n     the consumer protections this Amendment promotes. By leveling \n     the playing field between national banks and local lenders, \n     you will send a strong signal to Main Street that their \n     interests count. We urge adoption of this modest, yet \n     tremendously helpful amendment.\n       Please direct questions to Maureen Thompson.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   Americans for Financial Reform.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I know the membership of this \norganization that supports the amendment includes AARP, as I mentioned, \nthat also supported it individually, the Center for Responsible \nLending, Common Cause, Consumers Union, the NAACP, the National \nAssociation of Investment Professionals, the National Council of La \nRaza, and the Veterans Chamber of Commerce, in addition to a great \nnumber of other organizations.\n  This is an important amendment. It closes a loophole that was opened \nby the Supreme Court decision of 30 years ago, the decision to define \nthe term ``located'' in the National Banking Act from way back in the \nCivil War era, 1863, as meaning the location where the bank is located, \nnot the location where the consumer is located, so that when there is a \nbank in one State doing business with a consumer in another State, the \nlaws of the bank's State govern.\n  There is nothing particularly wrong with that decision. The problem \nis that the banks figured out that they could go to States that had the \nworst consumer protections or go to States that would be willing to \nchuck their consumer protections in return for the influx of business. \nFrom those States which have the worst consumer protection laws, they \ncould then market their products around to other States and undercut \nand dodge around the laws of Rhode Island, the laws of Minnesota, the \nlaws of Connecticut, the laws of Iowa, the laws of Virginia--the laws \nof all the States that for more than 200 years, in the history of our \nRepublic, had this authority to regulate interest and to protect our \nconsumers.\n  This is an unintentional loophole. It has created grievous abuse of \nconsumers who for the first time in the history of America are paying \n30-plus interest rates under the law. When you and I were growing up, \nMr. President, if a flier came in the mail that offered a credit card \nwith a 30-percent interest rate, that would probably be a matter to \nbring to the attention of the authorities because it would be illegal. \nNow they market this stuff at will, and too many Americans, too many of \nour State residents, too many consumers are paying exorbitant and what \nwould in that State be illegal interest rates because of that loophole. \nIt is long past time to change it. This amendment would close it.\n  I urge the support of my colleagues, and I look forward to the chance \nto call up this amendment.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3812\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about an \namendment I have filed along with Senators Schumer and Sanders, \namendment No. 3812. The purpose of the amendment is very simple: to \nprotect consumers from being charged unfair and unreasonable fees by \nATM machines.\n  How often have you gone to an ATM machine to access your own cash \nfrom your own credit union or your own bank and they charge you a \ncouple bucks, $2.50, $2.25, $3, $4? We have seen as high as $5 in parts \nof the country. I wish to talk about that issue, how unfair it is.\n  In recent years, Congress has acted to protect consumers by setting \nappropriate limits on the types of fees that financial institutions can \ncharge consumers in areas such as credit cards, and spurred by a good \nproposal by Chairman Dodd, the Federal Reserve is now considering rules \nregarding overdraft fees. One area that remains unregulated is the fees \nconsumers pay to use ATMs.\n\n  Right now there is no limit that the operator of an ATM can charge a \nconsumer for using that machine. Currently, the only regulation in this \narea--clearly insufficient, I might add--is that the operator must \ndisclose how much they will charge. So when you access an ATM it has to \ntell you how much they are charging you and you can then refuse to do \nthat, if you want. But this nominal disclosure requirement does nothing \nto ensure the charges are not arbitrary ways for banks and third-party \nowners of these machines to make an unreasonable sum on the backs of \nconsumers.\n  Some of my colleagues may remember that until 1996, most processing \nnetworks actually prohibited the operators of ATMs from adding an \nadditional surcharge for the use of the ATMs. Instead, to cover the \ncost of the transactions, banks paid fees that passed between the \nconsumers' banks, the ATM operating bank, and the card network. That \nfee of about 50 cents still changes hands today to cover the cost of \nprocessing. Simply put: By charging consumers these fees while \ncollecting fees from other banks, these big banks are double-dipping on \nthe backs of consumers. My amendment would end that double-dipping.\n  Enticed by the prospect of easy money, in 1996 the rules that \nprevented banks from charging consumers were overturned by the big card \nnetworks--Visa, Mastercard, and the big banks. For this reason, in, \n1997, I was a cosponsor, along with Chairman Dodd and others, of a \nmeasure introduced by then-Banking Committee Chairman D'Amato that \nwould have required the card networks to restore these rules and charge \nnothing for ATMs. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in that effort. \nBut it was bipartisan. Chairman D'Amato was a Republican.\n  As a result, because we were unsuccessful in 1997, the amount of fees \nthat consumers pay has skyrocketed. According to estimates by the \nFederal Reserve, the average surcharge fee paid by consumers for \naccessing their own money is $2.66. As I said, in some cases--in \nairports and other places--it is as much as $5 for gaining access to \nyour own money.\n  That doesn't seem right to me, and it doesn't seem right to a lot of \nconsumers. It is unfair for people to pay that much to access their own \ncash. If ATM operators want to charge a fee to cover the cost of \nproviding a service, I can understand that. But that fee needs to \nrelate to what it actually costs to process the transaction, not just \nthe maximum they think they can get away with.\n  To ensure these fees are reasonable and related to the costs of \nprocessing the transaction, my amendment would require the new Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau to ensure that fees charged consumers at \nATMs bear a reasonable relation to the cost of processing the \ntransaction.\n  The best data available suggests that the cost of processing a \ntransaction today--ready for this--is 36 cents. Think about that the \nnext time you go to the ATM and you have to get some cash and it comes \nup and says they are charging $2.50. The real cost of that is\n\n[[Page S3151]]\n\nabout 36 cents. Where does the rest of the money go? The rest of the \nmoney goes to the big banks and the big card networks, and they are \nmaking a fortune.\n  We got that data from a survey conducted by the Office of Thrift \nSupervision, which suggested in 1997--the time we had our amendment--\nthat the cost of processing a transaction was only 27 cents. So we \nfactored in inflation, and that would bring the cost to about 36 cents \ntoday, and that assumes any improvements in technology have not brought \ndown costs, which, obviously, they have. We have new technologies, \nfaster speed networks, which probably has brought the cost down. So \nwhen I say the cost of going to an ATM machine to access money is 36 \ncents, that is on the high side.\n  So what our amendment basically says is that they can set up a \nreasonable charge based upon what the costs are, but we put an upper \nlimit. We say no more than 50 cents per transaction. So our amendment \nwould basically say anytime you go to your ATM machine they have to \ncharge you a reasonable fee based upon what would be set, but in no \ncase more than 50 cents, in no case more than 50 cents.\n  Again, I would just point out that until 2002, in my State of Iowa, \nthe law required any bank establishing an ATM had to make that \navailable at no cost--no fee to all users. So Iowa did not charge any \nfees at all, and Iowa banks did just fine under this agreement. Iowa \nconsumers were protected from unfair fees.\n  But in 2002, this reasonable Iowa law was preempted by Federal \nbanking regulators. Federal banking regulators preempted this. Again, \nin the absence of these laws, the Federal banking regulators have taken \nno action to limit the amount of fees consumers can be charged. \nAccording to the New Rules Project, national banks--these big banks--\ncollected almost $5 million in ATM fees from Iowa consumers in the \nfirst 6 months after the Iowa law was overturned. Iowa credit unions \ndata said it was about $10 million just in the first year. Well, add \nthat up, and that can come to a lot of money.\n  Anyway, I bring this example of how things were in Iowa before 2002 \nbecause it is the kind of balance that the bill pending before us \nshould restore. Quite frankly, things have tipped so far in favor of \nbig banks in this country, and so far away from consumers, that we \noften don't even know what a reasonable balance looks like anymore. But \nthe example of Iowa from several years ago in which consumers were \nprotected from unfair ATM fees while banks still profited, is an \nexample--I think an excellent example--of the balance we need to return \nto.\n  So this broader bill that Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby have \nbrought forward isn't antibusiness or antibank, but it does seek to \nreturn us to a situation in which the needs of consumers and the rights \nof businesses are considered alongside one another. It restores some \nbalance for consumers in our society.\n  When I looked at this bill, I thought: Well, there is one area that \nkind of seems to be getting overlooked. I suppose a lot of people might \nsay: Well, $2 is not much. Well, here is the other unfair thing about \nit. The average person going to an ATM machine probably takes out $20, \n$50 to get them through a day or 3 or 4 days in the week, and they are \ncharged $2.50 for accessing that $20 or $50. Someone else goes in and \nwants to get $500, and they are charged the same $2.50. So the burden \nfalls more heavily on low-income people, moderate-income people who \nneed to use the ATM machines to get some cash to get them through. That \nis grossly unfair.\n  It is unfair that the banks and the ATM operators can charge whatever \nthey want to charge. As I pointed out earlier, according to the Office \nof Thrift Supervision and the data they collected, the average cost of \nprocessing this ATM transaction is only 36 cents. Why are you being \ncharged $2.50 or $3 or as much as $5? Well, that is what this amendment \nseeks to stop; again, to get this balance back where it should be.\n  My amendment is also supported by the U.S. Public Interest Research \nGroup, the Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Action, Consumers \nUnion, and the National Consumer Law Center on behalf of its low-income \nclients.\n  I close by thanking my colleague, Senator Dodd, for his tireless work \nto move this critical bill forward and to again help establish that \nbalance in our country between our consumers, our depositors, our \ncommunity banks, and the big banks. As I said, we have gotten so far \noff track we hardly recognize what a balance is any longer. I think \nthis bill does a great thing in trying to restore that balance. I just \nwant to make sure that consumers are no longer taken advantage of by \nthese unfair ATM fees that are out there, and that is why I will be \noffering this amendment at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. President, I see the chairman is here.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure.\n  Mr. DODD. I just want to thank him for all his work. We have spent a \nlot of time in the last year or so on the health care debate, where we \nsat next to each other day after day going through all of that. We, \nobviously, go back a lot longer than that.\n  The Senator from Iowa and I arrived here on the very same day. The \npages have oftentimes asked me when did I get here, and I have said: \nThomas Jefferson was President when I arrived.\n  It wasn't quite that long ago, but we arrived together on the same \nday, 35 years ago, in the House of Representatives, and we have been \ngreat friends and colleagues.\n  No one cares more about not only his State but people all across this \ncountry who struggle. He is the author of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, affecting millions of Americans, and I have a family \nmember who benefitted from Senator Harkin's work. I wish there had been \nsomeone around in the 1930s when she was born who might have stood up \nand recognized her talents and ability. Fortunately, she grew up in a \nfamily where they did some things and she ended up helping restore the \nAmerican Montessori system of teaching as an early childhood \ndevelopment specialist. But had she been born under different \ncircumstances, I suspect she would have been doing piecemeal work \nsomewhere.\n  So there is a lot for which our country has to thank the Senator from \nIowa. I appreciate his efforts on this amendment and thank him for his \ngeneral concerns on the bill as well.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Connecticut. Every time I see my \ngood friend here, I think of all the work that he did in getting our \nhealth care bill through, and now this. Talk about going out on a high \nnote. I am sorry, as he knows, that he is not going to be here after \nthis year.\n  Again, I think the fact that Senator Dodd did the health care bill \nand got it through was a great achievement for the people of this \ncountry and now this financial reform, to make sure we don't go through \nwhat we did a few years ago again and to help our consumers have a \nlittle better balance in their dealings with the big banks and the big \ninvestment houses. This is a great bill, and I compliment him for it.\n  I know it has been a long tough slog, as they say, but future \ngenerations will look back and thank Senator Dodd both for the health \ncare bill, and I think for this financial reform bill. A lot of people \nmay not understand all the intricacies of it--the high finance and all \nthat stuff. Sometimes you can get a little dizzy thinking about all \nthis stuff. But he understands it. He gets it. And Senator Dodd has \ndone a magnificent job in putting this bill together. It is going to \nhelp protect our consumers in this country.\n  So that is why I am proud to support it. I hope he doesn't mind if I \noffer an amendment to it, as I am going to do on the ATM piece. But I \nthank the Senator, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ntalk about the bill before us. I commend my colleague, the chairman of \nthe Senate Banking Committee, Senator Dodd, for his leadership on this \ncrucial reform.\n  I want to start off by reiterating what I know many of my colleagues\n\n[[Page S3152]]\n\nhave said, that this is a strong bill and it is a necessary bill. There \nis no doubt that we need Wall Street reform and we need it now. When \ntens of millions of Americans have lost their jobs, homes, and savings, \nAmericans cannot wait any longer to end the reckless Wall Street \npractices that caused those problems.\n  I certainly never want to see us again be in a position where we had \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve come to us, about a year and a half \nago, and say to members of the Senate Banking Committee, you need to \nact because financial institutions are on the verge of collapse and \ntheir collapse would create a consequence to the national economy of \nenormous proportions.\n  I will never forget the dialog that took place there, in essence when \nChairman Bernanke was asked, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, what \nhappened? Don't you have enough time, some tools at the Federal Reserve \nto get us through this period of time? He basically said, if you don't \nact you will have a global meltdown which basically means a new \ndepression in the 21st century. Certainly a depression in the 21st \ncentury is much different than the depression this country lived \nthrough under President Roosevelt.\n  Since he is someone whose expertise is in Depression era economics, \nhow we got into the Depression, what made it worse, how we got out of \nit, it was a pretty compelling set of arguments.\n  So here we are. What we want to do is make sure we are never put at \nthat risk again; that there is not anything that is too big to fail \nbecause, in doing so, you can make all the wrong decisions knowing that \neven when you make the wrong decisions, and they are risky, the \ntaxpayers will have to bail you out because we cannot have the \ncountry's whole economy go under. At the same time, we want to try to \nstrengthen our regulatory process so we not only not face that reality \nbut we create clear rules of the road.\n  I am for a free market. I believe in a free market. But there is a \ndifference between a free market and a free-for-all market. There is a \ndifference between when someone takes their own capital, whether as a \ncompany or as an individual, and makes an investment and when the \ninvestment does good, good for them; but when the investment goes bad \nwe all have to pay for it. We cannot have a system where profits are \nprivatized but losses become the general public's responsibility. That \nis, in essence, the core of what we are trying to do here--to make sure \nthat such a system, which is what we have had, not a free market but a \nfree-for-all market, gets changed so we never face that again.\n  As I said, I think this is an incredibly strong bill. But even a \nstrong bill can have suggestions to make a good bill even stronger. I \ncommend Chairman Dodd for being open to ideas to make this bill even \nstronger, regardless of which side of the aisle they come from. Now \nthat we have broken the Republican logjam that has been holding this \nbill up for over a week, I hope we can get to the business of fully \nlegislating in a full and open debate. I know that is what the American \npeople want and expect, that the Senators they sent to Washington \nactually get to work on the business of fixing these problems; not that \nthey sit on their hands while one party holds up debate because the \nbill didn't do everything they wanted it to or because we had \nconversations--some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhad conversations with Wall Street and basically they don't like a lot \nof what we are doing here. But, in fact, it is critical to the Nation's \neconomic security.\n  I am glad to see that we have colleagues now on the train. I hope \npeople do not try to pull the emergency brake switch to try to stop us \nfrom going to where we need to go.\n  I think this is a great bill but there are some amendments I plan to \noffer to the bill. I think they make the bill even stronger. I have \nfiled an open books amendment, to require companies to be more \ntransparent in their financial reporting. Many experts believe one of \nthe reasons we got into this mess in the first place was because no \none--not investors, not regulators, not counterparties, not even the \npeople running the companies--could actually figure out the true value \nof these big Wall Street banks. That is because banks hid a significant \npercentage of their liabilities, their risks, off their balance sheets. \nFor example, Lehman Brothers treated $50 billion in repurchase \nagreement transactions as sales instead of financing transactions on \ntheir balance sheets, misleading everyone about the state of Lehman's \nfinances.\n  The bottom line, you know, may sound very technical but if I can take \nmy liabilities off of my personal balance sheet and put them somewhere \nelse and look as though I am better off than I am, that is \nfundamentally wrong. Clearly, had there been more transparency we might \nhave dealt with the Lehman situation sooner, thus reducing the \nrepercussions of a catastrophic bankruptcy.\n  The amendment I am proposing is simple. It requires companies that \nare designated as systemically risky to disclose all their off-balance \nsheet activities in their annual 10-K report to the Securities and \nExchange Commission, and provide detailed justifications for why they \nare keeping those liabilities off their balance sheets.\n  It also requires disclosure of daily average leverage ratios in \nquarterly reports. This will prevent companies from moving liabilities \noff their balance sheets only days before when they are reporting \nearnings, as Lehman and others allegedly did.\n  It is a step toward transparency. We know capital markets work best \nwhen they are transparent. That is the thrust of what this bill is \ntrying to do. Put simply, the largest banks should not be able to \ndeceive regulators, investors, counterparties, and the public, by \nhiding their liabilities in off-balance vehicles. We need transparency \nand clarity, not trickery and deception.\n  I also am happy to join with Senator Akaka, who is leading on this \nparticular amendment but I am his prime cosponsor, to require \nstockbrokers to act in the best interests of their clients. What a \nrevolutionary concept, that stockbrokers act in the best interests of \ntheir clients. Brokers are not required to act in the best interests of \ntheir clients and can sell clients worse investments because they make \nmore money on them, without the client ever knowing it. Brokers are \nonly required to have reasonable grounds to believe that a property \nthey are recommending is suitable for the customer, even if it is not \nthe best product for the customer. Typically, brokers do not have to \nmake disclosures about conflicts of interest or past infractions. In \ncontrast, investment advisers are legally and ethically bound to put a \nclient's interest ahead of their own--in essence to have a fiduciary \nduty; and to fully disclose those conflicts they may have.\n  All brokers currently have exactly the same conflict of interest that \nGoldman Sachs had in its civil fraud case by the Securities and \nExchange Commission: financial incentives to steer clients toward bad \ninvestment products that brokers made more money on.\n  But retail investors are confused. They commonly think the services \nthat investment advisers and brokers provide are nearly identical. An \nSEC Commission study in 2008 by the RAND Corporation found that \ninvestors were confused about the differences. So I don't think we need \nfurther studies. Senator Akaka's amendment and mine would end the \nconfusion. It would require brokers to act in the best interests of \ntheir clients, just as investment advisers already do. It requires \nbrokers to disclose conflicts of interest, so brokers would have to \ntell retail clients if they get more fees for selling a particular \nmutual fund or annuity product.\n  It gives the FTC discretion to apply a fiduciary duty standard for \nall types of investors which would include institutional investors who \nare victimized by the allegations in the Goldman Sachs case. Investment \nadvice should be transparent. If there are conflicts of interest or \nhigher fees for a particular product, investors should know about it. \nInvestors need to know that brokers have a duty to act in their best \ninterest.\n  I also have an amendment to expand the opportunities for women and \nminorities in banking. Currently, the staff of financial regulatory \nagencies lags in diversity. According to the Office of Personnel \nManagement, minorities comprise only 18.7 percent of financial \ninstitution examiners; women comprise 34 percent.\n\n[[Page S3153]]\n\n  A recent GAO report found that among minority banks, only about one-\nthird thought their regulators were doing a good or very good job of \nmaking an effort to protect or promote their interests and less than a \nthird of minority-owned institutions have utilized services offered by \nthe regulators in the last 3 years.\n  Only 5.7 percent of African-American firms and 5.6 percent of \nHispanic firms obtained bank loans to start their businesses, compared \nto 12 percent of nonminority firms.\n  The amendment I am proposing would rectify this by creating the \nOffices of Minority and Women Advancement at all the major financial \nregulatory agencies. Those offices would be responsible for all matters \nof diversity, including diversity in agency employment and contracts. \nOffice directors would provide annual reports to Congress on diversity \nissues, with recommendations for improvements.\n  The amendment would also require publicly traded companies to provide \nin annual SEC filings ``diversity report cards'' which would break down \nby gender and race the percentages of officers and employees who are \nminorities and women and the percentage of total compensation they \nreceive.\n  Finally, it extends the minority banking requirements under section \n308 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act \nto the Federal Reserve and the OCC. A similar amendment has already \npassed the House of Representatives unanimously. I would certainly hope \nwe could do the same here.\n  Diversity within the Federal banking agencies will help ensure \ndifferent perspectives are being brought to bear on issues and enhances \nthe likelihood these solutions will be comprehensive and inclusive of a \nbroad range of views. It will make our banking system fairer, more \nstable, and more just.\n  I also have an amendment with Senator Merkley, to prohibit corporate \nexecutives and highly paid employees from hedging against any decrease \nin the market value of their employer's stock. This amendment is one \nthat I think is very important because I am concerned there are a lot \nof bad incentives undermining the goals of executive compensation.\n  A recent study found that at least 2,000 cases at 911 firms over an \n11-year period in which executives tried to profit by betting against \ntheir own company--by betting against their own company. Hedging \nundermines, in my mind, the whole point of incentive compensation to \nmake sure that executives only benefit when the company does well.\n  If they can hedge their stock, then it does not matter how well the \ncompany does, because either way the executive makes money. Tails they \nwin, heads they win. That simply is fundamentally wrong. Worse, it may, \nin some cases, give executives an incentive to sort of ``throw the \ngame,'' to use their privileged position to take a position that may \nvery well not be in the company and its employees' best interests and \nthen make a killing by selling the company stock short. Not good for \nthe company, not good for the employee, not good for investors. My \namendment would place a ban on stock hedging by executives and highly \npaid company employees, namely those making more than $1 million per \nyear, preventing them from betting against their own company.\n  Put simply: Executives and highly compensated employees should never \nhave financial incentives to act against the best interests of their \nvery own company.\n  I am hoping some of these may very well be able to see their way into \na managers' package. I hope we do not have to come to the floor to \noffer all of them.\n  The recession has hit everyone. Community Development Financial \nInstitutions have been hit hard, especially hard. They are in a tough \nposition because they have got to rely on the big banks for capital, \nwhich is neither affordable nor easily accessible.\n  My amendment would authorize the Treasury Department to guarantee \nbonds issued by qualified Community Development Financial Institutions \nfor the purpose of community and economic development loans. There is \nalso no cost to the taxpayers to do this. CDFIs have a track record of \njob creation and community development. They are the most effective way \nto infuse capital in low-income communities because the capital goes \ndirectly into those communities and economic development efforts.\n  In focusing on the finances of Wall Street, I think this is an \nopportunity not to forget about the finances of Main Street, where most \nof the jobs are and the devastating impact that Wall Street's actions \nhave had on Main Street.\n  Lastly, I wish to talk about whistleblower protections. They are the \nfirst and most effective line of defense against corporate fraud and \nother misconduct, yet because of inadequate protections against \nretaliation, would-be corporate whistleblowers often keep quiet when \nthey could be protecting the public from illegal activity.\n  As we have seen in the emerging Lehman Brothers scandal, a \nwhistleblower who tried to alert management to illegal accounting \ntricks was fired. Though the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 did much to \nexpand protection of corporate whistleblowers from retaliation, it \nlacks several modern whistleblower protections that have been standard \nin every piece of legislation since 2006.\n  My amendment updates Sarbanes-Oxley protections against retaliation \nby giving whistleblowers 180 days to file a claim instead of the 90 \nthat exists right now; giving whistleblowers their day in court with a \nclearer right to a jury trial; clarifying that whistleblowers are \nentitled to compensatory damages; strengthening due process rights for \nwhistleblowers by eliminating inconsistencies in current law; \npreventing employers from gagging whistleblowers by holding them to \ncontractual obligations; ensuring that whistleblowers will be protected \nfor all disclosures of material misconduct.\n  We think those opportunities strengthen a citizen to be able to \nengage and to come forth in a way that protects the company, that \nprotects the investors, that protects all of us in the economy at \nlarge. So, again, I want to commend Chairman Dodd for his leadership in \nthis effort. It has been a pleasure, as a member of the Banking \nCommittee, working with him on some of the underlying provisions that \nhe has already included in the bill that makes it so strong.\n  I stand ready to work together to address these remaining issues, \nsome of which I hope we can work through and get accepted, others \nwhich, if necessary, I am ready to come to the floor and seek to offer.\n  At the end of the day, I want a bill that puts New Jerseyans in a \nposition, and all Americans, in which they will never be asked to reach \ninto their pockets to take care of the excessive decisions of companies \nthat privatized the profit but then said, when it went bad and the \ngamble did not go well, that all of us should pay. We cannot have that. \nThat is what the core of this bill does. That is why I have been proud \nto work with the chairman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before our colleague from New Jersey leaves, \nlet me thank him. He is a member of our Banking Committee, and a very \nvaluable member. He has been tremendously helpful as we have worked \ntogether, through my 37 or 38 months as chairman of the committee, very \nclosely on the housing issues, on the credit card legislation.\n  There have been some 42 measures that have come through the Banking \nCommittee in the last 38 months, 37 of which have become the law of the \nland. That is a pretty good record out of our committee. It reflects \nthe tremendous effort of members of that committee to help pull \ntogether sound pieces of legislation.\n  Senator Menendez has been critical in so many of those efforts. I \nwant to thank him for that and I want to thank him for his ideas on \nthis bill. We are hoping we get many of these amendments up and have a \nchance to debate them. But I thank him for his contribution already.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3749\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Hutchison-\nTester amendment. This is an amendment that truly will help community \nbanks. It will level the playing field for them. It is something I have \nbeen working on\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\nfor several months, during all the consideration this bill has gone \nthrough in committee. This was one of the first things I wanted to \nattack.\n  I am pleased we are going to get a vote very soon on this amendment, \neither a voice vote or a record vote. I know that with the bipartisan \nsupport we have, we will pass this amendment.\n  I thank the cosponsors of the amendment: Senators Conrad, Murray, \nBurris, Brown of Massachusetts, Harkin, Shaheen, Cornyn, Johanns, \nNelson of Florida, and Nelson of Nebraska, as well as, of course, \nSenator Tester and myself.\n  We are trying to level the playing field for community banks. The \nunderlying bill sets a way of assessing the banks by the FDIC. There \nhas been flexibility in the past, but we are going to set in statute \nwith this amendment that banks will be assessed based on assets minus \ncapital. That should be the way to assess.\n  Community banks, with less than $10 billion in assets, rely heavily \non customer deposits for funding. But that penalizes these very safe \ninstitutions with these customer deposits by forcing them to pay \ndeposit insurance premiums far beyond the risk they would pose to the \nbank system. Despite making up just 20 percent of the Nation's assets, \nthese community banks contribute 30 percent of the premiums to the \nFDIC. At the same time, large banks hold 80 percent of the banking \nindustry's assets but pay only 70 percent of the premiums. There is no \nreason for community banks to have to make up this gap.\n  What we need is a level playing field. It is the community banks that \nare loaning to our businesses. It is community banks that are keeping \nour communities supported in so many ways, from the football programs, \nto the scoreboards in stadiums, to making sure small businesses have \ninventory loans. Community banks didn't cause the problems. To have \nthem pay more proportionately in FDIC insurance than the big banks do \nis unfair.\n  Senator Tester and I want to correct this inequity. That is exactly \nwhat the Hutchison-Tester amendment does.\n  I appreciate very much Senator Dodd saying he agrees with us, that he \nwill work with us to pass this amendment. I am pleased we have such \nbipartisan support. It will immensely improve the bill and give \ncommunity banks one of the pieces they need to stay in business and \nhopefully free them to provide more liquidity to the businesses in \ncommunities all across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Texas, a member of \nour committee, Senator Hutchison. There are a lot of amendments people \nwill offer that subtract or add provisions to the bill. Her amendment \nwith Senator Tester and others is a very important piece. This could be \na separate bill. It could be a freestanding idea. This would qualify as \nsuch an idea. Maybe it doesn't sound like much to people, but to \nconsider the liabilities, that really gives a far more accurate picture \nof the financial condition of a smaller bank. Therefore, the \nassessments make so much more sense if you have a fuller view of how \nthat institution is doing.\n  It is so painful, on Friday afternoons after 4 or 5 o'clock, every \nweek, 5 banks, 6 banks, 10 banks--I feel so bad when I hear the names--\na lot of them in small towns in our country, maybe small amounts, some \nof them a little larger--you think about a small town where there might \nbe one lending institution, maybe two but not much more than that--when \none closes its doors, what it means to a community to lose that lending \ninstitution where everybody knows everybody and you don't have to have \na computer printout to know whether Mrs. Hutchison or Mr. Dodd is going \nto be able to meet that obligation; they have known the family. They \nknow how it works, to be able to help them by reducing the burden \nfinancially on them.\n  At the same time, we need to keep up that insurance because you want \nto protect depositors. However badly you feel--and I do every week when \nI read the names of the smalltown banks that have to close their \ndoors--you want to make sure those customers can show up Monday morning \nand handle their finances. Shifting the burden a bit more to larger \ninstitutions that can afford to do so is a great idea.\n  As my colleague knows, I was prepared to accept it this afternoon. I \ndon't have the right to do that on my own. If I did, if I were king for \na moment, I would say: Let's accept the Hutchison-Tester amendment. I \nam confident we will.\n  I thank my colleague and Senator Tester for offering a very sound, \nvery worthwhile proposal that will be a help to community banks.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee. \nOf course, we could take over the world right now, since he and I are \nthe only ones on the floor.\n  Seriously, Mr. President, this is significant because I do believe \nthis bill is going to pass. We are working very productively to try to \nmake some changes in the bill that will make it much better for \ncommunity banks.\n  As the chairman knows, the FDIC has decided to prefund its deposit \ninsurance fund for the next 3 years by the end of this year. If we \nchange this formula and ensure community banks will not carry the \nheavier burden, that is going to have an impact this year in the \nliquidity of those banks and their capability to lend.\n  I appreciate very much the chairman's support. I look forward to \nhaving our amendment either voice voted or a record vote. I think we \nwill win overwhelmingly with the support of the chairman and ranking \nmember.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week we began debate on Senator Dodd's \nWall Street reform legislation. This is the culmination of a lengthy \ndialogue on how best to rein in Wall Street's excesses, and bring about \na new era of corporate responsibility. I have pushed, and will continue \nto push, for reform that preserves the role of the antitrust laws as a \ntool to keep Wall Street honest and promote competition in the \nfinancial industry.\n  The recent economic crisis showed all of us that corporations do not \nact responsibly without adequate oversight. As we work to pass this \nlandmark legislation, it is important to remember that, today, there is \nanother industry that is not required to even play by the same rules of \ncompetition as everyone else. Benefiting from a six-decade-old special \ninterest exemption, the health insurance industry is not subject to the \nNation's antitrust laws. We can surely agree that health insurers \nshould not be allowed to collude to fix prices and allocate markets.\n  Large corporate interests impact the daily lives of hardworking \nAmericans and must be regulated. When any large corporation acts \nirresponsibly, whether it is a financial institution or a health \ninsurance company, Americans pay the price. Today I filed the Health \nInsurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act as an amendment to the \nWall Street reform bill. This amendment, which is cosponsored by 21 \nother Senators, will repeal the health insurers' antitrust exemption \nand ensure that they follow basic rules of fair competition. \nCompetition ensures that consumers will pay lower prices and receive \nmore choices.\n  Congress and the President have recently enacted comprehensive health \ninsurance reform. It was clear from that debate, and from the Judiciary \nCommittee's hearing on this issue in October, that the time to repeal \nthe health insurers' antitrust exemption is now. The language I am \noffering today passed overwhelmingly in the House, and it is supported \nby the President. It has received a cross-section of support from \ngroups such as the Consumer Federation of America, the Consumers Union, \nand the American Antitrust Institute. This repeal will ensure that \nbasic rules of fair competition apply to those reforms included in the \nnew health insurance reform laws.\n  Last fall, I introduced similar legislation to repeal the health \ninsurers' antitrust exemption. The Judiciary Committee hearing I \nchaired examined the merits of this repeal. The lack of affordable \nhealth insurance plagues families throughout our country, and this \namendment is an important step towards ensuring that health insurers \nare subject to the laws of fair competition.\n  Today, I renew my call for the Senate to take up and pass this \namendment to repeal the antitrust exemption for health insurance \ncompanies. I hope all Senators will join me in support.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dodd). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I would like to talk a little further \nabout the problems with credit rating agencies. Yesterday, I filed an \namendment to the Wall Street reform bill that would create a Credit \nRating Agency Board and help encourage competition and, most \nimportantly, accuracy in the credit rating system.\n  The major role the credit rating agencies played in the recent \nfinancial crisis has been largely overlooked. Most of the blame has \nbeen directed at Wall Street's oversized banks and the investment firms \nthat were securitizing any kind of debt they could get their hands on. \nUltimately, these firms got their hands on quite a lot, and one of \ntheir favorite products became mortgage-backed securities.\n  Investment banks and hedge funds realized there was a lot of money to \nbe made--there is about $9 trillion worth of mortgage-backed securities \nin the market right now. So they securitized every mortgage they could \nfind, and once this happened, this source of easy profits dried up. So \nWall Street demanded more, and mortgage lenders all too happily lowered \ntheir lending standards and delivered a new fleet of subprime mortgages \nfor Wall Street to securitize.\n  As we all know, subprime mortgages are riskier than regular \nmortgages. That is why they are called subprime. Borrowers are more \nlikely to default. Yet when these risky mortgages were packaged, firms \nwere able to sell them easily.\n  One of their biggest selling points? Well, they came with a nice big \n``AAA'' stamped on them--three letters that say: This product is safe. \nThis product belongs as part of a pension fund, a retirement account or \nan educational endowment.\n  So that is where many of these risky subprime mortgage-backed \nsecurities ended up. When they failed, they ended up costing working \nAmericans billions and billions of dollars in losses to their savings. \nBut much of this could have been prevented, if only the ratings for \nthese exotic securities had reflected their true risk.\n  We need to reform the way credit rating agencies do business. Right \nnow, there is nothing to compel them to produce ratings that reflect a \nproduct's real risk. Quite the contrary, they are incentivized to \nprovide highly inflated ratings so they can keep getting repeat \nbusiness.\n  That is why I have filed an amendment to change the incentives in the \nindustry. My amendment, No. 3808, which I have crafted with Senators \nSchumer and Nelson, would finally encourage competition and accuracy in \nan industry that has little of either.\n  To stop the jockeying by raters to get repeat business, my amendment \nwould create a clearinghouse--a clearinghouse--to assign a rating \nagency to a product issuer for the purpose of an initial rating. The \nclearinghouse--which will be a self-regulatory organization called the \nCredit Rating Agency Board--will set up its own rules on how this \nassignment will work. It could be random, it could be formula based, \njust as long as the issuer does not choose which agency rates its \nproduct. This will eliminate the incentive for the rater to give an \ninflated rating in the hopes of getting that repeat business.\n  The Credit Rating Agency Board would be comprised of industry \nexperts: investors, issuers, raters, and, of course, independents. A \nmajority of its members would be investors, including institutional \ninvestors who have experience managing pension funds and university \nendowments. They would have a vested interest in accurate credit \nratings because they depend on them when making investments.\n  Another key element of my amendment is that the Board will regularly \nevaluate the performance of the credit rating agencies, and they would \nhave to take that performance into account in coming up with an \nassignment mechanism. In my mind, there is no better way to get \naccurate ratings than giving more initial rating jobs to the most \naccurate raters--and fewer jobs to those that repeatedly do a sloppy \njob.\n  Finally, the Board will be able to prevent raters from charging \nunreasonable fees. This will strike at the heart of sweetheart deals, \nin which a rater asks for more money for a better rating. Make no \nmistake, that is what has been happening. Just last week, Chairman \nLevin held a hearing in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. \nHis team revealed many e-mail exchanges between issuers and credit \nrating agencies that exposed how they did business.\n  Here is one e-mail from Moody's to Merrill Lynch, and I quote:\n\n       We have spent significant amount of resources on this deal \n     and it will be difficult for us to continue with this process \n     if we do not have an agreement on the fee issue. . . . We are \n     agreeing to this under the assumption that this will not be a \n     precedent for any future deals and that you work with us \n     further on this transaction to try to get to some middle \n     ground with respect to the ratings.\n\n  Does this sound like Moody's was objectively evaluating the value and \nrisk of Merrill's product? It doesn't sound like that to me.\n  I am confident the assignment process under my amendment will result \nin increased competition in the credit rating industry and provide \nincentives to produce accurate ratings. The amendment allows issuers to \ngo to whichever rating agency they choose for second or third ratings, \nbut these followup ratings will more likely be accurate because raters \nknow they will be compared to the initial rating. More accurate ratings \nwill mean safer products that end up in pension funds and in retirement \naccounts. Safer products mean more retirement security for working \nAmericans.\n  So, once again, this all boils down to security and stability in our \nfinancial system. The greed and recklessness driving Wall Street over \nthe past decade has wreaked havoc on our economy, and we need to take \nbold action to rein it in.\n  Ignoring the magnitude of this problem will only come back to haunt \nus. We simply can't let that happen. We must take action to \nfundamentally change the way the system works by putting accuracy first \nin these ratings.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me and Senators Schumer, Nelson, \nBrown, Whitehouse, and Murray in supporting this essential reform to \nrestore integrity to the credit rating agency system.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and I note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I had not intended to speak tonight, but \nhaving heard my friend, the Senator from Minnesota, speak about the \nproblems with the rating agencies, I thought I would rise to say that \nin very many respects the Senator from Minnesota is correct. It is my \nunderstanding that the underlying bill as yet has no provision \nwhatsoever dealing with the rating agencies. I think certainly if that \nremains, it will be a major flaw in the legislation.\n  I don't know the details of the amendment the Senator from Minnesota \nwas referring to, but I certainly welcome debate about the rating \nagencies to make sure they are accurate and to acknowledge so many \nmistakes that have been made by those agencies in the past. So I wish \nto commend the Senator for his debate about this issue.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I have a couple more points I wish to \nmake, and I don't have much more time. But I am happy to yield to the \nchairman.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, title IX of the bill--and I am not \nsuggesting you are going to love every dotted i and crossed t, but in \ntitle IX of our bill we do cover rating agencies. Again, this is a \ncomplex area, and there are different ideas about how to do this. But \nthe legitimate point made by the Senator from Minnesota about rating \nagencies is something we share, and in title IX we try to address ways \nin which we can get far more accountability out of these agencies.\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I appreciate that. I \nthink the Senator would also concede that there are many in this body \nand in this building who would make a case that the bill is far from \nadequate as regards to the rating agencies, and we will have debate \nabout that.\n  Mr. DODD. I accept that argument, but I would not accept the argument \nthere is nothing in the bill about rating agencies.\n  Mr. WICKER. I appreciate the Senator's statement. I hope we can \nstrengthen the bill in regards to rating agencies. I also hope we can \ndo this: We have an opportunity in some amendments later on in this \ndebate--perhaps next week or perhaps the week after--to address this \nquestion of the GSEs, Fannie and Freddie. I think almost everyone would \nacknowledge that much of the problem that was caused in 2007 and 2008 \nstemmed from the GSEs. There has been an effort on the part of Senator \nShelby and others over time to rein in and have some important \nregulations for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I would hope we could have \nan honest to goodness debate and include this very important aspect of \nfinancial reform in this legislation; otherwise, I think we haven't \ngotten to part of the problem.\n  Then, I would say also, we are going to have debate over the next few \ndays and perhaps weeks about this all-powerful consumer agency that \nwould be created. Certainly, we need to protect the consumers. But as I \nunderstand this legislation which we will be asked to consider and to \nvote on and have an opportunity to debate, it creates one of the most \nimportant--one of the most powerful, all-powerful individuals in the \nentire Federal Government; someone who would not even have to answer to \na board, as head of this all-powerful consumer protection agency. I \nthink the fact that we are hearing more from Main Street rising up in \ndismay saying the Main Street agencies didn't cause these problems--the \ncar dealers, the orthodontists who might finance payments over time, \nthe medium-sized banks and credit unions--they say: Mr. Senator, we are \nnot part of the problem. Why are we being penalized and brought into \nthe purview of this all-powerful Washington, DC, regulator?\n  I think the concerns of Main Street can be addressed by the Senate, \nand we can still pass a bill that will cover the abuses of Wall Street \nwhich, after all, is what we are after.\n  So I wanted to use the remarks of the Senator from Minnesota as a \nspringboard to begin to discuss a number of issues, including Freddie \nand Fannie, including dealing with too much power in the form of this \nregulator, as well as dealing with the issue which the Senator brought \nup of the rating agencies.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, just on my own time, again, I don't \nnecessarily expect agreement on everything, but I wanted to make the \npoint that 40 pages of our bill deals with rating agencies. This isn't \na page or two or a thought or two. There are sections that go in this \nbill from section 931 to 939, with subtitle C: Improvements on the \nregulation of credit rating agencies. Forty pages of this book deals \nspecifically with ways in which we try to get greater accountability \nand reform in the credit rating agencies--a very important issue, one \nthat obviously people have additional ideas about, and I accept that. \nThere might be ideas that even strengthen this; I don't claim \nperfection. But I want to make sure people have looked at the bill \nbefore they get up and suggest there is nothing in this bill about it. \nQuite the contrary, there is a very strong section on rating agencies.\n  So, again, people are entitled to their own opinions but not their \nown facts. With all due respect to my friend from Mississippi who has \nunfortunately left the floor, I wish to make the point to him that he \nmight not like what I have written--we have written--but there is very \nstrong language in here on getting that greater accountability out of \nour rating agencies.\n  With that, Mr. President, I notice at least one additional Member who \nperhaps is going to come over to be heard, so I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, \nMay 6, after the opening of the Senate, the time until 10 a.m. be for \ndebate with respect to the Tester-Hutchison amendment No. 3749, with \nthe time equally divided and controlled in the usual form; that at 10 \na.m., the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment, with no \namendment in order to the amendment prior to the vote; further, that \nthe Sanders amendment No. 3738 be the next Democratic amendment in \norder, and to clarify for the Record, the amendment would be called up \nupon disposition of the pending Shelby amendment No. 3826.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me say this, if I can, while we are \nwaiting to do the wrap-up here. We finished up on the series of votes \nsometime around 4 o'clock or 3:30 this afternoon. It is now 6:30. Other \nthan some statements made by Members regarding various amendments, the \npending amendment is the one offered by my colleague from Alabama \ndealing with the consumer protection part of the bill. I am anxious for \nus to debate that. I regret we didn't have any debate this afternoon.\n  I made the point that Members have amendments--and we have all been \naround--most people--long enough to know that with some 90 amendments, \nit is not going to mean every amendment people have will be offered. \nBut to the extent that time is used effectively, we can maximize the \nnumber of amendments that can be offered. Whether you agree with our \ncolleagues or not, they ought to be given the opportunity to offer an \namendment and to debate it and get a vote. Again, that doesn't mean \nevery amendment will be treated equally here, but I have been \ndetermined to try to make this work for as many Members as \npossible. But when 2 or 3 hours go by and not a word is spoken about a \npending amendment, the hour will come--and I can predict the debate: \nYou have not given us enough time to debate our amendments. I am \nkeeping score privately about the times that have gone vacant when no \none has talked on a pending amendment.\n\n  Tomorrow, after the disposition of the Tester-Hutchison, Hutchison-\nTester amendment, I will be asking at that time prior to that vote for \na time agreement on the pending amendment. My hope is it will be \nreasonable, take an hour or so to do that. I understand that. But I am \nnot going to tolerate a whole morning wasted on that with all these \nother amendments. We need to have that debate and then move along. I \nsay that respectfully.\n  We are not going to spend an endless number of days on this bill. \nThere are a lot of other matters to be considered by this body. This is \na very important bill, and it is important that we listen to the \nvarious ideas people want to offer to it.\n  I say this to my colleagues: Try to keep the time requests short. \nThis was a good beginning today, but I would have preferred we could \nhave used the last 2 or 3 hours to debate the pending amendment and \nthen schedule a vote in the morning. I believe 2 or 3 hours to debate \nan amendment ought to be adequate. I recognize that not every amendment \nis considered as important as others. Prioritizing the amendments is \nimportant.\n  Senator Bernie Sanders has an amendment that will come up afterward. \nI cannot speak for him, but I asked him. He said he might take an hour. \nThat is a reasonable request. He has an important amendment and wants \nto be heard on it. I hope Members will follow the Sanders example and \nbe respectful of others so we can get many amendments in.\n  My hope is that tomorrow evening we will be here later. We are going \nto be here Friday, I gather. I do not make those decisions, but I have \nbeen led by the leadership to believe we will be here Friday. If I had \nmy way, we would be here Saturday and Sunday to get the bill done. I \nwill be urging the leader to keep us here as long as necessary to have \na full debate on this bill. I am not sure I will succeed in those \nrequests, but I want to make them.\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\n  Given the complexity of this bill and the interest Members have, if \nwe utilize the time rather than sitting in quorum calls hour after \nhour--we will hear that bellowing that occurs: I never had a chance to \nbe heard on my amendment. Why didn't I have time to be heard? The \nanswer is going to be--I am keeping the record here--how much time I \nhave been sitting around waiting for someone to come debate an \namendment.\n  If I sound a little frustrated--it is a little too early in the \ndebate to get frustrated, but I wanted to express it in advance of the \nreal frustration that will come later on.\n  There will be no more votes this evening.\n  I see my colleague from Colorado is here. I am going to do the wrap-\nup and then allow my colleague to be heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3157-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I was saddened by the announcement of my \nfriend, Congressman David Obey of Wisconsin, that he will retire from \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. He has served with great distinction \nfor the people of his district in Wisconsin since April 1, 1969.\n  He was elected to succeed Melvin Laird, who had resigned from the \nHouse to serve as Secretary of Defense. David Obey was reelected to 17 \nsucceeding Congresses. In the House, he has chaired the Joint Economic \nCommittee and the Committee on Appropriations. David Obey has had a \ncareer of distinction in the Congress. He has been conscientious in the \ndischarge of his duties and responsibilities as a Congressman and he \nhas been a good friend of mine.\n  I will truly miss working with David Obey on the Appropriations \nCommittee. We dealt with some of the most contentious issues of our \ntime. I always respected him even though we sometimes had to disagree \non issues that were being considered by our committee.\n  He was a spirited and effective Member of Congress. I extend to him \nmy very good wishes for the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to join my great friend from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, in his sentiments about David Obey.\n  I have known Dave Obey for 36 years. He had already been in Congress \nabout 4 or 5 years when I got to meet Dave, when I arrived in 1975. He \nis a wonderful individual, with deep passions. He was the best ally you \never had if he was on your side, and he was a frightening opponent if \nhe was on the other side. Having been on both sides of an argument with \nDave Obey, believe me, I much prefer having him an ally on issues.\n  He is a notorious workhorse who showed up every day with his sleeves \nrolled up to fight for not only the little guy in his own district in \nWisconsin but for people all across the country. Working men and women \nnever had a better ally in the Congress of the United States than they \ndid in Dave Obey.\n  He did not spare any of his emotion or rhetoric when it came to the \ndefense of that working man and woman in our country during his more \nthan 40 years of service. He has great passion. Nothing he disliked \nmore than a bully, and nothing ignited his temper more than any \ninjustice.\n  He loved his State, his family, and enjoyed a great joke when we \nwould spend time with him in various committees and the marking up of \nbills. He and I worked together. We were involved, when in my earliest \ndays in the House I was a strong backer of Richard Bolling from \nMissouri to be majority leader back in 1976 I think it was.\n  Gillis Long of Louisiana and I were the comanagers of Richard \nBolling's campaign to become majority leader when Tip O'Neill was going \nto become Speaker and there was a contest over the majority leader's \nrace.\n  The other great ally in that effort was Dave Obey of Wisconsin. That \nis when I first got to know Dave, in that battle for the majority \nleader. We lost that battle. Dick Bolling did not make it. Jim Wright \nbecame the majority leader in a very close contest, in fact, with Phil \nBurton of California. It was a 1-vote margin that determined the \nmajority leader's race.\n  Richard Bolling dropped out after the second ballot, did not get \nenough votes. But Dave Obey and I and Gillis Long and a group of others \norganized to support Richard Bolling. That is when I got to know Dave. \nI was with him about a couple of weeks ago. Rosa DeLauro, the \nCongresswoman from the New Haven district in Connecticut, my former \ncampaign manager, chief of staff for 7 years, was only the second woman \nto be the Chief of Staff of a Senator of the United States. She served \nwith me for 7 years and went on to become a Member of Congress for the \nlast 20 years herself.\n  Rosa sits on the Appropriations Committee and chairs the Agriculture \nSubcommittee. Dave Obey was at that event for Congresswoman DeLauro and \ngave some wonderful remarks on behalf of her that evening.\n  I join Thad Cochran in wishing Dave the very best. He served his \nState, his district, and his country with distinction and great \npatriotism. We wish him the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3157-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3157-S3158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 JUSTICE FOR NEVADA'S COLD WAR VETERANS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge an important \nachievement for Nevada's Cold War veterans and their families. These \nindividuals served their country at the Nevada Test Site, where over \none thousand nuclear weapons detonations took place over four decades \nof nuclear testing. The work at the Nevada Test Site, NTS, helped \nAmerica win the Cold War, but it also left thousands of workers with \ndebilitating cancers. Beginning today, many of these workers will now \nbe eligible for automatic compensation, putting an end to years of \nbureaucratic nightmares and redtape.\n  On February 19, 1952, the Nevada Test Site was created to serve as \nthe Nation's nuclear test site. 174 atmospheric and underground tests \nwere performed there before the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 banned \nall atmospheric, space, and sub-sea nuclear weapons testing. Another \n754 tests were completed before the United States established a \nmoratorium on nuclear weapons testing in 1992. The vast majority of \ntesting in this period took place underground, in a network of tunnels \nand shafts, although some nonweapons nuclear testing continued to take \nplace above ground. Even though these tunnels were designed to contain \nthe radiation produced by the tests, most of the underground \ndetonations did release radiation that reached NTS workers.\n  In 2000, after a number of my colleagues and I had begun to hear \ndisturbing stories from our constituents about illnesses they had \ngotten from their nuclear weapons work and their inability to get any \nfinancial compensation from the government, we introduced and passed \nthe Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act. This \nlegislation was designed to allow thousands of America's Cold War \nveterans who had worked for the Department of Energy to receive \ncompensation that would not only help pay their medical bills but would \nalso honor the sacrifices they and their families had made for their \ncountry.\n  Unfortunately, it soon became clear that even with this new law, it \nwould not be easy for many workers to get the compensation they \ndeserved. In 2005, I began to hear from workers and survivors \ncomplaining that they were being put through a seemingly endless stream \nof bureaucratic redtape only to be denied in the end. I heard stories \nabout workers who were encouraged to remove their radiation detection \ndevices so that they could continue to work even after reaching the \nmaximum allowable radiation levels, yet their records showed zero \nradiation exposures year after year. I was enraged that these workers \nwere denied compensation simply because their employer failed to keep \nan accurate account of how much radiation each worker was exposed to, \nso I embarked upon a three-pronged strategy to add\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\nNTS workers to the Special Exposure Cohort, SEC, making them eligible \nfor automatic compensation. I immediately wrote a letter to President \nBush asking for his administration to rectify this horrible wrong, and \nfor some NTS workers, the situation was set right the next year.\n  In 2006, employees who had worked at NTS for at least 250 days from \n1951 to 1962, or the atmospheric testing years, saw a tremendous \nvictory. They were designated as part of a new Special Exposure Cohort, \nSEC. However, the sacrifices of NTS workers from the years of \nunderground testing and their families went largely unacknowledged, \nuntil now. Thanks to the new SEC which goes into effect today, some \nmeasure of justice will be brought to these employees of NTS and their \nfamilies.\n  Unfortunately, this new SEC will not put an end to the years of \nwaiting for all NTS workers. Some won't be eligible for automatic \ncompensation because their cancer isn't on the official list or because \nthey worked less than 250 days, even if they were present for a large \nrelease of radiation. I will continue to fight to make sure each and \nevery one of Nevada's Cold War veterans and their families get the \ncompensation and justice they deserve for the enormous personal \nsacrifices they have made for their country. Still, I am very happy \nthat today an estimated 1,365 claimants may be eligible for automatic \ncompensation under the new SEC.\n  After submitting legislation to add the underground testing years to \nthe SEC in 2006, my office began the long and complicated process of \nworking with workers, survivors, and experts to submit an SEC petition. \nAfter much hard work, on February 5, 2007, I joined with three Nevadans \nin submitting an SEC petition arguing the scientific problems with the \nradiation dose reconstruction process that was denying so many NTS \nworkers and their families the compensation and recognition they \ndeserve. When the National Institute for Occupational Safety and \nHealth, NIOSH, initially recommended that the petition be denied, it \nwas the tireless work of more than a dozen individuals standing up for \nwhat is right that prevented the petition from being rejected \ncompletely. It was as a team that we persevered to gain approval for \nthe petition and, with this approval, justice for the underground \ntesting workers and their families.\n  Today's victory would not have happened without the dedicated team of \nNTS workers, their families, and others who fought for years to make \nthis day possible. I would like to take a moment to thank some of these \npeople.\n  First, I personally extend a heartfelt thank you to the three \npetitioners who devoted their time, energy, and testimony to bring this \nissue to the forefront. Thank you Lori Hunton, Paul Stednick, and Peter \nWhite. Lori's father, Oral Triplett worked at the Nevada Test Site and \npassed away when she was only 16. Paul worked at the site from 1966 to \n1994 as a laborer and labor foreman. Peter worked as a laborer, \npipefitter, and welder from 1985 to 1989. Each of these individuals \nprovided invaluable insight and support necessary to complete the \npetition process.\n  I also thank Navor Valdez, Gene Campbell, Mary Bess Holloway \nPeterson, William Cleghorn, Robert Lemons, Cooper Michael Boyd, \nPatricia Niemeier, and John Funk, for sharing their stories about what \nreally happened on the ground in Nevada.\n  No thank you would be complete without acknowledging Richard Miller, \nformerly of the Government Accountability Project, without whom this \npetition would never have been filed.\n  Finally, I send my heartfelt gratitude to all those who have worked \nat the Nevada Test Site and their families. I especially would like to \nacknowledge workers who passed away while fighting for benefits and \ntheir widows, widowers, and children surviving them who took up the \nfight for their loved one. Nevada's Cold War heroes have made \nimmeasurable contributions to our nation's security, and the sacrifices \nthey have made their health and their lives make it impossible for us \nto ever adequately thank them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3158-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BBG NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have my letter \nto Mr. McConnell, dated April 28, 2010, concerning BBG nominations \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 2009.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am requesting that I be consulted \n     before the Senate enters into any unanimous consent \n     agreements regarding Presidential nominees to the \n     Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). On April 13, 2010 the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations reported the following \n     nominations to the Senate: Walter Isaacson, of Louisiana, as \n     Chairman; Victor Ashe of Tennessee; Michael Lynton of \n     California; Susan McCue of Virginia; Dennis Mulhaupt of \n     California; and S. Enders Wimbush of Virginia.\n       Additionally, the Committee on Foreign Relations is still \n     considering the nominations of Dana Perino of the District of \n     Columbia, and Michael Meehan of Virginia to the Broadcasting \n     Board of Governors. I request that I be consulted before the \n     Senate enters into any unanimous consent agreements for these \n     two nominations as well.\n       I have had longstanding concerns regarding transparency and \n     effectiveness of our taxpayer funded international \n     broadcasting agencies under the purview of the Broadcasting \n     Board of Governors. In particular, I am troubled by the \n     operations and management of Voice of America (VOA) given \n     issues raised by the media, Inspector General, and former \n     employees of VOA. Therefore, I have requested to meet with \n     all the prospective nominees to discuss these issues. The \n     Broadcasting Board of Governors performs a vital role \n     regarding oversight and management of our international \n     broadcasting. As the nation faces threats from the Middle \n     East and in fact throughout the world, transparent and \n     effective international broadcasting agencies are critical to \n     ensuring our international broadcasts are in fact fulfilling \n     the America's interests in securing peace for ourselves and \n     our allies.\n       Again, thank you for protecting my rights on these \n     nominations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Tom A.

Mr. President, I read with interest, and disgust, the \npress reports about the comments of Iranian President Ahmadinejad at \nthe United Nations on Monday, when he attempted to defend Iran's secret \nnuclear program and his government's continuing defiance of the \nSecurity Council.\n  I could not help but contrast his words with the efforts so many \nother countries have been making to prevent a nuclear weapon from \nending up in the hands of a terrorist, or a nuclear arms race from \ntaking off in the Middle East or South Asia.\n  In the past couple of weeks, the United States and Russia--two former \nenemies that once came to the brink of a nuclear war and since the \n1980s have slashed their nuclear arsenals--agreed to make further \nreductions, and President Obama has said he wants to negotiate deeper \ncuts in furtherance of his long-term vision of a world without nuclear \nweapons.\n  On Monday, the Pentagon disclosed publicly the number of weapons that \nremain in our arsenal, which would have been unthinkable a few years \nago.\n  There are serious efforts being made to establish nuclear weapons-\nfree zones in South America, Africa, and the Middle East.\n  And at the United Nations, even countries such as Russia and China, \nwhich have traditionally sided with Iran, have all but lost patience \nwith what Secretary Clinton rightly called Iran's ``history of making \nconfusing, contradictory and inaccurate statements.''\n  Nobody questions Iran's right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful \npurposes. But the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is, as United Nations \nSecretary General Ban Ki-moon has said, more important today than ever. \nTerrorists like the Times Square bomber could cause death and \ndestruction on a scale we have not seen since World War II. Nuclear \nweapons in the hands of terrorists would have consequences for life as \nwe know it that are almost unfathomable. And Iran has long been a state \nsponsor of terrorism.\n  President Ahmadinejad insists there is no proof that Iran is building \na nuclear weapon, at the same time that he\n\n[[Page S3159]]\n\nrefuses to permit the kind of international inspections that could \nestablish whether Iran's nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes. \nAfter Iran was offered the option of sending its enriched uranium to \nRussia and France for refinement into fuel rods for its research \nreactor, he responded by stalling with one contradictory counteroffer \nafter another, all the while continuing to enrich increasing amounts of \nuranium to the point when Iran now is believed to have enough to build \ntwo nuclear bombs.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Secretary of State Clinton for her \nmeasured, strong statements at the United Nations about Iran's \nduplicitous, dangerous flaunting of the international nuclear control \nregime. It does not appear that anything short of sweeping, \nmultilateral sanctions has a chance of convincing Iran's leaders to \nchange their reckless course.\n  It is tragic that Iran, a country of such talented, sophisticated \npeople--many of whom risked their lives to protest a blatantly \nfraudulent election and who want peaceful relations with the United \nStates--currently has a President who is squandering Iran's resources \nand reputation in pursuit of a narcissistic, foolhardy quest for a \nnuclear bomb that will only increase his country's isolation and \nintensify Iran's confrontational relationship with its neighbors and \nthe international community. The potential consequences could not be \nmore frightening for ordinary people everywhere, including the people \nof Iran, and the Security Council should delay no further in imposing \nthe strongest possible sanctions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3159-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MILITARY FAMILIES APPRECIATION DAY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in Oregon, we just honored the return of \n2,700 members of the Oregon National Guard's 41st Brigade Combat Team. \nAlthough the 41st's service in Iraq was Oregon's biggest single \ncontribution to a war effort since World War II, it is not the only \none.\n  The soldiers of the Oregon National Guard's 162nd Engineer Company \nare currently clearing roads in Afghanistan. The 1249 Engineer \nBattalion in Salem, OR, is preparing to deploy to Afghanistan this \nwinter, and about 600 soldiers from Eastern Oregon will be part of the \n116th Cavalry when it deploys to Iraq this fall.\n  I know I will return to the floor of the Senate to talk about the \nbravery and service of these men and women. But today I want to talk \nabout the often unrecognized other half of these deployments--the \nmilitary families that support the service members and keep things \ntogether at home. The spouses, sons, daughters, parents, grandparents \nand community supporters who work together and toil alone to pay the \nbills, get the kids to school, and help find employment while their \nloved ones are away.\n  May 8 is Military Families Appreciation Day in Oregon. On this \nspecial day, our State honors the dedication and service of military \nfamilies and veterans who have helped make America's military the \nstrongest the world has ever seen.\n  Being left behind when a loved one goes to war is not an easy \nmission. Yet our military families continue to make the difficult \nsacrifices, and call upon their inner reserves, to nurture family life \nso that their service member can focus on the business at hand.\n  Our military spouses are the glue that holds our military families \ntogether. They unselfishly give up their husband or wife, their partner \nand friend to help serve our Nation. They celebrate important events \nlike birthdays, anniversaries, and sometimes a child's first step or \nfirst word alone. They assume the difficult role of being both mother \nand father--shouldering the responsibility of creating and nurturing a \nloving family environment when their loved one is away. Their strength \nand determination are examples to the rest of the country.\n  And to all of the grandparents and friends who step up when our \nsingle-parent service members are called to duty, I thank you. You \nunselfishly answer the Nation's call by caring for our future \ngeneration. You help relieve the pressures of military service by \nmaking sure our service members' children are safe, happy, and loved. \nStand tall, stand proud. You, too, are our unsung heroes.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize the sons and daughters who grow up \nin a military family. As the children of America's defenders, they cope \nwith unbelievable circumstances. The smells of shoe polish, starch, and \nBrasso may remind them of home more than the smells of cookies and \napple pie. Their mothers and fathers are called to duty at a moment's \nnotice, and they have no choice but to be strong, even when it hurts to \nsay goodbye. Their contribution to the Nation and personal strength \ndoes not go unnoticed. They are our future and represent the best \nAmerica has to offer.\n  Today's military family--spouses, sons, daughters, parents, \ngrandparents and community--inspire us through spirit and strength. \nThey proudly wave flags and keep the candles burning as a reminder of \nthose who are gone.\n  Their dedication reminds us all that the U.S. flag is brilliant \nindeed; patriotic songs are not just reserved for the fourth of July; \nthat a parting kiss can hold for months; and that shared tears can \nsomehow bring us closer together. They put their own priorities aside. \nThey take care of one another. They take care of America.\n  So to all military families, I thank you.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to honor a \nNorth Dakota woman retiring from a long and honorable career dedicated \nto assisting U.S. military veterans throughout Burleigh County in the \nState of North Dakota.\n  Cindy Munsch, of rural New Salem, ND, started her professional career \nas a teacher, educating young people on the Standing Rock Reservation, \nin the Bismarck Public Schools, and at United Tribes Technical College.\n  In 1985, after 14 years in education, Cindy commenced employment with \nthe Burleigh County Veterans Service Office. Initially the office \nsecretary, Cindy's outstanding work ethic and duty performance was \nrecognized by the Burleigh County Commission with promotion to the \nposition of Deputy County Service Officer. She is now retiring after 25 \nyears of service to our veterans.\n  Cindy has assisted thousands of veterans with obtaining needed \nbenefits and services. She is recognized by her peers across the State \nas an expert in veterans benefits, and she frequently provides advice \nand counsel at the request of other veterans service providers. She \nalso assists in the administration of the veterans transportation \nprogram, which provides van transport to veterans from western and \ncentral North Dakota to the VA Regional Medical Center in Fargo.\n  Seeing a need for women veterans in the area to have the opportunity \nto address issues and experiences unique to their gender, in \nconjunction with staff from the Bismarck Vet Center, Cindy started a \nWomen Veterans Group that meets monthly for the purpose of discussion \nand support, education and community service projects. In addition, \nCindy cochaired the inaugural Women Veterans Summit, held recently in \nBismarck, to bring women veterans issues into focus and to provide a \nnetworking opportunity for women veterans from throughout the State.\n  There is no more admirable vocation than one of service to others. \nCindy Munsch dedicated her professional career to ensuring that our \nservice members, who stepped forward to serve the Nation by preserving \nour freedom and way of life, receive the benefits and assistance they \ndeserve. I am honored to salute Cindy Munsch for her dedicated and \nselfless service to our veterans for the past 25 years and to \ncongratulate her on her retirement from the Burleigh County Veterans \nService Office.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3159-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3159-S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. JOSEPH W. BASCUAS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to thank Dr. Joseph W. \nBascuas for his invaluable contributions as interim president to Becker \nCollege and\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\nfor his dedication to quality education and high academic standards.\n  Becker College, which traces its history to 1784, is comprised of two \nseparate campuses only 6 miles apart, one in Leicester and the other in \nWorcester, MA. The college serves more than 1,700 students from 18 \nStates and 12 countries, and offers more than 25 diverse, top-quality \nbachelor degree programs in unique, high-demand career niches and \nserves as an invaluable community partner. In September of 2008 the \nBecker College Board of Trustees named Dr. Bascuas as interim president \nand since that time he has served admirably.\n  Dr. Bascuas brought more than 25 years of experience in higher \neducation to Becker College. In addition to his teaching and leading \nexperiences, he has written and coauthored numerous papers on \npsychological topics and has presented at symposia and conferences. Dr. \nBascuas served as president of Medaille College, Buffalo, NY; founding \npresident of Argosy University Atlanta, GA, campus; and held \nadministrative and teaching positions at the Georgia School of \nProfessional Psychology, Antioch University, Nova/Southeastern \nUniversity and Salve Regina University. Moreover, he served recently as \na site visit team chair for the Middle States Commission on Higher \nEducation, and served on the National Collegiate Athletic Association \nDivision III Presidents Council. He received a B.A. from LaSalle \nUniversity and an M.A. and a Ph.D. from Temple University.\n  Dr. Bascuas took on the role of interim president during a \nchallenging time and was not content with simply being a placeholder. \nDr. Bascuas was willing to tackle serious issues including technology, \nfinancial aid, and improving retention and graduation rates. He \nsuccessfully positioned the College for significant growth rates and \nprogress in the future, and for that, the citizens of Massachusetts \ngreatly appreciate and commend him for his efforts.\n  Mr. President, I would like to wish Dr. Joseph W. Bascuas continued \nsuccess in the future. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Dr. \nJoseph W. Bascuas for his services at Becker College.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3160-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               125TH ANNIVERSARY OF ``OLD FOLKS SINGING''\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I commemorate the 125th \nanniversary of ``Old Folks Singing,'' a time-honored tradition in Tull, \nAR.\n  Each year, Tull residents and other Arkansans gather at Ebenezer \nUnited Methodist Church on the third Sunday of May to sing gospel hymns \nfrom the church's original Christian Harmony and Cokesbury hymnals. \nSince 1885, this event has brought together Arkansans for praise, \nworship, and fellowship.\n  Old Folks Singing is steeped in tradition. As event organizers \nproudly say, ``not much will change this year.'' The day begins with a \nprayer and welcome address before attendees join in song. After a \npotluck lunch and memorial service, the afternoon's music gets \nunderway, ending with prayer and the final hymn, ``God Be with You \n'Till We Meet Again.''\n  Mr. President, I also recognize the organizers of ``Old Folks \nSinging,'' including President Richard Tull, Vice President Wilson \nDuVall, Secretary Karen Westbrook, Treasurer Lena Ramsey, and Chaplain \nJohn Victor Burton. Numerous other volunteers help the day run smoothly \nby coordinating lunch, serving as ushers, creating the church bulletin, \nleading songs, and various other tasks.\n  ``Old Folks Singing'' represents the best of our Arkansas \ncommunities. In good times and bad, Arkansans come together to share \nfaith, family, and community. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring this great Arkansas tradition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3160-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JUDY TENENBAUM\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Little Rock \nphilanthropist Judy Tenenbaum and her lifetime of service for the \npeople of our great State of Arkansas.\n  Judy will be recognized during this year's ``Red Jacket Ball,'' an \nannual benefit gala for City Year Little Rock/North Little Rock, a \nleading nonprofit organization that unites young people of all \nbackgrounds for a year of full-time service. Throughout communities \nacross the U.S., City Year members are easily recognizable by their red \njackets, which symbolize the power of citizen service and provide the \nnamesake for their annual fundraiser.\n  This year marks the fifth anniversary of the Red Jacket Ball, and \nJudy joins a distinguished list of Arkansas philanthropists to have \nreceived this honor. Judy donates her time and resources to countless \norganizations throughout Central Arkansas, with causes ranging from the \narts to cancer research to community development. Judy has touched \nthousands of Arkansans who may never know her name but who feel her \ngenerosity and support.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to call Judy a friend. We have worked \ntogether on a number of charitable projects throughout the years, and \nshe is always willing and able to lend support where it is needed the \nmost. I join all Arkansans in recognizing Judy with the Red Jacket Ball \nLifetime of Service Award from City Year Little Rock/North Little \nRock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3160-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3160-S3161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO RICHARD L. ROCA, PH.D.\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished scholar, accomplished leader, and a treasured member of \nthe Maryland family, Dr. Richard Roca, director of the Johns Hopkins \nUniversity Applied Physics Lab, who will soon step down after a decade \nof distinguished leadership and service in that position.\n  The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab is a national \ntreasure. Since it was created in the early days of the Second World \nWar, APL has helped maintain our Nation's military, our intelligence \nagencies, our space community, and our medical profession on the \ncutting edge of technological achievements. Now the largest university \naffiliated research lab in the Nation, the dedicated scientists, \nengineers, technicians, and researchers at APL have time and again \nsolved the problems no one thought possible, and in the process kept us \nsafe and secure. Since 2000, Dr. Roca has led this uniquely talented \nand diverse team of world renowned scientists as they rose to the \nchallenges of the post-September 11 world.\n  Dr. Roca was the right leader at the right time to guide APL through \nthese fast-paced and challenging times. Like many visionary leaders in \nhis field, Dr. Roca understands that for a forward-leaning, high-tech \ninstitution like the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab can never be \nstatic. He knows that in order for APL to play its role solving the \nproblems of the 21st century and helping our Nation's national security \napparatus adjust to an ever-changing world, that APL itself must \ncontinually be updating and reinventing itself.\n  Dr. Roca's leadership over the last 10 years has embodied that \nmindset on continual improvement and self-reinvention. During his \ntenure, APL adapted to a changing world by expanding its roles and \ncapabilities into homeland security, cyber defense, space exploration, \nand information-centric operations. After September 11, under Dr. \nRoca's leadership APL established the Electronic Surveillance System \nfor Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics--ESSENCE--at APL to \nmonitor the threats from new diseases in the United States. That system \nis now on watch across the country to provide early warnings against \nnew epidemics created by nature or by terrorist activity. Dr. Roca was \nalso one of the first to recognize the threat from cyber attacks and \ncall for comprehensive cyber defenses. It was under his leadership that \nAPL established major partnerships with the National Security Agency to \ndevelop and test new cybersecurity tools. These are just a few examples \nof how Dr. Roca saw the world changing and mobilized APL to meet the \nnew challenges. We are safer for his leadership in keeping APL on the \ncutting edge of helping counter new and emerging threats to our \nnational security.\n  Dr. Roca also kept APL on the cusp of new explorations in space and \nscience. During his tenure, APL helped design, build, and send \nsatellites into space that have explored the Eros asteroid; that are \nenroute to explore\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\nMercury and Pluto, and which play valuable roles in understanding the \nSun's impact on Earth's atmosphere. These contributions to \nunderstanding and exploring our universe cannot be overstated. They are \nmajor achievements that will lead to decades of scientific study and \nachievement.\n  So as Dr. Roca comes to the end of his tenure, I want to thank him \nfor his tireless service, his devotion to excellence, his dedication to \nthe mission of the Applied Physics Lab, and for his inspired leadership \nin keeping APL at the cutting edge of keeping our Nation safe and \nadvancing valuable science in hundreds of different areas. We wish you \nthe very best, Dr. Roca, in whatever the next chapter in your \nprofessional life holds for you. Wherever that takes you, know that you \nwill always and forever be a member of the Maryland family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3161-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO DOROTHY CLARA KRALICEK AND DELLA MARIE GOEGEN\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dorothy \nClara Kralicek and Della Marie Goegen.\n  Dorothy and Della were born on April 8, 1920, at the family farm near \nMenominee, NE, where they learned about the true riches of family life. \nToday, they both live in Yankton, SD, continuing to pass along family \nvalues and faith as matriarchs of their vast families.

I am also pleased \nto transmit my written approval, authorization, and determination \nconcerning the Agreement, and an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation \nAssessment Statement (NPAS) concerning the Agreement. In accordance \nwith section 123 of the Act, as amended by title XII of the Foreign \nAffairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277), a \nclassified annex to the NPAS, prepared by the Secretary of State in \nconsultation with the Director of National Intelligence, summarizing \nrelevant classified information, will be submitted to the Congress \nseparately. The joint memorandum submitted to me by the Secretaries of \nState and Energy and a letter from the Chairman of the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission stating the views of the Commission are also \nenclosed.\n  The proposed Agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the Act \nand other applicable law. In my judgment, it meets all applicable \nstatutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other \nforeign policy interests of the United States.\n  The proposed Agreement provides a comprehensive framework for \npeaceful nuclear cooperation with Australia based on a mutual \ncommitment to nuclear nonproliferation. The Agreement has an initial \nterm of 30 years from the date of its entry into force, and will \ncontinue in force thereafter for additional periods of 5 years each, \nunless terminated by either party on 6 months' advance written notice \nat the end of the initial 30-year term or at the conclusion of any of \nthe additional 5-year periods. The proposed Agreement permits the \ntransfer of information, material, equipment (including reactors), and \ncomponents for nuclear research and nuclear power production. It does \nnot permit transfers of Restricted Data, sensitive nuclear technology, \nsensitive nuclear facilities, or major critical components of such \nfacilities. In the event of termination of the proposed Agreement, key \nnonproliferation conditions and controls continue with respect to \nmaterial, equipment, and components subject to the proposed Agreement.\n  Australia is a non-nuclear weapon state party to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Australia has concluded a \nSafeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency. Australia is a party to the Convention on the \nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material, which establishes \ninternational standards of physical protection for the use, storage, \nand transport of nuclear material. It is also a member of the Nuclear \nSuppliers Group, whose non-legally binding guidelines set forth \nstandards for the responsible export of nuclear commodities for \npeaceful use. A more detailed discussion of Australia's domestic civil \nnuclear activities and its nuclear nonproliferation policies and \npractices, including its nuclear export policies and practices, is \nprovided in the NPAS and the NPAS classified annex submitted to the \nCongress separately.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed Agreement and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe Agreement and authorized its execution.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana memorializing Congress to utilize the \n     power of technology to boost American productivity and \n     performance by consulting with state legislatures, education, \n     and computer organizations to ensure that every student has \n     access to a low-cost laptop; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 19\n\n       Whereas, the personal computer is an indispensable twenty-\n     first century learning tool; and\n        Whereas, the decreasing cost of technology makes it \n     possible to equip every student with a portable, personal \n     computer; and\n        Whereas, low-cost laptops are ``twenty-first century \n     textbooks'' due to their capacity to store thousands of books \n     and research materials; and\n        Whereas, computer technology has been shown to improve \n     academic performance, attendance, and enthusiasm in \n     classrooms; and\n        Whereas, according to a survey by the November 2007 Pew \n     Internet & American Life Project, one-fourth of Americans do \n     not have computers at home; and\n        Whereas, the ``digital divide'' most sharply impacts the \n     poor, racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, \n     and residents of rural areas; and\n        Whereas, attaining universal access to communication \n     technology is a goal spelled out in the 1996 \n     Telecommunications Act; and\n        Whereas, a nationwide push among state leaders to equip \n     students with laptops promises to fuel a new generation of \n     math, science, and technology innovators; and\n        Whereas, computer proficiency is increasingly required by \n     employers and institutions of higher learning; and\n       Whereas, previous technology-focused efforts, such as the \n     Technology Opportunities Program and E-Rate, resulted in \n     newfound information and communication access for millions of \n     students and thousands of schools; and\n       Whereas, the provision of low-cost laptops for all students \n     would increase learning in core subjects, improve literacy in \n     technology essential for twenty-first century skills, and \n     stimulate creativity, all necessary in reaching the goal of \n     academic excellence in schools as well as developing a \n     technical proficiency at an early age. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to utilize the power of \n     technology to boost American productivity and performance by \n     consulting with state legislatures, education, and computer \n     organizations to ensure that every student has access to a \n     low-cost laptop.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. JOHNSON:\n  S. 3310. A bill to designate certain wilderness areas in the National \nForest System in the State of South Dakota; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \nprotect the Cheyenne River Valley in the Buffalo Gap National \nGrassland. My bill will establish the first National Grassland \nwilderness area in the United States and provide the public with a \nunique experience to enjoy these public lands.\n  The Cheyenne River Valley in the Buffalo Gap National Grassland \nincludes some of the finest prairie wilderness in the United States. \nLocated among isolated buttes and the wide Cheyenne River Valley, these \nlands remain largely isolated and in the form that the Native people \nwho first inhabited these lands would recognize.\n  The lands of the Cheyenne River Valley--Indian Creek, Red Shirt and \nChalk Hills--exhibit the characteristics of undisturbed, wild lands. \nConsistent with their natural character, the U.S. Forest Service \nidentified these lands for inclusion in the Wilderness Preservation \nSystem. In fact, since 2002, the Indian Creek and Red Shirt areas have \nbeen managed by the Forest Service to preserve their wilderness \nqualities, including a prohibition on motorized traffic that created \none of the largest roadless areas in the Great Plains. My legislation \nbuilds off the Forest Service recommendation in a manner consistent \nwith the history and purposes of the Buffalo Gap National Grassland.\n  These lands also support livestock grazing, a productive use and \nintegral part of managing the health and sustainability of native \ngrassland. My bill safeguards existing grazing, consistent with the \nWilderness Act, by directing the Forest Service to allow for the \ncontinuation of grazing.\n  By designating a portion of the Cheyenne River Valley as wilderness, \nit is possible to protect its undeveloped character from encroaching \nmotorized recreation while providing hunters, rock collectors, campers \nand hikers a new way to enjoy prairie grasslands.\n  The public benefits from enjoying a variety of experiences on our \npublic lands. These lands provide food and fiber and are a natural \nasset to be responsibly and sustainably managed. America's grasslands, \nwith millions of acres of rangeland, can also sustain other purposes, \nincluding the solitude and primitive character of wilderness. \nEstablishing a first-of-its-kind grasslands wilderness fills a long \noverlooked gap and completes the unique history and varied landscapes \nof our National Grasslands.\n  I have named this bill in honor of my friend and a great advocate for \nSouth Dakotan's open spaces, the late Tony Dean. It is his words in \ndescribing the purposes of creating a grasslands wilderness bill that I \nturn to for the best explanation for why this bill is necessary. Tony \nsaid:\n\n       Let's relate wilderness from the perspective of a hunter. \n     It does not take a rocket scientist among hunters to \n     recognize that once the opening salvo takes place on opening \n     morning of the big game seasons, no matter where you live, \n     the best hunting is almost always found far from the nearest \n     road.\n\n  That sentiment is what, in part, this legislation is aimed at \ncreating: a place held from competition of multiple uses and \ndevelopment, a place where the public and future generations can enjoy \na unique wilderness experience found in few places outside my great \nState.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 3311. A bill to improve and enhance the capabilities of the \nDepartment of Defense to prevent and respond to sexual assault in the \nArmed Forces, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am deeply troubled by the increasing \nnumber of sexual assaults in the U.S. military. Not only is sexual \nassault a crime that is incompatible with military service, but it also \nundermines core values, degrades military readiness, subverts good will \nand forever changes the lives of victims and their families.\n  We know from the Defense Department's 2009 Report on Sexual Assault \nin the Military that the number of reported sexual assaults in the \nmilitary\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\nincreased substantially last year--a trend that has continued for the \nlast couple of years.\n  Unfortunately, according to the Pentagon, we also know that while \nimprovements have been made, the number of sexual assaults in the \nmilitary actually reported is far below the estimated number of \nassaults that have actually occurred in the military. It is estimated \nthat only 10 to 20 percent of sexual assaults in the military are \nactually reported.\n  Obviously, more needs to be done. That is why I have introduced the \nDefense, Sexual Trauma Response and Good Governance, STRONG Act of \n2010. This legislation builds on many of the common sense solutions \nthat were included in the December 2009 Report on Sexual Assault in the \nMilitary, a report from the Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the \nMilitary Services.\n  The Defense STRONG Act of 2010 would guarantee legal counsel from a \nJudge Advocate General to all sexual assault victims, whether or not \nthey file restricted or unrestricted reports. Currently, anyone who \nfiles a restricted report cannot seek legal counsel. Seeking legal \ncounsel triggers an investigation, which, in turn, makes that report \nunrestricted--that is, it is no longer confidential and the chain of \ncommand is notified.\n  A directive issued by the Department of Defense in 2005 omitted Judge \nAdvocate Generals and civilian lawyers trained in military law from the \nlist of individuals that a victim can seek guidance and assistance \nfrom. The only individuals on the list are Sexual Assault Response \nCoordinator's, SARCs, Victim Advocates, VAs, health care personnel, and \nchaplains--none of whom are likely to have legal training. But it is my \nbelief that the victim of a sexual assault should have the right to \nlegal counsel no matter what.\n  In its report, the Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the \nMilitary Services also found that victims are not offered appropriate \nprivileged communications. The report noted that there are 35 states \nthat currently have a privilege for communications between Victim \nAdvocates and victims of sexual assault. However, because no privilege \nexists in military proceedings, defense counsel are able to identify \nVictim Advocates as a potential defense witness in a court-martial. \nThere have been multiple occasions in which information was obtained \nfrom Victim Advocates in court-martial proceedings and used to try to \nundermine the credibility of a victim with cross examinations \nhighlighting inconsistencies in prior statements.\n  There are certain roles that I believe are inherently governmental \nand certainly one is the role of Sexual Assault Response Coordinator, \nwhich should be filled by either a uniformed servicemember or a DoD \ncivilian employee, not a contractor. The Defense Task Force on Sexual \nAssault in the Military Services agreed. So this legislation would \nrequire one Sexual Assault Response Coordinator per brigade, filled by \neither a full-time military servicemember or a DoD civilian employee.\n  Moreover, this legislation also would require that Victim Advocates \nbe either a uniformed servicemember or a DoD civilian employee. At the \nbattalion level, there are usually two part time Victim Advocates. The \nDefense STRONG Act would require that there be at least one-full time \nVictim Advocate at each battalion, or battalion equivalent.\n  Another issue that has long plagued the DoD's ability to adequately \nrespond to and prevent sexual assaults in the military is the lack of \nstandardization amongst the services. The Defense STRONG Act would \nrequire the DoD to standardize much of their certification programs in \na manner modeled after the Defense Equal Opportunity Management \nInstitute, training Sexual Assault Response Coordinators as well as \nVictim Advocates. Standardization and professionalization would \ndrastically impact readiness.\n  This legislation would also require the Department of Defense to \ndevelop modules specific to each level of Professional Military \nEducation. By doing so, we could ensure that military leadership is \naware of all available resources. This provision would also encourage \nthe Department of Defense to craft each level of Professional Military \nEducation to the level of responsibility as military leadership get \npromoted.\n  Elevating the Director of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response \nOffice to the Senior Executive Service level was another recommendation \nput forth by the Defense Task Force Report. A senior leader in this \noffice is necessary in order to obtain resources and provide the \nattention this issue requires, much like the Defense Military Equal \nOpportunity Office and the Office of Military and Community Family \nPolicy. Leadership at the senior level has already proven instrumental \nin helping advance the DoD's efforts in overcoming domestic violence \nand discrimination and could be just as helpful in combating sexual \nassaults.\n  While there is no magic formula for solving a problem that has long \nplagued the Department of Defense, I believe these provisions will \nstrengthen the DoD's ability to respond to cases of sexual assault and \nprevent future cases from occurring.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 3313. A bill to withdraw certain land located in Clark County, \nNevada from location, entry, and patent under the mining laws and \ndisposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing \nor mineral materials, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sloan Hills \nWithdrawal Act of 2010.\n  Over the past year, I have been contacted by thousands of people in \nsouthern Nevada who have voiced serious concerns about a proposed \naggregate mining operation that would be located on federal land very \nnear Henderson, Nevada. I have a simple goal with the legislation that \nI am introducing today. My bill will stop the development of the \nproposed 640-acre gravel pit by withdrawing the area from location, \nentry, and patent under the mining laws and disposition under all laws \npertaining to mineral materials. In short, this legislation makes sure \nthat the proposed gravel operations at Sloan Hills will not go forward.\n  The Bureau of Land Management, BLM, is currently evaluating a \nproposal for a major gravel operation at the site in question. If \napproved, the resulting mine would blast rock, crush gravel, kick up \ndust, and consume precious water resources up to 24 hours a day, every \nday, for 30 years. This would all be done just a few miles from \nnumerous Henderson neighborhoods.\n  Citizens from all over Clark County have rallied against this project \nbecause of its potential effect on the health of residents and the toll \nthat the blasting other operations would have on an otherwise peaceful \ncommunity. Because this project would be on Federal land local \ngovernments are limited in their ability to influence the outcome of \nthe Sloan Hills proposal. It is clear to all of us, though, that the \nproposed location for this gravel quarry is not in the best interest of \nour community.\n  One of the major points of concern raised by Henderson residents is \nthe large clouds of fine particulate matter that would be generated by \nmining activities at the Sloan Hills site. The dust kicked up by the \nproposed gravel operation would undoubtedly complicate the current air \nquality challenges in the Las Vegas Valley and would be particularly \ntroublesome for members of nearby, age-restricted communities that have \nseniors already suffering from respiratory problems. Blasting and rock-\ncrushing operations are also expected to generate noise and vibrations \nthat will interfere with residents' daily lives.\n  This bill is important to me and to the people of southern Nevada. \nKeeping our communities safe and healthy is critical. I appreciate your \nhelp and I look forward to working with Chairman Bingaman, Ranking \nMember Murkowski and the other distinguished members of the Senate \nEnergy Committee to move this legislation forward in the near future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 3313\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sloan Hills Withdrawal \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. WITHDRAWAL OF SLOAN HILLS AREA OF CLARK COUNTY, \n                   NEVADA.\n\n       (a) Definition of Federal Land.--In this section, the term \n     ``Federal land'' means the land identified as the \n     ``Withdrawal Zone'' on the map entitled ``Sloan Hills Area'' \n     and dated May 5, 2010.\n       (b) Withdrawal.--Subject to valid rights in existence on \n     the date of introduction of this Act, the Federal land is \n     withdrawn from all forms of--\n       (1) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and\n       (2) disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and \n     geothermal leasing or mineral materials.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 3315. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprotect Medicare beneficiaries' access to home health services under \nthe Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin in introducing legislation, the Home Health Care Access \nProtection Act of 2010, to prevent future unfair administrative cuts in \nMedicare home health payment rates.\n  Home health has become an increasingly important part of our health \ncare system. The kinds of highly skilled and often technically complex \nservices that our Nation's home health agencies provide have helped to \nkeep families together and enabled millions of our most frail and \nvulnerable older and disabled persons to avoid hospitals and nursing \nhomes and stay just where they want to be--in the comfort and security \nof their own homes. Moreover, by helping these individuals to avoid \nmore costly institutional care, they are saving Medicare millions of \ndollars each year.\n  That is why I find it so ironic--and troubling--that the Medicare \nhome health benefit continually comes under attack.\n  The health care reform bill that was recently signed into law by the \nPresident includes $40 billion in cuts to home care over the next ten \nyears. Moreover, these cuts are a ``double-whammy'' because they come \non top of $25 billion in additional cuts to home health over the next \nten years imposed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nthrough regulation.\n  These cuts are particularly disproportionate for a program that costs \nMedicare less than $18 billion a year. This simply is not right, and it \ncertainly is not in the best interest of our Nation's seniors who rely \non home care to keep them out of hospitals, nursing homes, and other \ninstitutions.\n  The payment rate cuts implemented and proposed by CMS are based on \nthe assertion that home health agencies have intentionally ``gamed the \nsystem'' by claiming that their patients have conditions of higher \nclinical severity than they actually have in order to receive higher \nMedicare payments. This unfounded allegation of ``case mix creep'' is \nbased on what CMS contends to be an increase in the average clinical \nassessment ``score'' of home health patients over the last few years.\n  In fact, there are very real clinical and policy explanations for why \nthe average clinical severity of home care patients' health conditions \nmay have increased over the years. For example, the incentives built \ninto the hospital diagnosis-related group--or DRG--reimbursement system \nhave led to the faster discharge of sicker patients. Advances in \ntechnology and changes in medical practice have also enabled home \nhealth agencies to treat more complicated medical conditions that \npreviously could only be treated in hospitals, nursing homes, or \ninpatient rehabilitation facilities.\n  Moreover, this unfair payment rate cut is being assessed across the \nboard, even for home health agencies that showed a decrease in their \nclinical assessment scores. If an individual home health agency is \ntruly gaming the system, CMS should target that one agency, not \npenalize everyone.\n  The research method, data and findings that CMS has used to justify \nthe administrative cuts also raise serious concerns about the validity \nof the payment rate cuts. For example, while changes in the need for \ntherapy services significantly affect the case mix ``score,'' the CMS \nresearch methodology disregards those changes in evaluating whether the \npatient population has changed. Moreover, the method by which CMS \nevaluates changes in case mix coding is not transparent, does not allow \nfor true public participation, and is not performed in a manner that \nensures accountability to Medicare patients and providers in terms of \nits validity and accuracy of outcomes.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will establish a reliable \nand transparent process for determining whether payment rate cuts are \nneeded to account for improper changes in ``case mix scoring'' that are \nnot related to changes in the nature of the patients served in home \nhealth care or the nature of the care they received. This process will \nstill enable the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enact rate \nadjustments provided there is reliable evidence that higher case mix \nscores are resulting from factors other than changes in patient \nconditions. The legislation will also prevent the implementation of \nfuture Medicare payment rate cuts in home health until the Secretary is \nable to justify the payment cuts through the improved process set forth \nin the bill.\n  Home health care has consistently proven to be a compassionate and \ncost-effective alternative to institutional care. Additional deep cuts \nwill be completely counterproductive to our efforts to control overall \nhealth care costs. The Home Health Care Access Protection Act of 2010 \nwill help to ensure that our seniors and disabled Americans continue to \nhave access to the quality home health services they deserve, and I \nencourage all of my colleagues to sign on as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 3316. A bill provide for flexibility and improvements in \nelementary and secondary education, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the No Child \nLeft Behind Flexibility and Improvements Act. I am pleased to be joined \nin this effort by my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe. Our \nlegislation would give greater local control and flexibility to Maine \nand other states in their efforts to implement the No Child Left Behind \nAct, NCLB, and provides common sense reforms in the statute.\n  Since NCLB was enacted in 2002, I have had the opportunity to meet \nwith numerous Maine educators to discuss their concerns with the law. \nIn response to their concerns, in March 2004, Senator Snowe and I \ncommissioned the Maine NCLB Task Force to examine the implementation \nissues facing Maine under both NCLB and the Maine Learning Results. Our \ntask force included members from every county in the State and had \nsuperintendents, teachers, principals, school board members, parents, \nbusiness leaders, former state legislators, special education experts, \nassessment specialists, officials from the Maine Department of \nEducation, a former Maine Commissioner of Education, and the Dean from \nthe University of Maine's College of Education and Human Development.\n  After a year of study, the Task Force presented us with its final \nreport outlining recommendations for possible statutory and regulatory \nchanges to the act. These recommendations form the basis of the \nlegislation that we are introducing today.\n  First, our legislation would provide greater flexibility to states in \nthe ways that they demonstrate student progress in meeting state \neducation standards. Specifically, it would permit states to use a \ncohort growth model, which tracks the progress of the same group of \nstudents over time. It would also permit the use of an ``indexing'' \nmodel, where progress is measured based on the number of students whose \nscores improve form, for example, a ``below-basic'' to a ``basic'' \nlevel, and not simply on the number of students who cross the \n``proficient'' line.\n  Second, our legislation would provide schools with better notice \nregarding possible performance issues, allowing schools a chance to \nidentify and work with a particular group of students before being \nidentified. It would expand the existing ``safe-harbor'' provisions to \nallow more schools to qualify for this important protection. The \nchanges made in our bill are in keeping with what assessment experts \nand teachers know--that significant gains in academic achievement tend \nto occur gradually and over time.\n\n[[Page S3169]]\n\n  Third, our legislation would allow the members of a special education \nstudent's IEP team to determine the best assessment for that individual \nstudent, and would permit the student's performance on that assessment \nto count for all NCLB purposes.\n  One reason this change is so important for Maine is that we have \nsmall student populations and Maine has chosen a very small subgroup \nsize--only 20 students. I was concerned to hear reports that in some \nschools, special education students fear that they are being blamed for \ntheir school not making adequate yearly progress. While the statute \nexplicitly prohibits the disaggregation of student data if it would \njeopardize student privacy, I am concerned to hear that this is not \nworking out in practice.\n  This legislative change is also based on principles of fairness and \ncommon sense. Many times, it simply does not make sense to require a \nspecial needs student to take a grade-level assessment that everyone \nknows he or she is not ready to take. Many special education students \nare referred for special education services precisely because they \ncannot meet grade-level expectations. Allowing the IEP team to \ndetermine the best test for each special student will bring an \nimportant improvement to the Act while still ensuring accountability.\n  Fourth, the legislation addresses my concern about the statute's \ncurrent requirement that all schools reach 100 percent proficiency by \n2013-2014. Our bill would require the Secretary of Education to review \nprogress by the states toward meeting this goal every three years, and \nwould allow him to modify the time-line as necessary.\n  Fifth, our legislation would provide new flexibility for teachers of \nmultiple subjects at the secondary school level to help them meet the \n``highly qualified teacher'' requirements. Unfortunately, the current \nregulations place undue burdens on teachers at small and rural schools \nwho often teach multiple subjects due to staffing needs, and on special \neducation teachers who work with students on a variety of subjects \nthroughout the day. Under the bill, provided these teachers are highly \nqualified for one subject they teach, they will be provided additional \ntime and less burdensome avenues to satisfy the remaining requirements.\n  Our legislation is a comprehensive effort to provide greater \nflexibility and common sense modifications to address the key NCLB \nchallenges facing Maine. Our goals remain the same as those in NCLB: a \ngood education for each and every child; well-qualified, committed \nteachers in every classroom; and increased transparency and \naccountability for every school. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on these issues during the upcoming NCLB reauthorization \nprocess.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S.J. Res. 29. A joint resolution approving the renewal of import \nrestrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a joint \nresolution that would renew sanctions against the Burmese junta. As in \nyears past, I am joined in this effort by my good friend Senator \nFeinstein. Senators McCain, Durbin, Gregg, and Lieberman are original \ncosponsors of this bipartisan legislation and continue to be leaders on \nthe issue.\n  Renewing sanctions against the military regime in Burma is as timely \nand as important as ever. Over the past year, the regime has not only \nmade clear that it has no intention of reforming, it is also trying to \nstand up a new sham constitution and to legitimize itself in the eyes \nof the world through a sham election. In my view, the United States \nmust deny the regime that legitimacy.\n  By way of background, a little history is in order. For nearly half a \ncentury, Burma has been under some kind of military rule, and every \npopular effort to reverse that situation has failed. In 1988, military \nauthorities violently put down a popular uprising. Two years later, the \nBurmese people went to the polls and handed an overwhelming victory to \nthe prodemocracy opposition, and the junta ignored the results. It \nnever seated these popularly elected candidates. It jailed prodemocracy \nleaders, such as Aung San Suu Kyi, and it has maintained its brutal \nrule ever since.\n  In response to these events, the United States established on a \nbipartisan basis various sanctions against the Burmese regime. These \ninclude a 1997 Executive order; the annual import ban, which has been \nrenewed annually since 2003; and restrictions on Burmese jade, which \nwere enacted in 2008.\n  On a number of occasions since 1990, the United States and the U.N. \nhave attempted to engage Burma diplomatically. These include, during \nthe Clinton administration, a delegation led by Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of State Thomas Hubbard; various efforts by former U.S. \nAmbassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright; and two trips to Burma by \nthen-Congressman Bill Richardson in the mid-1990s.\n  Other diplomatic efforts included Assistant Secretary of State \nChristopher Hill's ``roadmap'' in 2006, and overtures made by the \nUnited States through China in 2007. In 2008, ADM Timothy Keating met \nwith Burmese officials as part of United States efforts to provide \nhumanitarian assistance in the wake of Cyclone Nargis.\n  The U.N., for its part, has dispatched a human rights envoy to Burma \n15 times and special envoys 26 times over the past two decades. U.N. \nSecretary General Ban Ki-Moon has visited Burma on two occasions.\n  None of these efforts has yielded anything in the way of reform. \nIndeed, when Burmese citizens, led by Buddhist monks, took to the \nstreets in peaceful protest against the government and its policies in \nthe fall of 2007, these prodemocracy protesters, much like their \npredecessors, were brutally suppressed.\n  Nonetheless, the regime has sought at various times to save face \ninternationally. In response to this last major challenge to its \nauthority in the fall of 2007, for example, the regime unveiled a \nproposed constitution. But a quick look at the document shows that it \ncould scarcely have been less democratic. It precluded Suu Kyi from \nparticipating in the electoral process and ensured that the charter may \nnot be amended without the military's blessing. The noted \nconstitutional law professor, David Williams, of Indiana University, \ntold the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last year it was ``one of \nthe worst constitutions [he had] ever seen.''\n  What is more, the vote to adopt this constitution took place 2 years \nago in the immediate aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, the worst natural \ndisaster in modern Burmese history, and international election \nobservers were not permitted access to the country during the vote. If \nthe regime was interested in legitimacy, holding a vote such as this in \nthe middle of a natural disaster without election observers is not \nexactly the way to do it.\n  The results of this vote were roundly condemned, and for good reason. \nStill, despite widespread condemnation of this constitution and the \ncircumstances surrounding its adoption, some held out hope that a \nsubsequent election law might lead to democratic reform. But those \nhopes were dashed earlier this year when the regime actually issued the \nlong-awaited election law. Among other things, the law would force the \ndemocratic opposition, the National League for Democracy, to expel Suu \nKyi if the party chose to enter any of its candidates in the upcoming \nnational election and it forbids political prisoners and Buddhist monks \nfrom political participation.\n  The deadline for registering candidates and political parties under \nthe new law is later this week, and parties that fail to register \nbefore then will be deemed illegal. In other words, the law's practical \neffect would be to sideline Burma's most prominent democratic reformer \nand force its leading opposition party out of business.\n  We also get periodic press reports of ties between Burma and North \nKorea, including a particularly alarming report in recent days about an \nalleged weapons transfer from Pyongyang.\n  Last year, the Obama administration initiated a review of United \nStates policy with respect to Burma. As a result of that review, the \nadministration decided it is time for the United States to take another \nrun at engaging the regime. That is why last summer Secretary Clinton \nreportedly proposed to\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\nher Burmese counterpart at an international conference in Southeast \nAsia that the United States remove its investment ban on Burma in \nexchange for the unconditional release of Suu Kyi. Whatever the merits \nof this overture, this was a serious offer from a high ranking U.S. \nofficial aimed at improving bilateral relations.\n  Yet not only was Secretary Clinton's offer ignored and Suu Kyi not \nfreed, the regime actually extended Suu Kyi's detention for another \nyear and a half, and several months later, the junta denied her appeal. \nIt was shortly after that that the regime released the antidemocratic \nelection law I just referred to. So however well intentioned, the \nadministration's policy of engagement has, unfortunately, met with the \nsame fate as earlier engagement efforts, notwithstanding the fig leaves \nthe regime occasionally holds out as supposed proof of its willingness \nto reform.\n  Clearly, the regime craves legitimization of its rule. Why else would \nit suddenly move to finalize the constitution it had been working on \nintermittently for 14 years after its rule was challenged by the \nnonviolent Saffron Revolution in the fall of 2007? They did it for the \nsame reason they trotted out a transparently flawed election law \nearlier this year: They wanted to provide the appearance of reform \nwhere there was none. But they cannot have it both ways. If the regime \nwants legitimization, it must show real progress.\n\n       Secretary Clinton's policy review toward Burma concluded \n     that engagement along with sanctions might produce results \n     where sanctions alone had failed. Although we have yet to see \n     any positive results from engagement, the administration \n     itself concedes that sanctions should remain in place. But \n     the administration, to its credit, has been quite candid \n     about the lack of tangible progress by the regime.\n\n  Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell acknowledged as much after \nthe release of the Burmese election law. He said:\n\n       [T]he U.S. approach was to try to encourage domestic \n     dialogue between the key stakeholders . . . and the recent \n     promulgation of the election criteria doesn't leave much room \n     for such a dialog.\n\n  It should be noted parenthetically the absence of any tangible result \nfrom engagement has nothing to do with the work of American diplomats. \nIt has everything to do with the type of regime we are dealing with in \nBurma. But, again, the fact remains that no progress--none--has been \nmade.\n  Legitimacy is the one thing the regime cannot impose by force. But if \nlegitimacy is what it wants, a first step would be credible elections. \nAt this point there is no reason to believe that is even possible under \nthe current constitution, under the current election law, and in the \ncurrent political climate in Burma.\n  Renewing sanctions is important because it denies the junta the \nlegitimacy it so craves. A sanctions regime says to the junta and the \nworld, in no uncertain terms, the United States does not view this \ngovernment as having the support of its citizens. It says the United \nStates will not be a party to recognizing the junta's attempts to \noverturn the democratic elections of 1990, the last true expression of \nthe Burmese voters.\n  Sanctions should remain in place against the junta for the same \nreason the term ``Burma'' is used by friends of democracy instead of \nthe junta's chosen name of ``Myanmar''--because Myanmar is the name of \na government that has not been chosen by its people.\n  In short, sanctions should remain in place because lifting sanctions \nwould give the regime precisely what it wants; namely, legitimacy.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support sanctions renewal against \nthe Burmese regime.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me commend the minority leader for his \ncomments on Burma. It was a good education for me here to listen to it. \nI ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor to the \nlegislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Connecticut.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 29\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     approves the renewal of the import restrictions contained in \n     section 3(a)(1) and section 3A(b)(1) and (c)(1) of the \n     Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today once again with Senator \nMcConnell to introduce a joint resolution renewing the ban on all \nimports from Burma for another year.\n  We are proud to be joined by Senators McCain, Durbin, Gregg, and \nLieberman and we look forward to swift action by the Senate, House, and \nthe President on this important matter.\n  Now, more than ever, the people of Burma need to know that we stand \nby them and support their vision of a free and democratic Burma.\n  On May 6th, the National League for Democracy, NLD, led by Nobel \nPeace Prize Laureate and political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi, will \ncease to exist.\n  Let me be clear: the NLD is not shutting down out of its own free \nwill.\n  It is being forced to disband by an unjust and undemocratic \nconstitution and election law, both drafted in secret and behind closed \ndoors by the ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development \nCouncil, SPDC, to solidify its grip on power.\n  Let me explain.\n  Under the terms of the new constitution, 25 percent of the seats must \nbe set aside for the military.\n  Think about that: before any vote has been cast, the military is \nguaranteed a quarter of the seats in the new 440 member House of \nRepresentatives.\n  How will this new institution be any different from the current \nmilitary regime?\n  If that is not enough to raise doubts about the military's commitment \nto a truly representative government, it should also be pointed out \nthat last week the regime's Prime Minister, Thein Sein, and 22 cabinet \nministers resigned from the army to form a new ``civilian'' political \nparty, the Union Solidarity and Development Party.\n  Any seats won by this new ``party'' in the upcoming elections will be \nin addition to the 25 percent set aside for active military members.\n  Does anyone really believe the regime has embraced democracy and the \nconcept of civilian rule? Unfortunately, it will be business as usual \nfor the people of Burma and the democratic opposition.\n  What about Suu Kyi and her National League of Democracy, winners of \nthe last free parliamentary elections in 1990?\n  First, last month, the regime, which never allowed the NLD to assume \npower, officially annulled its 1990 victory.\n  Second, under the new constitution, as a convicted ``criminal'' Suu \nKyi is barred from running in the elections.\n  Finally, under the terms of the election law, in order to participate \nin the upcoming parliamentary elections and remain legally active, a \npolitical party has to cut ties with any members who are convicted \ncriminals.\n  Thus, the NLD had to either kick Suu Kyi out of the party and \nparticipate in the elections or face extinction.\n  It should come as no surprise that the NLD refused to turn its back \non Suu Kyi and give its stamp of approval to the regime's sham \nconstitution and electoral law.\n  I applaud their courage and their devotion to democracy, human \nrights, and the rule of law.\n  While I am saddened to see the regime close its doors, the spirit and \nthe principles of the NLD will live on in the hearts and minds of the \npeople.\n  I know they will one day be able to elect a truly representative \ngovernment.\n  As Tin Oo, the NLD's deputy leader and former political prisoner \nsaid: ``We do not feel sad. We have honor. One day we will come back; \nwe will be reincarnated by the will of the people.''\n  This is a clear message to the regime that an illegitimate \nconstitution and election law cannot suppress the unyielding democratic \naspirations of the people of Burma.\n  Now, we must send our own signal to the regime that its quest for \nlegitimacy has failed.\n  We must send our own signal to the democratic opposition that we \nstand in solidarity with them and we will not abandon them.\n\n[[Page S3171]]\n\n  Now is the time to renew the import ban on all products from Burma \nfor another year.\n  Let me be clear--I am disappointed that the ban has not moved Burma \nany closer to national reconciliation and a democratic government.\n  Indeed, as I have noted, the regime has taken several steps in the \nwrong direction.\n  But we have the opportunity to review these sanctions every year.\n  Last year we passed legislation allowing the sanctions to be renewed, \nonce a year, for up to three more years until 2012.\n  Simply put, if we fail to renew the import ban, we will reward the \nmilitary regime for its decades' long record of oppression.\n  We will reward them for keeping the true leader of Burma, Suu Kyi, \nbehind bars and under house arrest for the better part of 20 years.\n  We will reward them for forcing the National League for Democracy to \nclose its doors.\n  We will reward them for 2,100 political prisoners, the use of child \nsoldiers, the persecution of ethnic minorities, the use of rape as an \ninstrument of war, the use of torture, the use of forced labor, and the \ndisplacement of civilians.\n  Indeed, the standards for lifting the sanctions are clear. The regime \nmust make ``substantial and measureable progress'' towards ending \nviolations of internationally recognized human rights; releasing all \npolitical prisoners; allowing freedom of speech and press; allowing \nfreedom of association; permitting the peaceful exercise of religion; \nand bringing to a conclusion an agreement between the SPDC and the \nNational League for Democracy and Burma's ethnic nationalities on the \nrestoration of a democratic government.\n  By every measure, the regime has failed to even come close to meeting \nthese conditions. So we must act to renew the import ban.\n  But we cannot act alone.\n  I urge the United Nations and the international community to follow \nour lead and put pressure on the regime to abandon this process, \nrelease political prisoners, and draft a truly democratic and \nrepresentative constitution.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3171-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 514--CONGRATULATING THE STUDENTS, PARENTS, TEACHERS, \n  AND ADMINISTRATORS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES FOR \nONGOING CONTRIBUTIONS TO EDUCATION AND SUPPORTING THE IDEALS AND GOALS \n  OF THE 11TH ANNUAL NATIONAL CHARTER SCHOOLS WEEK, TO BE HELD MAY 2 \n                          THROUGH MAY 8, 2010\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Burr, Mr. \nCarper, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \nVitter) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 514\n\n       Whereas charter schools deliver high-quality public \n     education and challenge all students to reach their \n     potential;\n       Whereas charter schools promote innovation and excellence \n     in public education;\n       Whereas charter schools provide thousands of families with \n     diverse and innovative educational options for their \n     children;\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools authorized by a \n     designated public entity that respond to the needs of \n     communities, families, and students in the United States, and \n     promote the principles of quality, accountability, choice, \n     and innovation;\n       Whereas, in exchange for flexibility and autonomy, charter \n     schools are held accountable by their sponsors for improving \n     student achievement and for the financial and other \n     operations of the charter schools;\n       Whereas 40 States, the District of Columbia, and Guam have \n     passed laws authorizing charter schools;\n       Whereas 4,956 charter schools are operating nationwide, \n     serving more than 1,600,000 students;\n       Whereas, in fiscal year 2010 and the 16 previous fiscal \n     years, Congress has provided a total of more than \n     $2,734,370,000 in financial assistance to the charter school \n     movement through grants for planning, startup, \n     implementation, dissemination, and facilities;\n       Whereas numerous charter schools improve the achievements \n     of students and stimulate improvement in traditional public \n     schools;\n       Whereas charter schools are required to meet the student \n     achievement accountability requirements under the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) \n     in the same manner as traditional public schools;\n       Whereas charter schools often set higher and additional \n     individual goals than the requirements of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) to \n     ensure that charter schools are of high quality and truly \n     accountable to the public;\n       Whereas charter schools give parents the freedom to choose \n     public schools, routinely measure parental satisfaction \n     levels, and must prove their ongoing success to parents, \n     policymakers, and the communities served by the charter \n     schools;\n       Whereas more than 50 percent of charter schools report \n     having a waiting list, and the total number of students on \n     all such waiting lists is enough to fill more than 1,100 \n     average-sized charter schools;\n       Whereas the President has called for doubling the Federal \n     support for charter schools, including replicating and \n     expanding the highest performing charter models to meet the \n     dramatic demand created by the more than 365,000 children on \n     charter school waiting lists; and\n       Whereas the 11th annual National Charter Schools Week is to \n     be held May 2, through May 8, 2010: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the students, parents, teachers, and \n     administrators of charter schools across the United States \n     for ongoing contributions to education, the impressive \n     strides made in closing the persistent academic achievement \n     gap in the United States, and improving and strengthening the \n     public school system in the United States;\n       (2) supports the ideals and goals of the 11th annual \n     National Charter Schools Week, a week-long celebration to be \n     held May 2 through May 8, 2010, in communities throughout the \n     United States; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to hold \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities during \n     National Charter Schools Week to demonstrate support for \n     charter schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3171-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3171-S3172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3815.

shall briefly \n     state for the record the reason for the objection. An \n     objection may properly be made, received, and entered upon \n     the record when it is claimed that such person is entitled to \n     refuse to answer the question on grounds of any \n     constitutional or other legal right or privilege, including \n     the privilege against self-incrimination, but such person \n     shall not otherwise object to or refuse to answer any \n     question, and such person or attorney shall not otherwise \n     interrupt the oral examination.\n       (iv) Refusal to answer.--If a person described in clause \n     (i) refuses to answer any

(II) on grounds of the privilege against self-\n     incrimination, the testimony of such person may be compelled \n     in accordance with the provisions of section 6004 of title \n     18, United States Code.\n\n       (E) Transcripts.--For purposes of this subsection--\n       (i) after the testimony of any witness is fully \n     transcribed, the Bureau investigator shall afford the witness \n     (who may be accompanied by an attorney) a reasonable \n     opportunity to examine the transcript;\n       (ii) the transcript shall be read to or by the witness, \n     unless such examination

writing waives the signing, is ill, cannot be \n     found, or refuses to sign; and\n       (v) if the transcript is not signed by the witness during \n     the 30-day period following the date on which the witness is \n     first afforded a reasonable opportunity to examine the \n     transcript, the Bureau investigator shall sign the transcript \n     and state on the record the fact of the

  furnish a copy of the transcript (upon payment of reasonable \n     charges for the transcript) to the witness only, except that \n     the Bureau may for good cause limit such witness to \n     inspection of the official transcript of his testimony.\n       (H) Witness fees.--Any witness appearing for the taking of \n     oral testimony pursuant to a civil investigative demand shall \n     be entitled to the same fees and mileage which are paid to \n     witnesses in the district courts of the United States.\n       (d) Confidential Treatment of Demand Material.--\n       (1) In general.--Documentary materials and tangible things \n     received as a result of a civil investigative demand shall be \n     subject to requirements and procedures regarding \n     confidentiality,

permitted to adopt rules allowing prior notice to any \n     party that owns or otherwise provided the material to the \n     Bureau and had designated such material as confidential.\n       (e) Petition for Enforcement.--\n       (1) In general.--Whenever any person fails to comply with \n     any civil investigative demand duly served upon him under \n     this section, or whenever satisfactory copying or \n     reproduction of material requested pursuant to the demand \n     cannot be accomplished and such person refuses to surrender \n     such material, the Bureau, through such officers or attorneys \n     as it may designate, may file, in the district court of the \n     United States for any judicial district in which such person \n     resides, is found, or transacts business, and serve upon such \n     person, a petition for an order of such court for the \n     enforcement of this section.\n       (2) Service of process.--All process of any court to which \n

service, \n     by any Bureau investigator named in the demand, such person \n     may file with the Bureau a petition for an order by the \n     Bureau modifying or setting aside the demand.\n       (2) Compliance during pendency.--The time permitted for \n     compliance with the demand in whole or in part, as determined \n     proper and ordered by the Bureau, shall not run during the \n

Specific grounds.--A petition under paragraph (1) shall \n     specify each ground upon which the petitioner relies in \n     seeking relief, and may be based upon any failure of the \n     demand to

  custodian is in custody or control of any documentary \n     material, tangible things, reports, answers to questions, or \n     transcripts of oral testimony given by any person in \n

 is situated, and serve upon such custodian, a petition for an \n     order of such court requiring the performance by such \n     custodian of any duty imposed upon him by this section or \n     rule promulgated by the Bureau.\n       (h) Jurisdiction of Court.--\n       (1) In general.--Whenever any petition is filed in any \n     district court of the United States under this section, such \n

Such order may, by \n     provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the \n     covered person or service provider to cease and desist from \n     the subject activity, and to take affirmative action to \n     correct the conditions resulting from any such violation.\n       (2) Effectiveness of order.--A cease-and-desist order shall \n     become effective at the expiration of 30 days after the date \n     of service of an order under paragraph (1) upon the covered \n     person or service provider concerned (except in the case of a \n     cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall \n     become effective at the time specified therein), and shall \n     remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except \n     to such extent as the order is stayed, modified, terminated, \n     or set aside by action of the Bureau or a reviewing court.\n       (3) Decision and appeal.--Any hearing provided for in this \n     subsection shall be held in the Federal judicial district or \n     in the territory in which the residence or principal office \n     or place of business of the person is located unless the \n     person consents to another place, and shall be conducted in \n     accordance with the provisions of chapter 5 of title 5 of the \n     United States Code. After such hearing, and within 90 days \n     after the Bureau has notified the parties that the case has \n     been submitted to the Bureau for final decision, the Bureau \n     shall render its decision (which shall include findings of \n     fact upon which its decision is predicated) and shall issue \n     and serve upon each party to the proceeding an order or \n     orders consistent with the provisions of this section. \n     Judicial review of any such order shall be exclusively as \n     provided in this subsection. Unless a petition for review is \n     timely filed in a court of appeals of the United States, as \n     provided in paragraph (4), and thereafter until the record in \n     the proceeding has been filed as provided in paragraph (4), \n     the Bureau may at any time, upon such notice and in such \n     manner as the Bureau shall determine proper, modify, \n     terminate, or set aside any such order. Upon filing of the \n     record as provided, the Bureau may modify, terminate, or set \n     aside any such order with permission of the court.\n       (4) Appeal to court of appeals.--Any party to any \n     proceeding under this subsection may obtain a review of any \n     order served pursuant to this subsection (other than an order \n     issued with the consent of the person concerned) by the \n     filing in the court of appeals of the United States for the \n     circuit in which the principal office of the covered person \n     is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit, within 30 days after the date \n     of service of such order, a written petition praying that the \n     order of the Bureau be modified, terminated, or set aside. A \n     copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the \n     clerk of the court to the Bureau, and thereupon the Bureau \n     shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, as \n     provided in section 2112 of title 28 of the United States \n     Code. Upon the filing of such petition, such court shall have \n     jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall \n     except as provided in the last sentence of paragraph (3) be \n     exclusive, to affirm, modify, terminate, or set aside, in \n     whole or in part, the order of the Bureau. Review of such \n     proceedings shall be had as provided in chapter 7 of title 5 \n     of the United States Code. The judgment and decree of the \n     court shall be final, except that the same shall be subject \n     to review by the Supreme Court of the United States, upon \n     certiorari, as provided in section 1254 of title 28 of the \n     United States Code.\n       (5) No stay.--The commencement of proceedings for judicial \n     review under paragraph (4) shall not, unless specifically \n     ordered by the court, operate as a stay of any order issued \n     by the Bureau.\n       (c) Special Rules for Temporary Cease-and-Desist \n     Proceedings.--\n       (1) In general.--Whenever the Bureau determines that the \n     violation specified in the notice of charges served upon a \n     person, including a service provider, pursuant to subsection \n     (b), or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause the \n     person to be insolvent or otherwise prejudice the interests \n     of consumers before the completion of the proceedings \n     conducted pursuant to subsection (b), the Bureau may issue a \n     temporary order requiring the person to cease and desist from \n     any such violation or practice and to take affirmative action \n     to prevent or remedy such insolvency or other condition \n     pending completion of such proceedings. Such order may \n     include any requirement authorized under this subtitle. Such \n     order shall become effective upon service upon the person \n     and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in \n     proceedings authorized by paragraph (2), shall remain \n     effective and enforceable pending the completion of the \n     administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until \n     such time as the Bureau shall dismiss the charges specified \n     in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued \n     against the person, until the effective date of such order.\n       (2) Appeal.--Not later than 10 days after the covered \n     person or service provider concerned has been served with a \n     temporary cease-and-desist order, the person may apply to the \n     United States district court for the judicial district in \n     which the residence or principal office or place of business \n     of the person is located, or the United States District Court \n     for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting \n     aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or \n     effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the \n     administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges \n     served upon the person under subsection (b), and such court \n     shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.\n       (3) Incomplete or inaccurate records.--\n       (A) Temporary order.--If a notice of charges served under \n     subsection (b) specifies, on the basis of particular facts \n     and circumstances, that the books and records of a covered \n     person or service provider are so incomplete or inaccurate \n     that the Bureau is unable to determine the financial \n     condition of that person or the details or purpose of any \n     transaction or transactions that may have a material effect \n     on the financial condition of that person, the Bureau may \n     issue a temporary order requiring--\n       (i) the cessation of any activity or practice which gave \n     rise, whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or \n     inaccurate state of the books or records; or\n       (ii) affirmative action to restore such books or records to \n     a complete and accurate\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\n     state, until the completion of the proceedings under \n     subsection (b)(1).\n       (B) Effective period.--Any temporary order issued under \n     subparagraph (A)--\n       (i) shall become effective upon service; and\n       (ii) unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in \n     proceedings under paragraph (2), shall remain in effect and \n     enforceable until the earlier of--\n\n       (I) the completion of the proceeding initiated under \n     subsection (b) in connection with the notice of charges; or\n       (II) the date the Bureau determines, by examination or \n     otherwise, that the books and records of the covered person \n     or service provider are accurate and reflect the financial \n     condition thereof.\n\n       (d) Special Rules for Enforcement of Orders.--\n       (1) In general.--The Bureau may in its discretion apply to \n     the United States district court within the jurisdiction of \n     which the principal office or place of business of the person \n     is located, for the enforcement of any effective and \n     outstanding notice or order issued under this section, and \n     such court shall have jurisdiction and power to order and \n     require compliance herewith.\n       (2) Exception.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     subsection, no court shall have jurisdiction to affect by \n     injunction or otherwise the issuance or enforcement of any \n     notice or order or to review, modify, suspend, terminate, or \n     set aside any such notice or order.\n       (e) Rules.--The Bureau shall prescribe rules establishing \n     such procedures as may be necessary to carry out this \n     section.\n\n     SEC. 1054.

The court shall have jurisdiction to grant all \n     relief necessary to make the employee whole, including \n     injunctive relief and compensatory damages, including--\n\n       (I) reinstatement with the same seniority status that the \n     employee would have had, but for the discharge or \n     discrimination;\n       (II) the amount of back pay, with interest; and\n       (III) compensation for any special damages sustained as a \n     result of the discharge or discrimination, including \n     litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable \n     attorney fees.\n\n       (E) Other appeals.--Unless the complainant brings an action \n     under subparagraph (D), any person adversely affected or \n     aggrieved by a final order issued under subparagraph (A) may \n     file a petition for review of the order in the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the violation with \n     respect to which the order was issued, allegedly occurred or \n     the circuit in which the complainant resided on the date of \n     such violation, not later than 60 days after the date of the \n     issuance of the final order of the Secretary of Labor under \n     subparagraph (A). Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title \n     5, United States Code. The commencement of proceedings under \n     this subparagraph shall not, unless ordered by the court, \n     operate as a stay of the order. An order of the Secretary of \n     Labor with respect to which review could have been obtained \n     under this subparagraph shall not be subject to judicial \n     review in any criminal or other civil proceeding.\n       (5) Failure to comply with order.--\n       (A) Actions by the secretary.--If any person has failed to \n     comply with a final order issued under paragraph (4), the \n     Secretary of Labor may file a civil action in the United \n     States district court for the district in which the violation \n     was found to have occurred, or in the United States district \n     court for the District of Columbia, to enforce such order. In \n     actions brought under this paragraph, the district courts \n     shall have jurisdiction to grant all appropriate relief \n     including injunctive relief and compensatory damages.\n       (B) Civil actions to compel compliance.--A person on whose \n     behalf an order was issued under paragraph (4) may commence a \n     civil action against the person to whom such order was issued \n     to require compliance with such order.

Mr. President, I commend the Senate in promptly passing \nthe Leahy-Cornyn Faster FOIA Act of 2010--an important measure to \nimprove the administration of the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. \nThis bill will establish a bipartisan commission to examine the root \ncauses of agency FOIA delays and to recommend to the Congress and the \nPresident steps to help eliminate FOIA backlogs.\n  Senator Cornyn and I first introduced this bill in 2005 to address \nthe growing problem of excessive FOIA delays within our Federal \nagencies. In the 5 years since, we have successfully worked together to \nreinvigorate FOIA through several other legislative initiatives. I \nthank Senator Cornyn for his work on this bill and for his leadership \non this issue. I also thank Senators Feingold, Whitehouse and \nKlobuchar, who have cosponsored this bill. We have also worked with \nSenator Grassley and Senator Sessions to make further improvements.\n  The Obama administration has also made significant progress in \nimproving the FOIA process. In March, the administration announced that \nthe number of overdue FOIA cases fell by 50 percent governmentwide \nduring the past year. This is good news. But large FOIA backlogs remain \na major roadblock to public access to information.\n  According to the Department of Justice's Freedom of Information Act \nAnnual Report for Fiscal Year 2009, the Department had a backlog of \nalmost 5,000 FOIA requests at the end of 2009. The Department of \nHomeland Security's report for the same period shows a backlog of \n18,918 FOIA requests.\n  The Associated Press recently reported that more than 67,000 overdue \nFOIA requests remain outstanding across the Federal Government. Their \nreport also indicates that that the government's use of FOIA exemptions \nto withhold information from the public which often contributes to FOIA \ndelays increased during fiscal year 2009.\n  Senator Cornyn and I believe that these delays are simply \nunacceptable. And that is why we introduced this bill.\n  The Commission created by the Faster FOIA Act will make key \nrecommendations to Congress and the President for reducing impediments \nto the efficient processing of FOIA requests. The Commission will also \nstudy why Federal agencies are relying more and more on FOIA exemptions \nto withhold information from the public. In addition, the Commission \nwill examine whether the current system for charging fees and granting \nfee waivers under FOIA should be modified. The Commission will be made \nup of government and nongovernmental representatives with a broad range \nof experience related to handling FOIA requests.\n  I have said many times that open government is neither a Democratic \nissue nor a Republican issue--it is truly an American value and virtue \nthat we all must uphold. The Senate will unanimously pass this \nbipartisan legislation. I hope that the House of Representatives will \npromptly consider this bill so that Congress can send it to the \nPresident before the end of the year.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported amendments be considered; that a Leahy-Cornyn amendment, which \nis at the desk, be agreed to; that the committee-reported amendments be \nagreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If there is no further business to come before the Senate, \nI ask it adjourn under the previous order, following the remarks of \nSenator Mark Udall of Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, we are.\n\n\n                     AMENDMENT NO. 3778 to S. 3217\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a \nbipartisan amendment which Senator Lugar and I have filed based on our \nbill, the Fair Access to Credit Scores Act of 2010. This amendment is \ncosponsored by 17 of our colleagues from both sides of the aisle, which \nI have to say is a rare bipartisan piece of legislation. Our amendment \ncorrects one of the fundamental inequities in our financial system by \ngiving Americans free annual access to their credit score.\n  The problem is that most people have been misled to believe that \npeople have access to a free credit score, but that simply is not true. \nThey only have access to their report. A credit report\n\n[[Page S3292]]\n\ntells consumers what outstanding credit accounts they have open, such \nas student loans or credit cards, perhaps a car or home loan. \nUnfortunately, it tells Americans little else. On the other hand, your \ncredit score, which our legislation makes available, has the critical \ninformation consumers need to know.\n  This score is the very first point of entry into our entire financial \nsystem which rates each and every one of us. It is a number that banks, \nlenders, and large financial firms have easy access to, while hard-\nworking Americans--the engine of our economy--do not have access to it. \nA credit score affects consumers' interest rates, monthly payments on \nhome loans, and can even affect a consumer's ability to buy a car, rent \nan apartment or get phone or Internet service. They can be paying \ninterest rates on their home loan, car loan, or student loan which are \ntwo to three times higher because of their credit score. This inequity \nabsolutely needs to be fixed if Americans are to take control of their \nfinances. How do we expect them to do that if they do not know if their \ncredit score is bad or good?\n  Mr. President, I will be insisting on a vote because we must put \nconsumers back in control of their finances by offering Americans \nannual access to their credit score when they access their free annual \ncredit report.\n  I know lobbyists have been calling everyone in the Capitol. These \ncredit reporting agencies have misled Americans for years, and now \ntheir lobbyists are trying to mislead my colleagues in the Senate. They \nare making calls and asking Members to fight this transparency and \ncoming up with all sorts of phony arguments. The truth is, this \namendment accomplishes what the television commercials and their fine \nprint have claimed for years--the offer of a free credit score.\n  Our bipartisan amendment would simply require that a credit score be \nincluded when a consumer accesses their free annual credit report once \nper year from each agency. This would provide some context for \nconsumers who access their free annual credit report and allow them to \ntake responsibility for their financial situation.\n  Since we filed this amendment--and I want to thank the Presiding \nOfficer who has joined me on this amendment--credit reporting agencies \nand their lobbyists have been hard at work perpetuating fine-print \narguments. They claim our amendment would confuse consumers; that the \ninformation belongs to the agency and not the people; and they have \neven been threatening Members it will cost them jobs in their \nparticular State.\n  I don't have to tell those watching and my colleagues that those \narguments are overstated and are really no grounds for keeping \nAmericans from having access to their individual credit score. \nAccording to credit reporting agencies and their lobbyists, providing a \nfree score for transparency and therefore a sense of financial standing \nsimply would distract and confuse the American consumer.\n  How can they say these scores would confuse Americans, even though \nthey are happy to sell them that same information? These same lobbyists \nwe are discussing also claim that credit scores belong to them. In \nother words, a credit score to gauge the creditworthiness of a \nconsumer, based upon their personal information, is the property of the \ncredit reporting agency, not the consumer. So, in other words, they are \nmaking the argument it belongs to the agency, not to the individual who \ncreates the credit score.\n  I can't help but wonder: Would a doctor say someone's blood pressure \nreading is their information, not their patient's?\n  I have to say I am disappointed to hear these credit reporting \nagencies are even making the suggestion that this amendment might \nresult in job losses in their particular States. These are tough times, \nand who wouldn't be moved by the argument about jobs. But what they do \nnot tell you when they make that argument is that they opposed the 2003 \nlaw that required disclosure of consumers' credit reports and the \nindustry has tripled its business since that time. It has tripled \nbecause consumers have gotten engaged. They care about those credit \nreports. And I would predict that if we have free credit scores, it \nwill only enhance the interest of consumers to have additional \nfinancial literacy.\n  Talking about jobs, I have some of these jobs in my State, but I \ndon't consider deceptive practices and keeping Americans from their \npersonal information to be a kind of jobs program. In fact, if \nanything, not knowing your credit score could be the greatest threat to \nemployment for any given individual. Employers are increasingly using \nthis information to decide whether to hire one person over another.\n  I came to the Senate floor yesterday to speak about the frequent \ntelevision commercials and Internet advertisements we have all seen \nwhich falsely claim to offer consumers free access to their credit \nscore. Their ads clearly indicate to Americans that their credit score \nis critical information. What they do not tell you--and I know the \nPresiding Officer shares some personal experiences with me on this \naccount--is that they want to lure you into a costly monthly monitoring \nservice that can cost hundreds of dollars a year.\n  What is comical about all this is that credit reporting agency \nrepresentatives are walking the Halls of Congress as I speak telling \nMembers that our bill is somehow unfair and unfounded. They want to \nprotect a Federal law that has given them a monopoly on these scores \nand continues to direct unwitting consumers their way. They are using \nthe same tactics of confusion and misdirection to fight our amendment.\n  We agree with the credit reporting agencies that a credit score is \nimportant information, and perhaps their misleading ads, if anything, \nhave convinced consumers they need to know this information. However, \nluring Americans into a costly credit monitoring service is simply not \nfair.\n  As I begin to close, I want to say that we have all come to the floor \nthis week from both sides of the aisle explaining that what we want to \ndo is to protect consumers and to do what is right for Main Street in \nthis important and historic bill we are considering. We have a chance \nto right this wrong here and now. That is why the Consumer Federation \nof America, Third Way, the Consumers Union, and a wide range of \nconsumer advocates support this legislation.\n  While free access to a consumer's credit score is only a small part \nof the larger reforms that are needed, it addresses one of the \nfundamental inequities that pervade the financial system.\n  I wish to thank a group of bipartisan Senators who have held strong \namidst the lobbying blitz by these large multibillion-dollar entities \nto stand with consumers and cosponsors of my bipartisan amendment. That \nlist includes Senators Lugar, Bond, Cochran, Brown of Massachusetts, \nSchumer, Lieberman, Levin, Hagan, Brown of Ohio, Shaheen, McCaskill, \nLautenberg, Menendez, Tom Udall, Gillibrand, Burris, and Begich.\n\n  I hope and expect more Members will join us in cosponsoring this \namendment and vote for it when it comes up for a vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/05/senate-section/article/S3292-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3292-S3293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.
