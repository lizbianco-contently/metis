Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business \nabout the military construction issue I spoke about in July. I raised \nconcerns then about the Pentagon's overseas military construction \nprogram, particularly in Germany, Korea, and Guam, because, as the \nranking member of the Military Construction Subcommittee, I am seeing \nthat we are changing a strategy. Yet we have not had the strategy \nexplained to us. This is the beginning of a huge taxpayer-funded influx \nof rebuilding overseas in a way that I think is perhaps duplicative and \neven against the interests that have been shown in our previous \nstrategy. I think it is time to take a pause.\n  I rise to speak because the GAO has just released a study this week \nthat says we should take a pause. The Military Construction \nSubcommittee, chaired by Senator Johnson--and I respect and appreciate \nhis leadership in this so much--asked the GAO to do a study because we \nwere seeing the Army coming in and asking for what is going to be a \ncommitment for $1 to $2 billion to change their headquarters from \nHeidelberg to Wiesbaden and to add more BCTs than were originally \nintended to stay in Germany. We looked at this and said: Wait a minute. \nWe are getting ready to duplicate a lot of effort that we have made in \nbases in America and at a great taxpayer expense. Yet we are not seeing \nthe backup and the strategy proposed to support this kind of taxpayer \nexpense.\n  Let me start back in the beginning. Prior to the 2010 Quadrennial \nDefense Review, the Army planned to return the four brigade combat \nteams stationed in Europe to the United States in fiscal years 2012 and \n2013. It would save millions annually in overseas stationing costs. \nThis was in response to the Overseas Basing Commission--that was passed \nby Congress--to adopt a force projection strategy. The Pentagon is \nreversing the recent efforts to transform the military and restation \ntens of thousands of military personnel back on U.S. soil. That is what \nthe Overseas Basing Commission recommended, passed by Congress, \nsupported by Congress, and now we seem to see a change in that strategy \nbut without a projection of what the strategy would be.\n  What the Overseas Basing Commission found, and the Pentagon \noriginally agreed with, is that training and deployment of forces was \ndetermined to be superior in the U.S. bases and certainly more cost \nefficient. We learned that there were constraints on transferring the \nmembers of our military into Iraq because we could not use the airspace \nof certain European countries, and we could not go on the train through \ncertain European countries. It was costly to get our troops from \nGermany into Iraq, more costly than it should have been.\n  In addition, there are training constraints. The Overseas Basing \nCommission saw this. Many of us who have looked at bases overseas see \nthat there are training constraints. There are constraints for live \nartillery training. There are constraints for use of the airspace. In \nlooking at this, it was determined we should bring them home from \nGermany to train in America to accommodate our families in America and \nto deploy from America, where we would control the capability to deploy \nquickly and cost efficiently.\n  On that basis, we have invested $14 billion in U.S. bases to \naccommodate the military and the families who were projected to come to \nAmerican bases and have the training capabilities they need. Now we are \nseeing requests for military construction, and it triggered our \ncommittee to say: Wait a minute. We are supposed to be pulling out of \nGermany, but now we are seeing the Army get ready to put $1 billion to \n$4 billion into military construction, to change their headquarters \nfrom Heidelberg to Wiesbaden, and duplicate what we have already done \nin the United States for construction projects in Europe, Korea, and \nGuam, without demonstrating the cost efficiencies or projected future \ncosts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Hearing no \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  Now we are seeing an expensive and duplicative strategy--well, there \nis not a strategy but request for spending. I am asking for a strategy.\n  The Government Accountability Office did issue a report this week \nthat says the Army's justification for keeping the forces in Europe was \nbased on a flawed analysis, and it would cost taxpayers up to $2 \nbillion, from 2012 to 2021, to pay for it. Let me reference a couple \nthings from the report. The GAO found the decision to retain brigades \nin Europe to require the Army to seek roughly $176 million annually to \nsupport the Bamberg and Swineford communities, again in fiscal year \n2013. Those are the communities that would have had Army facilities.\n  The Army now estimates that not returning two of the four BCTs, \nbrigade combat teams, in Europe to the United States could potentially \ncost between $1 billion and $2 billion between fiscal years 2012 and \n2021. It will cost an average of 360 million American dollars per year \nto retain those units in Europe that were scheduled to be moved to \nAmerica.\n  Closing the Heidelberg facility and moving the headquarters to \nWiesbaden--the Army estimated that move from Heidelberg to go to \nWiesbaden would save hundreds of millions of dollars in 2013. But the \nGAO found the Army now admits they will need $150 million annually to \nsupport the continuing operation in Heidelberg because of delays.\n  The GAO goes on to say that the Army has not documented the savings, \nnor why the move is necessary at that cost. The GAO concludes that with \nover $1.3 billion invested since 2004 and another $1.4 billion in \ninfrastructure investments planned for the Wiesbaden consolidation and \nthe recapitalization of medical facilities and the potential to \nincrease costs, it would cost up to $2 billion over the next 10 years \nif all four BCTs were kept in the Europe. The financial stakes are \nhigh.\n  The GAO is recommending in its report that the Secretary of Defense \ntake advantage of a pause before final decisions are made on the Army's \nEuropean force structure, conduct a comprehensive analysis of \nalternatives, and have a process that is credible in determining what \nthe costs are and whether those units should be kept in Europe or, as \noriginally planned and as invested in our military bases in America, \nwhat it is going to cost.\n  The GAO has concluded that we need a comprehensive analysis.\n  It conducted important cost-benefit analyses at the urging of the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee, chaired by \nSenator Johnson. The GAO report findings are instructive. I hope the \nPentagon will pause and take a fresh look at this military construction \nprogram to determine, does it serve our Nation not to move those troops \nback? We prepared the bases for them. The families, the medical units, \nare in the United States now. So, please, I am asking the Pentagon to \ndetermine if it does serve our best military strategy and our taxpayers \nto keep those troops in Europe rather than moving them back.\n  I want to thank Senator Johnson for including a provision in the \nmilitary construction/VA appropriations bill that would restrict the \nlevel of spending in overseas construction. Our bill would restrict the \nuse of MILCON funds for Germany until the Department of Defense \ncompletes the following: an evaluation of the NATO strategy concept \nreview, the U.S. assessment of its defense posture in Europe, a front-\nend assessment of DOD's global posture from fiscal year 2012 to 2016 in \nthe program budget review cycle.\n  I have shared my concerns with the Secretary of Defense. I have asked \nhim, as our committee has asked him, to provide to the Congressional \ndefense committees a comprehensive Army basing strategy for Europe \nbased on these assessments and a projected timeline and a cost estimate \nof what this will be.\n  In Korea, it is the same. We need a cost estimate for the decision \nthat the Pentagon has apparently made to put more troops and families \ninto Korea without any accommodation for the new facilities that will \nbe needed for the accompanied families' military transfer into Korea.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S7099]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank you for allowing me to have the extra 5 \nminutes. I thank the Senator from Maryland. This is a serious issue. \nThe Department of Defense says they are trying to cut back on military \nspending, and this is a place that would be very important, because if \nwe are going to have accompanied service people, more in Korea now, we \nhave got to accommodate those families. There will be a longer duration \nof mission, and we have got to accommodate them.\n  There is going to be a cost, and we have not even seen the cost \nestimates for that yet. We should take a pause on this German MILCON \nuntil we know if that is the right thing for our global strategy. I \nthank the Senator from Maryland for accommodating me on the time. There \nwill be further discussion, I assure you.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the summary from the GAO report be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   U.S. Government\n\n\n                                        Accountability Office,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 13, 2010.\n     Subject: Defense planning: DOD needs to review the costs and \n         benefits of basing alternatives for Army forces in \n         Europe.\n\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans \n         Affairs, and Related Agencies, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       Keeping more Army forces in Europe than originally planned \n     would result in significant additional costs; however, it is \n     unclear the extent to which DOD plans to weigh these costs \n     against the benefits of having additional forces overseas, \n     especially in light of an evolving European strategic concept \n     and U.S. posture plans. In the near term, delays in decisions \n     associated with two initiatives will impact the Army's costs \n     in Europe. First, prior to the 2010 Quadrennial Defense \n     Review, the Army had planned to return two of four brigade \n     combat teams stationed in Europe to the United States in \n     fiscal years 2012 and 2013, which would have saved millions \n     annually in overseas stationing costs by allowing the closure \n     of installations located at Bamberg and Schweinfurt, Germany. \n     However, these plans are on hold pending an announcement of \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's strategic concept \n     planned to be announced in November 2010, as well as ongoing \n     U.S. assessments of the global defense posture, which have a \n     less clear time frame for completion. The decision to retain \n     these brigades in Europe will require the Army to seek \n     funding of roughly $176 million annually to support the \n     Bamberg and Schweinfurt communities beginning in fiscal year \n     2013, according to Army estimates. Second, U.S. Army Europe \n     estimated that closing Heidelberg and moving its headquarters \n     to Wiesbaden would save hundreds of millions of dollars \n     annually beginning in 2013. However, because of uncertainty \n     for the funding of construction in Wiesbaden, Heidelberg will \n     remain open longer than originally planned and the previously \n     estimated savings will be delayed by 2 years or more. As a \n     result, the Army estimates it will need approximately $150 \n     million annually to support continued operations. Both our \n     review and an analysis performed by the Army found gaps in \n     the support used to justify the decision to close Heidelberg \n     and consolidate forces in Wiesbaden. Our work revealed that \n     the original analyses were poorly documented, limited in \n     scope, and based on questionable assumptions. Department of \n     the Army officials also found the U.S. Army Europe's original \n     analysis inadequate and performed another more detailed \n     analysis in mid-2009 that affirmed the decision to \n     consolidate but lowered the estimated savings. In the longer \n     term, if DOD decides not to return two of the four Brigade \n     Combat Teams in Europe to the United States the incremental \n     cost could be significant. The Army estimates that, depending \n     upon the assumptions used, it will potentially cost between \n     $1 billion and $2 billion more from fiscal years 2012-2021 to \n     keep the two brigades in Europe than it would cost to return \n     them to the United States. DOD is reconsidering retaining the \n     brigades in Europe in part because senior military officials \n     in Europe have said that four brigade combat teams in Europe \n     are needed to meet operational and mission requirements. \n     According to DOD officials, the evaluation of U.S. forces in \n     Europe will be primarily focused on whether four combat \n     brigades will be retained in Europe. DOD and Army guidance \n     call for the department to consider alternatives as part of \n     the economic analyses conducted when contemplating \n     construction or real property acquisition, which are \n     decisions that often arise in the basing decision process, \n     but we found that prior analyses have been limited in scope, \n     or based on assumptions that were questionable. Without a \n     comprehensive analysis, the Army may lack sufficient \n     information to determine the most cost effective approach to \n     maintaining a continued military presence in Europe that will \n     align with the evolving North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     strategic concept and U.S. defense posture.\n       Once DOD determines its force structure and basing plans \n     for a region, it then needs to determine the types and \n     quantities of facilities necessary to provide operational and \n     quality of life support to its soldiers and families; \n     however, we were unable to validate whether completed or \n     planned facilities in Europe would meet Army facility \n     planning criteria because U.S. Army Europe planners use \n     inconsistent processes to generate facility requirements. The \n     Army in Europe does not consistently use the official Army \n     facility planning tools that are designed to calculate, using \n     population data and facility space criteria, the facilities \n     required to accommodate forces and ensure that quality-of-\n     life and other facility standards are met. Army officials \n     stated that its facility planning systems do not always \n     include current force structure and installation population \n     data because overseas basing decisions are sensitive and not \n     reflected in the systems before public announcements are \n     made. The Army's systems showed populations at some \n     installations even after anticipated closure dates, making \n     the requirements generated by the systems inaccurate. Army \n     planners in Europe use unofficial, locally developed systems \n     to determine requirements, and we found that planners at \n     different installations were not using consistent methods to \n     calculate requirements for barracks and other facilities. The \n     Army planners in Europe told us that they are developing \n     their own criteria for determining the requirements that \n     varies among the installations. Because these alternative \n     methods are not linked with the Army's official system and \n     its resident facility criteria and vary among the \n     installations, we were unable to determine if completed and \n     planned facilities will meet the Army's quality-of-life and \n     other facility planning criteria. Our inability to validate \n     infrastructure requirements reflects systemic issues that \n     have been brought to the Army's attention, but have not yet \n     been resolved. For example, in a June 2010 report addressing \n     domestic facility requirements, we reported that the Army's \n     Real Property Planning and Analysis System did not always \n     produce reliable results for some types of facilities because \n     the systems have often relied on data that were not complete, \n     current, or accurate. Until the Army has a process to \n     calculate facility requirements based on current and accurate \n     information, the department cannot be assured that planned \n     Army facilities in Europe will meet quality-of-life and other \n     facility standards.\n       We are recommending that DOD require the Army to conduct a \n     comprehensive analysis of alternatives for stationing forces \n     in Europe that, at a minimum, should be done as expeditiously \n     as possible upon the completion of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization's strategic concept announcement and consider \n     the costs and benefits of a range of force structure and \n     basing alternatives. Additionally, we are recommending that \n     the Army develop a consistent process to determine specific \n     facility requirements associated with the various basing \n     options. In written comments on a draft of this \n     correspondence, DOD stated that it concurred with our \n     recommendations and have already initiated a strategy-based \n     assessment of U.S. defense posture to be completed by the end \n     of calendar year 2010 and that the Army intends to develop a \n     central, on line classified site containing Army Stationing \n     and Installation Plan population data that will reflect out-\n     year stationing decisions that are classified due to host-\n     nation sensitivity.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       Since 2004, as part of DOD's Integrated Global Presence and \n     Basing Strategy, the Army has drawn down its forces in Europe \n     and consolidated remaining forces and infrastructure at fewer \n     locations. As a result, according to Army officials these \n     efforts have resulted in significant recurring savings. As \n     shown in figure 1, the Army's plan called for reducing the \n     number of permanent, or enduring, major installations in \n     Europe to six located in Germany at Wiesbaden, Baumholder, \n     Kaiserslautern, Grafenwoehr, Stuttgart, and Ansbach, and one \n     located in Italy at Vicenza. Figure 1 also shows \n     installations located in Germany at Schweinfurt and Bamberg \n     that the Army originally planned to close; however, the \n     status of these installations is now uncertain because of the \n     February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review tentative decision \n     to retain forces in Europe pending a global force posture \n     review.\n       From fiscal years 2004 to 2009, the Army spent \n     approximately $1.3 billion dollars to support its \n     infrastructure transformation and consolidation plans in \n     Europe, The majority of this investment was used to undertake \n     two main efforts: (1) the consolidation of operational forces \n     close to Europe's training facilities at Grafenwoehr, Germany \n     and (2) the consolidation of the U.S. Army Europe's Airborne \n     Brigade Combat Team in Vicenza, Italy. In and around \n     Grafenwoehr, the Army spent about $473 million on facilities. \n     These included new or renovated operational complexes, \n     maintenance and operations centers, and barracks to support \n     Army brigade combat teams and other units. Other work at \n     Grafenwoehr included upgrading a medical and dental facility \n     and constructing a new post exchange and commissary, dining \n     facility, physical fitness center, as well as numerous other \n     facilities to\n\n[[Page S7100]]\n\n     support unit operations, the soldiers, and their families. \n     Looking forward, the Army is planning military construction \n     to build barracks facilities at Grafenwoehr to meet the \n     current barracks standard, though this was not part of the \n     original transformation and consolidation plan. At Vicenza, \n     Italy, the Army has spent about $424 million on facilities to \n     accommodate an expected increase in the forces stationed in \n     Italy. The Army's construction and renovation projects \n     include headquarters and maintenance buildings, barracks, \n     child development centers, and schools at various locations \n     around Vicenza. The remainder of the Army's investment, \n     including Payment-in-Kind and Sustainment, Restoration, and \n     Modernization funds, were used to support transformation and \n     consolidation-related projects throughout Germany, including \n     at Ansbach, Heidelberg, and Kaiserslautern, among others.\n       In addition to the Army's projects at Grafenwoehr and \n     Vicenza, the Army and TRICARE Management Activity have plans \n     for two major infrastructure projects to support forces in \n     Europe at a cost of almost $1.4 billion. These include \n     construction of an Army headquarters facility at Wiesbaden, \n     Germany and construction of a replacement regional medical \n     center adjacent to Ramstein Air Base near Kaiserslautern, \n     Germany. Moving and consolidating several Army headquarters \n     from Heidelberg and other locations to Wiesbaden is the last \n     step in the U.S. Army Europe's transformation and \n     consolidation plan that began in 2004. According to U.S. Army \n     Europe officials, consolidating the headquarters would \n     optimize command and control, intelligence, and signal \n     capabilities; provide a more responsive organizational \n     structure; offer better force protection options than at the \n     current location in Heidelberg; and provide access to a \n     nearby Army airfield. The Wiesbaden location would include a \n     theater-level command and control center, a consolidated \n     intelligence center, and a network warfare center at a cost \n     of approximately $240 million. The first increment of $59.5 \n     million was appropriated for fiscal year 2009 to build the \n     command and control center and the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers began design work for the facility in the first \n     quarter of the fiscal year 2010. DOD's second project is to \n     replace the regional medical center located in Landstuhl and \n     the Medical Clinic at Ramstein Air Base in Germany with a new \n     consolidated medical center adjacent to Ramstein Air Base \n     near Kaiserlautern, Germany at a cost projected at $1.2 \n     billion. According to DOD, this project is being driven by \n     the effort to recapitalize medical facilities worldwide, and \n     was not part of the effort to transform and consolidate Army \n     forces in Europe. The medical center is a major hospital that \n     provides primary care for more than 40,000 military personnel \n     and 245,000 beneficiaries in the European Command. The \n     facility also provides medical support for casualties that \n     are air-evacuated from Iraq and Afghanistan: wounded \n     personnel are flown into Ramstein Air Base and then taken by \n     bus to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, approximately 20 \n     minutes away. According to TRICARE Management Activity \n     officials, a 2002-2003 Army Medical Department study \n     recommended that DOD renovate and add to the existing \n     hospital in Landstuhl. However, in 2009, the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee directed DOD to complete a site \n     assessment for this approach and the Office of the Deputy \n     Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment) \n     conducted a new analysis that included consideration of \n     alternative sites. One of the reasons officials decided upon \n     the new construction adjacent to Ramstein Air Base was \n     because it allows for easier access to the airfield where \n     wounded personnel arrive from combat zones.\n       Many defense organizations are involved in force structure \n     and basing decisions. According to Army, Joint Staff and DOD \n     guidance, unit commanders, U.S. Army Europe, and European \n     Command are responsible for providing analytical support and \n     coordinating proposed basing actions. For example, for \n     stationing actions and unit moves, commanders of units \n     stationed in Europe will review the mission, operational \n     facilities, base support, available resources, potentially \n     including available funds, and political and environmental \n     effects of the proposed basing action. For force structure \n     changes, Army Headquarters or U.S. Army Europe obtains input \n     and comments from affected commands, including European \n     Command, the functional combatant commands and the component \n     commands. Army Headquarters transmits the resulting proposal \n     to the Joint Staff and requests approval by the Secretary of \n     Defense. European Command conducts an assessment of the \n     implications of potential force structure changes, to inform \n     the Joint Staff and Office of the Secretary of Defense of the \n     relative values or benefits and costs or risks. The \n     assessment includes political-military, operational risk, \n     force structure, infrastructure, and resource implications of \n     the proposed change, and it should address alternatives \n     considered, where applicable.\n\n\n  Future Plans for Army Forces in Europe Are Uncertain, but Costs Are \n            Likely to Be Higher Than Earlier Army Estimates\n\n       Keeping the four brigades in Europe will require the Army \n     to seek funds to keep installations open in the near term \n     (fiscal years 2013 and 2014) and future decisions about force \n     structure could result in $1 billion to $2 billion in \n     incremental costs in the long term if four combat brigades, \n     rather than two, are retained. The Army's force structure in \n     Europe is subject to the results of several pending reviews \n     including a comprehensive review of U.S. defense posture \n     worldwide. To date, however, DOD has not announced the \n     details of the scope and timing for the completion of this \n     comprehensive review.\n     Retaining forces in Europe will require the Army to spend \n         additional funds, lowering anticipated near-term savings\n       Delays and changes in decisions will require the Army to \n     seek hundreds of millions of dollars more annually than \n     planned to support facilities in Europe that they originally \n     intended to close. As part of its plans to return two brigade \n     combat teams stationed in Europe to the United States in \n     fiscal years 2012 and 2013, U.S. Army Europe intended to \n     close installations located at Bamberg and Schweinfurt, \n     Germany. However, the decision to retain these brigades in \n     Europe delays or eliminates these savings and, according to \n     Installation Management Command-Europe, will require the Army \n     to seek funding of roughly $176 million annually beginning in \n     fiscal year 2013 to support base operations at these two \n     communities.\n       In addition, U.S. Army Europe planned hundreds of millions \n     in savings by closing Heidelberg and consolidating in \n     Wiesbaden by 2013 and did not program funding to operate this \n     installation beyond 2012. However, because of uncertainty for \n     the funding of construction in Wiesbaden, Heidelberg will \n     remain open longer than originally planned and the previously \n     estimated savings will be delayed by 2 years or more. As a \n     result, the Army estimates it will need approximately $150 \n     million annually to support continued operations.\n       Both our review and the subsequent analyses performed by \n     the Army found gaps in the support used to justify the \n     decision to close Heidelberg and consolidate forces in \n     Wiesbaden. The original analyses were poorly documented, \n     limited in scope, and based on questionable assumptions. Army \n     and DOD guidance describing economic analyses to support \n     military construction projects or decisions about the \n     acquisition of real property indicate that reasonable \n     alternatives should be considered when contemplating \n     projects. For example, DOD Instruction 7041.3 indicates that \n     the analyses should address alternatives that consider the \n     availability of existing facilities and estimated costs and \n     benefits, among other factors. Similarly, Army Pamphlet 415-3 \n     identifies the consideration and evaluation of alternatives \n     as sound economic principles underlying the economic analyses \n     to be performed in support of military construction projects. \n     When we asked to see the original analyses for the 2005 \n     decision, U.S. Army Europe officials provided us with an \n     information paper that had been prepared in response to our \n     request but did not produce documentation to support the \n     original decision. Little detail was available about the \n     alternatives that had been considered, or how quantitative \n     criteria (like cost savings) and qualitative criteria (like \n     force protection and access to airfields) were weighed in the \n     decision. Army officials told us that alternatives to \n     Wiesbaden had been considered in discussions, and that these \n     were rejected in favor of Wiesbaden. In addition, although \n     they noted that estimated cost savings was one of the key \n     reasons for the decision, they also told us that the decision \n     was primarily based on judgment. Furthermore, according to \n     DOD officials, the analysis was not rigorous or documented. \n     Department of the Army officials also deemed the analysis \n     inadequate to defend the operational and business needs for \n     the consolidation and as a result called for additional \n     cost analysis to be conducted by officials from the \n     Assistant Chief of Staff-Installation Management. A \n     subsequent, more robust cost analysis completed in 2009 \n     reduced the estimated annual cost savings to less than \n     half of the original estimate, but affirmed the decision \n     to consolidate in Wiesbaden. DOD has updated its plans and \n     has announced that its current plan is to close the \n     facilities in and around Heidelberg by 2015, but has not \n     yet obtained all the funding to build the new headquarters \n     complex in Wiesbaden.\n     Keeping more forces in Europe than originally planned could \n         cost up to $2 billion in the long term\n       DOD has not yet made a final decision on the number of \n     brigades that will remain in Europe for the long term; \n     however, the Army's Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for \n     Programs (G8) estimates that the long-term incremental costs \n     for keeping the two brigades in Europe will be between $1 \n     billion and $2 billion for fiscal year 2012 through 2021. The \n     projected costs will vary depending on whether forces are \n     sent from the United States to Europe for training to \n     maintain a constant presence in Europe. Figure 2 compares the \n     Army's annual estimated cost for fiscal years 2012 through \n     2021 for keeping the two additional brigades in Europe versus \n     returning them to the United States, assuming no rotational \n     costs. As shown, in years 2012 and 2013 the need to construct \n     facilities in the United States to house the returning \n     brigades would cost more than retaining the brigades in \n     Europe at existing installations. However, Army analyses show \n     that for fiscal year 2014 through 2021 it will cost on \n     average $360 million more per year to retain the brigades in \n     Europe.\n       Several factors make keeping the two additional brigades in \n     Europe more expensive than returning them to the United \n     States. These include the cost to provide schools and \n     commissaries overseas, increased personnel\n\n[[Page S7101]]\n\n     costs due to overseas allowances, and additional funds for \n     needed infrastructure projects to continue operations at \n     Bamberg and Schweinfurt. For example, the Army estimates that \n     for fiscal years 2016 to 2021 it will need approximately $370 \n     million to improve facilities at Bamberg and Schweinfurt to \n     meet quality of life standards because improvements had not \n     been planned for either of these locations as they had \n     previously been scheduled to be returned to the German \n     government.\n       Even with the potential significant long-term costs, senior \n     military officials in Europe have argued that the larger \n     force structure is necessary. In March 2010, the Commander of \n     European Command stated in written testimony that without \n     four brigade combat teams and certain headquarters \n     capabilities European Command assumes risks in its capability \n     to conduct steady-state security cooperation, shaping, and \n     contingency missions and that deterrence and reassurance are \n     at increased risk. He also stated that the loss of certain \n     headquarters combined with significant force requirements in \n     support of Overseas Contingency Operations outside the \n     European Command region makes retaining four brigade combat \n     teams critical to the United States Army Europe's and \n     European Command's mission.\n     DOD's plans for reviewing U.S. global defense posture are \n         unclear, but alternatives under consideration are limited\n       The Army's force structure in Europe is subject to the \n     results of a pending review of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization's Strategic Concept and an accompanying U.S. \n     assessment of the U.S. European defense posture network. The \n     new North Atlantic Treaty Organization strategic concept is \n     scheduled to be unveiled at a November 2010 meeting in \n     Lisbon, Portugal. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review \n     announced plans for a comprehensive review of U.S. defense \n     posture worldwide and the Secretary of Defense issued a \n     memorandum in May 2010 identifying global posture as a \n     critical issue to be scrutinized in preparation for the \n     fiscal year 2012 budget process. To date, DOD has yet to \n     announce the details of the scope and timing for the \n     completion of its comprehensive review of global posture.\n       DOD and Army guidance should prompt the department to \n     consider alternatives when contemplating basing decisions. In \n     our past work, we have found weaknesses in the department's \n     process for adjusting defense global posture and linking it \n     with current strategy. And, even though DOD has stated that \n     it plans to conduct a comprehensive review of global posture, \n     DOD and Army officials told us their review of Army forces in \n     Europe will focus on whether four combat brigades will be \n     retained in Europe. Additionally, until the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization new strategic concept is unveiled, it is \n     not known if DOD and the Army are making basing decisions \n     that will support the new strategy.\n\n\n    Inconsistent Processes to Develop Facility Requirements Hampers \n                      Validation of Facility Needs\n\n       Once DOD determines its force structure and basing plans \n     for a specific region, it then needs to determine the types \n     and quantities of facilities necessary to provide operational \n     and quality of life support to its soldiers and families; \n     however, we were unable to validate whether completed and \n     planned facilities in Europe meet Army facility planning \n     criteria because U.S. Army Europe planners use inconsistent \n     processes to generate facility requirements. The Army in \n     Europe does not consistently use official Army facility \n     planning tools to calculate its requirements. The Army's \n     official tools for determining facility requirements do not \n     use the most current and accurate information for European \n     locations, such as installation population data and, in some \n     cases, planners have used alternative or workaround methods \n     to develop facility requirements.\n       Army guidance directs garrison planning staff to use an \n     Army-wide system, known as the Real Property Planning and \n     Analysis System, to conduct facility requirements analyses \n     which determine requirements for the number, type, and size \n     of facilities needed to accommodate forces stationed at each \n     installation. The planning and analysis system uses \n     installation population data from the Army Stationing and \n     Installation Plan and Army standardized facility criteria \n     needed to support the population and meet mission \n     requirements and quality-of-life standards. For example, the \n     system uses installation population data to determine the \n     required number and size of headquarters and administrative \n     buildings, maintenance facilities, barracks, medical and \n     dental clinics, commissaries, and other support facilities \n     needed at each installation.\n       According to Army officials, the force structure and \n     installation population data used by the Real Property \n     Planning and Analysis System are not current and thus not \n     accurate. Army officials stated that its facility planning \n     systems do not always include current force structure and \n     installation population data because overseas basing \n     decisions are sensitive and not reflected in the systems \n     before public announcements are made. For example, we found \n     in the case of Vicenza that the facility requirements in the \n     planning and analysis system did not track with anticipated \n     increases in the installation population. Specifically, the \n     Army's force structure is expected to almost double in \n     Vicenza, Italy for fiscal years 2010 to 2014, yet the \n     planning and analysis system was not edited to reflect a \n     corresponding increase in facility requirements.\n       Because the stationing data do not always reflect current \n     or planned force structure decisions, U.S. Army Europe \n     planners often use alternative methods to determine facility \n     requirements. However, such methods use spreadsheets that are \n     not linked to the planning and analysis system or the \n     criteria database. And, because the alternative requirements \n     determination methods are not linked with the official \n     planning system and its resident facility criteria and \n     standards, it is unknown if planned facilities will meet Army \n     quality-of-life and other facility standards contained in \n     that system. We found that planners were not using \n     consistent methods to calculate facility requirements. To \n     illustrate, key U.S. Army Europe officials told us that \n     because accompaniment rates for troops in Europe are \n     different than in the United States, Army installation \n     planners in Europe were not using the Army's facility \n     planning criterion for determining barracks and family \n     housing requirements; instead, they are using their own \n     subjective estimates that vary among the installations. \n     Planners explained that it was a challenge to develop \n     these rates because the documents available to them that \n     provided details on installation population were not \n     always up to date and did not accurately reflect future \n     Army force structure decisions. This lack of consistency \n     in the methods used by planners in Europe and not knowing \n     to what extent the planners are using current information \n     to determine facility requirements precluded us from \n     validating whether completed or planned facilities in \n     Europe would satisfy its infrastructure needs.\n       Our inability to validate infrastructure requirements \n     reflects systemic issues that have been brought to the Army's \n     attention, but have not yet been resolved. A 2006 Army Audit \n     Agency report on military construction requirements in Europe \n     noted that Army systems for planning construction projects \n     often contained conflicting or inaccurate information and \n     planners sometimes generated incorrect requirements when they \n     used the systems. Although the Army Audit Agency found that \n     planned military construction projects were adequate to \n     support U.S. Army Europe's installation plans, it also \n     identified concerns with the accuracy of the information used \n     to determine facility requirements in Europe. The report \n     noted that project planners often did not maintain adequate \n     documentation supporting how they determined requirements \n     and, as a result, often had to recreate the information to \n     support their analysis. In addition, in a June 2010 report \n     that examined facility requirements for Army installations in \n     the United States, we found that the Army's Real Property \n     Planning and Analysis System did not always produce reliable \n     results for some types of facilities because the system has \n     often relied on data that are not complete, current, or \n     accurate. For instance, we found that the facility design \n     criteria had not been updated to reflect current standard \n     designs for 47 of the 58 facility types in the system. As a \n     result of our findings, to improve the accuracy and \n     completeness of the Army's Real Property Planning and \n     Analysis System as a tool for generating facility \n     requirements, we recommended that the Secretary of Defense \n     direct the Secretary of the Army to develop and implement \n     guidance that requires the Army Criteria Tracking System \n     which feeds standardized facility criteria into the Army's \n     Real Property Planning and Analysis System to be updated to \n     reflect changes to facility designs as they are made. DOD \n     concurred with our recommendation and stated that the Army \n     has already taken action to enhance the accuracy of its \n     planning systems to better respond to changing requirements.\n\n\n                              Conclusions\n\n       With over $1.3 billion invested since 2004, another $1.4 \n     billion in infrastructure investments planned for the \n     Wiesbaden consolidation and the recapitalization of medical \n     facilities, and the potential to increase costs by up to $2 \n     billion over the next 10 years if all four Army brigades are \n     kept in Europe, the financial stakes are high for DOD as it \n     considers its future posture. Existing guidance should prompt \n     the department to consider analyses of alternatives when \n     contemplating basing options; however, previous Army analyses \n     have not been well documented, and the plans being pursued \n     are based on a previous strategy developed in 2004 and may \n     not be aligned with a new strategic concept that has yet to \n     be determined. In addition, the Army's approach to managing \n     its facilities thus far has resulted in uncertainty \n     concerning whether completed and planned facilities will meet \n     infrastructure needs. Until facility requirements reflect \n     quality-of-life and other standardized facilities criteria, \n     there is inadequate assurance that the Army's facilities in \n     Europe will fully meet the needs of soldiers and their \n     families. Without a comprehensive review the Army may lack \n     sufficient information to determine the most cost effective \n     approach to maintaining a continued presence in Europe.\n\n\n                  Recommendations for Executive Action\n\n       To take advantage of the pause before final decisions on \n     the Army's European force structure are made and determine \n     the best course of action for its European posture, we \n     recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary \n     of the Army to take the following two actions:\n       1, Conduct a comprehensive analysis of alternatives for \n     stationing forces in Europe. At\n\n[[Page S7102]]\n\n     a minimum, the review should be done as expeditiously as \n     possible upon the completion of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization's strategic concept announcement and consider \n     the costs and benefits of a range of force structure and \n     basing alternatives.\n       2. Develop a consistent process to determine specific \n     facility requirements associated with the various options.\n       We are sending copies of this report to other congressional \n     committees and interested parties.

Mr. President, I take this time, first, to thank Senator \nLandrieu for her persistence in bringing forward legislation that is \ngoing to help small businesses. We are on the verge, I hope this week, \nto finally pass in the Senate legislation that will help the small \nbusinesses in our country--H.R. 5297 that is now before us. Hopefully \nwe are going to be able to get this legislation through the Senate.\n  What this bill does is create jobs. I am proud to serve on the Small \nBusiness Committee. We have been working long and hard, and many of the \nprovisions we have supported in our committee on a strong bipartisan \nbasis are included in the legislation that is now before us.\n  This bill is about helping small businesses so we can create more \njobs for our communities. I think my colleagues will all agree and \nacknowledge that more jobs are created through small companies than \nthrough large companies. If we are going to be able to grow our \neconomy, we have to be able to help our small businesses.\n  It is also known that innovation is more likely to come from the \nopportunities from small companies. So we need to pay attention to and \nhelp our small companies help our economy grow. The bill that is before \nus incorporates many of the provisions that have been voted on in a \nbipartisan way by the Small Business Committee. But let me tell you \nthis: I traveled the State of Maryland during our August break when we \nare back in our States. I had a chance to visit all parts of the State \nof Maryland and visited many small business owners. The No. 1 issue \nthey continued to raise with me is the ability to be able to borrow \nmoney, to get credit for their businesses to expand.\n  We spent a lot of time trying to help the Wall Street bankers, but, \nquite frankly, it has not gotten to the small business owners. They are \nnot able to get the type of loan at an affordable cost so that they can \nexpand their businesses. This bill will help. This bill provides \nstrength to the SBA.\n  I think all of us agree, the Small Business Administration has the \ntools to help small companies. But we need to give them the tools that \ncan work in the current economy. So this legislation extends the 7(a) \nloans under the SBA from $2 million to $5 million, the 504 loans from \n$1.5 million to $5.5 million, and the micro loans. They may not seem \nlike a lot of money, $35,000 to $50,000, but that could be the key \npiece of the puzzle necessary for a company to start or expand and \ncreate more jobs in our communities.\n  The legislation also extends the SBA guarantees to 90 percent and \nwaives the costs so we can make it affordable. The legislation sets up \nan intermediary lending program so that we encourage banks to make more \nloans to small businesses. In all, it is estimated that it will \ngenerate $5 billion of credit for small businesses, creating 300,000 \njobs. That is quite a step forward, quite an important step forward to \nhelp our communities.\n  In addition, the legislation includes help to our States. In the \nState of Maryland, we have our own program. Governor O'Malley has a \nprogram that is aggressively helping small companies in Maryland. The \nproblem is, as you know, State budgets are strapped. This bill provides \n$1.5 billion more for the programs our States are operating in order to \nexpand those programs. That will be leveraged to far more than $1.5 \nbillion of new credit to small companies. It will provide substantial \nhelp in Maryland and all of the States of our Nation.\n  The bill also deals with the continuing problem of contracting. If \nyou are a small company, you are trying to get a contract with the \nFederal Government--you do not have a lot of contract officers in your \nbusiness, you are trying to be very efficient, you need help so you can \nget a fair shake in bidding for a Federal contract.\n  Unfortunately, today there have been abuses known as bundling where \nagencies have bundled together a lot of small contracts into a large \ncontract, making it very difficult for a small company to get any part \nof that Federal contract. In addition, there is prime contractor abuse \nin not paying the subcontractors on time, which are generally more \nlikely to be the smaller companies.\n  This legislation incorporates the work of our committee to make it \neasier for Federal procurement officers to enter into contracts with \nsmall businesses. The proposal is estimated to create another 100,000 \njobs in our communities.\n  This is what we need to do. These are not partisan issues. These are \nbipartisan. I do not know of anyone who disagrees with our efforts to \ntry to help small businesses with more credit or make it easier for \nthem to deal with the Federal Government.\n  One other major part that will create jobs in our communities is to \nmake it easier for small companies to be exporting goods to other \ncountries. We all talk about keeping jobs in America. Let's not \noutsource. Let's keep the jobs right here in America. Well, again, if \nyou are a small company, and you are trying to get through the \nbureaucracy of exporting, it can become very difficult. This \nlegislation makes it easier for our small companies to be able to \nparticipate in international trade, keeping jobs here in America, \ncreating more jobs, helping our economy, reducing the balance of \npayment problems we have with other countries. It is a win-win \nsituation for the U.S. economy.\n  In addition, this legislation provides tax relief for small \ncompanies. Tax relief. We all talk about that. You get higher \ndeductions for startup costs so small companies can get help from the \nFederal Government as far as tax relief.\n  It provides tax equity for small companies in the deductions of their \nhealth insurance costs, and allows for the continued writeoff of \ncapital expenditures that were included in the Recovery Act. So there \nare a lot of tools to help small companies grow. But here is the good \nnews: It is done without adding any money to the deficit of the \ncountry. It is totally paid for. We all understand we have to energize \nthe growth of jobs in our economy, but we cannot do it at the cost of \nraising the deficit. This bill provides the tools but makes sure that \nwe do not add to the deficit of the country, again, strengthening the \nunderlying economy so that we get true job growth.\n  I thank all who have been responsible to help bring this bill \ntogether. I think it is an important step forward in creating new jobs \nand helping our economy grow and helping small companies help our \ncountry. I am proud to support this legislation and hope we can move it \nquickly this week and get the tools out there helping our small \ncompanies grow, creating more jobs for the people in our communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, over the last several months I have been \npushing very hard for this legislation that would help small business \nowners in my home State of Washington access the capital they need to \nexpand and create jobs.\n  I stand here today to urge all of our colleagues to put politics \naside and finally allow this critical legislation to pass. I spent the \nlast month crisscrossing my home State of Washington talking to \nfamilies and small business owners about ways that we can create jobs \nand grow the economy. What I heard again and again from so many of \nthese small business owners is that one\n\n[[Page S7103]]\n\nof the major factors that prevented them from growing is their \ninability to access credit. Banks were not lending their money to the \nsmall businesses that were doing better than they have ever done \nbefore.\n  I recently spoke with a small business owner named Alton McDonald who \nowns a grocery store in Tacoma. He told me he wants to hire new \nemployees. His business is primed to grow. But when he went to the bank \nto get a loan he was turned down.\n  I spoke with a small business owner named Peter Aaron, who owns the \nElliott Bay Bookstore in Seattle which has been a local institution for \ndecades. He is doing his best to keep his head above water in these \ntough economic times. But he told me that finding a lender to lend him \nthe money he needs to stay in his business is an ongoing challenge. \nRight now he is struggling to get the financing he needs to put books \non his shelves for the holiday season so that when people come in to \nbuy there is something for them to buy.\n  I had the opportunity to speak with Timothy Robinson. He owns a small \nmanufacturing company in Snohomish County. His small business today \nemploys about 14 people and he is doing well. But he told me that \ndespite his best efforts, he simply cannot get access to the credit he \nneeds to expand. If he could get a bank to give him a loan, Timothy \ntold me he could add 30 people right away, 30 new jobs in Snohomish \nCounty.\n  What I heard from these small business owners and dozens more over \nthe last several weeks was clear: If small businesses were given access \nto credit, they would be able to expand their operations and add new \njobs--as simple as that. Small businesses such as the ones I visited in \nWashington State can be the engines that drive our economic recovery. \nBut that engine needs fuel in the form of credit to run, and that fuel \nis not flowing right now.\n  In communities across my home State of Washington, it has been \ncommunity banks that have taken the lead in providing that fuel for \nsmall business growth. They understand the communities they work in, \nand they work closely with local small business owners to make sure \nthat their needs are met. But the sad fact is that for far too long our \ncommunity banks been ignored in our economic recovery. Since this \nrecession began, we have seen banks fail one after another, lending \ndrying up to our small businesses, and job growth suffering. Meanwhile, \nWall Street institutions such as AIG and Goldman Sachs were deemed too \nbig to fail. The collapse of our community banks has apparently been \ntoo small to notice.\n  That is why last year I introduced the Main Street Lending \nRestoration Act, which would direct $30 billion to help jumpstart small \nbusiness lending.\n  It is why I spoke directly to Secretary Geithner about this several \ntimes. It is why I have been pushing my colleagues hard to make small \nbusiness lending a priority. It is why, when President Obama came to \nSeattle last month, I introduced him directly to several small local \nbusiness owners and we specifically talked about this issue. I believe \nstrongly that we need to focus more on community banks if we are really \ngoing to make progress and bring true recovery to Main Street \nbusinesses.\n  I am proud to stand here today in support of the small business \nlending legislation now before us. This bill takes the most powerful \nidea from my Main Street Lending Restoration Act. It sets aside $30 \nbillion to help local community banks--those under $10 billion in \nassets--get the capital they need to begin lending money to small \nbusinesses again. It would reward banks that are helping small \nbusinesses grow by reducing interest rates on capital they receive \nunder this program. It would help support small business initiatives \nthat are administered by States across the country struggling today \nbecause of budget cutbacks. It does all this while saving taxpayers an \nestimated $1 billion.\n  When I met with small business owners across my State, I spent a lot \nof time talking with them about this bill. I talked about how it would \nhelp them create jobs and grow their businesses. Every single small \nbusiness owner with whom I spoke thought this was a very important \nidea. Many of them had a question for me--a question to which I wish I \nhad a better answer. Their question: Who would oppose this bill? Who \nwould oppose a bill that seems to be such a commonsense solution to a \nmost pressing problem, a bill that would create jobs and help small \nbusinesses grow, boost our economy at a time when it is so desperately \nneeded? Who would stand up and say no? I was asked that constantly. \nUnfortunately, I suspect it comes down to some old-fashioned political \ngames. I fear too many of our Republican colleagues are afraid that a \nvictory for small businesses is a victory for the Democratic Party. \nThey don't want that to happen this close to an election. I think that \nis truly a shame because I believe the challenges small business owners \nface today transcend partisan politics.\n  The truth is that this is a nonpartisan bill. It is a bill that puts \ncredit back into the hands of small business owners. It is a bill that \nputs people back to work. It is a win for small business. It isn't a \nwin for a political party. It is a win for the economy, our workers, \nand our country. I urge my colleagues to put partisan politics aside, \nlisten to the voices of their constituents, listen to small business \nowners, and support this critical legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 5297, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5297) to create the Small Business Lending \n     Fund Program to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to make \n     capital investments in eligible institutions in order to \n     increase the availability of credit for small businesses, to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax \n     incentives for small business job creation, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Baucus-Landrieu) amendment No. 4594, in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n       Reid (for Nelson (FL)) modified amendment No. 4595 (to \n     amendment No. 4594), to exempt certain amounts subject to \n     other information reporting from the information reporting \n     provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n       Reid (for Johanns) modified amendment No. 4596 (to \n     amendment No. 4595), to repeal the expansion of information \n     reporting requirements for payments of $600 or more to \n     corporations.\n       Reid amendment No. 4597 (to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 4594), to change the enactment \n     date.\n       Reid amendment No. 4598 (to amendment No. 4597), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Book of Ecclesiastes says: ``A \nworker's sleep is sweet.'' Because of the great recession that started \nin 2008, millions of Americans have lost sleep. Why? Because they lost \ntheir work. That is why, throughout this Congress, we have been working \nto create jobs. That is why today, with this small business jobs bill, \nwe are continuing to work to create jobs.\n  One of the first things this Congress did was to pass the Recovery \nAct in February of 2009. The Recovery Act cut taxes for Americans by \n$326 billion. That is right. The Recovery Act cut taxes for Americans \nby $326 billion. In their latest report on the Recovery Act, the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office once again reports that the \nRecovery Act is working.\n  That office, CBO, says in the second quarter of this calendar year; \nthat is, in 2010, the Recovery Act ``raised real . . . gross domestic \nproduct by between 1.7 percent and 4.5 percent''--raised gross domestic \nproduct by between those amounts. CBO also says--and I am quoting from \nthem--the Recovery\n\n[[Page S7104]]\n\nAct ``lowered the unemployment rate by between 0.7 percentage points \nand 1.8 percentage points.'' That is right: The Recovery Act lowered \nthe unemployment rate. CBO also says the Recovery Act ``increased the \nnumber of people employed by between 1.4 million and 3.3 million'' \npeople. Continuing, CBO says the Recovery Act ``increased the number of \nfull-time-equivalent jobs by 2.0 million to 4.8 million compared with \nwhat would have occurred.''\n  Just think of that. That is CBO's estimates of the effect of the \nRecovery Act--all positive in all those respects.\n  In March, Congress passed the HIRE Act; that is, the Recovery Act \nlast year, the HIRE Act this year. The HIRE Act includes a payroll tax \nexemption for new hires. The HIRE Act cut taxes by a further $15.5 \nbillion. That law has also helped to bolster job creation.\n\n  I might add that this summer the Treasury Department found:\n\n       From February to May of 2010, an estimated 4.5 million \n     workers who had been unemployed for eight weeks or longer \n     were hired by employers who are eligible for the HIRE Act \n     payroll tax exemption.\n\n  These actions that Congress has taken, therefore, are working.\n  August was the eighth consecutive month of private sector job \ngrowth--the eighth consecutive month. Coming out of the 2001 recession, \nit took 28 months before we had 8 straight months of private job \ngrowth.\n  Since last December, the American private sector has created 763,000 \nnet new jobs. Contrast that with the previous 8 years under the \nprevious administration. During that 8 years, America's private sector \nlost 673,000 jobs.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber shows that. If you look at the \nchart, beginning in January of 2008, the red bars show the job loss. \nThe job loss got greater from January of 2008, April 2008, July 2008. \nAs you see the longer red bars, that shows the greater job loss.\n  Then, beginning with the Recovery Act in 2009, what happened? Look at \nthis chart. This chart shows it. The black bars show action since the \nRecovery Act. The red bars to the left are job loss before the Recovery \nAct. Once the Recovery Act passed, according to the black bars on the \nchart, job loss decreased, steadily decreased in April 2009, July 2009, \nand October 2009. Then, guess what. We start getting positive numbers \nwhere job creation exceeded job loss. Those are the blue bars in \nJanuary 2010, April 2010, and July 2010.\n  So just to repeat broadly, beginning in January 2008, job loss grew \ndramatically, unfortunately, for all those folks. The Recovery Act \npassed in the beginning of 2009, and then job loss got less and less \nand less and less until about October, January of this year, and now we \nhave a net increase of private jobs. The Recovery Act and the HIRE Act \nworked.\n  We still have more to do. We still need to do more to help create new \njobs, and we will not rest until every American who wants to work can \nfind it.\n  We are doing more today. The small business jobs bill we are working \non right now is about helping Americans get back to work. This bill \nhelps by helping small businesses especially hire more workers.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of America's economy. We say that \nmany times because it is true. They are the principal engine of job \ngrowth. Over the past 15 years, small businesses have created two-\nthirds of all new jobs. It is not big business that creates most of the \nnew jobs. Two-thirds of new jobs are created by small businesses. That \nhas been the case for a long time, and I daresay it will continue to \nbe.\n  But the great recession hit small businesses especially hard. Since \nDecember 2007, small businesses lost more than 6 million jobs.\n  This small business jobs bill would help create the right economic \nconditions for job growth. This small business jobs bill on the floor \nnow could help small businesses create as many as 500,000 new jobs.\n  The great recession's credit crunch starved America's small \nbusinesses' access to the capital they need. We hear that all the time. \nI say to the Presiding Officer, I know you do back home in your State. \nIn response, this small business jobs bill will provide small \nbusinesses with access to capital, robust incentives for investment, \nand support for innovation and entrepreneurship.\n  How? Well, this small business jobs bill would give small businesses \n$12 billion in tax cuts--$12 billion in tax cuts aimed at small \nbusinesses. It would increase small business lending. It would help \nsmall business owners get private capital to finance expansion and hire \nnew workers. It would reward entrepreneurs for investing in new small \nbusinesses. It would help Main Street businesses compete with large \ncorporations, and all these things would help small businesses create \nas many as half a million new jobs.\n  Creating jobs is what people want us to do. I might say, I have a \nhard time understanding why some on the other side of the aisle have \nbeen holding this bill up for weeks and weeks. That is their business. \nI do not understand it, but that is their business. This is the kind of \ncommonsense legislation we have before us today that Americans sent us \nhere to do.\n  At last, the end is in sight, thanks to the courageous votes of \nSenator George Voinovich and Senator George LeMieux. I thank them. I \nthank Senator Voinovich and I thank Senator LeMieux on behalf of \nAmericans and on behalf of all the folks, especially small businesses, \nwho want to find jobs.\n  I thank, as well, every other Senator on this side of the aisle for \ntheir votes. I thank those two Republican Senators and the Democratic \nSenators who voted for this bill. Because of all of you, we are finally \nbringing this debate to a close, and it is certainly time to.\n  It is time to pass this bill. It time to help small businesses. It is \ntime to help create up to half a million new jobs. So let us bring this \ndebate to a close. Let us send this targeted tax relief to small \nbusinesses without further delay, and let us pass this commonsense \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, while we are talking about taxes, I wish \nbring up something that is significant to about 26 million Americans. \nIt doesn't deal only with small businesses, but obviously a lot of \nsmall businesses are affected by the issue I bring to my colleagues' \nattention. I do this several times a year. It deals with the \nalternative minimum tax, a tax that I am sure that out of the 26 \nmillion people who might be hit this year if we don't do something, a \nlot those are small businesspeople.\n  The AMT was first enacted by Congress in 1969. The alternative \nminimum tax was created in reaction to some very wealthy and very high \nincome individuals paying no income tax. These high-income individuals \nwere able to do this because they were able to claim a huge amount of \ntax credits and deductions legally.\n  Probably the sensible way to have dealt with this problem would have \nbeen to curtail the proliferation of those tax credits, tax deductions, \nand tax expenditures at that time. Unfortunately, that was not the \ncourse Congress took when the alternative minimum tax was set up, now \n40 years ago. Instead, Congress created this alternative tax system \nthat we call the alternative minimum tax. With the alternative minimum \ntax, an individual must first calculate his regular income tax, and \nthen he must calculate his alternative minimum tax. The taxpayer \ncompares the two numbers and pays the highest figure of tax owed. I \nknow this is complicated, figuring one's taxes twice--as if the regular \nincome tax all by itself isn't complicated enough--but it has gotten \nmuch worse over the decades.\n  The alternative minimum tax has not merely added complexity; it has \nensnared tens of millions of Americans in its clutches. What was \noriginally intended for fewer than 200 very wealthy taxpayers back in \n1969 because they didn't pay any income tax--legally didn't pay any \nincome tax--now has grown to ensnare tens of millions of middle-class \nAmericans.\n  What is really worse is that it was supposed to get everybody to pay \nsome income tax under the theory that if you live in America, even if \nyou take legal advantage of everything the Tax Code allows you to do \nand still pay no tax, you ought to pay something, so the alternative \nminimum tax. But now the IRS tells us that there are a large\n\n[[Page S7105]]\n\nnumber of people--not tens of thousands but thousands--who don't pay \neither the regular income tax or there are ways they don't legally have \nto pay the alternative minimum tax. So it isn't even accomplishing its \noriginal purpose of making sure everybody pays some income tax.\n  The reason it has grown to include many middle-income Americans is \nbecause the exemption amount has not been indexed for inflation. \nCongress has increased the exemption amount so it would be targeted \ntoward those people it was meant to hit--very wealthy people.\n  We keep talking around here about patching the AMT. We have done it \nevery year since 2001. Congress has passed the AMT so that only 4 \nmillion taxpayers have been subject to it in the past few years. At \nthis point, however, the AMT is not patched for 2010. So unless \nCongress acts to patch the AMT, rather than only about 4 million \nAmericans being subject to the AMT, more than 26 million will be.\n  The chart I have here shows my colleagues a breakdown of the number \nof families and individuals State by State subject to the alternative \nminimum tax. These families and individuals should be paying the \nalternative minimum tax right now because Congress hasn't acted so far \nthis year, after 9 months, to do the patch. That means that about 22 \nmillion families and individuals are currently scheduled for quite a \nsurprise come April 15, 2011. Roughly 4 million Americans are \npresumably used to paying the AMT, but the additional 22 million \nfamilies and individuals currently subject to it may not have realized \nthey are standing in a hole dug by this Congress. Until Congress \npatches the AMT in 2010, these individuals should either have their \nwages withheld at a higher rate and/or pay estimated taxes to take into \nconsideration the fact that the AMT has not been patched. But we would \nhave to figure that very few of these 22 million Americans are, in \nfact, paying the higher estimated taxes in anticipation of Congress not \nacting on the AMT. They probably do not know.\n  The third quarterly estimated tax payment is due today. Literally \nright now, taxpayers across the country are under the legal requirement \nto pay their estimated tax. They should be using the form depicted on \nthis chart, the form 1040-ES. I hope I am not here in January when the \nfinal estimated payment is due.\n  It is disappointing that Congress has created a situation where law-\nabiding citizens who still trust in Congress to look out for them are \nat odds with the law, even if only temporarily. The betting money is \nthat Congress will get this job done before the end of 2010, but in the \nmeantime, confusion reigns.\n  In many ways, people simply do not know what to do about this. As I \nsaid, taxpayers don't know how much estimated tax to pay. The IRS \ndoesn't know what forms to be preparing for publication. Tax software \nfirms don't know how they should program their software. Tax \nprofessionals are not sure what to advise their clients. Government \nrevenue estimators don't know whether to count the AMT patch in or out. \nAnd most important, our fellow Americans don't know how to plan their \nfinancial affairs. Can they afford that vacation or can they afford a \nnew car? Can they afford some additional gift to charity? Should they \ncontribute more or less to their 401(k)? The answers to these questions \nturn in part on whether Congress patches the alternative minimum tax.\n  So what is to be done? The 2005 bipartisan tax reform panel had two \ndifferent tax reform options: the simplified income tax and the growth \nand investment tax. But under either option, the bipartisan tax reform \npanel said that Congress should simply repeal the AMT. I think that is \nwhat has to be done.\n  Don't forget the philosophy behind it 40 years ago, not indexed. That \nis why we have to patch, is because 200 people, maybe only 150 at that \ntime, were not paying any income tax. Progressives thought: Well, \neverybody living in this free country, even if they legally don't have \nto pay any income tax, ought to pay ``some tax.'' So that is the \nphilosophy behind it. We have not argued so much with that philosophy \nover the last 40 years. But we are in a situation where the IRS says \nthere are some people in America who legally don't have to pay income \ntax or the alternative minimum tax. Does that make sense? Why would we \nhave that law on the books if it is not fitting its original intention?\n  That is what I would favor--complete repeal of the AMT. If that isn't \nto be done, I would favor then a permanent patch of the AMT. Given \nCongress's actions in this area, it seems likely we will patch it year \nafter year after year, so wouldn't it help with everyone's plans to \nsimply do that once and for all? That is the question. That would be \nthe way to do it. It is predictable.\n  But allow me to address the AMT in the context of statutory pay-as-\nyou-go. The statutory pay-as-you-go was enacted earlier this year as \npart of the majority party's debt limit increase. Some on the other \nside of the aisle have described statutory pay-as-you-go as a fiscally \nresponsible way in which to address the 2001 and 2003 tax relief \nextensions.\n  Statutory pay-go provides that all the regular tax relief for \ntaxpayers under $250,000 is permanent. Statutory pay-go, however, only \nprovides for a patch to the AMT just for 2 years: 2010 and 2011. So \nwhat is going to happen in the next year, come 2012? There are at least \nfour possible options.\n  Option 1 would be: In 2012 and after, AMT will not be patched. But I \ndo not really think that is an option Congress would seriously \nentertain--then or now--to add another 20 some million people paying \nthis tax that middle-income taxpayers were never supposed to pay in the \nfirst place.\n  Option 2: In 2012 and after, AMT will be patched and paid for with \nnew taxes. That would be consistent with what we call statutory pay as \nyou go, but does anyone think that would make sense, pay for tax relief \nwith new tax burdens?\n  Option 3: In 2012 and after, AMT will be patched and paid for with \nspending cuts. In general, I believe that we need to use spending cuts \nto tackle our deficits and debt. But we know our friends in the \nDemocratic leadership are allergic to spending cuts. So, as much as we \nwould like to reign in the record spending spree of the last 18 months, \nI don't see my friends on the other side agreeing to cure their allergy \nto spending restraints. They've rejected roughly $270 billion in \nspending restraints since adopting the much ballyhooed statutory pay-go \nregime.\n  But then there is option 4: In 2012 and after, AMT will be patched \nand not paid for. That certainly is an option I am very open to and \nquite possibly what Congress will ultimately do and has done in the \npast. Money that wasn't supposed to be collected in the first place \nshouldn't be relied on as revenue and so doesn't need to be offset.\n  However, if the AMT is patched and not paid for, then there is a \nhidden $1 trillion revenue loss in the package. This means the deficit \nimpact of the so-called fiscally responsible package is understated by \n$1 trillion. The so-called fiscally prudent statutory pay-as-you-go \nlegislation likely has a $1 trillion understatement of the deficit \nimpact.\n  If fiscally responsible is understating an increase to the deficit by \n$1 trillion, I wonder then what fiscal irresponsibility would be. The \nAMT is a serious problem and needs to be addressed in a comprehensive, \npermanent, prompt, fiscally prudent fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, Senator Baucus of Montana, who just spoke about the \nbill before us. If you go to any State in America and ask those who own \nsmall businesses what their challenges are today, I will guarantee you \nthat in the top one, two or three items, it is access to credit.\n  This bill, this small business jobs bill, will give access to credit \nto thousands of businesses across America so they will have money to \nexpand inventory, to expand their business, to expand their employment.\n  Many of us believe, as Senator Baucus has said, small businesses are \nkey to job growth in America. I cannot explain--I cannot explain--why \nthe Republican Party decided to filibuster this to try to stop us from \neven bringing this bill to the floor over and over and over. We should \nhave passed this bill months ago. It should have been\n\n[[Page S7106]]\n\npassed on a bipartisan basis. The Small Business Committee is one of \nthe most bipartisan committees in the Senate. Yet they have resisted \nit.\n  I wish to join Senator Baucus in thanking two Republican colleagues \nwho had the courage--and it took political courage--to step up and say: \nPut an end to this filibuster. We have to help small business. Senator \nGeorge Voinovich of Ohio and Senator George LeMieux of Florida both \nstepped up, and because of their courage, we passed this bill yesterday \nwith 61 votes--at least moved it forward, I should say, toward passage, \nand that is dramatic, positive progress for us when it comes to dealing \nwith this recession.\n  I also wish to say there was a statement made yesterday. I listened \nto it in my office. It was the stakeout of the Republican leaders after \ntheir luncheon, and I listened carefully as Senator McConnell, the \nSenate Republican minority leader, as well as Senator Kyl of Arizona, \nand others in their leadership, came to the microphones right outside \nthis Chamber and said there should be no tax cuts in America--pardon \nme--there should be no tax increases in America. They came and said \nthere should be no tax increases in America for anyone. They were \nfocusing on the Bush economic policies that gave tax cuts to the \nwealthiest Americans, and these Republican leaders said: There should \nbe no tax increases in America.\n\n  I wish to say that from my point of view, yesterday the Senate \nRepublican leadership, in front of microphones right outside this \nChamber, filed for bankruptcy for the United States of America. If we \ncannot, in the midst of this recession and with our Nation's deficit, \nask for a sacrifice from the wealthiest people in America, then I am \nafraid we have lost our way.\n  Let me quote someone who knows a little bit about policy in \nWashington. His name is David Stockman. I remember David Stockman when \nI first came to Congress because David Stockman was the budget adviser \nto President Ronald Reagan. He was the man who guided the President in \nhis thinking about budgets. So, certainly, he has a Republican resume \nthat is pretty strong.\n  What did David Stockman say about the current state of the Republican \nParty when it came to these issues of deficits and tax cuts? Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       If there were such a thing as Chapter 11 for politicians, \n     the Republican push to extend unaffordable Bush tax cuts \n     would amount to a bankruptcy filing. The nation's public debt \n     . . . will soon reach $18 trillion.\n\n  Stockman said it screams ``out for austerity and sacrifice.'' But, \ninstead, the GOP insists ``that the Nation's wealthiest taxpayers be \nspared even a three-percentage-point rate increase.''\n  Well, I know what the Republicans are likely to say in response. They \nare likely to argue what they have argued for 10 years; that is, if we \ngive a tax break to the wealthiest people in America, then this economy \nis going to prosper. These wealthy people will spend their money and \ninvest their money in a way that will create jobs, which leads to one \nvery basic question. After 10 years of tax cuts for the wealthiest \npeople in America, where are the jobs? After 10 years of tax cuts for \nmillionaires and those at the highest levels of income, where are the \njobs? Eight million Americans are out of work. Another 6 million have \nbasically given up looking for work. We have 14 million unemployed in \nthe worst recession we have ever faced because of Bush economic \npolicies--we have to go back to the Great Depression to see anything \nworse--and it was based on 10 years of tax cuts for wealthy people. \nThis did not create jobs; it created the biggest debt in the history of \nthe United States.\n  Let me digress for 60 seconds or so for history. President William \nJefferson Clinton left office, turning over the keys to the White House \nto George W. Bush. What was the state of the economy in America? Well, \nwe had created some 22 million jobs in the previous 8 years. We had a \nnational debt that had been accumulated--a national debt from George \nWashington through President Clinton of $5 trillion--$5 trillion--and \nthe President said--President Clinton said to President Bush: Welcome \nto Washington. Good luck in your administration. Let me give you as a \nstarting gift from my administration a $120 billion surplus--surplus in \nthe Treasury--not a deficit but a surplus.\n  Now, fast-forward 8 years. Now President George W. Bush has had his \nchance to use his economic policies, and where are we? Well, the \nnational debt has risen from $5 trillion over an 8-year period of time \nto $12 trillion--more than double during that period of time. How does \none more than double the national debt of America in 8 years? Well, let \nme count the ways.\n  First, wage two wars and don't pay for them--wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Secondly, do something no President has ever done in \nAmerican history: give tax cuts in the midst of a war. We have all the \nordinary expenses of our government, and then we have the added expense \nof war, and President Bush and his Republicans in Congress said: Well, \nthe answer to that is to cut people's taxes.\n  Guess what. When you cut taxes, you take money out of the Treasury \nthat otherwise would come in and add to the national debt. Then add a \nfew major programs that President Bush passed and didn't pay for. \nMedicare prescription Part D is a classic example. Though we in health \ncare reform were required by President Obama to pay for it, the \nRepublicans, facing a change in Medicare, did it without paying for it. \nThey added to the national debt.\n  So President George W. Bush left office. The $5 trillion debt under \nPresident Clinton is now $12 trillion, and he said to President Obama: \nI won't be able to hand you that surplus that I was given when I took \noffice. Instead, I am handing you a $1.2 trillion debt in the next \nyear. Ten times more than the surplus offered him, he offered to \nPresident Obama. President Obama took his hand off the Bible being \nsworn in as President, and in the first month faced 750,000 Americans \nnewly out of work. Welcome to Washington, President Obama; a little \ngift from the previous administration. That is what we have.\n  So now come Senate Republicans, and they say: Well, to get out of \nthis recession, clearly what we need to do is do everything over again \nthat got us into the recession, and the first thing we need to do is \ncut taxes on the wealthiest people in America. As David Stockman says: \nIf you can't ask a millionaire to give up a 3-percent tax cut in the \nmidst of what we are facing in this Nation--a millionaire--if you can't \nask for a sacrifice from those who are most well off in our country, \nhow can you possibly govern in a responsible way?\n  Senator McConnell introduced a bill this week which spells out \nexactly what he thinks about the deficit. His bill--a tax cut bill--\nwill add $4 trillion to the national debt. That is $4 trillion unpaid \nfor. Did he raise taxes to give tax cuts to others? No. Did he cut \nspending to give tax cuts to others? No. He just said $4 trillion of \ndebt, here it is, unpaid for. This is the party of fiscal conservatism? \nThese are the deficit hawks? These deficit hawks have had their wings \nclipped--clipped by the richest people in America, and that is their \nposition.\n  If I can transition to another question of debt, it isn't just the \ndebt of our national government, as large as it is, that ought to \nconcern us. There are other debts across America. Americans have $826 \nbillion in credit card debt. Naturally, people are struggling to make \nends meet, and they are going to put more debt on their credit cards. \nThey are going to owe more. So $826 billion in credit card debt.\n  The debt I want to focus on is even larger. The Federal Reserve \nrecently revealed that we passed a milestone in American economic \nhistory in June of this year. For the first time in history, American \nconsumers owe more on their student loans than on their credit cards. \nWe have $826 billion in credit card debt and $850 billion in student \nloan debt. The total national student loan debt is increasing at the \nrate of $3,000 per second. The average college student in 2008 \ngraduated with over $23,000 in student loans. By the time the students \nstart college this fall, when they graduate, they could easily owe more \nthan $30,000 at graduation.\n  Growing student loan debt creates a tremendous burden on recent \ncollege graduates. Recent graduates have a hard enough time finding a \njob in today's economy, but they need a job that pays enough to cover \ntheir monthly student loan payments. Young adults delay decisions to \npursue advanced degrees, buy a home, start a\n\n[[Page S7107]]\n\nfamily, because of student loan debt. We want young Americans to be an \nactive engine for our economy, but too many graduates trapped in debt \nhave to worry about the first paycheck and making the first payment on \ntheir student loans.\n  This week, Education Secretary Arne Duncan announced the 2008 student \nloan cohort default rates. Default rates on student loans across \nAmerica were 7 percent--up from 6.7 percent last year. The cohort \ndefault rate is a snapshot of one group of students, those whose first \nloan repayments came due between October 1, 2007, and September 30, \n2008, and who defaulted on their loans before September 30, 2009. \nDuring that time, over 200,000 borrowers defaulted on their student \nloans within 2 years of leaving college.\n  I was the beneficiary of a student loan when I went to school. It was \ncalled the National Defense Education Act. I couldn't have gone to \ncollege and law school without it. My understanding was--at least I \nfelt an obligation to pay off that loan so that future generations \ncould borrow that money and other students would get a chance to go to \ncollege. Now we find in this cohort 200,000 students already defaulting \nwithin 2 years of leaving college. This shows difficult economic times \nand the trouble young people are having finding jobs after school.\n\n  But a closer look at the data reveals another growing problem. \nDefault rates at for-profit colleges are already far too high and \nrising. The 2-year default rate at for-profit colleges was 11.6 percent \nin 2009, up from 11 percent the year before. In comparison, public \ncolleges had an average default rate of 6 percent; nonprofit colleges, \n4 percent.\n  So let's put the numbers in perspective. The default on student loan \npayments from those graduating from nonprofit colleges nationwide, 4 \npercent; public colleges, 6 percent; and the default rate at for-profit \ncolleges, 11.6 percent in 2009.\n  More than one out of every nine students who take out a student loan \nto attend a for-profit college will default on that loan within 2 years \nof leaving school, and the results are even worse after 2 years. Since \n1995, two out of every five--40 percent of students who attended 2-\nyear, for-profit colleges--defaulted on their student loans. Students \nat for-profit schools represent less than 10 percent of postsecondary \nstudents in America but one-quarter of student loan borrowers and 43 \npercent of all student loan defaults. Defaulting on a student loan is \nnot just a bad economic experience; it can be a disaster.\n  For-profit recruitment officials, however, take it very lightly when \nthey explain to young people what the consequences are of default on a \nstudent loan. The Government Accountability Office investigated 15 for-\nprofit colleges and found that all 15 colleges misled students, \nincluding making false statements about student loans and defaults. One \nrecruiter told a potential applicant:\n\n       I owe $85,000 to the University of Florida. Will I pay it \n     back? Probably not . . . I look at life as tomorrow's never \n     promised. Education is an investment. You're going to get \n     paid back tenfold no matter what.\n\n  Another recruiter taped by a government investigator said, when the \nstudent asked about student loans:\n\n       But it's, workable, you know, it's really workable. And the \n     . . . a lot of people have student loans . . . but the best \n     thing about it, it's not like a car note, where if you don't \n     pay they're gonna come after you.\n\n  That is a lie, and it is that kind of lie that is leading students \ninto debt that they cannot repay.\n  Defaulting on a Federal student loan can have dire consequences for \nthese students for the rest of their lives.\n  Here is what happens if students don't pay back their student loans. \nFirst, the loan will be turned over to a collection agency and they \nwill be charged collection costs over and above the loan up to 25 \npercent. Their wages can be garnished, their tax refund intercepted, \nand their Social Security benefits withheld. Their defaulted student \nloan will be reported to a credit bureau and remain on their credit \nhistory for 7 years after they pay it off. That means they may not be \nable to buy a car or a house or take out a credit card. It might even \nmean they don't get a job if an employer looks at their credit history. \nThey can't take out any more student loans or receive Pell grants to go \nback to school. They are no longer eligible for HUD and VA loans. They \ncan be barred from the Armed Forces and they might be denied some jobs \nin the Federal Government.\n  That recruiter was right about one thing, though: a student loan is \nnot like a car loan. Car loans can be discharged in bankruptcy but not \nstudent loans. A borrower can never escape a student loan, whether it \nis federally guaranteed or a simple private loan for school.\n  I had a hearing in Chicago about 3 weeks ago on these for-profit \nschools. I never saw such a crowd in my life. Do you want to know why? \nThis is a big, profitable business. These schools are dragging in \nbillions of dollars in Federal money that is then being loaned to \nstudents so they can go to school online or at these so-called for-\nprofit schools. They end up with a worthless degree, if they graduate, \ndeep in debt. They default on the loans and the government loses.\n  So I went to this hearing with 450 people showing up at this hearing \non for-profit colleges.\n  I didn't expect an amazing turnout. There were picketers on the \nsidewalk outside the Federal court building. Lo and behold, they were \nthere for me. I went up to the students and said to them: Hi, I am Dick \nDurbin. I am going up to the hearing. What are you kids doing here? \nThey said: We are students at the Illinois Institute of Art, which is a \nschool in Schaumburg, a suburb of Chicago. They were dressed similar to \nthe people you see on ``Top Chef.'' I don't know the name of the white \ntunic they wear. I said to them: So you are at this for-profit college. \nWhat are you studying? They said: Culinary arts. One said: I want to be \na cook and own a restaurant. I said: How much does it cost you in \ntuition to go to this school?\n  Well, it is a 2-year course in culinary arts, and the tuition is \n$54,000. Do you know what the starting pay is for people in a \nrestaurant, a cook? It is about $10 an hour. So I said: Are you \nconcerned about paying back this student loan? The answer was: Yes, but \nsomeday I may own a restaurant. Well, they may. These students were \nmisled into believing they were going to get a job to pay them enough \nto pay back that student loan, but very few will be able to do so. \nThere just isn't that much money in that line of work. I wish we could \nsuspend all the ``Top Chef'' shows on the cable networks for a couple \nyears so kids will stop signing up for $50,000 training courses and \nborrowing student loans they can never pay back to become the ``top \nchef.''\n  For some, I wish them the best, but it is going to be impossible--\ndifficult at least--for them to pay their loan back. For another school \nthat was upstairs, it was $41,000 for the culinary arts degree.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, who is also from Illinois, we have \nsomething called the City College of Chicago. Do you know what the same \nculinary arts course, over a 2-year period of time, which is just as \ngood, same course, same training--what it costs in tuition for 2 years? \nIt is $12,000. It is $12,000 to go to a city college, a community \ncollege, for culinary arts. But it is $54,000 to go to the Illinois \nInstitute of Art--whatever that is--out in Schaumburg. You may say to \nyourself that these students are dragging themselves deeply into debt \nthat they may never get out of, and the default rate at for-profit \ncolleges is outrageous. It is double what it is for many other schools \nacross America.\n  The growing levels of student loan debt and the increase in defaults \nare undermining our economic recovery. Instead of contributing to the \neconomy, many graduates and former students are doing all they can to \ndig out of debt.\n  While high tuition levels and student debts are a problem across \nhigher education, I am particularly troubled by these for-profit \ncolleges. Low-income students come to these colleges in droves, lured \nby promises of high-paying careers and flexible courses. Did you see \nthat ad on cable TV saying you can get a college degree in your \npajamas? It shows this beautiful young girl in her pajamas saying: I am \ngoing to college in my pajamas.\n  Here is an alert to young people across America: You are not going to \nearn a college degree in your pajamas. You have to dress up and be part \nof the world and go to school. I understand that you can go online, and \nfor many\n\n[[Page S7108]]\n\npeople that is a great way to go to school, but it takes more than \nlounging around the house and going online and ending up with a \nworthless degree. One of the persons who testified in our hearing was a \nyoung girl who is a graduate in law enforcement from the Westwood \nCollege. Ever heard of it? I haven't. She went to school there in \nChicago; it took her 5 years. She got a bachelor's degree in law \nenforcement because she wanted to work for the Chicago Police \nDepartment or the Sheriff's Department. She wanted to be a professional \nthere and she would have a bachelor's degree. They laughed at her when \nshe showed them that degree. Westwood College? They didn't even accept \nor recognize it. There she sat, after 5 years of education, with a \nworthless degree. Do you know what it cost her? It cost $86,000 in \nstudent loans. That is how much she owed for that worthless degree. Now \nshe cannot get a Federal student loan to go to a community college. She \ncannot get a Pell grant. She is paying $600 a month and living in her \nparents' basement.\n  That is the reality of life for these young people who are lured into \nthese for-profit colleges. What are the biggest recipients of Federal \nloans in America today when it comes to those colleges? No. 1, \nUniversity of Phoenix, the Apollo Group. How many undergraduate \nstudents do they have? They have 480,000 undergraduate students--more \nthan the combined undergraduate enrollment of the entire Big Ten \nschools. No. 2, Kaplan; No. 3, DeVry; No. 4, Penn State University, \nwhich offers online courses. They are taking out the lion's share--25 \npercent--of all Federal student loans for education help to for-profit \ncolleges and have 43 percent of the student loan defaults. It tells the \nstory.\n  Low-income students don't know any better. They are signing up for \ncourses with promises that can't be kept. I went to the Web site of \nRoosevelt University, an established college in Chicago, to look up \nsome information, and I was bombarded with ads from these for-profit \nschools. I called the President of the school and said: Chuck, have you \nlooked at your own Web site? You can't find Roosevelt on there. There's \nArgosy and Corinthian and all these things thrown at you. Imagine a \nyoung person who is trying to decide where to go to school.\n  It is time to look at risk sharing when it comes to student loans. \nThese for-profit colleges ought to be on the hook. If they are going to \nlure young people into debts they can't pay, they ought to have some \nskin in the game and say: If there is going to be a default, we are \ngoing to pay a price too. Secondly, I am sick and tired of these \nschools that are not accredited and are being given money for Federal \nstudent loans. If your school is not accredited and if your hours \ncannot transfer to another school, you should not receive Federal \nloans. Students should not have to go through a research investigation \nto decide whether a school is accredited. That is not their job and \nshould not be. It ought to be our job as a requirement. We ought to say \nthat if you want to qualify for Federal aid for education, you have to \nbe an accredited school. If it is a phony school, you don't get Federal \nmoney. That ought to be the basics.\n  Today, school officials are working with incentives, incidentally, \nthat push companies to bring in the highest volume of financial aid, \nwhich means they will sign up anybody who can qualify. They don't care \nif you can read or write. Literally, they will put you on as one of \ntheir students earning a baccalaureate degree, and they will get the \nmoney from the Federal Government. Incidentally, they complained \nrecently because we capped how much Federal money a for-profit college \ncan receive of their revenues at 90 percent--and they complained. \nColleges that have burdened students with this debt, without giving \nthem the skills and credentials, should share a piece of this default \nrisk. Maybe then the colleges would focus less on bringing in as many \nstudents as possible, at the highest tuition as possible, and focus \nmore on preparing students to succeed. We need to seriously consider \nthis risk sharing, as well as other ideas to bring student loan debt \ndefaults under control. I look forward to working with my colleagues.\n  Look at your own States. For those of us who have voted reflexively \nfor Federal student loan increases and Pell grants, the party is over. \nI will not stand by and watch billions in taxpayers' money funneled \ninto for-profit schools that heap debt on the students and fail to give \nthem the training and degree they need to succeed in life. It is time \nto bring this to an end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the legislation before us is the small \nbusiness bill, which includes a number of provisions. I have stated \nbefore in comments on the floor that there are a number of concerns I \nhave about the $30 billion lending fund that is included in what is now \nthe Baucus-Landrieu substitute amendment to the small business bill.\n  I simply say, in reaction to the comments of the Senator from \nIllinois, because a suggestion was made that somehow Republicans were \ntrying to block this bill, I think everybody should know this is being \ndebated under a procedure that is very unique. The Democratic leader \nfilled the tree, which blocks Republicans from offering amendments. So \nit should come as no surprise that the minority party would react \nnegatively to not being able to have any of their amendments considered \nor voted on in a debate about legislation such as a small business \nbill, which we happen to think is very important.\n  The suggestion was made by the Senator from Illinois that, again, \nsomehow Republicans are being resistant to or blocking this, I think, \nmisses the broader point, which is that there are a number of us who \nhave amendments we would like to offer to try to improve the bill and \nmake it better. But the majority party has filled the tree, and that \nmeans, in layman's terms, that they are not going to allow any \namendments. This is being considered under a procedure that doesn't \nallow us to offer amendments, and I have a couple that are filed at the \ndesk. If I were permitted to do so, I would offer them. I think they \naddress what are some of the fundamental shortcomings in this \nunderlying legislation.\n  I don't think we ought to be using taxpayer dollars to establish this \nnew fund--this $30 billion lending fund or what I like to refer to as \n``TARP III''--and there is a section 103 of the substitute amendment \nthat creates this small business lending fund. Part of that section \nallows a bank that received TARP funds to refinance into the newly \ncreated small business lending fund. Obviously, there are advantages to \nthis refinancing because this new lending fund was created specifically \nto avoid the negative association with TARP.\n  While I have serious concerns with allowing these banks to refinance \ninto this new program, at least the legislation prevents those banks \nthat are behind in dividend payments from refinancing into this new \nfund. I would give the underlying legislation credit in that regard. \nWhat the legislation fails to do, however, is provide a similar \nprohibition on those banks that are behind in their TARP payments from \napplying to receive even more capital from the Treasury to this new \nfund. They can't refinance, but they can get more funds from the \nTreasury, even though they are delinquent in their payments already to \nthe TARP fund.\n  According to the most recent report, on July 21, 2010, there were 105 \nTARP recipients who took funds through the Capital Purchase Program \nthat missed their scheduled dividend payment. That is $157.7 million in \noutstanding obligations to the Treasury through TARP.\n  Keep in mind, there were over 70 banks under $10 billion in assets \nthat have received TARP funds through the Capital Purchase Program. Of \nthe six largest banks over $10 billion, all but one have paid back \ntheir obligation. Of the 701 banks under $10 billion in assets, there \nare 625 banks with outstanding investments.\n  If you are a bank that took money from TARP and are behind in what \nyou owe the taxpayers, you should not be allowed to take more money \nfrom the Treasury. This is a major loophole in this legislation.\n  My amendment, No. 4614, would make sure those banks that are \nnonpaying TARP recipients would not have access to more capital through \nthis fund.\n  A bank would not extend a second loan to a customer who is behind in\n\n[[Page S7109]]\n\ntheir first loan. Why wouldn't we, as the American taxpayers, provide \nthe same restrictions when it comes to a loan through the Treasury? It \nseems to me that is a fairly straightforward understanding that we \nought to have. If you are delinquent on your first loan, you should not \nbe able to get a second one. As I said before, that is a shortcoming in \nthis legislation.\n  My amendment would correct that. I think this is an important \nsafeguard that ought to be included. Having said that, that is not \nenough to make this legislation stronger and better.\n  At the end of the day, I still believe the small business lending \nfund will be a reincarnation of TARP. This is not something I can \nsupport.\n  While I am opposed to the inclusion of this fund in this small \nbusiness bill, I am particularly concerned that we are not adequately \nmeasuring the cost of this provision. When I say that, I point out that \nthe CBO, Congressional Budget Office, scored the small business lending \nfund, and when they did that, the analysts produced two estimates, \nwhich is a rare departure from their standard procedure.\n  One cost estimate was based on a cash-basis method of cost \naccounting. The other was based on fair market value. The former \nestimated that the small business lending fund would save taxpayers \n$1.1 billion over 10 years. That is using the cash-basis accounting \nmethod that I mentioned earlier. The fair market value estimate \nsuggested this fund would result in a $6.2 billion net loss in taxpayer \nmoney over that same period.\n  You have a $7.3 billion difference on a $30 billion fund, and I think \nthat is due to the inadequacies in the cash-basis method of accounting, \nwhich does not include adjustments for market risk. That is why I think \nthe CBO submitted two different cost estimates, which, as I said, is a \nsort of departure from their common practice.\n  To quote the Congressional Budget Office--and this is important:\n\n     . . . cost estimates made under the Federal Credit Reform Act \n     [which is what we use in terms of making estimates of what \n     things will cost] do not provide a comprehensive measure of \n     the cost to taxpayers primarily because the Federal Credit \n     Reform Act methodology does not include costs that stem from \n     certain risks in lending--risks that private investors would \n     require compensation to bear.\n\n  CBO goes on to say:\n\n       In particular . . . it does not recognize a cost for the \n     risk that losses from defaults will be higher during periods \n     of market stress when resources are scarce and most valuable.\n\n  That is from the Congressional Budget Office pointing out the flaws \nin the traditional way in which the cost of a program such as this \nwould be accounted for.\n  Phrased differently, with this fund taxpayers are assuming an \nuncompensated level of risk as lenders of last resort, and this risk is \nnot accounted for in the cash-basis cost estimate.\n  While I believe the movement of the Federal Government to ownership \nof private companies in and of itself is a disturbing trend and is one \nthat needs to be stopped and rolled back rather than promoted in \nadvance, it is critically important that these programs include a \nproper accounting of their costs--something that is lacking in this \nsmall business bill.\n  What my amendment No. 4610 would do is require the Congressional \nBudget Office to score Federal Government purchases of equity purchases \nor capital investments on a fair-value basis that considers market \nrisk. In other words, it would use the convention that was used in the \noriginal TARP bill that was passed back in 2008. This change would be \nconsistent with what private companies are doing in terms of moving \ntoward a fair-value method of accounting because of its superiority to \na cash-basis method of accounting.\n  This is not the first time this more accurate method of scoring would \nhave been used by the Congressional Budget Office. As I said, when the \noriginal TARP program first moved through Congress, it included an \nimportant provision that the cost of the bill be calculated using a \ndiscount rate adjusted for market risk. Yet, despite all the \nsimilarities between this bill we are debating today and TARP, this \nbill does not have any such provision. Because of this, many Senators \nand Members of Congress believe this bill will save money for the \ntaxpayers, when, in fact, the opposite is true. If you use the fair-\nvalue method of accounting, as I said earlier, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, this provision--this $30 billion mini-TARP \nprogram--has a net cost of $6.2 billion as opposed to a savings of $1.1 \nbillion if you use the cash method of accounting. The most \ncomprehensive estimate we have from the CBO is that the $6.2 billion \nwill be more reflective of the actual cost, but because the cash-basis \nmethod of accounting is used, this cost is not going to be added to the \npay-go scorecard.\n  One of the most important duties we have as Senators and Members of \nCongress is to be vigilant in watching the taxpayers' money and how it \ngets spent. This duty has taken on increased importance as the Federal \nGovernment and Federal spending has exploded and our national debt has \nnow surpassed $13 trillion.\n  A quick point on that point. Before I got up to speak, the Senator \nfrom Illinois was talking about the Federal debt. Of course, as is \ntypically the case around here, when one of my Democratic colleagues \ngets up, they think that all that happened is all Bush's fault. \nAnything bad in America today, it is Bush's fault. What he did not \nmention, of course, is the fact that on January 2007, the Democrats \ntook control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Since \nthat time, they have been writing the budgets. We all know that under \nthe Constitution, the President cannot appropriate a single dime. It is \nCongress that appropriates money. Since January of 2007, it has been \nthe Democrats who have been writing the budgets around here.\n  Even if you give them the benefit of the doubt and say when the \nPresident came to office in January 2009 and you measure it from that \npoint forward to where we are today, we have added almost $3 trillion \nto the Federal debt--almost $3 trillion since January of 2009 when this \nPresident took office. If you were breaking that down into terms people \ncan understand, if you are a child under the age of 18 in America \ntoday, when the President took office in January of 2009, the debt for \na young person under the age of 18 was $85,000. Today, it is $114,000. \nSince this President has taken office, the share of the Federal debt \nfor an average American under the age of 18 has increased by $29,000. \nBy the year 2016, that number will be $196,000. Mr. President, do you \nwant to know why? Because the debt is projected to explode over this \nnext decade. In fact, it took 232 years and 43 Presidents to rack up \nthe first $5.8 trillion in debt. In the next 5 years, we are going to \ndouble that and triple it under the President's budget.\n  I will be the first to admit that Republicans are not perfect, and \nwhen we were in charge of the Congress, there were certainly things we \nshould have done better in terms of getting our fiscal house in order \nin Washington. But to say for a moment, as the Senator from Illinois \ntried to imply when he was on the floor, that somehow this was a \nfunction or a problem that was created by the Republicans or somehow by \nBush is just absolutely inconsistent with the facts. As I said, \nDemocrats took control of this Chamber in January 2007. The President \nbecame President of the United States in January 2009. Since January \n2009, the Federal debt has grown $3 trillion.\n  There is a whole lot of spending going on around here that is being \nroutinely ignored by Members on the other side when they get up to \nspeak, such as a $1 trillion stimulus bill that was designed to keep \nunemployment under 8 percent. We all know unemployment today is well \nnorth of 9 percent. In fact, with no end in sight, the amount of \nspending and borrowing that continues today, in my view, puts in \njeopardy the opportunity for this economy to recover and begin to \ncreate jobs, which is what all of us want to see happen.\n  But when you spend $1 trillion and borrow it and you hand the bill to \nyour children and grandchildren, when you create a massive new \nexpansion of health care which, when fully implemented, will cost the \ntaxpayers $3.2 trillion and at every turn continue to spend more and \nmore, at some point you have to say, when you are in a hole, you ought \nto quit digging. That is precisely where we are. We are in a deep, deep \nhole.\n  The first rule should be: do no harm. When it comes to spending and \nthe\n\n[[Page S7110]]\n\ndebt, the administration and the current leadership of this Congress \nhave taken that to a whole new level. That is a comment about this debt \nand one of the reasons this legislation is so important and why it is \nimportant that we get it right in terms of accounting for the true \ncosts of the underlying bill.\n  It is my belief that the fair-value method of accounting provides a \nmuch more accurate, much more transparent, and much more comprehensive \nway of accounting for the costs and benefits of these programs. To \nignore the risks these programs pose to the hard-earned money of \nAmerican taxpayers is simply to stick our heads in the sand and hope. \nThis is not a responsible strategy for governing, and I hope my \ncolleagues will work with me to update this outdated method of scoring \nwith regard to this $30 billion mini-TARP that is included in the small \nbusiness bill.\n  While I have many concerns with this bill, some of which I just \noutlined, we are debating what I think was a well-intended bill with a \nlot of good provisions and many I support. There are a number of \nprovisions in this bill which, left to themselves, I think will be \ngood. I am a member of the Small Business Committee. We made \nadjustments in the small business lending program, increasing loan \nsizes and guarantees for SBA 7(a) and 504 loans and temporarily \nreducing the fees for some of those loans. It updates SBA's very \noutdated size standards and provides much needed tax relief through \nbonus depreciation, section 179 expensing, and allowing business \ncredits against the alternative minimum tax.\n  There are provisions in this bill that I think do get at providing \nassistance to small businesses, but I cannot support a new program that \nputs more taxpayer dollars at risk. The American taxpayer is expected \ntoday--this is with the most recent estimate--to lose $66 billion \nthanks to the original Troubled Asset Relief Program, the TARP, and \nthis current legislation reincarnates that TARP through a $30 billion \nTreasury fund that will be used to inject capital into banks that are \nthen directed to lend to small businesses.\n  Treasury and the administration have tried various programs through \nTARP to increase small business lending without any success, mostly \nbecause of a lack of interest on the part of the banks. Again, this \nlack of interest is likely attributed to the fact that many banks \nrecognize the negative stigma that accompanies accepting TARP money, \nand that is why I think the Democrats and the administration are trying \nto create a new fund and call it something other than TARP. The actual \nlanguage in this amendment provides assurance to banks that by \naccepting this money, they would not be TARP recipients. That is \nactually specified in here because they want to get rid of the original \nstigma that comes with the original TARP. In their talking points, even \nthe White House admits the ``program would be separate and distinct \nfrom TARP to encourage participation.'' Essentially, what they are \nsaying is, We are not going to call it TARP. We are going to call it \nsomething different. If we call it TARP, banks will not participate, \nand we want to encourage banks to participate.\n  The administration goes on to say that ``the administration's \nproposal would encourage broader participation by banks, as they would \nnot face TARP restrictions.'' These ``restrictions'' the White House is \nreferring to include limits on executive compensation and warrant \nrequirements--many of the restrictions included in the original TARP \nprogram.\n  I wish to point out for the benefit of my colleagues that Elizabeth \nWarren, who serves as the chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight \nPanel, has criticized the manner in which TARP funds have been provided \nto smaller banks--15 percent of which cannot even make payments to the \nTreasury regarding TARP funding they received. The new fund relies on \nthe same problematic lending structure that has been deemed a failure \nunder TARP.\n  I wish to quote what this Congressional Oversight Panel said about \nthe Small Business Lending Fund.\n\n       The small business lending fund prospects are far from \n     certain.\n       The small business lending fund also raises questions about \n     whether, in light of the Capital Purchase Program's--\n\n  That was the program under the main TARP--\n\n     poor performance in improving credit access, any capital \n     infusion program can successfully jump-start small business \n     lending.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Banks are subject to a stigma for accepting government \n     money no matter the name of the program.\n       The small business lending fund looks uncomfortably similar \n     to the TARP.\n       Like the Capital Purchase Program--\n\n  In the original TARP--I continue to quote from the Congressional \nOversight Panel's report--\n\n     the small business lending fund injects capital into banks, \n     assuming that an improved capital position will increase \n     lending--despite the lack of evidence that the Capital \n     Purchase Program--\n\n  Again, the original TARP--\n\n     did so.\n\n  This lending fund does not affect the capital issues affecting banks \n``nor any of the issues affecting small business credit demand.'' It \ngoes on to say that such a fund ``runs the risk of creating moral \nhazard by encouraging banks to make loans to borrowers who are not \ncreditworthy.''\n  That is all from the Congressional Oversight Panel's report about the \nvery Small Business Lending Fund--the concept we are debating as part \nof the small business bill.\n  I am ready to close, but the point I am trying to underscore with \nthis amendment is that the same flawed structure for repayment that is \nnot working for small banks under the current TARP is included in the \nlegislation before the Senate. Knowing this, we are purposefully \nremoving some of the safeguards created through the original TARP, \nallowing TARP recipients who are behind in their payments--people who \nare delinquent in their payments--to participate in the new program and \nget even more funding under this new mini-TARP program.\n  I believe there are more responsible methods to support our small \nbusinesses than through a $30 billion Treasury line of credit for \nbanks. Let's focus on the programs we know work. As I said, some of \nthem are included in this bill, such as the SBA 7(a) and 504 loan \nprograms. Let's not create a new Treasury fund and hope somehow in the \nend it is going to pay off. History has proven otherwise.\n  We all know small businesses are the economic growth engine in our \neconomy. They are what keeps this economy growing. Two-thirds or three-\nquarters of the jobs in our economy are created by small businesses. \nDespite spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a stimulus bill, \nthe Nation's unemployment rate is still at 9.5 percent. How many more \nbillions are we going to have to spend before we realize that might not \nbe the correct solution to this problem?\n  Let's pass a good bill that helps small businesses grow and prosper, \nnot another version of a failed TARP program. I think we, as Members, \nought to be able, in the context of this legislation, to offer \namendments. These two amendments I have spoken to this morning are \nexamples of amendments that would make this bill stronger and that we \nare being blocked from offering because of the procedure under which \nthe leader has determined this bill ought to be considered.\n  That is unfortunate. It goes against the very nature of the Senate, \nwhich is a place that tends to be free-flowing and open to debate and \nwhere all Members have an opportunity to speak to legislation and to \nget their amendments voted on. That has not been the case here. And I \nregret that, but we are where we are. We are going to have a vote \nlater, and I hope my colleagues will vote to defeat this bill.\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I want to say one thing to my esteemed \ncolleague from South Dakota. I went all around the State of Minnesota \nduring this recess. I had 118 meetings. Many of them were economic \ndevelopment meetings all around the State. Over and over and over I \nheard from small businesses that they can't get access to capital, and \nI heard from commercial bankers that they can't lend capital because \ntheir regulators are saying: Well, we are going to have to write that \nall off.\n\n[[Page S7111]]\n\n  Small businesses want this. This is not toxic asset relief, as TARP \nwas. This is small business lending. Small businesses create 70 percent \nof new jobs, and this is something that Minnesota's small businesses \nwant and the Small Business Administration in Minnesota wants.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   FDA Food Safety Modernization Act\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I rise today, Mr. President, to speak in support of food \nsafety legislation. Food safety is a topic that affects every single \nAmerican. Food safety is something we all care about because we all \neat. American consumers spend more than $1 trillion on food each year, \nand each year there are an estimated 76 million cases of foodborne \nillness, including at least 5,000 deaths a year in our country. That is \nwhy it is time that this important piece of bipartisan legislation be \nbrought to the floor. We have waited far too long to do our job and to \ncomplete our work on the issue. We have waited too long to pass a bill \nthat will save lives.\n  In November, we unanimously voted S. 510, the bipartisan FDA Food \nSafety Modernization Act, out of the HELP Committee--unanimously. At \nthe time, we were talking about the recent outbreaks of E. coli in \nspinach and salmonella in peppers and peanut butter. But months have \npassed and we have still not brought the bill to the floor. In the \nmonths since we have passed the bill out of committee, we have already \nhad more outbreaks of salmonella--from black and red peppers in 44 \nStates and frozen tuna in 6 States. Seven states have been affected by \nraw milk outbreaks, including my home State of Minnesota. Eighteen \nstates have been affected by salmonella in frozen dinners. And this \nsummer, we have seen one of the worst outbreaks in recent history. From \nMay to September of this year, 1,519 illnesses were reported that are \nlikely to be associated with contaminated eggs. That includes at least \n14 Minnesotans. And we may still see more cases before this awful \nsituation has been resolved.\n  With all these cases of illnesses and the recalls taking place, I \nthink we all understand the serious threat contamination poses to our \nfood supply. We have heard repeatedly, and correctly, that our current \nfood safety system is broken. The system relies too heavily on reacting \nto outbreaks after they have occurred instead of preventing their \noccurrence in the first place. This is why we need to pass Federal \nlegislation now. We must stop more Americans from getting sick and \nbring our country's food safety system into the 21st century.\n  S. 510 will provide FDA with the resources and authorities it needs \nto properly oversee that safe food comes to our table. There are a lot \nof great provisions in this bill, and I want to highlight a few that \nare most important to us in Minnesota.\n  First, the bill would give FDA the authority to require certification \nof imported food and verify that the food coming from foreign suppliers \nis safe. Our food safety system was set up in the early 1900s, and a \nlot has changed since then. The key difference is that we have a lot \nmore imported food than ever before. The truth is that even if we do \neverything right with our food products here in the United States, \nabout 15 percent of our food comes from other countries. S. 510 gives \nthe FDA new authority so we can avoid situations such as the 2007 \nmelamine contamination in the infant formula and pet food coming from \nChina.\n  Secondly, S. 510 would get the FDA out and inspecting food producers \nmore often and require them to keep better records. Right now, FDA \nvisits a given food facility every 10 years, on average. A lot can \nchange in 10 years. Ten years is not frequent enough to assure safety.\n  The issue is primarily one of lack of resources. As the number of \nfood producers has increased, FDA's capacity has remained stagnant. \nThis bill would provide FDA with the resources to inspect more \nfrequently and target the facilities with the greatest risk for \noutbreaks. FDA would also have the authority to require better \nrecordkeeping and access records if there is a reasonable probability \nthat a problem is occurring.\n  Lastly, S. 510 would also make sure the FDA is equipped to trace and \nrecall food quickly when it needs to. Right now, there are a lot of \nprocessed foods with a lot of different ingredients and there are no \nrequirements for anyone to track where they come from, and when there \nis a problem, FDA can't force a company to recall its product, even \nwhen there is overwhelming evidence to do so.\n  Let me give an example of why these traceback and recall provisions \nare particularly important. In late 2008, the Minnesota Department of \nHealth noticed an elevated number of salmonella cases. My State has one \nof the best surveillance systems in the country, and after \ncomprehensive investigations, the Minnesota scientists identified the \nKing Nut brand of peanut butter as the culprit, produced by the Peanut \nCorporation of America, or PCA.\n  Minnesota folks worked with the FDA and the CDC, and in January \ncompanies began to voluntarily recall products with potentially \ncontaminated products. But it was difficult for the company to know \nexactly where the contaminated peanut butter had ended up. So the \nrecall was expanded three different times to try to get hold of the \noutbreak.\n  Most companies complied. But on March 23, 2009, the FDA asked the \nWestco Fruit and Nut Company to voluntarily recall all of its products \ncontaining peanuts from PCA because of the contamination threat. Westco \nrefused. This company willingly put American lives in danger. And since \nthe FDA doesn't have mandatory recall authority--now--it wasn't until \nApril 27, 2009--36 days later--at the request of the FDA, that U.S. \nMarshals seized about $35,000 worth of PCA peanuts and products \ncontaining PCA peanuts at Westco because of possible salmonella \ncontamination. So even after the tainted products were identified, it \ntook almost 5 weeks to get the salmonella-laced peanut products off the \nshelves and away from where they could harm people.\n  This contamination and the subsequent investigation led to weeks of \nmultiple company recalls of more than 2,000 different products from the \nshelves. But if the FDA had been able to immediately trace foods back \nto their producers and demand they be recalled, it could have withdrawn \nthe contaminated foods much more quickly, saved lives, and prevented \nillness. Because so much tainted peanut butter got into our markets, \nthe whole debacle was estimated to have cost the industry nearly $1 \nbillion and led to the loss of innumerable jobs.\n  But the greatest cost was to American families. Because of the \ntainted products that PCA sent to market, over 700 Americans became \nill, half of them children. Nine people died, three of them from my \nhome State of Minnesota.\n\n  One of those who died was Shirley Almer, a Minnesota mother of three \nsons and two daughters. She had survived brain cancer and was in good \nhealth at the time of the outbreak. There was Clifford Tousignant of \nDuluth, a Korean war veteran, father of six, grandfather of 15, and \ngreat-grandfather of 14, who died. And Doris Flatgard of Bergen, MN, \nwho had been married to her husband John for 65 years before she died \nfrom eating peanut butter on her morning toast.\n  I wanted to recount this outbreak because there are lives that were \nlost because we failed to protect the American people.\n  The bill we referred out of the HELP Committee takes some steps to \nimprove the traceback infrastructure, but I think we can do more. I \ndecided to work on this issue when Shirley Almer's three sons came and \nmet with me and told me about how their lives had changed since they \nlost their mother; how their family would never be the same. They told \nme about the contaminated peanut butter, about how it had been included \nin countless products across the country, but we couldn't track the \nproblem down fast enough since we don't require companies to keep track \nof where ingredients come from.\n  That is why I have been working closely with my colleague Senator \nBrown of Ohio to strengthen the traceability provisions in S. 510. I \nthink we have made some good progress and I am hopeful the bill will be \neven better because of our efforts.\n\n[[Page S7112]]\n\n  S. 510 includes a lot of other great provisions too and there is not \nenough time to talk about them all. But I do know that many elements of \nthe bill were inspired by the great food safety work we do in \nMinnesota. We are a national leader, especially in early detection of \nfoodborne disease. I am pleased that my colleague from Minnesota, \nSenator Klobuchar, has a great provision we hope will be in the final \nbill to enhance our Nation's foodborne illness surveillance.\n  Mandatory recall authority, traceability, more frequent inspections, \nbetter recordkeeping, and safer imported foods--these are just a few of \nthe reasons why we need to get the food safety bill to the President's \ndesk, and we need to get it there now. Not later, but now.\n  This is legislation that every member on the HELP Committee, on both \nsides of the aisle, voted to favorably report. Every Member of this \nbody recognizes the importance of food safety to the American people. \nThe FDA Food Safety Modernization Act will finally give the FDA the \ntools it needs to do its job and keep Americans safe. So I urge the \nmajority leader to bring this critical legislation up before we head \nhome in October. We can't afford to wait any longer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \njob creation and what this Congress needs to do in order to make sure \nthat our businesses have the best chance of succeeding in what is a \nvery difficult business climate.\n  I have the privilege of representing the great State of Florida--\n18\\1/2\\ million people. The economic difficulties we are having now are \nas difficult as anybody can remember. We are No. 1 in being behind on \nour mortgage payments; No. 1 on mortgage foreclosures for the first \nhalf of the year, and unemployment is at record highs--near 12 percent. \nNo one can remember a recession as difficult as the one we are \nexperiencing.\n  I think it is our job, as Members of Congress, to do what we can \nwhere we can be helpful to try to get people back to work. In Florida, \nour small businesses are struggling. When I drive down the State roads \nof Florida, down Federal Highway in southeast Florida, or I am in \nTallahassee on Monroe or I am over in Pensacola or in Jacksonville or \nwherever I am in the State--and I spent a lot of time in the State \nduring our work period in August visiting with business owners--I see \nmore and more doors that are shut, small businesses that have been \nclosed.\n  I talked to a woman today who owns a small strip shopping center. She \nsaid in the past 3 years they have gone from being 95 percent occupied \nto 55 percent occupied. Businesses are struggling. That is why I was \nproud to work with Senator Landrieu and others to fashion a small \nbusiness bill, a bill I believe is going to help our small businesses \nget back to work.\n  The small business bill does three things, principally, that I think \nare going to help small businesses. First, it is going to cut taxes on \nsmall businesses by $12 billion--a tax cut for small businesses. Among \nthose tax cuts is a 100 percent exclusion of capital gains tax for \nthose who invest in a small business. There is a provision to allow \nfirms to immediately write off 50 percent of the cost of new equipment, \nand there is a doubling of the tax deduction for expenses for start-up \nbusinesses to $100,000. These will allow businesses to pay less taxes, \nto buy new equipment, hopefully hire new people, and get Floridians and \nAmericans back to work.\n  The bill also has a lending facility, a $30 billion lending facility \nthat is going to bring money to small community banks to get loans to \nthem--not Goldman Sachs, not Citibank, not Wall Street but the banker \ndown the street, the banker who knows the small dry cleaners, the local \npaint shop, those small businesses that employ our friends and \nneighbors. If these banks do not loan the money, they will have to pay \na higher interest rate back. They cannot just keep the money on their \nbooks to make their balance sheets look better. If they want to \nparticipate in this program--and it is voluntary, by the way--if they \nwant to participate and get these dollars out to small businesses, they \nhave to lend them out.\n  All over Florida small businesses tell me they cannot get a loan, \nthat their credit line has been frozen. If they are some of the few \nbusinesses that have a chance to expand, they cannot do so because they \ncannot get the needed capital.\n  I visited one of those businesses this past week in Florida, a \nbusiness by the name of UniQueso. They are a family business, two \nbrothers, and they make dairy products, principally focused on the \ngrowing Hispanic community in Florida. They have had great success \nbecause this is a market that wants more of these wonderful products. \nThey are moving their business from Cocoa to Orlando, FL. They are \nbuilding a new plant. I had a chance to tour it. They are going to open \nin about a month, and they are growing their business. They are \ndoubling the number of their employees. They are going to produce 10 \ntimes more product than they did at their previous location--just the \nkind of story we want to hear.\n  But even though they have a good business plan, even though they are \nmaking money, 10 banks denied them loans. What did they do? This \nfamily-owned business had to sell off a majority share in their company \nto get an investor so they could expand. At least they were able to \nfind a private investor, but they should not have had to give up \ncontrol of their family business just to succeed in the marketplace \nwhen no bank would give them a loan.\n  I believe this small business bill, while it will not cure every \nproblem, is a good start. It is not going to cure all the troubles we \nhave in this economy. That is why I am proud to support it. Frankly, \nthere are not a lot of folks on my side of the aisle who support this \nbill. But I have to look at this bill for what it means for Florida and \nthe country. It does not increase the debt, it does not increase the \ndeficit, it does not increase taxes--it cuts taxes--and it is going to \nhelp small businesses with tax cuts and the credit they need to build \ntheir small business and, hopefully, put people back to work. That \nsounds good for Florida. It sounds good for America.\n  But we need to do more. Where I do differ with my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle is that we have taken steps in this Congress in \nthe past year and a half that have been chilling to business and job \ncreation. When I talk to business folks in Florida, they tell me this \nnew health care law is keeping them from hiring new employees. They do \nnot understand it, it is complicated, it is thousands of pages. They \nunderstand if maybe they hire that next employee, they will come within \nthe confines of the bill and will be fined if they do not offer the \ntype of health care the Federal Government has mandated.\n  The financial regulation bill we passed in this Congress has caused \nconfusion and anxiety among businesses in Florida, some of which have \ntold me they are going to move a portion of their business to the \nBahamas so they will not fall under these regulations. That is jobs \nthat will leave Florida.\n  Small business in Florida is frozen in its tracks because of an \nuncertain regulatory burden from Washington and now the specter of new \ntaxes. At the end of this year, the tax cuts that were put in place \nnearly a decade ago are set to expire. If those tax cuts expire, we are \ngoing to raise taxes during a recession, and we are going to raise \ntaxes on small businesses. As many as three-quarters of a million small \nbusinesses in America will be impacted by higher taxes at the end of \nthe year if Congress does not act.\n  Look, I walked across the aisle to work with my colleagues from the \nother side on something that made sense for job creation. I know now \nthat there are four or five or six of my colleagues on the other side \nwho are saying let's not raise taxes on anybody during recession. We \nneed to work together. We need to work together to be problem solvers. \nIt does not make any sense to raise taxes during a recession. It \ndoesn't make any sense to raise capital gains taxes, which will stop \ninvestment. It doesn't make any sense to raise the taxes on dividends, \nwhich will hurt seniors, which will hurt people who invest in \ncompanies, which will chill business. It doesn't make any sense to \nraise taxes on small businesspeople who, we know, create two out of \nevery three jobs in this country--more than that in my home State.\n\n[[Page S7113]]\n\n  I hope we will work together to extend the current policy for \neveryone and not raise taxes in the middle of a recession.\n  Let me say there is one more thing this Congress can do right now to \nhelp job creation. We have three pending trade agreements--with Panama, \nwith Colombia, and with South Korea. The President of the United States \nsaid in his last State of the Union Address that he wants to pass these \nfree-trade agreements. He wants to promote trade and exports with \nforeign countries.\n  Why haven't we taken them up? Why haven't we passed them? Colombia \nand Panama are huge trading partners of my home State of Florida. If we \npass these free-trade agreements, we will create jobs in Florida almost \nimmediately. Let's get out of the business of pulling huge levers on \nthis economy, imposing new restrictions, and burdens and taxes on \nbusinesses. Let's promote trade. Where we act, let's act judiciously, \nwith the surgeon's knife and not the bureaucrat's bludgeon.\n  Business is hurting in this country, small business especially, \nhurting very much in my home State of Florida. I think there is a way \nfor us to work together to do these things which will put Americans \nback to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Federal Employees\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about \nthe continued disparagement of our Federal workforce. I also want to \nspeak about the opportunity we have for long-term investment in making \nour government work better for all Americans.\n  Earlier this month, people across the country took time to mark Labor \nDay. It is a moment to celebrate one of the chief American values that \nhas helped make this country so great, that is, hard work. Employees in \nevery industry tirelessly each day not only realize their own share of \nthe American dream, but also because it is part of our culture to \nstrive for success in every task we undertake.\n  I have seen the same quality every day throughout my career, \nexemplified in all the outstanding government employees with whom I \nhave met and worked. That is why I have been coming to the floor each \nweek to honor a great Federal employee. All of those I have so honored \nwork extremely hard and serve with dedication.\n  In June, I spoke from this desk about how efforts to scapegoat \ngovernment workers with threats to freeze their pay or cut hiring are \ncounterproductive and how proponents of such measures use flawed \nanalysis of compensation data to make their argument.\n  I was dismayed and upset to see once again an article in USA Today \nmaking the claim that Federal employees earn more than double that of \nprivate sector employees. USA Today based their article on the newly \nreleased data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and, quite frankly, \nthey did a very poor job of it.\n  Unfortunately, their findings have been circulated to other papers \nand on television and are being used as fodder for political attacks \ndirectly against those who work in government jobs. The article's lead \nstatistic is based on 2009 BEA data that shows the average amount spent \nby the Federal Government--not the average salary, the average amount \nspent by the Federal Government--on salary and benefits for each \nworker, is $123,049. For the average private sector employee in this \ncountry, they figure $61,051. This statistic would truly be shocking if \nit were true.\n  The newspaper also points to a trend, a growing pay gap, between \nFederal employees and those in private companies. That trend is also \nbased on a flawed reading of statistical data.\n  In my remarks of June 17, I went through their early analysis of \nFederal compensation data from 2008 and explained the flaws in their \nmethodology and how they drew spurious conclusions. This latest study \nsimply repeats the mistakes they made last time.\n  Let me list several common analytical errors. No. 1, the analysis did \nnot consider differences in experience and education. The data does not \nmeasure similar populations sometimes, even USA Today concedes. The \narticle says that with regard to the gap in pay between Federal and \nprivate sectors: ``The analysis did not consider differences in \nexperience and education.''\n  The analysis does not take into account the statistically significant \nfact that the private sector workforce is 52 times larger than the \nFederal workforce. There are 101.3 million private sector workers. \nSimply put, there are far more people proportionally in the private \nsector earning low wages than the Federal sector, only 1.9 Federal \ncivilian employees, because the government has outsourced so many of \nits low-paying jobs.\n  This is like matching apples and oranges. Our Federal workforce has \nalso become far better educated in the last 20 years, which translates \ninto greater earning power. The most egregious mistake made by USA \nToday in its last analysis, which I spoke about in June, was trying to \ncompare data from two different Bureau of Labor Statistics studies. The \nnumbers the paper used for private sector salaries comes from the BLS's \nNational Compensation Survey, while the numbers used for its Federal \nemployee salaries are from another data set, the Occupational \nEmployment Statistics Program.\n  Even the BLS has warned against comparing data from these sets \nagainst one another. On its Web site it says:\n\n       Occupational wages in different ownership groups (the \n     private sector, and state, local, and federal governments) \n     are influenced by many factors that the [Occupational \n     Employment Statistics] measure cannot take into account. It \n     goes to list examples, such as ``level of work performed,'' \n     ``age and experience,'' and ``cost of living'' adjustments \n     for large urban areas.\n\n  For many of the occupations being compared, the total number of \nFederal employees in a given category is miniscule compared to the \ntotal employed in the private sector; therefore, leaving the \nstatistical analysis in the lurch.\n  For others, the job categories in the private and public sectors are \nsimply not comparable. One great example is broadcast technicians. \nAccording to USA Today, broadcast technicians in the Federal Government \nearn an average of $132,000 a year, while those in the private sector \nearn only a little more than $88,000.\n  However, what USA Today does not tell its readers is that according \nto the very same data set they use, there are only 110 broadcast \ntechnicians working in the entire Federal Government. In the entire \nnational workforce, according to the same data, there are 33,550 \nbroadcast technicians. This means the broadcast technicians in the \nFederal Government represent three-tenths of 1 percent, three-tenths of \n1 percent of the total.\n  One can hardly compare them, especially since, according to the OPM, \n99 percent of broadcast technicians in the Federal Government work for \nthe Broadcasting Board of Governors here in Washington and are \nbroadcasting throughout the world.\n  I know very well from personal experience that BBG technicians \nrequire much more experience and education than the average private \nsector broadcast technician working at radio and television stations \nacross the country, many of which are very small.\n  The same is true for clergy. Most of the 810 clergy in our Federal \nworkforce are employed by the Veterans Health Administration. I think \nit is reasonable to take a guess at what clergy might be doing at the \nVA--working as chaplains and counseling our wounded warriors. There are \n42,040 clergy employed in this country, many of them with small \ncongregations that cannot afford to pay much salary. It is impossible \nto draw conclusions by comparing 800 Federal clergy to over 42,000 \nclergy based on compensation alone.\n  Let's take a look at another one. Highway maintenance workers are \nsaid to make an average of $11,344 more each year in the Federal \nGovernment than in the private sector. However, if we look at the data, \nwe find there are only 50 highway maintenance workers\n\n[[Page S7114]]\n\nin the entire Federal workforce. When USA Today compares this to the \ntotal number in the private sector, how many highway maintenance \nworkers are they looking at for an average? The answer is 5,190. That \nis 104 times more.\n  But this brings us to the other problem. Some of these jobs, like \nhighway maintenance worker, do not have truly comparable positions in \nthe Federal Government. When searching through the Office of Personnel \nManagement's human resources data, one cannot even find such a \ncategory. The 50 who work in the Federal Government, who were listed in \nthe BLS survey under this category, are likely performing very \ndifferent, and quite possibly more highly specialized work, than most \nof the highway maintenance workers in the private sector.\n  The Federal Government is not like any private industry. Federal \nemployees perform functions directly relating to public health, \nnational security, and financial stability. Jobs in the Federal \nGovernment routinely involve decisionmaking that affects millions of \nlives.\n  Over the past 20 years, after calls in the 1980s and early 1990s to \nstreamline government, many Federal jobs not directly related to \n``inherently governmental functions'' have been outsourced. This is a \ngood thing. As a result, the demographics of the Federal workforce have \nbeen transformed perhaps even more dramatically than most realize. That \nis the subtext behind the data chosen by USA Today.\n  By far, most of the jobs now performed for the government by private \nsector contractors are entry level and low wage. This includes \nmaintenance workers, customer-service agents, security guards, and \nother jobs that typically receive smaller salaries.\n  Correspondingly, a larger share of the jobs still held by Federal \nemployees is higher wage, supervisory, and professional--such as \nphysicists, doctors, and highly specialized IT experts.\n  At the same time, the size of the Federal Government is virtually \nunchanged since the 1960s, even though our Nation has grown by 40 \npercent in the same period. According to the OPM, in 1960 there were \n1.8 million Federal employees. Today, there are 1.9 million. Looking at \nthis chart, one can see that the Federal workforce has shrunk \ndrastically compared to the number of Americans its serves on a per \ncapita basis. The total population of the United States was 180 million \nin 1960, and it has risen to over 300 million today.\n  These days, Federal employees are working harder than ever. In fact, \nand I have said this before, the USA Today is right about one thing. \nThere is a public-private pay gap, but it goes the other way.\n  The Federal Salary Council reported last October that civilian \nFederal employees are making, on average, over 26 percent less than \nprivate sector workers in comparable jobs. This gap continues to widen.\n  I am thrilled that there are so many outstanding individuals who have \nchosen to work in public service knowing that they could probably make \nmore money in the private sector. But the pay gap has certainly \ncontinued to discourage many talented Americans from making that \nchoice.\n  Like all important decisions we make about government, our mission to \nrecruit and maintain the best possible workforce must feature a \nstrategic approach.\n  I think Linda Bilmes, of Harvard's Kennedy School, and Max Stier, the \nPresident and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, put it best \nwhen they wrote:\n\n       The fundamental mistake . . . is to think of the federal \n     workforce as a cost rather than as a resource that delivers \n     specific benefits to the nation.\n\n  That was from an op-ed in the Boston Globe in February.\n  The great Federal employees I have honored from this desk over the \npast 16 months are just a few examples of government workers who are an \nasset and make great contributions to the government but, more \nimportantly, to the country.\n  As Director of the Office of Public Housing Programs at HUD, Nicole \nFaison inherited a rental assistance program rated as ``high-risk'' by \nthe GAO for 13 years due to rampant waste, fraud, and abuse. She \nquickly turned it around, eliminating over $2 billion--that's billion \nwith a ``B''--in fraudulent payments what is that worth?\n  Eileen Harrington and the Federal Trade Commission's ``Do Not Call \nTeam'' brought peace of mind to dinner tables around the country when \nthey designed and implemented the national registry to stop \ntelemarketing calls. Tens of millions have benefited.\n  Dr. Gareth Parry, who retired last year after a long career at the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, worked to create risk assessment models \nfor our Nation's nuclear facilities. His efforts significantly improved \nthe safety of communities near nuclear plants and those who work there.\n  I could go on and on and on.\n  But the example of Dr. Parry leads me to an important point we here \nin Congress must consider. There is a lot of data on the demographics \nof our Federal workforce. While some choose to point to compensation, \nthe statistic I think is most pressing and needs the most attention is \nthat of retirement eligibility.\n  Currently, there are two retirement systems for civilian Federal \nemployees. Those who began work before 1984 fall under the old civil \nservice retirement system, or CSRS. All employees hired after 1984 \nparticipate in the Federal employees retirement system, or FERS. In \n1997, the number of employees eligible to retire under CSRS was 12 \npercent. In 2006 it had climbed to 37 percent. That is over a third of \nthe workforce. That is over a third of the Federal workforce. For those \neligible to retire under FERS, the number climbed from 7 percent to 13 \npercent.\n  As I said in June, the OPM today estimates that a fifth of the \nFederal employees will leave the workforce by 2014. That is almost \n400,000 people. Many have already been postponing retirement for years \nbecause they know we need their talents and experience.\n  Today our civil service finds itself at a crossroads.\n  We could choose to listen to those who continue to disparage public \nemployees and cut salaries or cap hiring. We would, however, \nundoubtedly see more failures to regulate Wall Street because we didn't \nhave regulators or those who drill offshore, failures to secure our \nborders and keep our communities safe, failures to ensure that all \ncitizens have fair access to resources they need to pursue the American \ndream.\n  We can do that, but there is an alternative. Actually, I would say, \nit is a necessity.\n  We can choose--now at this critical moment--to renew our investment \nin a strong, vibrant, and successful Federal workforce. The return on \nsuch investment promises to be high--indeed, if we fail to devote \nourselves now to building a top-notch civil service, the next \ngeneration of Americans will have to spend even more to fix the \nproblems that will result.\n  In his book, ``Excellence,'' former Health, Education, and Welfare \nSecretary John Gardner--who founded the public interest group Common \nCause--wrote that:\n\n       The society which scorns excellence in plumbing as a humble \n     activity and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because it is \n     an exalted activity will have neither good plumbing nor good \n     philosophy: neither its pipes nor its theories will hold \n     water.\n\n  In the same way, if we don't value our government workers and the \njobs they perform, we're going to end up with a Federal workforce--and \na government--that isn't the best it could be for all of us. I have \nnever known Americans to settle for second-rate.\n  What does a sound investment in our Federal workforce look like? \nFirst, we will need to redouble our efforts to recruit new hires, and I \nhope many will be young graduates. We have so many young people right \nnow who are eager to give back to this country and make a difference.\n  According to the Partnership for Public Service, the Federal \nGovernment will need to fill 273,000 full-time, mission-critical jobs \nover the next 3 fiscal years. By mission-critical, they mean jobs \nconsidered essential for agencies to fulfill their obligations to the \nAmerican people: doctors and nurses at the VA, counterterror analysts, \nlawyers, high-tech specialists, contract administrators. These are very \nspecial jobs. We have high unemployment now, but the kind of jobs we \nneed are not readily available.\n  So how can we attract the best and brightest of the new generation \ninto\n\n[[Page S7115]]\n\npublic service? We need to pursue policies and enact legislation that \nwill enable a work-life balance competitive with the private sector. \nThis includes programs like parental leave, loan repayment, and \ntelework. I am glad that some departments are already making strides on \nwork-life balance, and I commend Chairman Akaka of the Subcommittee on \nOversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the \nDistrict of Columbia for being a leader on these issues.\n  We should also be launching programs to help train managers and \nsupervisors, since more and more Federal employees are taking on these \nroles. With so many lower wage jobs outsourced to contractors, we need \nto ensure that those managing contracts remain Federal employees and \nthat they have the skills and experience to make sure contract work is \nbeing performed according to the public interest. Just think how much \nit has cost us because people were not monitoring contracts. Think \nabout the problems we have had monitoring contracts.\n  Now some of my colleagues are probably starting to shake their heads \nand say: Wait a minute; Americans do not want bigger government.\n  Indeed, these recent charges that Federal employees are somehow \noverpaid evoke the perpetual claim that the most desired government is \nalways the smallest. That cuts and outsourcing are ends in themselves. \nWe hear it every day, that government is too big. However, it was \nprecisely this ideology of reduction that left our key regulatory \nagencies unable to prevent disasters like the financial crisis and the \ngulf oilspill and so many other things over the last 8 to 10 years \nwhere agencies did not follow up--whether it was FDA, the Consumer \nProtection Agency.\n  I think they have it wrong. It is not that Americans want smaller \ngovernment. They want better government. They want government that \nworks.\n  Let me share some interesting findings from a survey conducted in May \nby the Center for American Progress and Hart Research Associates. The \nstudy found that 62 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of \nFederal Government, a 22-percent rise since 2000.\n  However, it also found that Americans would rather improve the \nefficiency and effectiveness of government than reduce its size. The \nsame number--62 percent--preferred better government to just smaller \ngovernment. Among those who identified as political moderates, the \nfigure was even higher, at 69 percent.\n  Furthermore, when asked about specific aspects of government \ninvolvement, a majority of Americans believe the Federal Government \nshould be more involved in solving problems. 60 percent want the \ngovernment to do more to improve schools; the same number want Federal \nhelp to make college more affordable; and 57 percent would like the \ngovernment to do more to reduce poverty.\n\n  Investing now in building and developing the next generation of \nFederal employees will go a long way in making sure that government \nworks better for everyone. It will help us tackle problems such as \nthese--developing clean energy, expanding educational opportunities, \nreducing poverty--and avoid the next financial crisis or major oil \nspill.\n  It is time to ask ourselves what kind of government we want for the \nnext century. We can not afford to let this important debate about our \nFederal workforce and its future be hijacked by those who prefer to \nscapegoat and distort the facts. We have all seen what happens when we \nmake important policy decisions based on incorrect information.\n  I am encouraged that the OPM has joined with the Office of Management \nand Budget and the Labor Department to study the actual pay gap, in \norder to determine how best to compare Federal and private-sector jobs. \nOnce we have that data, then we will be better able to figure out how \nto make Federal jobs competitive with their private-sector counterparts \nand attract the very best talent into government.\n  Again, I want to stress, everybody cares about money. Most Federal \nemployees I meet are here because they want to make the world a better \nplace and they are concerned about making the world a better place, and \nthey want to make a difference for their lives. That is one of the \nthings we do not talk about nearly enough; that is, how great it is \nwhen you get to my age to see that you actually tried to make the world \na better place, and you worked on making the world a better place.\n  That is important, and that is the kind of people we have in the \nFederal Government. They are willing to make the financial sacrifices \nbecause they care about and make the special extra effort to give of \nthemselves in order to make this country the great country we know it \nis.\n  By looking forward, by ceasing the ``blame game,'' and by making a \ncommitment now to building the best Federal workforce possible, we can \nensure that the next generation is well poised to tackle its greatest \nchallenges.\n  Lincoln called on his fellow Americans to cherish and safeguard our \ngreatest strength: ``government of the people, by the people, and for \nthe people.'' We must also strive to maintain a civil service of the \nsame kind for the long term. Our children and grandchildren deserve the \nsame type of great Federal employees we have today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I was very disappointed to learn \nrecently that Senator Reid intends to bring up a very significant \namnesty proposal next week known as the DREAM Act. It is disguised as \nan education initiative, but it will provide a powerful incentive for \nmore illegal immigration by allowing States to grant in-state tuition \nto illegal alien students. This is a bad idea at any time, but this is \na bad idea right now, at the worst possible time.\n  Unfortunately, this announcement isn't shocking given Senator Reid's \nand this administration's record of pushing policies on the American \npeople that the people oppose. In these difficult economic times, it is \nreally an insult to legal, taxpaying citizens that the President and \nSenator Reid would want to use their hard-earned money to pay for in-\nstate college tuition for illegal aliens.\n  This horrible economy has increased the demand for enrollment and \nhelp at public universities. As a growing number of families are unable \nto afford an education at a private university, they turn to public \nuniversities in increasing numbers, and they turn to that help, \nincluding in State tuition, in increasing numbers. At a time when many \nAmericans cannot afford to send their children to college at all, this \nbill would allow States to provide in-State tuition to illegal aliens \nwho would displace legal residents competing for those taxpayer \nsubsidies.\n  I am opposed to this proposal because of that--because it would \nunfairly place American citizens in direct competition with illegal \naliens for very scarce slots in classes at State colleges and \nuniversities. The number of those coveted seats is fixed, so every \nillegal alien who would be admitted because of this through the DREAM \nAct would take the place of an American citizen or legal immigrant. It \nmakes no sense to authorize Federal and State subsidies for education \nof illegal aliens, when our State schools are suffering, as higher \neducation budgets are slashed, admissions are curtailed, and tuition is \nincreased.\n  Enactment of the DREAM Act would do just that, and it would be bad \npolicy under any circumstances, but in the current economic climate it \nwould be a catastrophe.\n  Again, the DREAM Act would grant amnesty to millions of illegal \naliens who entered the United States as minors and who meet loosely \ndefined so-called educational requirements.\n  Specifically, the bill grants immediate legal status to illegals who \nhave merely enrolled in an institution of higher education or received \na high\n\n[[Page S7116]]\n\nschool degree or diploma. The bill's sponsors described the \nbeneficiaries of this legislation as ``kids,'' boys and girls. In \nreality, the DREAM Act is far broader than that. It would allow \nillegals up to the age of 35 to be eligible to receive this amnesty and \nqualify for Federal student loans.\n  The American people have made it very clear that they want to see the \ngovernment fulfill its responsibility to enforce the laws on the books, \ntake steps to control illegal immigration, not to reward bad behavior \nwith tuition breaks.\n  Amnesty and economic incentives, such as taxpayer-subsidized tuition, \nonly encourage more illegal immigration. This is certainly not the \nanswer to our current immigration crisis and will only worsen our \ncurrent economic crisis.\n  If Senator Reid does move forward with this proposal, I plan to file \na second-degree amendment to strike the provision that allows States to \ngrant in-State tuition for illegal aliens. It will be a very clear \nchoice: Do you want these limited resources, this limited help, to go \nto U.S. citizens and legal immigrants or do you want illegals to \ncompete for those and take some of those slots away from U.S. citizens \nand legal immigrants?\n  As chairman of the border security caucus, I will be fighting this \noverall measure tooth and nail and also advancing this second degree \nproposal. This is common sense. This is certainly the sentiment and the \nwill of the American people.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--to talk \nto Senator Reid to dissuade him from the bill overall and, if it comes \nto the floor, to support this second-degree amendment so that American \ncitizens and legal aliens are not having slots taken away from them by \nillegals in this matter.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we have been debating for weeks now a \nneeded solution to our economic recovery in the United States. We have \nseen some progress, but it is a long and difficult journey for American \nfamilies. The depth of the crisis that materialized in the last few \nyears of the Bush administration can't be overcome in just 18 months, \nalthough I believe we are headed in the right direction. The \nlegislation we are considering will help us in that journey to \nrecovery.\n  We have seen, in fact, over the last several months, an increase in \nprivate sector jobs. We didn't see that in the last several years of \nthe Bush administration. When President Obama took office, we were \nlosing 750,000 jobs a month and we had 22 straight months of job \nlosses. Now we need to turn that dynamic around by creating private \nsector jobs, but we have to do much more.\n  The great engine of private job creation is small business in \nAmerica. These provisions are aimed to aid small businesses throughout \nthe country. Small business is an engine of growth. It is the place \nwhere people will, I think, find employment as we go forward. Our small \nbusiness community has been hit very hard by the economic crisis, the \nfinancial crisis, and the collapse of the credit bubble. Small \nbusinesses have lost more than 6 million jobs since December 2007, and \nwe have to start restoring those jobs.\n  The legislation we are considering--the Small Business Jobs Act--will \nprovide $12 billion in fully paid-for tax breaks for small businesses \nto bolster confidence in the economy by unlocking frozen credit \nmarkets, spurring job creation, and fostering our Nation's burgeoning \nrecovery. These tax incentives will allow small businesses to make \ninvestments to help with job growth, purchases, and expansion. I \nemphasize that these are fully paid for because we have multiple \nchallenges.\n  I have served long enough to recall in 2000, when we were looking at \nstrong employment growth and a Federal budget surplus, and, in 2009, \nwhen President Obama took office, we were looking at a job collapse in \nmany parts of the country and a huge deficit, which is still going on. \nSo we have to consider both as we move forward.\n  The particulars of this legislation are important to note because \nthey will contribute, I believe, very significantly--and one would hope \nvery quickly--to increased job opportunities throughout the country. \nThe legislation will incentivize investors by giving 100 percent \nexclusion from capital gains taxes on small business investments. It \nwill create a targeted $30 billion small business lending fund to \nprovide small community banks with the capital to increase their \nability to lend to small businesses. This is particularly notable. I \nmust commend Senator Landrieu for her tenacious advocacy of this \nposition, along with Senator Merkley and others. In fact, this is a \nbipartisan effort. This proposal will put money in the hands of small \ncommunity banks that want to lend, that have clients, and that do it \nthe old-fashioned way. They look at the books, they know the borrower, \nthey have faith and confidence in that individual, and they are \nconstrained now because they do not have sufficient capital to expand \ntheir lending. With this capital, they will be able to expand lending \nand go right out to the heart of small businesses throughout the \ncountry. Madam President, just as in North Carolina, in Rhode Island I \nhave numerous businesses that will come in and say they are very \nsuccessful, they want to expand, they can hire a few people, but they \njust can't get the loan from the bank. This will help.\n  Another provision reduces the tax burden of small businesses by \nallowing them to carry back general business tax credits to offset \ntheir tax burdens from the previous 5 years. Small businesses will also \nbe able to count the general business credits against the Alternative \nMinimum Tax. That will free up capital for expansion and job growth.\n  The legislation also increases Section 179 expensing--permitting up \nto $500,000 in capital investments that businesses can expense to \nimmediately get some tax credit for it. It also extends bonus \ndepreciation, allowing taxpayers to immediately write off 50 percent of \nthe cost of new equipment. We hope that this will have the small \nbusinessman or woman buying a piece of equipment which will require, we \nhope, a manufacturer or assembler somewhere in the United States to \ncall people back to work to meet this new demand.\n  This is going to increase demand for goods and services, and that is \none of the key deficiencies in this current economy. We have a lot of \nmoney locked up. It is said, quite authoritatively, that there is about \n$2 trillion on the balance sheets of corporations throughout the United \nStates that they are not spending. We hope these incentives will \nproduce increased demand which will get them to start spending and \nprovide the kind of private capital investment and momentum that will \ncarry us forward.\n  As I mentioned before, this Small Business Jobs Act has a $30 billion \nlending fund that is so critical. More than 10 community banks in Rhode \nIsland, for example, are eligible to receive these funds. I have spoken \nto many of the bank leaders and they are ready to lend right now. They \nhave customers whom they have great faith in, who have a good business \nplan and are profitable. In fact, many times business owners are \nwilling to guarantee or to put up even personal collateral to get the \nloan. Yet the bank says: We can't do that because we have reached the \nlimit based on our capital of what we can lend to small business. This \nraises those limits, and it is absolutely necessary to do that.\n  One other important aspect is that this legislation will raise the \nlimits on loans that the Small Business Administration can make and \nguarantee. Again, another source of tremendous and important funding is \nbeing capped now because they can't make big enough loans because there \nare certain loan limits. It will also extend the elimination of the \nfees borrowers pay to the SBA. Now we have businesses that may be ready \nto hire, but they just can't generate the cash to pay the fees. Now \nthey will be able to get the loan, hire the workers, and move forward.\n  The legislation also supports States because there are many State \ninitiatives. There is $1.5 billion in grants to\n\n[[Page S7117]]\n\nStates that will help in their efforts. There are many States that have \nprograms very much like our Small Business Administration at the \nFederal level--innovative programs that will be supported.\n  This legislation has bipartisan support, and that is absolutely \nnecessary. Again, I wish to thank particularly my colleagues who were \nsupportive of the cloture motion that has us now on a path to \npassage. I thank them very much for their efforts. They made a decision \nthat will benefit American business across the country, small \nbusinesses in particular.\n\n  We need to move forward. We need to get this legislation done--I hope \nthis week--as soon as we can. Then we have other legislation we can and \nshould consider. For example, we have a tax extenders bill that will \nhopefully provide R tax credits and other provisions that will help \nbusinesses, both large and small but particularly small business.\n  I urge all my colleagues, now that we feel confident we have the \nvotes, let's move to final passage. Let's give American businesses, \nparticularly small businesses, the help they need to move the economy \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                       POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I am rising today because this is PKD \nAwareness Week. People say: What is PKD and why do we need to be aware \nof it? PKD is the acronym that stands for polycystic kidney disease. \nPolycystic kidney disease is the leading cause of kidney failure from a \ngenetic disease in America. Every year, we have PKD Awareness Week, as \nwe try to bring people a better understanding of it.\n  Let me outline how serious it might be and how it affects the Federal \nGovernment. For those who do not know, it is a silent killer that \nstalks more than 600,000 Americans. That is greater than the number of \nAmericans who are afflicted with cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, \nsickle cell anemia, hemophilia, muscular dystrophy, or Down syndrome. \nThat works out to be about 12,000 PKD sufferers in each State. Every \none of them is at risk for kidney failure and the ravages that come \nwith that.\n  I became aware of it particularly when my daughter was diagnosed with \nit. It is a disease that is carried as a genetic disease. We had no \nidea it was anywhere in the family until she was diagnosed with it. We \nhave now tried to go back to find out who may or may not have had it. \nBut this means that not only is she at risk and is losing kidney \nfunction, but so are her children and perhaps so are others in our \nfamily. So it becomes a very significant personal thing for me, but I \nwish to reach out and express my gratitude to my colleagues in the \nSenate, who do not have the same kind of personal connection, who have \njoined in cosponsoring the resolutions on PKD Awareness Week--Senator \nHatch, Senator Kohl, Senator Specter, and Senator Harkin. Over the \nyears, they have cosponsored the annual PKD Awareness Week resolution. \nThey have joined in securing PKD-specific appropriations report \nlanguage, and they have helped pass the Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination Act, which has been very important with respect to \nthis disease and others where, for a variety of reasons, they have not \nhad the kind of attention they have needed.\n  This has an impact on the Federal Government because the annual cost \nof PKD exceeds $2 billion for kidney dialysis, kidney transplants, \nantirejection drugs, and related therapies. That, of course, affects \nthose who have government money going into their health care support. \nEnd-stage renal disease is the fastest growing expense of Medicare. \nThis causes a huge financial, emotional, and physical burden on the \nAmericans who are affected by it.\n  The good news is that the field of PKD research is robust, the \ntherapy is ripe, and I ask my colleagues to look favorably on a \nforthcoming public-private partnership initiative that is known as the \nRegional PKD Diagnostic and Clinical Treatment Center, designed to \nincrease application of new diagnostic methods and therapeutic regimens \nfor PKD patients, conduct pilot studies and clinical trials, and, \nfinally, coordinate data and streamline the appropriate clinical \napplication of effective treatments.\n  I am pleased to have the opportunity to once again call attention to \nthe disease of polycystic kidney disease and the ravages and challenges \nit has. I thank my colleagues for their continued support over a 20-\nyear period of PKD Awareness Week and the work they have done in the \nSenate and hope that all of us can continue to support an activity to \nkeep the research going forward. The consequence will be, if it is \nsuccessful, tremendous benefit for those families who suffer from PKD \nand financial benefit for the government as a whole through reduced \nMedicare costs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to speak to the bill pending \nbefore us briefly, first to respond to a criticism that Republicans had \nbeen filibustering this bill, and, therefore, that somehow revealed an \nantagonism on the part of Republicans toward small business.\n  The charge is so ludicrous that one would think it does not even need \nto be responded to. Republicans have been the champions of small \nbusiness in this debate about taxes. I will have more to say about that \nin a moment.\n  Why was it that the majority of Republicans did not want to proceed \nwith the proposal that the majority leader put before the Senate? A \nvery simple reason. The majority leader, once again, precluded \nRepublicans from offering any amendments. The entire history of the \nSenate is a history of tradition and comity and the opportunity for the \nminority to be able to offer amendments and debate.\n  When repeatedly the majority leader does what they call, in the \nSenate parlance, filling the parliamentary tree, which means he \nprecludes the minority from offering any amendments, naturally \nRepublicans are going to object to that.\n  We said repeatedly we would be delighted to debate this bill, just \nlet us offer some amendments. No, was the answer; you cannot do that. \nWell, we are on the bill now, and I think it is pretty clear that what \nthis debate boils down to is what is the best way to help the small \nbusinesses who are the job creators. In fact, about one-quarter of all \nof the jobs in this country are created by small business, and what we \nknow is that especially the small business folks are the first ones to \nhire in bad economic times, hoping to bring the economy out of a \nrecession.\n  Why are they not hiring today? Well, on Monday I came to the floor \nand I pointed out one of the reasons. One of the entrepreneurs in our \ncountry wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in which he totaled \nup all of the expenses that he has every time he hires someone. I \nbelieve, if memory serves me correctly, it cost him about $78,000 every \ntime he hired somebody who had a $44,000 salary. That is in the extra \ntaxes that he would have to pay and the cost of regulations just to \ncomply with Federal law for hiring one additional person. It is no \nwonder that small businesses do not hire at this point.\n  So what is the Democratic response? Let's raise their taxes. Let's \nmake it even more difficult for small businesses to hire people. We \nbelieve that is the wrong solution, and rather than looking at the kind \nof bill that is on the Senate floor today that creates yet another kind \nof TARP bank lending authority, something the American people are a \nlittle bit fed up with, we believe we should leave tax rates where they \nare so that businesses have some certainty that they are not going to \nbe raised. At least do not make it worse.\n  I noted that the distinguished assistant majority leader earlier this \nmorning inadvertently confused tax cuts with tax increases. I have done \nthe same thing many times. But the reason I wanted to point that out is \nbecause I think there has been so much talk on the Democratic side \nabout tax cuts for the rich that the Members on the other side have \nalmost gotten to believe that. The truth is, nobody is proposing\n\n[[Page S7118]]\n\ntax cuts for the rich. Nobody is proposing tax cuts for anyone.\n  My colleague from Illinois corrected himself and said: No, I mean tax \nincreases. That, of course, is what the question is. Should there be \ntax increases on anyone? The Republican position is no. At least in \ntimes of recession or bad economic times, do not raise taxes on anyone. \nDo not raise taxes on families who are struggling to make ends meet, \nand do not raise taxes on businesses, especially the small businesses \nthat are the best job creators.\n  So our view is, do not raise taxes. But the Democratic view is, well, \nlet's raise taxes on some but not on others. That is this class warfare \nconcept that I was critical of Monday. In America we do not believe in \nclass warfare. We think everyone ought to have a chance to succeed, and \nif someone succeeds, we applaud it and we hope we are in the position \nthe next week or the next year. But, instead, there seems to be a view \nthat, well, rich people can afford it, so let's raise their taxes.\n  Again, economists generally--including Peter Orszag, the immediate \npast Director of OMB under President Obama--have made it clear that \nraising taxes on anyone, including the entrepreneurs, those people who \npay in the higher tax brackets, is a bad thing for job creation \nespecially in bad economic times.\n  So why would we do it? Well, the concern is we have to be worrying \nabout the deficit. Well, this is a fine time to be worrying about the \ndeficit and a fine way to do it. We spend $1 trillion on a new health \ncare bill, we spend $1 trillion on a stimulus bill, we spend all of \nthis other money bailing out this and that in our economy, and now \nanother new TARP lending program spending trillions of dollars, a \nbudget that doubles the national debt in just 5 years, doubles all of \nthe debt accumulated from George Washington through George Bush, we are \ngoing to double that in 5 years under the Obama budget.\n  I would suggest that we ought to start worrying about the spending. \nIf we are worried about the deficit, let's stop the spending spree. \nLet's do not try to make up a little bit of that by deciding to tax a \nbunch of people who are the very folks who are going to hire the \nemployees that are going to help bring us out of the recession.\n  Am I just sort of fancifying this or do real small businesspeople \nhave this view? Well, let me just read about--I think there are three, \nmaybe four folks here. These are some of the folks, some of the 750,000 \nsmall business owners in the United States whom we are counting on to \ncreate jobs and who would see an increase in their marginal income tax \nrate under the Democratic proposals.\n  I just want to quote from what a few of these folks say. Here is the \nchief operating officer of a company called Logical Advantage in North \nCarolina. His name is John Fread. He says marginal tax rates will mean \nhis company will not be able to hire the new sales representative it \nneeds, and it may force layoffs. He says:\n\n       We founded Logical Advantage in 2003 with a couple of card \n     tables and laptops and a staff of three. We've been \n     successful and have since expanded our business. One of the \n     keys to our growth has been our determination to reinvest our \n     profits in our firm. We're organized as a pass-through \n     business, (meaning the company's taxes are paid at the \n     individual income tax rate),--\n\n  That is why this marginal rate is so important--\n\n     and if our marginal income tax rates go up, we'll be left \n     with less money to put back into our company. This would mean \n     we would not be able to hire an additional sales \n     representative.\n\n  Then he also closes with this:\n\n       Also, since our employees bill their services hourly, we \n     use profits to keep our employees employed between projects \n     and avoid layoffs. Without this additional cash, we'll have \n     no choice but to do layoffs. My advice to Congress would be \n     to keep the current tax rates in place and do all they can to \n     avoid raising our taxes because that will lead to fewer jobs.\n\n  So here is an entrepreneur, a small business owner, who says he wants \nto create jobs, save the jobs he has. He wants to expand, but an \nincreased tax burden will prevent him from doing so. No, we are not \ntalking about tax cuts for the rich. Nobody is talking about tax cuts. \nWe are talking about keeping his taxes from going up. That is what we \nwant to prevent.\n  Kevin Linehan of Bravadas Fairfax, LLC, a small clothing and \naccessories business, says--and I hope I am pronouncing that correct--\nBravadas is the way I see it here. Anyway, he says the shaky economy \nhas forced him to cut his staff and payroll by 40 percent and slice his \ninventory by 30 percent, not an uncommon situation in this economic \ndownturn. He wants Congress to know that if the top two marginal rates \nincrease, he will not be able to hire the new employees he needs, \nincrease his inventory, or take the risks that would lead to innovation \nin his business. I am going to quote him.\n\n       If Congress goes through with the plan to increase the \n     marginal income tax rates for the top two brackets, my \n     business will be hurt. We've already been battered by the \n     recession and had to cut staff and payroll by 40 percent. I \n     have also cut both my advertising and inventory by 30 percent \n     each, and have had to downsize and change locations to save \n     on rent.\n       If Congress raises my taxes, it will be more of the same \n     rather than being able to grow my business, attract new \n     customers and hire new staff. In fact, in this economy I have \n     had to cut back on essentially all new business activity, \n     meaning I've stopped trying to innovate and instead have been \n     forced to focus on only those activities that are the most \n     profitable because I cannot afford to take risks. The more \n     and more the government takes, the more difficult it is for \n     small businesses like mine to be successful and do the things \n     they want us to do, which is to create jobs.\n\n  Here is a third small businessperson, Ray Pinard. He owns a printing \nbusiness in Boston. He says if tax rates go up, he would not have the \nresources to expand his business operation to new areas, and, \ntherefore, to create new jobs. Here is what he wants Members of \nCongress to know:\n\n       Keeping the tax burden low is so critical to our business, \n     48HourPrint.Com. . . . With the economy where it is, now \n     certainly isn't the time to play games by extending tax \n     relief for some but not others.\n       For example, if Congress fails to keep all of the current \n     income tax rates in place and we take a hit, then that will \n     mean we have left capital to grow our team and our \n     operations, not only in the Boston area but at our other \n     facilities in Ohio, Arizona, and New Hampshire, as well. \n     There are thousands of other small businesses out there that \n     will react similarly if their tax burdens increase. I am \n     worried that it will take much longer to get our economic \n     ship righted if our elected officeholders in Congress fail to \n     show leadership on this issue. [Raising taxes] is a job \n     killer. Leave the money in the private sector where it will \n     be put to good use.\n\n  Despite what the President says, these tax increases will have a very \nnegative impact on job creation, especially for the small businesses, \nthe entrepreneurs I have quoted. These are the people who are on the \nground, running businesses, trying to weather the bad economy, hoping \nto hire new workers. They are telling us that their businesses cannot \ntolerate new taxes.\n  As this debate continues, I will share more stories from small \nbusinesses and other folks who are opposed to the tax increases.\n  It is critical that we appreciate the fact that even the talk about \nthis, even the potential for an increase in taxes, has created a kind \nof uncertainty that has caused businesses to lock up and not want to \nmake any kind of big decisions because of what they think could happen. \nI remind my colleagues that this money is not the government's money. \nIt doesn't belong to the Congress or the President. When we talk about \ntaxing people, we are talking about taking their money. It is not the \ngovernment's money. It is their money.\n  The question is, Will the government do more good spending it or will \nthe private sector, the people who have that money, who earned that \nmoney? Will they do more good with it? I think it is obvious that these \nsmall business folks I have talked about will put that money to good \nuse for their families and their employees. They will create more jobs \nwith it. That will help more folks.\n  The irony is that will eventually help the economy and will even help \nthe U.S. Treasury, because we have more people paying more taxes at the \nexisting rates, and that means more revenue for the Federal Government.\n  This is a very aspirational country. Almost everybody here looks at \nopportunity. We all think we can do better. If we work hard, we have a \nsystem that will reward hard work. These successful small business \nfolks never cease to amaze me. They come up with an idea, a service, or \na product to sell. They go through all the difficulties of doing so,\n\n[[Page S7119]]\n\nsometimes mortgaging their home, borrowing money. They are the \nlifeblood of the economy. They are not some bunch of fat cats. They are \nthe people who make the economy work.\n  It bothers me when folks on the other side of the aisle denigrate \nthem as if they are somehow evil people because they end up making \nenough money to pay taxes in the top tax brackets when, as we pointed \nout, the reason for that is that as business people who are not \ncorporations, they are subchapter S or other partnership or small \nbusiness legal entities, they pay taxes as individuals. And because of \nthe income of their businesses, therefore, they are put in the top \nbracket and somehow, therefore, they deserve to be punished--they can \nafford it; they are the rich.\n  They are not the rich. They are folks like all of us, struggling to \nmake ends meet, who will hire more people and who don't deserve to be \npunished for their success. We are supposed to be creating incentives \nfor people to do exactly this. Ironically, the bill we are debating now \nis a bill that is supposed to help small business folks. We will give \nthese TARP-like funds to the banks and make them lend a certain amount \nof it to small businesses, and everybody will be better. My guess is, \nif we let the small businesses keep their money and not raise their \ntaxes, they would be perfectly happy and be able to get along, and they \nwould have the ability to borrow money from the banks without the \neffect of the legislation before us.\n  I hope we both begin to change our rhetoric, not to attack those \npeople who are the backbone of the economy, people who cannot afford \nanother tax increase, who want to help the economy recover and like to \nhire more people, and that we would also recognize the most productive \nway to help them is to simply not raise their taxes. We are not talking \nabout a tax break. I would argue that this TARP-like lending thing is \nan idea that may be well motivated, but it is not the way to help most \nof the businesses we are talking about. Just don't raise their taxes.\n  I will return to where I started. Some of us get a little confused. \nSometimes we say tax cut when we are talking about tax increases. It \nmay be that we have gotten so used to this rhetoric that somehow \nsomebody is asking for a tax cut for the rich when, in fact, I don't \nknow of anybody who is asking for a tax cut for the rich. Not a single \nRepublican is asking for a tax cut for the rich. All we are asking is \ndon't raise taxes on anybody; it is usually not a good idea, and it is \ncertainly not a good idea in this time of economic downturn.\n  I hope as time goes on, I will have the opportunity to reflect on \nwhat more small business folks have written to us, and we will take \ntheir pleas to heart. The three people I have talked about today all \nsay: Don't raise my taxes. I am having a hard enough time as it is. If \nyou leave me alone, I might be able to begin hiring more people.\n  Let's take those stories to heart and listen to our constituents and \nnot take the attitude that Washington knows best. It reminds me a \nlittle of what the President and one of our colleagues said in a \ntownhall meeting in August when somebody asked about the health care \nbill. One of our colleagues said: Well, you may not like it now but \nover time I think you will get to appreciate it.\n  It is the attitude that we know best here; we will make the \ndecisions; you may not like them now, but you will come to think they \nare okay over time. I think Americans have understood what it takes to \nmake a successful business. They understand what taxation is all about. \nThey understand this isn't the time to raise taxes on anybody, and we \nought to get away from this idea that Washington knows best. Let's \nlisten to our constituents. Let's listen to what they are telling us. \nDon't raise our taxes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the bill.\n  I rise to strongly support the pending bill, the Small Business Jobs \nand Credit Act. I do it because it will help small business create jobs \nin Maryland. I spent much of the last several months visiting worksites \nin Maryland, and it was an exciting time. Maybe orders and customers \nare not up, but enthusiasm and entrepreneurship is up, and absolutely, \nin many areas, consumerism and customers are up.\n  I visited bakeries, microbreweries, factories of small machine tool \ncompanies wanting to retool. During that time I visited Main Street, \nsmall streets, rural communities. I talked with small business owners \nand their employees.\n  What was loud and clear and visible was that small businesses are \nstressed and strained. Small businesses said: Hey, Barb, it is sluggish \nout there. There is uncertainty, but we believe we can expand. We \nbelieve we can grow our business, but we need help.\n  They continually talked about their problems in having access to \ncredit--not because they were not good risks but because there was not \ngood money out there for them to borrow. Even though these businesses \nare thriving, they could not expand because they could not get the \nloans they needed to grow.\n  I visited a startup green energy business whose demand is \nskyrocketing, but they need credit to expand their business and, I \nmight add, certainty in an energy bill.\n  I visited a wonderful family bakery which reminded me so much of my \nown grandmother's bakery. Well, they just do not bake bread, they build \ncommunity and create jobs. They want to expand. They need access to \ncredit.\n  I visited a machine tooling business in Baltimore which does \nprecision metal work for many of the components for our military, the \nspace program. They, too, want to retool.\n  These are ``good guy'' businesses, working hard, playing by the \nrules. They have jobs right here in the United States of America. They \nwant to expand. They want to hire. They want to upgrade their \nequipment. They want access to credit. They need a government on their \nside and at their side.\n  I believe that is what the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act will \ndo. It will help businesses be able to get that much needed access to \ncredit to be able to strengthen our economy.\n  I know people are anxious about the economy. Many are worried their \nmiddle-class life is slipping away. But in Maryland we know we can \ncount on small businesses to create jobs, to help people who are in the \nmiddle class stay there, and those who want to get there be able to do \nso through hard work.\n  From beauty shops to biotech, there are family-owned businesses, \nsmall businesses in Maryland that need help. What they need is not a \nguaranteed outcome, but they do need to have access to credit.\n  I am no Janey come lately on this issue of small business. My \ngrandparents owned a local bakery shop. My father ran a small grocery \nstore, alongside with my mother. I often watched him open very early \nfor local steelworkers and automobile workers, people who worked making \nthe famous National Boh beer right down the street. They would come and \nbuy their lunches before going to the morning shift.\n  We know what it is like to have a small business and to be able to \nmeet a payroll and to be able to grow. I saw what it means to be able \nto provide service to the community, lend a helping hand, provide a \ngood customer value for a hard day's work. I believe it is through \nthese small entrepreneurial efforts that we will get our economy going \nand growing.\n\n[[Page S7120]]\n\n  We have bailed out banks. We have even bailed out other countries. \nNow we have to bail out the people who are building the United States \nof America--the people who are building jobs in the United States of \nAmerica. That is what I think this bill will do.\n  What I like about it is, it gets credit flowing to small business. It \ncreates a Small Business Lending Fund at the Department of the Treasury \nto help those community banks at the local level lend to small \nbusinesses. It creates incentives for private businesses to invest by \nmaking the capital gains from small business stock tax free. It \nprovides tax breaks that will help small businesses grow by making it \nless expensive to purchase new equipment. We help small businesses get \nstarted by doubling the amount of startup costs small businesses can \ndeduct from their taxes.\n  So let me repeat. No. 1, we create a Small Business Lending Fund at \nTreasury that guarantees access to credit. We make capital gains tax \nfree. That will help small business investment. We will help make sure \nsmall businesses grow by making it less expensive to purchase new \nequipment because of the tax breaks we give, and we are going to double \nthe amount of startup costs small businesses can deduct from their \ntaxes to help make sure they can get a jump-start on getting underway. \nI believe we have practical, affordable solutions.\n  Some people say: Is this a baby TARP? No, this is not a TARP. We do \nnot bail out Wall Street. We help Main Street. We help all those people \nwith a dream in their heart, with a small business underway, with the \ngrit and determination to be able to create a job for themselves and \nfor others and add a product and add value to the United States of \nAmerica. These are jobs that will stay in the United States of America.\n  So let's say goodbye to tax breaks to send jobs overseas, and let's \nsay hello to tax breaks to make sure our small businesses can grow. I \nhope we pass this bill. I hope we get it done this week. I hope we get \nour economy rolling in the way we need to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                          Unfinished Business\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak today for a few moments \nabout the unfinished business of the Senate, but I will focus on only \none issue.\n  We come now to September of an even-numbered year. We will have an \nelection in November, and then we will have a lameduck session, \napparently, and the Congress will end its session. Then the question \nis, What is left on the table? What is the unfinished business? What \nhas not been done that needs to be done for this country? It is a very \nlong list, unfortunately. I would say the reason, in most cases, is we \nhave experienced in this Congress less cooperation and more \ndetermination to block almost anything than at any time I have seen in \nthe 30 years I have served here. It doesn't matter what the issue is. \nWe have had issues that are noncontroversial, that get 94 or 98 votes \nin favor of the issue, that have been blocked when brought to the floor \non a motion to proceed. We have a noncontroversial issue, a motion to \nproceed brought to the floor on something on which there is no \ncontroversy, and it is subject to a filibuster, and then a cloture \nmotion has to be filed. Then 2 days have to pass before it ripens. We \nhave a cloture vote, and then following the cloture vote, the minority \nsays: Well, we insist that the 30 hours postcloture be used. So 30 \nhours has to be burned off. Only then can you get to a vote on a \nnoncontroversial issue. Then you have the vote, and it is 98 to 1. That \nhas happened throughout this year--continual efforts to block \neverything; deciding that the best strategy politically, apparently, \nfor the minority here in the U.S. Senate is to block everything.\n  The result is that the list of unfinished business in this Senate is \nunbelievable. Not one appropriations bill will be done when we break \nfor October. An energy bill which I intend to speak about today is \ncritically important for this country's future and has not been done. \nExtending the tax extenders, the research and development tax credit, \nand so many other issues that are important have not been done. It is \nnot because Senator Reid hasn't tried as majority leader. He has tried \nin every way to make progress on these issues. We have just not been \nable to get it done.\n  Let me speak for a moment about one issue that will represent the \nunfinished business, regrettably, unless there is a change of heart \nsomehow and perhaps at the end of this session, in a lameduck session, \nwe are able to get it done; that is, energy.\n  Energy affects everyone's lives. They don't think about it, but they \nget up in the morning and perhaps take a shower. That is energy coming \nfrom a hot water heater. They turn off an alarm clock first. That is \nenergy coming from electricity. They then go down and perhaps have a \nslice of toast. That is energy from the toaster. They have some coffee, \nwhich uses energy from a stove. They put a key in the ignition and \ndrive to work--energy from the gas tank of that vehicle. Almost every \nwaking moment is blessed with abundant energy resources in this \ncountry. We don't even think about it. We do all of those things in the \nfirst hour of our day and never think about the fact that energy played \nsuch a central role.\n  Here is the dilemma. Our country, in large part, runs on oil--not \nexclusively but in large part--oil and natural gas. Coal is a very \nimportant part of producing electricity, but oil is 70 percent of our \ntransportation, and here is the circumstance we face. Nearly two-thirds \nof the oil we use in America we have to get from somewhere else. We use \none-quarter of all the oil that is sucked out of this planet every \nsingle day. We put straws in this planet, called drilling rigs, and we \ndrill holes very deep into the surface of this planet, and we find oil \nand we suck oil out of the planet, and one-fourth of it must come to \nthis little spot on the globe called the United States of America. That \nis the prodigious appetite we have for energy, and it enhances our \nlives in every way. But it doesn't add up. We use one-fourth of all the \nworld's energy in our country, but we produce only 10 percent of the \nworld's energy, and we have only 3 percent of the world's energy \nreserves. That is not an equation that adds up.\n  So if two-thirds of our oil comes from outside our country--some of \nit from countries that don't like us very well--what are the \nconsequences of that? Does that represent adequate national security \nwhen we are dependent on that amount of oil from others? It does not. \nIt represents a very deep vulnerability that one day that supply of oil \ncould be cut off from our country, and our economy would be flat on its \nback.\n  What do we do about that? Well, we should produce more, to the extent \nwe can, and we are, and I will talk about that in a moment. We should \nconserve more. We should be concerned about the efficiency of its use. \nWe should find new sources of energy. We should convert the automobile \nfleet, to the extent we can, to an electric fleet. We should continue \nto invest in the longer stream strategies such as fuel cells and \nhydrogen. All of those things are necessary. We should have a renewable \nelectricity standard that drives the production of electricity from \nrenewable energy that says: Here is where America needs to go. Here is \nwhat we want to produce in our future. Count on it, believe in it, \ninvest in it, because this is America's policy for the next decade. We \nshould do that. It is called a renewable electricity standard. We \nshould build a transmission capability around the country, just as we \ndid interstate highways--an interstate transmission grid that allows us \nto produce energy where the wind blows and the sun shines and move it \nto the load centers that need the energy. All of these things are \nnecessary. Yet the prospect is that they will all be left on the \ndrawing table at the end of this session of the Congress.\n  Let me describe, if I might, what we have done and what we threaten \nto lose. A year ago last June, we passed on a bipartisan basis out of \nthe Energy Committee here in the Senate a piece of legislation that \nreduces our dependence on foreign energy; increases our domestic \nproduction of energy from virtually all sources; establishes a \nrenewable electricity standard; helps create a transmission \nsuperhighway; electrifies and diversifies our vehicle fleet;\n\n[[Page S7121]]\n\nenhances our energy efficiency; expands clean energy technology; and \nwill train the energy workforce of tomorrow. We did all of that, passed \nthat out of the Energy Committee and did it on a bipartisan basis. And \nwe threaten to lose all of that progress at the end of this session \nunless we get some cooperation on the floor of the Senate.\n  I have described a bit of this, but let me do it by chart. Our \ndependence on foreign energy--and this translates mostly to foreign oil \nby sector. You can see that the most significant sector that increases \nour dependence on foreign oil is the transportation sector. We use 70 \npercent of our oil in the transportation fleet. Seventy percent of our \noil is used in transportation. That is why all of us understand that we \nhave to convert.\n  By the way, moving to an electric transportation fleet--and I will \ntalk a bit about that later--it is not new; it is back to the past in \nmany ways. When President Taft decided that the horse and buggy had \noutlived its usefulness as a mode of transportation outside of the \nWhite House--he ordered an electric vehicle, the Baker electric \nvehicle. So the fact is, it is not as if electric vehicles haven't been \naround; they have.\n  When Henry Ford decided that the Model T shall have an internal \ncombustion engine because Thomas Edison suggested that was the way to \ngo, that determined for the future what we were going to be doing for a \nlong, long time. Then in 1916 our country said: You know what we want \nto do, we want to reward anybody that goes and finds oil and gas \nbecause we are building this automobile fleet with the internal \ncombustion engine that needs to use gas stations every week or two, so \nwe need to have gasoline at these gas stations. In 1916, we decided as \na country to say: If you are looking for oil and gas, God bless you. We \nwant to reward you. We are putting in place deep, permanent tax \nincentives to say: You go look for oil and gas because that is good for \nthe country.\n  So here we are nearly a century later, and the problem is that we now \nknow that being dependent on others for two-thirds of our oil--70 \npercent of which is used to run our transportation fleet--holds America \nhostage. It holds our economy hostage and holds our future hostage. So \nwhat do we do about that?\n  Here is a chart that shows the use of energy in this country. At this \npoint, coal fuels about half of the electricity generated in our \ncountry. That comes from coal. There is a problem with coal, and that \nis, when you burn it to produce electricity, it puts carbon into the \natmosphere, and we now know that contributes to climate change and \nglobal warming, putting more and more carbon into the atmosphere is \ntroublesome.\n  So now we come to an intersection that is different from any other \nintersection we have been at before: trying to ensure a better energy \nfuture and at the same time address climate change. That is a pretty \ndifficult proposition but not impossible.\n  By the way, our energy future will not be a future without coal, so \nthe question is, How do we deal with the fact that burning coal \nproduces carbon? Well, the energy legislation we have produced begins \nto address that by saying that there are a lot of ways to separate \ncarbon when coal is burned and to use that carbon in a lot of different \nways, one of which is to put it underground to enhance oil recovery \nfrom an oil well. If you put carbon deep into the ground in an oil well \nthat is almost depleted, you can move oil out of that oil well. That is \ncalled enhanced oil recovery. Another way is just storing this carbon \nunderground. Another is to understand there are uses for carbon that \ncan produce additional fuel. You can take the carbon from a coal plant, \nstrip the carbon from the emissions, and use it to feed algae. Algae is \nthat single-cell pond scum that you see--the green scum on top of \nwater. But if you grow algae--and how does algae grow? In water, \nsunlight, and CO2. To grow algae, you take the \nCO2, grow algae with it and then harvest the algae, and you \nthen get diesel fuel. So you create something--you have a problem that \ncreates a solution. Solve a problem by creating a product. That is \nanother approach. There are more. There are other ways to address this.\n  There is a patent by a guy in California who says he has the silver \nbullet. You can use coal and get rid of the CO2, because he \nmineralizes the entire effluents from a coal plant and turns it into a \nproduct that encompasses all of the CO2 that is harder and \nmore valuable than concrete. So that brings the cost of capturing and \ncontaining CO2 down to near zero, he says. I don't know \nwhether that is accurate; all I know is there are a lot of interesting \nideas out there about how to continue to use coal and protect this \ncountry's environment at the same time.\n  I would say one other thing about this. A woman scientist from Sandia \nNational Laboratory testified before a subcommittee that I chaired, and \nshe said: You think of carbon, CO2 emissions, as a problem. \nWhy don't you think of carbon as a product? Then she described what you \ncan do with carbon as a value-added product. She is absolutely right.\n  I believe that in 5, 10, 15, 20 years, if we make the right \ninvestments, we will almost certainly be able to continue to use coal, \nour most abundant resource, and do it in a way that protects this \ncountry's environment by sequestering and providing a beneficial use \nfor carbon.\n  So 48 percent of the fuel used for electricity comes from coal. As \nyou see, some comes from natural gas, some is hydroelectric, and that \nrepresents a descriptive use of the various kinds of resources in this \ncountry.\n  I mentioned a while ago that the Energy bill had what is called a \nrenewable electricity standard--RES. Why is that necessary? Because you \nhave to decide where you are headed. You have to drive toward a goal. I \nsupport a 20-percent renewable electric standard. If I buy a kilowatt \nhour of electricity, I want 20 percent of that to come from renewables. \nTwenty percent of that, by 2020, would create 100,000 more new jobs. \nBut much more important than that is it would put us on the road to \nwhat we should be doing; that is, maximizing the production of \nrenewable energy.\n  The fact is, taking energy from the wind makes a lot of sense. It is \nnot polluting. Somewhere in this country, the wind blows almost all the \ntime. Perhaps I have a vested interest because the Department of Energy \nsays the State of North Dakota is the windiest State in America. We are \nborn leaning to the northwest. There is just a lot of wind in our \nState. So we have the capability all across this country to produce \nsubstantial amounts of wind energy.\n  This picture shows what we are doing these days in sunflower fields, \nwhere we grow sunflowers and harvest energy from the wind. It is really \npretty simple and works very well.\n  This chart describes how dependent and how addicted we are to oil. \nThe top oil consumers in 2008--you can see the green line is the United \nStates. It far exceeds the use of oil by anyone else on this planet.\n  China is next but, of course, China has, I think, 1.4 billion people.\n  Tomorrow there will be, on Capitol Hill, a Nissan LEAF. I am not \nadvertising for Nissan, I have never driven one. I will drive one \ntomorrow, because they have a new electric car coming here for people \nto test drive. I have described a bit about the electric vehicle \nfuture, and I, along with Senators Alexander and Merkley, from Oregon, \nhave introduced legislation that would move this country toward an \nelectric drive future. I think it is a great piece of legislation.\n  This country needs to decide where it is headed and then create \nincentives and a roadmap to get there. There is an old saying that if \nyou don't care where you are going, you are never going to be lost. It \nis true for this country as well. I believe it is far better for this \ncountry to set a course, create a destination, and then say to people \nand investors--to everyone--here is where we are headed. You can count \non it, believe in it, and invest in it, because here is where America \nis going. That is what we ought to do.\n  There is not a lot of time left in this legislative session. One of \nthe very important pieces of unfinished business reflects what I have \ndescribed in general form; that is, energy production, conservation, \nexcessive dependence on foreign oil, a concern about the environment, \nenergy conservation and efficiency, and all of this is critically \nimportant.\n  I come from a State that is producing a lot of energy, no question \nabout that.\n\n[[Page S7122]]\n\nWhen I was a little boy, in my hometown of 300 people, there was never \nmuch going on. So we would drive up and down Main Street forever seeing \nif something was going on, and it never was. Sometimes we would go to \nan adjoining town 20 miles away to see if there was anything going on \nthere, because that was a town of about 800 people--much larger--and \nthere was never anything going on there either.\n  What happened one day is that news reached our town that somebody was \ngoing to drill an oil well 2 miles west of Regent, ND. We thought this \nwas unbelievable, something is going to go on. So they hauled in these \nbig rigs with a truck, and lots of metal, and they built this little \npyramid, and all these strange, new people were in our town, and then \nthis oil rig went up--a drilling rig. Then they put lights on it. At \nnight, in a town where there was nothing to do, we would drive out and \npark our cars and look at the lights on the oil rig because there was \nsomething happening. It was so exciting. I can remember as a little boy \nlooking at that oil rig thinking that this is unbelievable, something \nhas come to our town--it and a circus, but they were in different \nyears. It took some while to put it up. They do it now in 30 days. But \nit took a while to drill this well, and then our town was like a \nballoon that lost the air, because they discovered it was a dry hole. \nSo that was my acquaintance with oil and drilling and the people who \ndecide to go out and look for a source of energy, and remembering the \nlights as a young boy.\n  Now, in my State, I asked the U.S. Geological Survey about 3, 3\\1/2\\ \nyears ago, to do an assessment of what is called the Bakken shale. That \nis a formation that is in most of western North Dakota and a fair \namount of eastern Montana. It is a formation of shale rock that is \n10,000 feet, or 2 miles, below the surface of the ground. It is very \nextensive. They do core samples way down so they know where that shale \nexists. It is 100 feet thick. When I had the U.S. Geological Survey \nassess how much oil would be recoverable from the Bakken formation--\nwhich you could not have gotten 10 years ago, because we didn't know \nhow--the USGS said: We believe there is up to 4.3 billion barrels of \nrecoverable oil from that. That is the largest amount of recoverable \noil, using today's technology, that we have ever assessed in the \nhistory of the lower 48 States. We have 120 or 130 oil rigs in western \nNorth Dakota drilling wells, and they each drill a new well in 30 days, \nand then it moves. At each well site, there are 1,000 discrete truck \nvisits back and forth. You can imagine the activity that is going on. \nThey go down 10,000 feet, with 1 drilling rig, 2 miles down, and make a \nbig curve with that rig and go out 2 miles searching for the middle \nthird of a 100-foot seam. That is how sophisticated it is. When they \nfind it, they go out 2 miles, and then they fracture that rock with \nhydraulic fracturing--water under high pressure--and the oil drips, and \nthey put a pump in, and they are getting up to 2,000 barrels per day \nout of this Bakken formation in some of these wells. It is \nunbelievable.\n  I didn't intend to describe it at that length, but the point is we \nare producing more oil in this country. We are producing more, but not \nnearly enough to make us less dependent, or even close to independent. \nWe are still so unbelievably vulnerable to foreign oil. If nothing else \nwould drive the Congress to decide we have to do better and do more in \nenergy, it ought to be that we are unbelievably dependent. God forbid \nthat some day somebody wakes up in this country and understands that \nnone of their electricity works because terrorists have interrupted the \nsupply of oil, they have brought down the grid system, and somehow we \ndon't have electricity and we don't have oil.\n  This country needs better security and more energy security than \nthat. That is the reason to have an energy bill. I have said often that \nI believe in doing everything. I come from a high school class of nine. \nThere were no foreign languages in that class, so I didn't take Latin, \nbut I have always felt these Latin words describe my approach on \nenergy: totus porcus. I think that means ``whole hog.'' I believe we \nought to do everything we can and do it well. Should we maximize \nrenewables? Yes. Should we drill in areas where there is oil and gas \ndomestically? The answer is yes. Should we proceed with ethanol and the \nbiofuels? You bet your life. Should we continue to work on coal and \nmake the investments necessary to sequester carbon or use it to produce \nother fuel? The answer is, of course, that we should do all of that.\n  Should we be more conservation minded? We are prodigious users and \nwasters of energy. I also think of the words totus porcus when I pull \nup to a stop light in Washington, DC, and somebody pulls up next to me \ndriving a Hummer; it is like driving a tank down the streets of a major \nAmerican city, and it is getting probably 6 miles per gallon. Now I \nwill hear from them, I am sure.\n  This country can do better in every single area of energy: \nconservation, efficiency, energy production, and also distribution, and \nthe pipelines that are necessary, and the transmission lines that are \nnecessary.\n  I mentioned earlier that the Energy bill we passed has the capability \nof helping produce an interstate highway of transmission. That is very \nimportant. When the winds blow--if you are going to gather energy from \nthe wind and use it, you have to transmit it someplace on transmission \nlines. We can't build them in this country. We have built 11,000 miles \nof natural gas pipelines in the last 9 years, and do you know what we \nhave done on high voltage interstate transmission lines? It is 660 \nmiles. Why? You can't build them. There are a dozen ways for people to \nsay no, and they do: not on my property, not in our State--not here or \nthere. So you have planning problems, siting problems, and price \nproblems.\n  We are probably not going to be able to get to this bill now, which \nwill represent the important unfinished business this year and \naddresses these important issues. I may well be the only person who \ncares. There is not a big fuss here about leaving on the floor an \nenergy bill that was bipartisan and was passed by the Energy Committee \na year and a quarter ago now. I think others in this country understand \nthe vulnerabilities of this country. We respond sometimes to \ncatastrophes. We respond sometimes when something awful happens. So \nsome day if, God forbid, we wake up and flip the switch and the lights \ndon't come on, or we get in our vehicle and go to find oil and it \ndoesn't exist, so there is no gas for the cars, then we will understand \nthat somehow, some way, we should have done something that addresses \nwhat we know is a vulnerability for this country.\n  The intersection of better energy policy and policy that addresses \nthe issue of climate change is an intersection we can't ignore. We are \nat that intersection, and there is about to be an accident unless we \nmake smart choices. I hope in the coming weeks in the Congress we \nmight, all of us, decide let's try to reduce that list of unfinished \nbusiness by at least doing something that represents a bipartisan \nconsensus out of a committee, a major committee, in this Congress, the \nEnergy Committee. This is a good bill that deserves passage. It will \nstrengthen this country's energy and America's security generally.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is very easy to say we need to create \nmore jobs. It has proven much more difficult to get bills passed to \naccomplish that. On both sides of the aisle we say we are in agreement \nthat small businesses are the engines of job growth. Before us is a \nbill that would put our words into action by enacting a number of \nprovisions that will help these businesses survive and thrive, keeping \ncurrent workers on the payroll and creating new jobs. For months this \nlegislation has been bottled up in this Chamber, held up by a \nfilibuster. The filibuster has come despite the fact that business \ngroups have strongly, almost unanimously--in fact, probably \nunanimously--called for its passage. It promises to help create perhaps \nhalf a million jobs that our economy needs so desperately to get moving \nagain.\n\n[[Page S7123]]\n\n  I am hopeful we will finally end this needless delay and get small \nbusinesses the support they need, get capital flowing, and get more \nAmericans back to work. We are on the verge of doing that, and I hope \nwe can do it within the next 24 hours.\n  This bill is going to do that by addressing a key problem small \nbusinesses now face--difficulty in obtaining the capital they need to \noperate, expand, and grow. One of the most important ways in which this \nbill will do that is through a State small business credit initiative. \nI have sought inclusion of this provision along with many Senators, \nincluding Sherrod Brown and Senators Stabenow, Warner, Baucus, Shaheen, \nBegich, McCaskill, and others, in order to provide badly needed \nassistance to State and local programs across the country that help \nsmall businesses grow. Let me explain how this works.\n  Just as the recession has battered the value of our homes, it has \nalso battered the value of business property such as real estate, \nfactories, and equipment. That has damaged the ability of small \nbusinesses to get bank financing because it has lowered the value of \nproperty they can offer as collateral. Businesses with plenty of \ncustomers and excellent credit histories have been unable to get the \nfinancing they have relied on and need, endangering existing jobs and \npreventing the creation of new jobs. My State and many others have \nbegun programs designed to deal with this problem. Thanks to our \ncollateral support program in Michigan, companies such as Saline \nElectronics, an electronics manufacturing company, and Display Pack, a \npackaging company, have been able to expand production and add workers. \nJust since 2006, with just $3 million in State money, Michigan's \ncapital access program has leveraged nearly $88 million in private \nlending and saved or created an estimated 13,000 jobs. But the demand \nfor this successful program far exceeds the resources available.\n  In Michigan and elsewhere, these programs can't help enough of the \nbusinesses that could effectively use support. Lack of resources for \nsmall businesses is stifling job creation by small business.\n  The legislation before us includes what we call the State small \nbusiness credit initiative which will make available $1.5 billion to \nState and local programs that help small businesses get the loans they \nneed. It will help provide many times that much in private loans to \nsmall businesses.\n  There are other major provisions of this bill that will help small \nbusinesses create jobs. This bill contains $12 billion in tax cuts for \nsmall businesses, tax cuts that will help them put their money into \ngrowing their businesses and creating new jobs. It will more than \ndouble the limits for two of the Small Business Administration's most \nimportant loan programs and provide other enhancements to the SBA loan \nprograms, enhancements that will increase lending to small business by \nover $5 billion in the first year.\n  The bill also includes a proposal which I suggested for what we call \nan intermediary lending pilot program which allows the SBA to make \nloans to intermediary lenders such as business incubators which can \nthen loan that money to growing businesses. The bill also includes the \nsmall business lending fund. This provision is very similar to the Bank \non Our Communities Act. It will provide capital to local community \nbanks, banks on which small businesses depend, so they in turn can lend \nthat money to small businesses. It does all this in a way which will \nnot add to our budget deficit.\n  This legislation has the support of nearly 200 business and financial \nindustry groups. If these groups, many of which disagree with one \nanother on many issues, can come together to support this legislation, \nit speaks volumes about the positive impact this bill is going to have.\n  I thank our Small Business Committee chairman, Senator Landrieu, for \nher extraordinary leadership in guiding this bill to the Senate floor. \nShe has shown talent, dedication, a willingness to work with Senators \nof both parties, and a determination to overcome the obstacles that \nhave threatened to prevent us from providing the support small \nbusinesses need. The Senate and the Nation are benefiting greatly from \nthe leadership of Senator Landrieu.\n  This body should do everything within its power to help the \nbusinesses of our Nation put workers back on the job. We cannot afford \nto miss opportunities to boost employment because the hundreds of \nthousands of people in my State and the millions across the country who \nhave lost their jobs in this recession deserve our very best efforts.\n  All of us, Democrats and Republicans, say we support small business. \nWe have an opportunity in the next few hours to back up our words with \nactions.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have the Small Business Jobs Act of \n2010 before us. For more than a year now, the mantra of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, meaning the majority party, has been: \njobs, jobs, jobs. Unfortunately, the only jobs the policies of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have created are government \njobs. The legislative fixes proposed by the other side have fallen \nshort in creating private sector job growth.\n\n  I have a chart here that will show unemployment reaching a high of \n10.1 percent in October 2009. The administration promised that \nunemployment would not go above 8 percent if we enacted their $800 \nbillion stimulus bill. Moreover, they asserted that 90 percent of the \njobs would be in the private sector. The unemployment numbers have come \ndown from their high in October, but this has not been the result of a \nrobust hiring in the private sector. To the contrary, many people are \nsimply no longer counted as being unemployed because they have stopped \nlooking for work. For those who did find work, many found work with the \nU.S. Census Bureau helping to complete the 2010 census. The \nunemployment rate reached a low of 9.5 percent in July but once again \nhas ticked up to 9.6 percent as 114,000 temporary census jobs ended. \nWhile those who put their faith in the stimulus package believed that \nthis summer would become known as ``recovery summer'' due to all of the \nstimulus projects underway, it actually has ended in what a National \nPublic Radio story termed as an ``economic pothole.''\n  To be fair, the private sector employment number has inched up \nslightly in the past few months. For August, the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics reported that private sector employment payroll edged up by \n67,000. However, the problem is that around 150,000 jobs need to be \nadded each month just to keep up with the growth in population. So \nbasically, by adding 67,000 jobs, we are treading water too slowly to \nkeep our head above water. Moreover, as pointed out in the September \nissue of the National Federation of Independent Business Small Business \nEconomic Trends, 45,000 of those 67,000 private sector jobs were in \neducation and health care. These jobs are heavily dependent on \ngovernment spending, and that means these are not typical small \nbusiness jobs on Main Street.\n  It is clear, however, that the small businesses remain pessimistic \nabout the economy and are hesitant to hire new workers. According to \nthe National Federation of Independent Business's most recent survey--\nand we have a chart here on this point--a net negative 1 percent of \nbusiness owners plan to create new jobs in the next 3 months. A net \nnegative 8 percent of business owners expect the economy to improve. \nOnly 4 percent of the business owners said it was a good time to \nexpand. A net negative 30 percent of owners reported higher earnings. \nThis last component is especially important for businesses when it \ncomes to hiring new employees since businesses need to know that \nrevenue generated from an additional employee will exceed the costs.\n  Given the current unemployment rate, it is not surprising, then, that \nwe are once again looking at ways to create jobs. Hence the bill that \nis before the Senate. The question remains: Are we going to continue to \nlook to the government to be the job creator or are we going to realize \nthat job creation\n\n[[Page S7124]]\n\nand real economic growth comes from the private sector? This question \nalso brings to mind that government doesn't create wealth; government \nconsumes wealth. So if we are going to increase the economy in this \ncountry, it has to be done through the private sector.\n  The bill before us appears to recognize the importance of the private \nsector--in particular, the importance of small businesses and \nentrepreneurs in getting our economy back on track and getting the \nemployment numbers to move in the right direction. I have been beating \nthe drum for some time now that if we want to get our economy back on \ntrack, we need to focus on small business. After all, small business is \nresponsible for creating 70 percent of the jobs in our economy. That is \nnot a Republican percentage put out there by my party. That is also a \nfigure I have heard the President of the United States, our President, \nsay in speeches as well--70 percent of the new jobs are created in \nsmall business.\n  During the debate on the $800 billion stimulus bill, I pointed out \nthat it contained too little in terms of provisions aimed at small \nbusiness. In all, less than one-half of 1 percent of the stimulus bill \nwas tax relief for small businesses. Unfortunately, my concern that the \nstimulus bill provided too little relief to small businesses has proved \ncorrect. Since the stimulus bill was signed into law, small businesses \nhave been hemorrhaging jobs. According to the ADP national employment \ndata, since the stimulus was enacted, small businesses, which are those \ndefined as fewer than 500 employees, have lost a net amount of 2.6 \nmillion jobs. During this same time, large businesses, which are those \nwith over 500 employees, lost a net amount of 716,000 jobs. According \nto this data, small businesses have accounted for nearly 80 percent of \nthe decline in employment since the stimulus bill was signed into law.\n  With the consideration of the small business package before us today, \nI hope this body is finally starting to get serious about tracking \nunemployment through a true jobs bill. Compared to previous stimulus or \njobs bills promoted by the majority, this small business bill has a \nrather modest cost, with tax provisions totaling about $12 billion. It \nis targeted at job creation by providing small businesses with \nincentives to invest in new equipment, expand their operations, and \nultimately hire new employees. The bill includes provisions that would \nencourage small businesses to invest in new equipment and real property \nby increasing the amount of capital expenditures small businesses can \nexpense. For equipment, the amount that can be expensed is increased to \n$500,000 and for real property, to $250,000.\n  Moreover, it encourages investment by providing additional first-year \nbonus depreciation. It promotes entrepreneurship in another way by \nincreasing the amount allowed as a deduction for startup expenditures. \nIt increases access to capital by allowing 100 percent of gain from \ninvestment in qualified small business stock to be excluded from \nincome. It also takes the general business credits out of the \nalternative minimum tax for those sole proprietorships, flowthroughs, \nand nonpublicly traded C corporations with $50 million or less in \nannual gross receipts. Another way is increasing access to capital by \nextending the 1-year carryback for general business credits to a 5-year \ncarryback for small businesses.\n  Finally, this bill promotes small business fairness by limiting harsh \npenalties that have been imposed on small businesses by the IRS and \nequalizing the tax benefits for health insurance that self-employed \nindividuals may receive to those received by employees.\n  In regard to the Small Business Administration provisions, I strongly \nsupport many of the bipartisan provisions included in the bill. This \nlegislation would increase small business lending by lowering small \nbusiness loan program fees while at the same time raising loan \nguarantees and lending limits. Specifically, this bill extends the fee \nreductions and eliminations for the Small Business Administration's \n7(a) program and 504 program and the 90-percent loan guarantee limit \nfor the SBA's 7(a) program. I am pleased that these well-established, \neffective measures have been included in the bill. Raising the 7(a) \nguarantee rate and reducing lenders' and borrowers' fees in the 7(a) \nand 504 loan programs has been enormously successful. These \nmodifications, which expired in May, have led to a significant increase \nin lending capacity and access to capital.\n  I am a supporter and, in fact, have been a leader of the many \nbipartisan small business provisions in the current small business \npackage. I am an original cosponsor of S. 3604, standalone legislation \nintroduced by Senator Snowe, the ranking member of the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, which would extend the same Small \nBusiness Administration lending provisions that are in the bill \ncurrently before the Senate.\n  Additionally, many of the small business tax incentives included in \nthe small business package were taken from legislation I introduced \nlast year entitled the ``Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2009.'' Of \ncourse, there are differences and additional provisions I would have \nliked to have been included, but, as with any piece of legislation in \nthe Senate, there is a need to compromise if you want to get anything \ndone. My bill generally would have made the small business tax \nprovisions permanent law. I believe this would have provided small \nbusinesses with certainty and promoted job creation over the short run \nas well as the long run. However, the Senate small business package \ngenerally only makes the tax provisions applicable for 1 year. That \ngets us back to the point that the word ``uncertainty'' crops up so \noften when used by small businesses as well as big businesses--the \nuncertainty of what Congress is going to do or the fact that when they \nmake policy, they don't make it for a long enough period of time.\n\n  That word, ``uncertainty,'' is the one reason jobs are not being \ncreated. It is kind of a sin that Congress would bring about this sort \nof uncertainty--or maybe the executive branch of government is bringing \nabout some uncertainty--when, in fact, corporations have a historically \nhigh amount of cash just lying around. The last figure I saw was $2.1 \ntrillion, and with $2.1 trillion, one would think there would be a lot \nof jobs expanded, except the people who could do it don't know what \nCongress is going to do to them next, so they are taking caution. Well, \nif we could reduce that caution and encourage them a little bit by \nletting them know what we are doing over the long haul, it would go a \nlong way to getting this unemployment down.\n  Getting back to what I said, I would have liked to have seen in this \nbill an additional provision from my bill included in the final \npackage. This provision would have provided small businesses with a 20-\npercent deduction off of their small business income. It is unfortunate \nthat this provision was left out. This was the largest and most \nimportant provision of the bill I introduced in the summer of 2009.\n  However, in all, the tax provisions included in the Senate small \nbusiness package provide real relief to small businesses. They \ngenerally have the support from Members on both sides of the aisle. In \nfact, you would have thought this small business bill would have been a \nslam dunk. However, the Democratic leadership has used the small \nbusiness bill as a political football, scoring political points. The \nmajority leader refused to allow the small business bill to be \nconsidered under regular order. The majority leader filled the \namendment tree, thereby limiting amendments that could be offered. The \nDemocratic leadership and the administration then proceeded to blame \nRepublicans for blocking relief for small business. This is despite the \nfact that the Democrats were unable to get their own Members in line on \nthe small business package. It still remains unclear whether the \nDemocrats in the House, with their large majority, will pass the small \nbusiness bill should it pass this body.\n  Moreover, the waters of the small business package were further \ndirtied by the inclusion of a controversial lending provision that \nwould create a $30 billion lending fund. This fund is designed to \nprovide billions of taxpayer dollars to banks for the purpose of making \nloans to small businesses. To me and to many experts, the fund \nresembles the TARP bailout program, which has been badly mismanaged.\n\n[[Page S7125]]\n\n  Elizabeth Warren, head of the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel, \nexpressed skepticism that the fund would be effective in increasing \nsmall business lending.\n  She stated that:\n\n       Such a fund runs the risk of creating moral hazard by \n     encouraging banks to make loans to borrowers who are not \n     creditworthy.\n\n  The Special Inspector General of TARP stated that:\n\n       In terms of its basic designs, its participants, its \n     application process, and perhaps its funding source from an \n     oversight perspective, the [small business lending fund] \n     would essentially be an extension of TARP's Capital Purchase \n     Program.\n\n  There is also disagreement about the cost of the program. Proponents \nargue that the lending fund will raise $1.1 billion. However, the \nCongressional Budget Office has indicated that if you score the fund on \na fair value basis, the program would score as a cost to taxpayers of \n$6.2 billion. The Congressional Budget Office has indicated that the \nfair value basis is a more comprehensive measure of the cost than \nestimates done on a cash basis.\n  Many Members in this body voted for the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act in 2008 because we were led to believe our economy \nwas on the brink of failure. We were told the Treasury Department would \npurchase toxic assets. But after its passing, the executive branch \nchanged course and picked winners and losers. Where? Not on Main Street \nbut on Wall Street.\n  We should not be fooled again by the same officials at Treasury who \nhave mismanaged TARP and have been less than transparent with the \nAmerican people about how the taxpayers' money has been spent.\n  I compliment my friend, Chairman Baucus, for diligently pressing the \ntax provisions in this bill. There are many good things in this bill, \nbut I believe it could have been better. Unfortunately, the Democratic \nleadership is more interested in scoring political points than actually \nproviding relief to small businesses. If the majority was actually \ninterested in passing small business relief, a small business package \ncould have been put together that would have garnered 80, 90, or more \nvotes. But instead the majority leader filled the tree, prohibiting \namendments being offered to improve the bill.\n  The small business fund in the bill just doesn't have the safeguards \nin place to ensure that recipients are creditworthy or that taxpayers \nmay be made whole in the end.\n  Should this bill be signed into law, I will do my part to make sure \nthe implementation is in the best interest of the taxpayers as well as \nsmall businesses.\n\n\n                      Watch-Dogging the Watchdogs\n\n  Mr. President, I want to speak about watch-dogging the watchdogs.\n  I first started watch-dogging the Pentagon in the early 1980s, when \nPresident Reagan was trying to ramp up the defense budget. A group of \nDefense reformers were examining spare parts pricing. We found the \nPentagon buying a $750 toilet seat and $695 ashtrays for military \nairplanes.\n  That experience taught me an important lesson: If you are going to \nwatch-dog the Pentagon like the inspector general, or IG, is supposed \nto do, then you better sharpen your wits and have the tools of the \ntrade ready.\n  One of the most important oversight tools is the simple tool of the \naudit. The audit is the IG's main weapon for detecting and reporting \nfraud, waste, and theft. Mr. President, I am sad to report that the \nIG's Audit Office at DOD is not ready to tackle fraud and waste. The \nlack of IG audit readiness comes at a time when aggressive audits are \nsorely needed.\n  Secretary Gates recently announced that he wants to cut $100 billion \nin wasteful spending. But he is relying on the Pentagon bureaucrats to \neliminate it. Asking those who created the waste in the first place to \nthen turn around and get rid of it is not a good plan. He needs a \nbetter mix of weapons. To win this declared war on waste, Secretary \nGates needs the independent backup from the IG. Unfortunately, the \ninspector general's Audit Office is AWOL doing policy audits instead of \nfinancial audits.\n  Policy audits are not known for exposing waste. Last year, I received \na series of anonymous letters alleging mismanagement and low \nproductivity in the IG's Audit Office. This is a huge Audit Office. It \nhas 765 auditors and an annual budget of $90 million.\n  In response, I and my staff conducted an indepth review of all the \npertinent issues. That oversight report was just completed, and I \nforwarded it to Secretary Gates with recommendations within that report \nfor corrective action.\n  My oversight should fit right in with Secretary Gates' plan to cut \nwaste at the Defense Department. My people in Iowa are aching for some \ncommonsense fiscal policy in Washington.\n  My oversight report puts the spotlight on a good starting point. That \noversight report indicates this vital piece of inspector general \noversight machinery--the important tool of the audit--has been \ndisabled. It is broken, leaving hundreds of billions of tax dollars \nvulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse, outright theft.\n  The status quo is totally unacceptable. The IG's audit machinery \nneeds to be brought back up to standard.\n  IG Heddell needs to hit the reset button. He needs to refocus the \naudit effort on priority areas consistent with the inspector general's \ncore mission, which is to detect and report fraud, waste, and abuse.\n  The problem identified in my oversight report is twofold. The first \nbig problem is the broken Defense Department's accounting system. That \nsystem is incapable of generating accurate and complete financial data.\n  The success or failure of an audit turns on the quality of data \navailable for that audit. Unfortunately, the quality of Defense \nDepartment data presented to auditors should probably be rated as poor \nto nonexistent. The consequences are then predictable. Auditors \nconsistently report ``no audit trail found.'' But what does ``no audit \ntrail found'' mean? It means critical supporting documentation and data \nare missing. Vital records are not available for audit. Money has been \npaid out but for what? When there is no audit trail to follow, that \nquestion gets no answer.\n  The ``no audit trail'' finding is like a bad toothache that doesn't \ngo away. The IG's own audit manuals warn that a ``no audit trail'' \nscenario is a red warning flag. It is a very common indicator of fraud. \nSo we have clear-cut indicators of fraud that show up in one IG report \nafter another and, do you know what. Nothing seems to happen. It is \nlike the IG is howling in the wilderness. There is no followup, no \ncorrective action.\n  Why is this being tolerated? How many more times does the IG need to \nbe confronted by such obvious signs of fraud before decisive action is \ntaken?\n  Maybe next time the auditors can't find an audit trail on a big \ncontract, they should ``lock the doors and call the law''--just drop a \nnet on the place and call for backup.\n  This brings me to my second audit issue. The IG's Audit Office has \nallowed itself to be buffaloed by the ``no audit trail'' scenario. It \njust backs off and rolls over instead of attacking the problem head on \nwith solutions.\n  The heart and soul of my financial oversight operation is a contract \naudit.\n  In the government, there can be no expenditure of public money \nwithout a written binding contractual agreement. That document must \nspecify what goods and services are to be delivered. That is the law. \nThat is where the money trail starts, with a contract. That is where \naudit work should begin. It is square 1 on the audit roadmap.\n  Beyond the contract, there are a number of critical data points or, \nyou might say, dots. These should pop up on the auditor's radar screen. \nThese may include contract modifications, recorded obligations, \ninspection and receiving reports, invoices, and payments, eventually.\n  To get a handle on fraud and waste, auditors then need to connect all \nthe dots between the contract that starts over here at the beginning \nand the final payment of money over here. They need to make all of the \nhookups. For example, when contract requirements can't be matched with \npayment, well then, bingo; there is a potential problem.\n  This is what is called a full-scope, end-to-end audit. This is what \nauditors must do to document and verify fraud and waste. Doing that \nwork positions them to answer two key oversight questions: Did the \ngovernment get what it ordered at the agreed-upon price and schedule or \ndid the government get ripped off?\n\n[[Page S7126]]\n\n  Top audit officials repeatedly and consistently told my investigators \nthat doing genuine contract audits was ``impossible, we can't do it, \nit's too difficult.''\n  One audit appears to illustrate and typify the seemingly impassable \nobstacle, or brick wall, perceived by the auditors. The report is \nentitled ``The U.S. Air Force's Central War Reserve Material \nContract.'' It is report No. D-2009-108.\n  Instead of attempting to verify payments at the primary source, which \nis the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, the audit team opted for \nan unauthorized shortcut. When you are following the taxpayers' money \nto see if there is fraud involved, you are going to find some shortcut?\n  They chose, then, to rely on payment data provided by who? The \ncontractor, DynCorp, the target of the audit. Even using this flawed \naudit procedure, examiners were unable to match contract requirements \nwith payments. Then when they could not do it, they just give up. The \nreport concluded:\n\n       The government did not know what it was paying for. . . . \n     It may have paid for services DynCorp did not perform.\n\n  The auditors then simply turned a blind eye to the potential fraud \nhere in this instance.\n  One hundred sixty-one million dollars went out the door, and for \nwhat, we don't know. The report does not tell us. It does not nail down \nall of the pertinent facts. It is inconclusive and unfinished. The \nauditors just kicked the can down the road, bucking it to another \nDefense Department audit agency.\n  Clearly, auditing large, complicated Defense Department contracts \nwhere there is no audit trail to follow is, we have to admit, a \ndaunting task. But that does not mean it is a mission impossible. It \ncan be done. It has to be done. Senior managers refer to this task as \n``audit trail reconstruction work. It is labor intensive pick and \nshovel work.''\n\n  Today, the inspector general relies on small rinky-dink 5- or 10-\nmember audit teams. That doesn't cut it. The IG needs to deploy much \nlarger teams consisting of 25, 50, or even 100 auditors or more to \ntackle the most egregious contract jobs. And I don't mean hire more \nthan the 675 employees who are already there eating up $90 million.\n  Let me make one point crystal clear right now--and I am repeating \nbecause I think it is important. I am not suggesting the IG needs to \nhire more auditors. This should be done within available resources. \nWhat I am saying is this: The audit office needs to switch from a large \nnumber of small teams to a small number of large teams. That would be a \nreallocation of audit resources. The top audit office official said it \nwould be possible ``to cobble together such an audit team to look at \none of the big weapons programs.'' However, doing that would ``deplete \nresources needed to meet other priorities.''\n  The ``other priorities'' referenced by this top official are probably \nwasteful reviews of the Department's policy and procedures--in other \nwords, doing policy auditing instead of doing financial auditing.\n  In 2009, the audit office did not conduct one in-depth contract audit \nof a major weapon system or contract. Aren't major weapon systems an \naudit priority? The record suggests that it is not an audit priority.\n  To this Senator from Iowa, this is an astonishing revelation. The \ninspector general is not doing contract audits. How can this be? If the \nIG is doing contract audits, then the office of the IG is not or should \nnot be open for business--ought not to be spending that $90 million.\n  The core IG mission is to detect and report fraud, waste, and abuse \nto the Secretary and to the Congress and to recommend corrective \naction. To detect and verify fraud and waste, auditors need to be on \nthe money trail 24/7. That is where most fraud occurs. They need to be \nconnecting all the dots between contract signing over here and the last \npayment being made over here.\n  Instead of trying to do contract audits, the audit office gave up and \nmoved to greener, easier pastures. Most audits now focus on policies \nand procedures. In moving in this direction, the inspector general has \nstrayed far from a core mission costing $90 million. Today's preference \nfor policy audits yields zero benefits to the taxpayers. These reports \ncost about $800,000 apiece. Cranking out worthless policy audits may \nnot qualify as misconduct, but it surely is a blatant waste of precious \ntax dollars, at $90 million a year.\n  The current focus on policy audits helps me understand why 765 \nauditors--with an annual budget of $90 million--could not root out any \nmeasurable fraud or waste last year. The IG there at the Department of \nDefense needs to hit the reset button and refocus the audit effort on \nthe core IG mission.\n  First, he needs to resume full-scope contract audits to root out \nfraud and waste. Second, the audit office needs to aggressively review \nall the Defense Department's plans and programs for deploying a modern \naccounting system. It needs to offer specific recommendations that \nwould help the Department reach the 2020 readiness goals.\n  I am receiving assurances from the IG at the Department of Defense \nthat he is moving smartly in the right direction. The signals from that \noffice are very encouraging. Yet I remain skeptical. The audit office \nstill seems to think that full-scope contract audits are a nonstarter \nand policy reviews are highly relevant. We need a change of course.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/15/senate-section/article/S7126-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, It has been my custom to make a report to \nthe Congress, my constituents, and the general public when I return \nfrom a trip. I have sought recognition to speak about foreign travel I \nmade to Beijing, Hanoi and Taipei from August 6, 2010, to August 16, \n2010.\n  We departed Dulles International Airport on United Airlines on Friday \nmorning, August 6 en route to Beijing, China. This was my sixth visit \nto China, with the most recent taking place in 2006.\n  On Sunday, August 8, we had a meeting with Mr. William Farris, \nManaging Counsel for Google. Mr. Farris had previously served as \ngeneral counsel for the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, \nwhich was created by congressional statute in 2001 to oversee human \nrights and the rule of law. Especially with his background in these \ncritical issues, Mr. Farris offered his views on the potential for \nunfettered access to the internet in China, the recent cyber attack \nagainst Google, and an overview of the Chinese business environment. \nAlthough Google initially censored its search engine in China, I was \npleased that it has decided to offer a reroute through Hong Kong \nservers in order to provide uncensored access. China continues to put \npressure on international firms over the nature of content produced. \nThe Chinese government maintains a block on many U.S. Websites, \nincluding Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The pressure that the Chinese \ngovernment places on firms has already led to the departure of major \nforeign ventures. Go Daddy, a leading U.S. Web site registration firm, \nhas recently left the Chinese market. Increasing freedom will \nfacilitate economic growth and attract investment.\n  In my fiscal year 2011 appropriations request letter to the State and \nForeign Operations Subcommittee on the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nI urged the provision $50 million from the democracy fund to promote \nwidespread, secure Internet use by individuals residing in countries \nwith Internet monitoring, censorship, and control. This is a low-cost \nmethod of allowing people, especially those living under repressive \nregimes, to access all-source, unfiltered information. This capability \nenables freedom of thought, expression, and the unimpeded flow of ideas \nand information. One group, the Global Internet Freedom Consortium--an \nalliance of several organizations specializing in anti-censorship \ntechnologies--has submitted several important proposals. This group has \nbeen particularly effective in China, neutralizing the Chinese \ngovernment's ``Golden Shield'' and ``Green Dam'' barriers.\n\n[[Page S7127]]\n\n  As I wrote in my July 7, 2009, op-ed in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette:\n\n       The United States must fight fire with fire in finding ways \n     to breach these cyberwalls, which dictatorships use to \n     control their people and keep themselves in power. Tearing \n     down these walls can match the effect of what happened when \n     the Berlin Wall was torn down. No one understands this better \n     than the dictator states.\n\n  The Internet has proven to be one of the most powerful tools for \ncultivating nascent democracies. American companies who have abetted \nrepressive regimes by censoring information should reexamine their \nrelationships and ways of doing businesses.\n  That afternoon, we met with Ambassador Jon F. Huntsman Jr. and his \nwife, Mrs. Mary Kaye Huntsman, at the Ambassador's residence. I have \nknown Ambassador Huntsman since his days as Deputy U.S. Trade \nRepresentative in the George W. Bush administration as well as the \nGovernor of Utah. Ambassador Huntsman, fluent in Mandarin, brought \nunique skills to this post, gleaned from studying China for much of his \nlife, serving as a missionary in the Republic of China, and extensive \nbusiness experience. We discussed different dynamics of the U.S.-China \nrelationship, including international trade, regional security, and \nhuman rights.\n  On Monday, August 9, we began the day with a country team briefing \nfrom the U.S. Embassy in China. The briefing was led by Robert \nGoldberg, the Deputy Chief of Mission, and included Christopher Adams, \nMinister Counselor for Trade Affairs at the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, Aubrey Carlson, Political Minister Counselor, MaryKay \nCarlson, Acting Consul General, David Dollar, U.S. Treasury Economic \nand Financial Emissary to China, Robert Forden, Acting Economic \nMinister Counselor, Bradley Gehrke, Defense Attache, Randal Phillips, \nMinister Counselor for Plans and Programs, and William Zarit, Minister \nCounselor for Commercial Affairs from the Department of Commerce. \nFollowing the Country Team Briefing, I met John Klena, Julie Schneider, \nAndriana Wiegand, Sanford Dawson, Frank Joseph, Msg. Simon Price, Msg. \nMichael Fernald, Msg. Kenneth Hayles, and Megan Kellogg, fellow \nPennsylvanians who admirably serve the U.S. through our Embassy in \nBeijing.\n  Although the U.S. has many shared interests with China, it is \nimportant that we do not shy away from issues of potential conflict. I \npushed for the need to gain leverage in our relationship with the \nChinese in order to get them to change their behavior. I posed the \nquestion whether congressional action on trade issues and other \ndisagreements with China would be helpful in pursuing U.S. policy aims. \nThe country team indicated that congressional engagement helps China \nunderstand different stakeholders in the U.S. system. One other way to \nengage the Chinese is to coordinate with other countries and the \nbusiness community to apply unified pressure against China on specific \ntrade issues.\n  An area of concern is China's commitment to reducing the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, especially with regard to Iran and \nNorth Korea. Although China initially resisted a new round of sanctions \nagainst Iran this year, China seems to have been compliant with United \nNations Security Council resolutions. China has significant energy and \nbanking investments in Iran, and is reluctant to undermine its own \ninterests. Iran has a history of using deceptive financial practices to \ncircumvent U.N. sanctions, and it is important that all nations block \nbanking relations with Iranian financial institutions if those \ntransactions could facilitate Iranian nuclear proliferation. I made the \npoint that an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear weapons facilities \ncould harm China's energy supply, and that China might not have \nconsidered the impact of such an armed conflict on their bilateral \nrelationship with Iran.\n\n  China is North Korea's most significant economic partner and \ncontinues to provide North Korea with food aid. In 2009, trade between \nChina and North Korea surpassed $2.7 billion. In 2009, North Korean \nexports to China rose by 4.3 percent to $793 million. China needs to be \nmore willing to collaborate with the U.S. and international partners on \nurging North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program and \ndestabilizing rhetoric. According to the U.S. Mission, engagement with \nNorth Korea is the best bilateral working relationship we have with \nChina.\n  A recurring issue during my visit to the region was territorial \ndisputes in Southeast Asia. One especially problematic area is the \nSouth China Sea, which stretches from Singapore and the Strait of \nMalacca to the Strait of Taiwan. This waterway includes over 200 small \nislands, the majority of which are uninhabitable but rich in such \nnatural resources as oil and natural gas. Although projections for \nenergy reserves in the South China Sea vary, a 1994 U.S. Geological \nSurvey approximated that there were 28 billion barrels of oil. Because \nthere has not been any exploratory drilling in the area, estimates for \nenergy reserves in two of the particularly resource-rich island chains, \nthe Spratly Islands and Paracel Islands, are unknown. According to the \nEnergy Information Administration at the Department of Energy, oil \nconsumption in Asia is estimated to rise by over 2.7 percent per year \nto nearly 29.8 million barrels per day in 2030. Given the strategic \nimportance of the South China Sea, many of its proximate nations have \ncompeting claims for territory. Although the 1982 United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea has not determined specific \nterritorial delineations, it has offered guidelines for the resolution \nof competing claims through negotiation between nations.\n  China submitted a map to the United Nations Security Council that \ndepicted China's claim to over 80 percent of the South China Sea. The \nmap includes a U-shaped line, connected by ``9 dots,'' granting China \naccess to portions of the shores of Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, \nBrunei and the Philippines. This year, China began referring to this \ndisputed waterway as a ``core national interest,'' similar language \nused to describe Tibet and Taiwan. China currently occupies several of \nthe Spratly Islands. Vietnam has also claimed the Spratly Islands, \noccupying a small portion of the chain, as well as the Paracel Islands, \ndespite ceding the latter to China after being forcibly removed by the \nChinese military in 1974. China claims a wide-ranging exclusive \neconomic zone, EEZ, an area of a sea zone for which a nation owns \nrights for use of marine resources including fishing and subterranean \nenergy stores, in the South China Sea, despite the fact that Brunei, \nMalaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam all have proximate \ncoastal areas and competing claims for sovereignty. An EEZ, as \ndescribed in the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, is permitted \nfor certain waterways given their proximity to the coast of a country \nand other geographic factors.\n  The South China Sea is host to over one-third of global maritime \ncommerce, as well as more than 50 percent of Northeast Asia's energy \nsupplies. U.S. forces also use the South China Sea to support the war \nin Afghanistan. China's naval aggression is troubling. China has \ndeveloped its naval power to an unprecedented extent in recent years. \nNot only has China provoked U.S. military and aircraft in the South \nChina Sea, but its defense budget has grown by 10 percent per decade, \nonly slowing to 7.5 percent in 2010. China's naval modernization began \nin the 1990s, integrating such components as anti-ship ballistic \nmissiles, submarines, new weapons acquisition, and surface ships into \ntheir forces. China has been known to use the force of its navy to \nresolve disputes, in opposition to U.N. treatises and internationally \naccepted norms.\n  Increased Chinese aggression is also evident in the Yellow Sea. In \nthe wake of a March 26, 2010, North Korean sinking of a South Korean \nship, killing 46 sailors, the U.S. and South Korea announced, on July \n6, 2010, plans to hold war games. In a July 8, 2010, press report, \nChina came out against any foreign warships or planes participating in \nmilitary activities in the Yellow Sea or adjacent areas and ultimately \nhosted its own war games on the same day that the U.S. and South Korea \ndid. The Chinese military conducted a drill of unmanned drone aircraft \nin coastal areas to test radar and electromagnetic interference. The \nYellow Sea is international waters--all nations should have access.\n  Another contentious issue is the manufacturing of counterfeit \nproducts. In 2009, China was the source of 79 percent of the total \nvalue of all counterfeit products seized by U.S. Customs,\n\n[[Page S7128]]\n\ntotaling over $260 million. Chinese products also accounted for over 90 \npercent of all intellectual property rights-related seizures. The \nBusiness Software Alliance, an information technology industry group, \nhas projected that 80 percent of software used in China has been \npirated in violation of international copyright infringement laws, an \nimprovement from 90 percent in 2004. As a growing power, China should \nmake a greater effort to abide by international conventions and respect \nintellectual property rights. In fact, China stands to greatly benefit \nfrom fostering a business environment that protects innovation. A 10-\npercent drop in pirated software since 2004 corresponded to the \naddition of 220,000 jobs in China's legitimate information technology \nsector. Additionally, companies such as Apple, could be more willing to \nintroduce new ventures to Chinese markets with assurances that their \nproducts would be protected. Because Chinese companies preemptively \nregistered both the iPad trademark and design patent, Apple has delayed \nmarket entry of the iPad in China.\n  We departed the Embassy for a meeting with the Governor of the \nPeople's Bank of China, Zhou Xiaochuan. Many of the economic issues in \nthe relationship between the U.S. and China have persisted for years. \nAlthough Chinese officials have met with Secretary Geithner and former \nSecretaries of the Treasury, the U.S. should continue to develop a \nfrank dialogue with the Chinese. The U.S. Embassy counts 49 formal \ndialogues with the Chinese regarding financial and economic \ncooperation, although the Chinese count 60. At the meeting, I pressed \nthe issue of China's currency manipulation. Governor Zhou mentioned \nthat the Chinese economy is transitioning, noting that workers' wages \nhave increased by 20 percent and that China is allowing for increased \nprivate sector growth. Although the Chinese economy grew at 7.7 percent \nin 2009, Governor Zhou expected China's export growth rate to slow over \nthe next 3 to 5 years. I objected that 5 years would be too long to \nwait as the U.S. is losing jobs, especially in industries such as steel \nand rubber. I argued that Congress is contemplating legislating on the \ncurrency issue to rectify imbalances. Governor Zhou discussed how \neconomic uncertainty has made the Chinese government more careful about \neconomic policy changes and that China has economic challenges of its \nown, including a 10-percent unemployment rate. I retorted that the U.S. \nunemployment rate is currently at 9.6 percent.\n\n  I informed Governor Zhou about how Chinese subsidies and dumping are \nunfairly harming the steel and tire industries. According to the most \nrecent data issued by the Foreign Trade Division of the U.S. Census, \nthe annual trade deficit with China stands at $93.3 million as of May \n2010. Employment in American manufacturing has plummeted at the same \ntime that Chinese imports and U.S. trade deficits have set records. The \ntrade deficit with China is the largest imbalance ever recorded between \ntwo countries, in part because of China's deliberate undervaluing of \nits currency. I brought up two cases I recently argued before the \nInternational Trade Commission, ITC, for which the ITC found that \nChinese tire imports had disrupted the U.S. tire industry. In December \nof 2009, I urged the ITC to charge China with dumping of tubular steel \nand to impose sanctions. I argued that the lost jobs, reduced hours, \nand plant shutdowns constituted a ``severe and intolerable harm.'' By \nthe spring of 2009, 6 of 11 high grade tubular steel plants in the \ncountry, including mills in Koppel and Ambridge, PA, were idle as a \nresult of Chinese imports. While the Koppel and Ambridge plants are \nback operating at minimum capacity, overall industry operating capacity \ndropped from 68.5 percent in 2006 to 17.6 percent in 2009. During the \nsame period, China's market share of high grade tubular steel rose from \n15 to 37 percent. The ITC determined that the steel industry was \nmaterially injured or threatened with material injury, and the Commerce \nDepartment issued an AD duty order on imports ranging from 29.94 to \n99.14 percent.\n  I emphasized to Governor Zhou that it is unacceptable for China to \ncontinue to dump goods on the American economy. He mentioned that China \nunderstands the pressure on the Pennsylvania industries. He said that \ncertain shifts are inevitable and suggested that the U.S. seek \nsettlement from the World Trade Organization, WTO. The U.S. has filed \neight cases at the WTO for trade violations. We settled four cases and \nwon four of them. I pressed that the WTO takes too long and that the \ndamage from unfair trade practices is done before there is time for a \nresolution.\n  Following our meeting with the People's Bank of China, we departed \nfor a meeting with Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Chao. We discussed \nthe benefit of enhancing the U.S.-China relationship by targeting areas \nof mutual interest. I argued that the current trade relationship \nbetween the U.S. and China has an unfair impact on the U.S. steel and \nrubber industries. I also pressed the issue of ITC violations and \nChinese subsidizing and dumping goods. The U.S. is the largest export \ndestination of China, and China is the third largest export destination \nfor the U.S. There are 58,000 U.S. companies present in China. I told \nthe Minister that both China and the U.S. should review subsidies in a \nmanner where everything is placed on the table.\n  Our last meeting in Beijing was at Tsinghua University, host of the \nTemple University Rule of Law Program in China. On this visit, I met \nwith Wang Zhenmin, dean of the Law School and John Smagula, director of \nAsian Programs at Temple University Beasley School of Law. Since 1999, \nTemple has educated 1,024 legal professionals. Seventy-nine percent of \nthese participants have been from the public sector, including 370 \njudges, 151 prosecutors, 88 government officials, 152 law professors, \nand 47 Non-Governmental Organization legal staff.\n  On this visit, I addressed students in the master's in law program. \nThe students included: Judges Jiang Minsong, Su Tuan, Wang Didi, Wang \nXiaoqin, Wei Xigui, Xie Aimei, Yang Lingping, and Zhou Junsheng; \nProsecutors Feng Guanhua, Lin Bowen, Lu Xiaomei, Tang Shengjia, and \nYang Li; Chinese Officials Li Sheng, Ma Ning, Pang Lei, Xiang Hang, and \nYang Kefei; Law Professors Abulimiti Ameina, Lu Yao, and Zheng Yanpu; \nand from the private sector, Dimitrova Deniza, Fan Ping, Guo Qiushi, \nKuang Lu, Lang Zhuo, Tan Jiacai, Wang Hong, Wang Xin, Xu Changrong, \nZhang Hairong, Zhang Xianzhong, Zhang Yitong, and Zhu Wenting. The \ngroup asked me numerous questions on topics ranging from Justice Kagan, \nmy battles with cancer, my legislation that would televise Supreme \nCourt deliberations, and health care reform. The students were eager to \ndiscuss the benefits of the Temple University Program in China and how \nthe school continues to play an important role in bridging U.S.-Chinese \nrelations and cultivating the development of law.\n  This trip to China was especially meaningful for me because my last \nvisit in August 2006 was on a CODEL led by my friend, the late Senator \nTed Stevens. The Nation has lost an icon of statesmanship and a \nstalwart public servant. Senator Stevens was an exemplary leader in the \nU.S. Senate, a champion for military and defense issues, a proud \nveteran, and friend of mine. His work on behalf of all Alaskans was \nunparalleled in the U.S. Senate, and his passion for this country will \nbe forever remembered. Joan and I are deeply saddened by this news and \noffer our most sincere condolences to Catherine and the Stevens family.\n  I want to note that Senator Stevens was awarded the Distinguished \nFlying Cross for flying support missions for the 14th Air Force, also \nknown as the Flying Tigers, during World War II. The Flying Tigers, the \nFirst American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force, were organized \nbefore the U.S. officially entered World War II, designed to fight \nagainst Japanese forces. In 1942, the division was officially inducted \ninto the U.S. Air Force.\n  On Tuesday, August 10, we departed Beijing on Vietnam Airlines for \nHanoi, Vietnam. This was my second visit to Vietnam. We were met at the \nairport by Ambassador Michael Michalak and Control Officer Michael \nGoldman.\n   On Wednesday, August 11, we departed for the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi \nto receive a country team briefing. This briefing, led by Ambassador \nMichalak, was staffed by Mike Goldman, Acting Political Counselor, \nPatrick Reardon, Defense Attache, Justin Taylor, from the Foreign \nAgricultural Service, Michael Foster, Acting USAID Country Director, \nEric Frater, the Environment, Science, Technology, and Health Officer, \nYashue Pai, from the\n\n[[Page S7129]]\n\nForeign Commercial Service, Vivian Chao, PEPFAR Country Director, Lloyd \nNeighbors, Public Affairs Officer, Bruce Struminger, Center for Disease \nControl Country Director, Jessica Webster, Economic Counselor, and \nRobert Frazier, Management Counselor and Acting Deputy Chief of \nMission. I also appreciate the efforts of Nicole Johnson, Michael \nOrona, Tim Liston, and Matt Mathews.\n   At the briefing, we discussed the need to promote education in \nVietnam, address climate change in a global way, and deepen trust \nbetween the U.S. and Vietnam. Military exchanges could assist the \nlatter aim. The U.S. Embassy is actively involved in locating and \nreturning the remains of U.S. soldiers who were missing in action \nduring the Vietnam war, as well as managing funding appropriated by \nCongress to clean up Agent Orange. The continued presence of Agent \nOrange in Vietnam continues to present grave health threats to the \nVietnamese. The Vietnamese government requested that the U.S. focus its \nremediation efforts on Da Nang Airport. USAID has estimated that at \nleast $24 million is needed to complete this remediation project. I \nhave supported U.S. funding for remediation of dioxin contaminants, one \nof the harmful components of Agent Orange, including $15 million in \nfiscal year 2010 funding. The fiscal year 2010 amount was $3 million \nhigher than the fiscal year 2009 amount.\n   The U.S. currently contributes over $154 million a year in total aid \nto Vietnam, with $102 million allocated to the health sector--largely \nfor the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, and avian \ninfluenza. HIV/AIDS continues to pose a serious threat to the \nVietnamese. In the 111th Congress, I voted to appropriate $48 billion \nfor international HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs through \nfiscal year 2013, including $30 billion for PEPFAR. In my fiscal year \n2011 appropriations request letter to the State and Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee on the Senate Appropriations Committee, I asked for $1.75 \nbillion for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria \nworldwide.\n   Another issue in Vietnam is the continued presence of unexploded \nordinance. Since the end of the Vietnam war in 1974, more than 40,000 \nVietnamese have been killed from contact with unexploded ordinance and \nanother 64,000 people have been injured. According to Vietnam's \nMinistry of Defense, over 16 million acres of Vietnam are still \ncontaminated by 350,000 to 800,000 tons of unexploded ordinance, with \nover 3 million landmines in addition to unexploded bombs. From 2000 to \n2009, Vietnam has received more than $37 million in U.S. assistance for \nde-mining, mine risk education, survivors' assistance, and landmine \nimpact studies. At the current pace of clearance, it will take 300 \nyears and more than $10 billion to clear Vietnam of leftover unexploded \nordinance.\n   This year, the U.S. and Vietnam celebrate the 15th anniversary of \ndiplomatic relations. Fifteen years ago, bilateral trade was $451 \nmillion annually, an amount dwarfed by the $15.4 billion traded in \n2009. The U.S. and Vietnam have come very far in overcoming historical \nanimosities, exemplified through joint military exercises held on \nAugust 11, 2010. Vietnam currently holds the rotating Chair of ASEAN \nand the ASEAN Regional Forum, increasing its leadership role in the \nregion. Since adopting a series of economic reforms in 1986, Vietnam \nhas been steadily liberalizing its economy. Vietnam was admitted to the \nWorld Trade Organization in 2007. This economic transition has led to a \nsteep decline in the poverty rate, which dropped from 58 percent of the \npopulation in 1993 to below 30 percent in 2003. The partnership between \nVietnam and the U.S. continues to grow. In 2009 the U.S. imported $12.2 \nbillion from Vietnam and exported $3 billion.\n   With regard to territorial disputes in the South China Sea, in \nrecent months, China has escalated its rhetoric, harassed Vietnamese \nfishing boats, and objected to potential cooperation between Western \nenergy companies and the Vietnamese government to harness resources. \nUsing the guidelines for EEZs, Vietnam claims sovereignty over all of \nthe Spratly and Paracel Islands. In 2002, Vietnam, along with other \nASEAN countries, signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in \nthe South China Sea. The parties of this declaration agreed to settle \nthe territorial disputes in the South China Sea through negotiation and \nthe development of peaceful solutions rather than military force. \nAccordingly, Vietnam resolved a dispute with Cambodia over the Gulf of \nThailand through a 2006 resource-sharing pact. In 1992, Vietnam and \nMalaysia signed a Joint Development Areas agreement. In 1997, Vietnam \nand Thailand signed an agreement delineating their respective sea \nboundaries. Despite all of these agreements, China has not been willing \nto pursue peaceful arrangements, instead relying on coercion and \nbullying. Supported by the leadership of Secretary Clinton, a coalition \nof Southeast Asian nations, at the recent ASEAN Regional Security \nForum, publicly challenged Chinese sovereignty over many areas of the \nSouth China Sea, seeking a regional solution as opposed to a series of \nbilateral agreements.\n   On August 11, we participated in a working lunch hosted by the \nNational Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ngo Quan Xuan. We \ndiscussed the importance of the U.S.-Vietnam economic relationship, \nAgent Orange remediation, as well as the prospect of Chinese regional \nhegemony. The Chairman also mentioned that there are 13,000 Vietnamese \nstudents studying in the U.S.--this student exchange is particularly \nimportant given the need for trained doctors and lawyers in Vietnam and \nfor fostering ties between the U.S. and Vietnam among the next \ngeneration of leaders. I explained to him how a lack of progress on \nhuman rights threatens progress of many areas of the U.S.-Vietnam \nrelationship, including arms sales.\n\n  The next day, we met with Duong Trung Quoc, a member of the \nVietnamese Assembly. He is one of the few non-Communist members in the \nAssembly and shared his views on prospects for liberalizing Vietnam and \nthe future of the Vietnamese political and economic systems. He is a \nhistorian and journalist by trade. We spoke at great length about the \nhistory of Vietnam and how historical interactions have shaped current \nregional tensions and security concerns.\n  On Friday, August 13, we departed Hanoi for Taipei, Taiwan on China \nAirways. This was my fourth visit to Taiwan, with the most recent one \ntaking place in 2001.\n  After being received at the airport by officials from the Taiwanese \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and the American Institute in Taiwan, we \nwere escorted to a meeting with President Ma Ying-jeou. President Ma \nwas born in Hong Kong and received his undergraduate education from the \nNational Taiwan University. He then received graduate degrees from New \nYork University and Harvard University. President Ma served as mayor of \nTaipei before being elected President in 2008.\n  The U.S. and the Republic of China enjoy close ties. President Ma \noffered his views on North Korean aggression and China's role in the \nregion. I pressed him on the steel industry, tariffs in both our \ncountries, importing American beef to Taiwan, and ways of enhancing the \nbilateral economic relationship. The U.S. exported over $18.5 billion \nto Taiwan, while it imported $28.4 billion. Taiwan is currently the \n11th largest export market for U.S. goods and the U.S. is currently \nTaiwan's third largest trade partner. The bilateral Trade and \nInvestment Framework Agreement, TIFA, a process designed to enhance \neconomic cooperation and resolve disputes, guides U.S.-Taiwan trade \nrelations.\n  We spoke about the recent Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement, \nECFA, between Taiwan and China, signed on June 29, 2010. The EFCA was \npreceded by the first direct flight between Taipei and Shanghai, which \ndeparted on June 14, 2010, increasing the ease of travel between China \nand Taiwan. The ECFA will remove tariffs on 539 Taiwanese products and \n267 Chinese goods over the next 3 years. This deal permits Taiwan to \nseek free trade agreements with other nations in the region, and talks \nwith Singapore are currently underway. Because Taiwan would struggle \neconomically without the Chinese market, some are wary that Taiwan is \nbecoming too dependent on the Chinese.\n  We discussed U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. The Taiwanese Relations Act, \nTRA, of 1979 calls for the U.S. to supply\n\n[[Page S7130]]\n\nTaiwan with capabilities for self-defense and creates unofficial \nrepresentation in Taiwan through the American Institute in Taiwan. The \nTRA names U.S. policy as being oriented towards resisting coercion of \nthe unofficial U.S.-Taiwan relations. Although the U.S. must provide \nfor the sale of arms to Taiwan, the TRA does not specify the types of \narmaments, requiring only that Taiwan should be able to maintain \n``sufficient'' defensive capabilities. Under the purview of the TRA, \nthe U.S., on August 25, 2008, announced its intent to sell 60 Harpoon \nmissiles, worth approximately $89.8 million, to Taiwan. On October 3, \n2008, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the \npossible foreign military sale of six different types of defense \narticles and equipment, which could have totaled a maximum of \napproximately $6.4 billion. After increasingly tense relations between \nthe U.S. and China, President Obama decided to defer the arms deal \nuntil 2011. Taiwan will still be able to purchase minor parts and \nupgrades.\n  We discussed the Taiwanese request, submitted in November 2009, to \nupgrade F-16A/D fighters which were initially sold to Taiwan in 1992. \nThe Taiwanese request noted that the upgrades would render the fleet \nparallel to the new F-16C/D fighters, reducing the need for a \nsubstitute fleet. American contractors have estimated that this \nretrofit would take approximately 6 years to complete.\n   On August 15, we attended a working lunch hosted by Dr. Lyushun \nShen, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. The meeting was attended by \nBenny T. Hu, Chairman of CDIB BioScience Venture Management, Maj. Gen. \nMike Tsai-Mai Tien of the Republic of China Air Force Academy, Mrs. \nTien, Lawrence S. Liu, Senior Vice President of China Development \nFinancial Holdings, Johnson S. Chiang, Section Chief of the Department \nof North American Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ms. Grace \nYa-hung Lin, Assistant to Deputy Minister Shen, Eric Madison, Deputy \nDirector of the American Institute in Taiwan, Ms. Judy Kuo, Deputy \nChief from the Economic Section at the American Institute in Taiwan, \nand Ms. Astrid Ai-yun Chen, Officer, Department of North American \nAffairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n   On Monday, August 16, we met with Wang Jin-pyng, president of the \nLegislative Yuan, before departing for Taipei International Airport. We \nflew on Eva Airlines from Taipei to Newark, NJ, for 16 hours leaving on \nAugust 16 and arriving on August 16 crossing the international date \nline.\n   I would like to recognize Major Lance Burnett and Dan Eisenberg of \nmy staff for their support of this CODEL.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/15/senate-section/article/S7130-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the significant \nthreat prostate cancer poses to the male population in the United \nStates.\n  The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 217,000 American \nmen will learn that they have prostate cancer in 2010, and 32,000 \nAmerican men will lose their lives to the disease this year, making \nprostate cancer the second most common cause of cancer death among men.\n  One out of every six American men will be diagnosed with prostate \ncancer, and an estimated one in 36 men will die from this disease.\n  African-American men experience a significantly higher incidence rate \nof prostate cancer than White males, and more than double the mortality \nrate.\n  This disease is also affecting young Americans. Thirty percent of \nthose battling prostate cancer are under the age of 65, prime years of \nproductivity for families and for this Nation.\n  Doctors across our country agree: early detection presents the best \nchance for a cure. However, this motto is more than good public policy \nfor me.\n  As a 10 year prostate cancer survivor myself, I know the value of \nearly detection and surgery, and it is painful for me to know that many \ngood people in this great country are not being diagnosed early and are \ntherefore greatly increasing their risk. The simple PSA blood test can \nbe the key to detection. Millions have taken advantage of it, but \nunfortunately millions do not. We must do better.\n  Approximately 98 percent of men diagnosed with early stage prostate \ncancer are still alive after 10 years, but only 18 percent of those \ndiagnosed with advanced stage prostate cancer survive 10 years.\n  Increasing awareness of prostate cancer is particularly important to \nmy home State of Alabama. Although we have world class medical research \nfacilities at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and excellent \ndoctors across the State, 3,300 men in Alabama will develop prostate \ncancer in 2010, and 600 deaths in our State will be attributed to \nprostate cancer this year.\n  In May 2006, Alabama was one of 5 States to receive a failing grade \nin regards to its ``prostate cancer awareness'' by the National \nProstate Cancer Coalition. A 2006 CDC study found that 38 out of \n100,000 Alabama men die from prostate cancer, ranking Alabama 47th in \nthe US.\n  Every year since 2002, I have introduced a resolution to increase \nawareness about prostate cancer and to encourage men to talk with their \ndoctors about this disease.\n  I am pleased to partner with ZERO: The Project to End Prostate Cancer \nin promoting this year's resolution and other activities throughout the \nmonth of September to increase public knowledge about prostate cancer \nincluding risk factors, prevention, and treatment options.\n  Last night the Senate passed S. Res. 597, a resolution to designate \nSeptember 2010 as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. The purpose \nof this resolution is to bring attention to prostate cancer and \nencourage Americans to take an active role in the fight to end the \ndevastating effects of prostate cancer on individuals and their \nfamilies.\n  I am honored to be joined on this resolution with 28 cosponsors, \nincluding Senators Bayh, Bennett, Boxer, Burr, Burris, Cardin, Casey, \nChambliss, Cochran, Crapo, Dodd, Dorgan, Feingold, Feinstein, Hatch, \nInhofe, Inouye, Isakson, Johanns, Johnson, Kerry, Landrieu, Lugar, \nSchumer, Shelby, Specter, Tester, and Vitter.\n  I thank my Senate colleagues that have worked to increase prostate \ncancer awareness through this resolution, and I applaud the work of \ncountless Americans who give up their time and energy to raise \nawareness of this disease and fight prostate cancer's impact on \nfamilies and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/15/senate-section/article/S7130-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7130-S7131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICA'S CUP INDUCTION\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this Saturday I will attend the 17th \nannual America's Cup Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in Newport, RI. \nToday, I would like to congratulate this year's inductees: Simon \nDaubney, Warwick Fleury, Murray Jones, Dean Phipps, Mike Drummond, and \nHalsey Herreshoff. I would also like to say a few words about Rhode \nIsland's connection with sailing and with the America's Cup.\n  I should call special attention to the Rhode Islander being honored, \nHalsey Herreshoff. Halsey has made numerous contributions to the \nsailing world. His four defenses of the America's Cup and his legendary \nnaval designs continue the long and proud history of the Herreshoff \nfamily. His grandfather, Nat ``the wizard of Bristol'' Herreshoff, \ndesigned 27 years of defenders of the America's Cup, and that tradition \nwas passed down through his father to Halsey. Halsey Herreshoff is the \neditor of the classic ``The Sailor's Handbook'' and has served his \ncommunity as the Bristol town administrator for 8 years. He continues \nhis service as president of the Herreshoff Marine Museum and as a \nmember of the Bristol Town Council. He is a friend, a public servant, \nand a great sailor, and I congratulate him on this honor.\n  In 1930, Newport hosted its first America's Cup race. For many \ndecades, Newport and the America's Cup were so closely identified as to \nbe virtually indistinguishable. Our excellent sailing waters and winds, \nour beautiful venue, our legendary hospitality, and a long string of \nsuccessful defenses kept this link firmly forged.\n  It is thus no coincidence that this ceremony is held in Newport or \nthat the America's Cup Hall of Fame resides in Rhode Island. People \nacross the country closely associate our great Ocean State with our \nsailing culture. And nothing is more responsible for that association \nthan our long connection with the America's Cup. Newport\n\n[[Page S7131]]\n\nhosted the Cup for over 50 years; its departure in 1983 left our State \nwithout one of its most cherished icons.\n  For Rhode Island, the Cup represented more than the pride of years of \nsuccessful defenses: the Cup was a huge boost to our economy. San \nFrancisco, the site of the next race, estimates that the competition \nwill bring $1.4 billion in additional revenue, and a 2007 study \nestimated that Newport could see a $886 million boost if we were the \nhost site. Imagine what that investment would do for Rhode Island with \nour nearly 12 percent unemployment rate. The Cup brings millions of \ndollars in construction, hospitality, boat maintenance, and media \njobs--jobs our State sorely needs.\n  While the Cup may no longer be held in our Ocean State, Rhode Island \ncontinues its love for sailing and remains a great host site for \nnational and international races. Efforts are underway to bring some of \nthe America's Cup qualifying races to Newport--efforts I \nenthusiastically support. It would be heartening to see the Cup come \nfull circle, to what we still consider its true home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/15/senate-section/article/S7131-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 REISTERSTOWN AMERICAN LEGION POST 116\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing the Reisterstown American Legion Post 116, which will \ncelebrate its 75th anniversary on November 6, 2010. The American Legion \nDepartment of Maryland has 147 active posts. Reisterstown Post 116 is \nthe largest post and the largest wartime veterans service organization \nin the State of Maryland. The Reisterstown American Legion Post 116 was \nformed on November 6, 1935, by a group of 13 charter members. By 1986, \nthe post had expanded to more than 400 members, including a Sons of the \nAmerican Legion Squadron of 75 members, an American Legion Auxiliary of \nabout 100 members, and an active Legion Riders organization.\n  Part of the Reisterstown American Legion Post 116's success has been \nits involvement in the northwest Baltimore County community. The post \nawards scholarships to students, participates in the American Legion \nBoys and Girls State programs, and assists the Reisterstown Recreation \nCouncil. Post 116 also provides volunteers and donations to many \ncharitable organizations, including the Maryland Special Olympics, the \nEpilepsy Foundation, United Cerebral Palsy, the Muscular Dystrophy \nAssociation, and the Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Post 116 on its \n75th anniversary, and to join me in commending the post's leadership, \npast and present, and in extending our thanks to its members for their \nservice to Reisterstown Post 116, the Baltimore community, and to our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/15/senate-section/article/S7131-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING RALPH SMEED\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I honor the life of Ralph \nSmeed, who will be remembered affectionately for his great love for \nthis country.\n  Ralph had many accomplishments throughout his life. Born into a \npioneer family in southwestern Idaho in 1921, Ralph embodied strength, \nperseverance and devotion. He served in the U.S. Army during World War \nII, attended the University of Idaho, and was a successful and able \nbusinessman who ran his family's ranching operation after Ralph's \nfather passed away. Ralph was also a dynamic thinker, debater and \nwriter, who contributed significantly to State and national political \ndiscussions, cofounded the Center for the Study of Market Alternatives, \nserved on the board of the Foundation for Economic Education, and was a \nlong-time newspaper columnist. Ralph had a unique and powerful way of \ncommunicating his ideas, and his presence in Idaho political discourse \nwill be greatly missed. One could not ignore Ralph's electronic reader \nboard that gave passersby food for thought. Understandably, Ralph has \nbeen honored for his strong commitment to free market ideals, liberty \nand his defense of the principles of freedom.\n  Ralph will continue to be recognized for his numerous \naccomplishments, but it is his example of conviction that will be most \nremembered. Ralph had strong principles and held true to his values. He \nthought deeply, understood the value of listening albeit many times \nwith great restraint, and delivered his points with passion and humor. \nRalph could not be rightly accused of caring too little. He did not sit \non the sidelines. Ralph embraced the dialogue and tackled the tough \nissues. He was always engaged and challenged others. Ralph's \ninterjection of free-thinking, strong, libertarian views shaped \ndiscussions and opinions. He added flavor and insight from his many \nyears of experience, discussion and contemplation. He sought to protect \nindividual liberties and contributed substantially to conservative \nknowledge.\n  Ralph was a spirited, dedicated, witty, generous, sincere individual \nand true patriot. Ralph touched and enriched the lives of all those he \nmet, and I am grateful to have known him. There is no doubt there will \nbe a significant void left by Ralph's passing. As we honor Ralph \nSmeed's life, and extend thoughts and prayers to Ralph's family, \nfriends and loved ones for this great loss, Ralph's individuality and \ndedication will not be forgotten. Ralph was a true thought provoker who \nwas devoted to the promotion of liberty and encouraging others to work \nfor liberty. Ralph Smeed will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/15/senate-section/article/S7131-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7131-S7132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING BOBBY EUGENE HANNON\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I recognize Bobby Eugene \nHannon Sr., 76, of Hot Springs, who passed away Saturday, August 28, \n2010. A beloved member of the Hot Springs community and the entire \nState, ``Coach Hannon'' was one of Arkansas's finest citizens. His \nlegacy will long be remembered at Hot Springs High School, where he \ncoached football from 1970 to 1979. His many championships and \naccomplishments in coaching were highlighted by his undefeated 1970 \nState Championship Team, voted No. 1 in the State by the Associated \nPress.\n  In 2008, Coach Hannon was inducted into the Arkansas High School \nCoaches Association Hall of Fame. He received the Lowell Manning Award \nin 1970 as the Arkansas High School Coach of the Year and was selected \nhead coach for the West Squad in the AHSCA All Star Game. His teams \ncompeted in five more championship games, including the longest high \nschool football game in Arkansas history against Jonesboro in 1972 that \nended in a tie for co-championship.\n  Before his coaching career, Coach Hannon was an outstanding athlete \nwith many accomplishments, including serving as quarterback of Little \nRock High School and being selected All-State and All-Southern \nquarterback. Coach Hannon received a football scholarship at Arkansas \nTech University and played there for 4 years, where he received all AIC \nconference honors.\n  Drafted into the U.S. Army, he played on the Fort Lewis Washington \nChampionship football team for 2 years. Coach Hannon also played \nshortstop for the famed Little Rock Doughboys baseball team next to \nMajor League Baseball Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson.\n  After retiring from coaching, he continued his working career selling \nteam sporting goods for Spaulding and Sportstop Athletics. Most \nrecently Coach Hannon was employed by Hurst, Morrisey and Hurst Law \nFirm.\n  Coach Hannon was involved in numerous community services. He was a \nmember of Brookwood Baptist Church, a lifetime member of Elks Lodge No. \n380, American Legion Baseball commissioner for 4 years, served as \ncochairman for the State Multiple Sclerosis Fund Raisers and was a \nmember of the Hot Springs Quarterback Club prayer group.\n  He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Janice (Avra) Hannon; his \nthree children, Lisa Hannon Madden, Bobby Eugene Hannon Jr., and \nBridget Hannon Summers; four grandchildren, Beau Harvey, Trish Madden \nJordan, Lauren Hannon Madden Pope, and Don Allen Madden III; four step-\ngrandchildren; three great-grandchildren; and three step great-\ngrandchildren.\n  Along with all Arkansans, I thank Coach Hannon for his years of \nservice to our State. He will be greatly missed.\n\n[[Page S7132]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/15/senate-section/article/S7132-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO TIM PIKE\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I recognize Arkansan Tim \nPike of Quitman who was recently named Arkansas's 2010 First Responder \nof the Year by the Arkansas EMT Association. Tim represents the best of \nArkansas and is more than deserving of this prestigious honor. I \ncongratulate him on this significant achievement.\n  Tim's tenure as a first responder for the Quitman EMS spans 25 years. \nHe has saved countless lives and aided his fellow citizens at times \nwhen they needed him the most. Tim's efforts have also inspired those \nwho he has helped to ``pay it forward'' and give back to the community \nthrough volunteerism and other types of service.\n  Tim first started his volunteer service with the local fire \ndepartment in 1985. That same year, he became a volunteer first \nresponder for the ambulance service. Today, he balances both his gun \nbusiness and his duties as Quitman's animal-control officer and Cadron \nTownship constable.\n  First responders like Tim help keep Arkansas safe, and I am grateful \nfor their service and sacrifice. Along with all Arkansans, I commend \nour emergency responders for their commitment to protecting the \ncitizens of our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/15/senate-section/article/S7132-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/15/senate-section/article/S7132-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/15/senate-section/article/S7132-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:34 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 6102.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to issue prospective guidance clarifying \nthe employment status of individuals for purposes of employment taxes \nand to prevent retroactive assessments with respect to such \nclarifications; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Fair Playing \nField Act of 2010 to provide a fairer playing field to America's \nbusinesses and workers. It will ensure workers are afforded protections \nalready in the law, such as workers' compensation, Social Security, \nMedicare, payment of overtime, unemployment compensation, and the \nminimum wage. It will also ensure help\n\n[[Page S7136]]\n\nemployers who play by the rules are not forced to compete against those \nbusinesses that don't. This legislation is identical to legislation \nbeing introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative \nMcDermott. Senators Murray, Gillibrand, Sherrod Brown, Franken, Akaka, \nSchumer, and Leahy are cosponsors.\n  Under current law, employers are required to take certain actions on \nbehalf of their employees including withholding income taxes, paying \nSocial Security and Medicare taxes, paying for unemployment insurance, \nand providing a safe and nondiscriminatory workplace. Employers are not \nrequired to undertake these obligations for independent contractors. \nToo often, workers are misclassified by businesses looking to avoid \npaying taxes. These businesses receive an unfair advantage over \nbusinesses that play by the rules.\n  The Internal Revenue Service, IRS, currently uses a common law test \nto determine whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor. \nUnfortunately, a loophole exists which allows a business to escape \nliability for misclassifying employees as independent contractors. \nFurthermore, there is statutory prohibition on the IRS providing \nguidance through regulation on employee classification.\n  Federal and State revenue is lost when businesses misclassify their \nworkers as independent contractors. A study estimated that, between \n1996 and 2004, $34.7 billion of Federal tax revenues went uncollected \ndue to the misclassification of workers and the tax loopholes that \nallow it. Recently, GAO and Treasury Inspector General reports have \ncited misclassification as posing significant concerns for workers, \ntheir employers, and government revenue.\n  Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 generally allows taxpayers to \ntreat a worker as not being an employee for employment tax purposes, \nregardless of the worker's actual status under the common law test, \nunless the taxpayer has no reasonable basis for such treatment or fails \nto meet certain requirements. Section 530 is commonly referred to as a \n``safe harbor.'' This provision was initially enacted in 1978 for a \nyear to give Congress time to resolve these complex issues. In 1982, \nthe safe harbor was made permanent. In addition, section 530 prevents \nthe IRS from requiring an employer afforded a safe harbor to reclassify \na worker prospectively.\n  The Fair Playing Field Act of 2010 ends the moratorium on IRS \nguidance addressing the worker classification issue. The legislation \nrequires the Secretary of Treasury to issue prospective guidance \nclarifying the employment status of individuals for Federal employment \ntax purposes. The effective date for the provision of authority to \nissue guidance is the date of enactment.\n  Under the Fair Playing Field Act of 2010, the section 530 safe harbor \nwill continue to be available to employers with respect to the \ntreatment of an individual for Federal employment tax purposes until \nthe individual has a reclassification date. An individual's \n``reclassification date'' is the earlier of the following two dates: \nthe first day of the first calendar quarter beginning more than 180 \ndays after the date of an ``employee classification determination'' \nwith respect to such individual; or the effective date of the ``first \napplication final regulation'' issued by the Secretary of the Treasury \nwith respect to such individual. An ``employee classification \ndetermination'' with respect to an individual is a determination by the \nSecretary of the Treasury, in connection with an audit of the taxpayer \nthat begins after the date that is one year after the date of \nenactment, that a class of individuals holding positions with the \ntaxpayer that are substantially similar to the position held by the \nindividual are employees.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Fair Playing Field Act of 2010 \nwhich will provide valuable protections to workers who are erroneously \nmisclassified and help combat the underground economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 3788. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \ntemporarily increase the investment tax credit for geothermal energy \nproperty; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from \nIdaho, Senator Mike Crapo, in introducing the Geothermal Energy \nInvestment Act of 2010. This legislation will amend an already existing \ninvestment tax credit for geothermal energy authorized under Sec. 48 of \nthe tax code. The bill would provide geothermal energy with the same 30 \npercent investment tax credit that is now available to solar energy and \nfuel cell technologies in Sec. 48 and extend this 30 percent tax credit \nfor geothermal through December 31, 2016, as it is for these other \ntechnologies. Without this legislation, new geothermal energy projects \nwould be allowed only a 10 percent investment tax credit under Section \n48. This legislation will create a more level playing field among \nclean, renewable energy technologies and support substantial growth in \nutility scale geothermal power, distributed on-site power generation, \nand heating for buildings and commercial processes.\n  Geothermal energy facilities provide a continuous supply of renewable \nenergy with very few environmental impacts. Although the United States \nhas more geothermal capacity than any other country, this potential has \nbeen barely tapped. This shortfall is partly due to the high initial \ncost and risk involved in locating and developing geothermal resources. \nExtending the 30 percent tax credit through 2016 will help give \ngeothermal developers the assurance they need to make the long lead-\ntime investments in exploration and development necessary to make \nexpansion of geothermal energy a reality.\n  This legislation is identical to a bipartisan companion bill, H.R. \n5612, that Representative Earl Blumenauer from Oregon has introduced in \nthe House.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3788\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 5, United States Code to provide that \npersons having seriously delinquent tax debts shall be ineligible for \nFederal employment; read the first time.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, today I have introduced two separate \nbills, S. 3790 and S. 3791, intended to hold members of Congress and \nother Federal employees to the same tax rules Washington imposes on the \nrest of America.\n  In 2009, the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, found nearly 100,000 \ncivilian Federal employees were delinquent on their Federal income \ntaxes, owing over $1 billion in unpaid Federal income taxes. When \nconsidering retirees and military, more than 282,000 Federal employees \nowed $3.3 billion in taxes.\n  These bills are not intended to single out the majority of Federal \nemployees who work hard and pay their taxes, but members of Congress \nand Federal employees have a clear obligation to pay their Federal \nincome taxes. Legislators and government employees should not be exempt \nfrom the laws they write and enforce. The very nature of Federal \nemployment and the concept inherent to ``public service'' demands those \nbeing paid by taxpayers contribute their fair share of taxes. They \nshould lead by example.\n  Tax delinquency rate among congressional employees exceeds the rate \nof all returns filed nationwide. Taxpayers are fed up with those in \nWashington living under a different set of rules than the\n\n[[Page S7137]]\n\nrest of America. At a time when Congress may allow taxes to increase on \nsome or even all Americans, Congress should not expect other Americans \nto pay more taxes when they are not even paying the taxes they owe \nunder the rates they set themselves.\n  The bills I am introducing are fair to Federal employees and other \ntaxpayers. Both bills carefully reach only those paid by the taxpayers \nwho have willfully neglected to pay their incomes taxes.\n  The legislation excludes elected officials or Federal employees who \nmade oversights in their personal taxes but willfully agree to pay \nthem, or if they are challenging the delinquency in court or through \nthe IRS. Instead, it targets those who willfully neglect or avoid the \npay their taxes.\n  Specifically, it excludes Federal employees from termination and \nMembers of Congress from repercussions if the individual is currently \npaying the taxes, interest, and penalties owed to IRS under an \ninstallment plan; the individual and the IRS have worked out a \ncompromise on the amount of taxes, interest and penalties owed and the \ncompromise amount agreed upon is being repaid to IRS; the individual \nhas not exhausted his or her right to due process under the law; or the \nindividual filed a joint return and successfully contends he or she \nshould not be fully liable for the taxes, interest, and/or penalties \nowed because of something the other party to the return did or did not \ndo.\n  The first bill requires all Federal employees to be current on their \nFederal income taxes or be fired from their jobs.\n  The second bill requires Members of Congress to report any \noutstanding tax liability. If the Member possesses a tax liability, \nthis bill would require the appropriate congressional committee to \nlaunch an ethics investigation and the Member's salary would be reduced \nin accordance with the amount he or she owes.\n  These bills require no more of members of Congress or Federal \nemployees than is required of other Americans.\n  It should be a priority of this Congress to pass these solutions as a \nway to guarantee equal treatment under the law. This is especially \nimportant at this time when our national debt exceeds $13.5 trillion \nsince this legislation is estimated to reduce the Federal deficit by at \nleast $3 billion.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support these \nbills to demonstrate their commitment to requiring Congress to live \nunder the same rules it imposes on the rest of the country. It is time \nfor every member of Congress to pay their taxes rather than simply \nspending the taxes of others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/15/senate-section/article/S7137-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7137-S7138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             SENATE RESOLUTION 622--TO STOP SECRET SPENDING\n\n  Mr. COBURN (for himself and Mrs. McCaskill) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, there has been much debate over the past \nyear regarding ``secret holds'' stalling the consideration of \npresidential appointments or slowing expedited passage of legislation \nby the Senate. Lost in this discussion has been an issue that should be \na far greater concern for taxpayers--``secret spending.''\n  This body routinely attempts to pass hundreds of bills costing tens \nof billions of dollars or more in secret without debate, votes, or \namendments. It does so using an unofficial process not found in Senate \nrule books known as the ``hotline.''\n  The U.S. Senate is often referred to as ``the world's greatest \ndeliberative body.'' This is because Senate rules grant each of the \nSenate's 100 members rights that cannot be overridden by a simple \nmajority, including the right to require debate before a bill is \nconsidered or passed.\n  Yet, the Senate practice known as the ``hotline'' often prevents and \nprecludes debate. In fact, Senators often do not even read the bills \nbeing passed using the hotline.\n  The term ``hotline'' or practice of ``hotlining'' bills does not \nappear in the Senate's official rules, but this procedure is utilized \nnearly every day the Senate is in session. A hotline is an informal \nterm for an alert sent to members of the Senate giving notice of a \nproposed agreement to allow a bill or resolution to be approved by the \nSenate without debate or amendment. A measure that is ``hotlined'' is \nrecorded in the Congressional Record as a being agreed to by unanimous \nconsent, UC.\n  Hotlines occur at the discretion of the Majority Leader in \nconsultation with the Minority Leader. The leader's office contacts \neach Senate office with a message on a special alert line called the \n``hotline,'' which provides information on what bill or bills the \nleader is seeking to pass through unanimous consent. Hotline notices \nare only given to Senate offices.\n  If there is an objection to the bill being ``hotlined,'' a senator is \nasked to call the leader's office and give notice of intent to object \nto the bill being passed by unanimous consent whenever such a request \nmay occur. The process of notifying the leader's office of an objection \nto ``hotline'' is informally referred to as a ``hold.'' In practice, \ninstead of requiring explicit unanimous consent to pass a bill, the \n``hotline'' process only requires a lack of dissent.\n  In many instances, bills are hotlined for which no text, description, \nor budget estimates have been made publicly available. In some Senate \noffices, the ``hotline,'' or request for unanimous consent to pass a \nmeasure, may never even reach senators, and the decision to allow a \nbill to be approved without debate is determined by staff, who do not \neven read the bill.\n  When a bill is ``hotlined,'' the public is not informed and neither \nis the media. Only the offices of senators are alerted. It is therefore \na form of ``secret spending.'' Much like a ``hold'' can be kept from \nthe public, so can the ``hotlining'' of bills, which can cost billions \nof dollars.\n  The vast majority of legislation approved by the Senate is done so \nvia the ``hotline'' under the guise of unanimous consent. According to \nthe Congressional Research Service, CRS, ``in\n\n[[Page S7138]]\n\nthe last ten Congresses, 110th-101st, an average of 93 percent of \napproved measures did not receive roll call votes'' and ``in the 111th \nCongress through February 1, 2010, 94 percent of approved measures were \napproved without a roll call vote.''\n  Every time the Senate passes legislation without full and open \ndebate, the American people are done a disservice. The Senate should \nnot pass a new bill if its text, purpose, and budget estimate are not \navailable to the general public.\n  Taxpayers and the media should have the right to read and analyze \nlegislation prior to its passage. Senators, likewise, have a \nresponsibility to know the contents of legislation prior to granting \nconsent for its passage. Additionally, hotlining bills take away the \naccountability for legislation approved by the Senate. Since there is \nno recorded vote for most hotlined bills, senators have no culpability \nfor most of the legislation approved by the Senate.\n  The lack of of an objection from unelected staff should not be \nsufficient to pass legislation that could spend millions or even \nbillions of dollars and significantly alter U.S. laws.\n  In many cases, if a senator objects to a hotline request--even if the \nobjection is merely to be granted sufficient time to study and review \nthe text, cost, and impact of the legislation--special interest groups \nwill immediately label the senator who is trying to be diligent as an \nundemocratic obstructionist.\n  But the truth is neither democracy nor taxpayers are served well by \nthis process. ``Hotlining'' bills enable the hasty passage of \nlegislation without the public's knowledge or feedback. This process \nbenefits politicians and special interests rather than taxpayers.\n  Senators have an obligation to their constituents to do their jobs, \nwhich includes reading the bills and understanding the impact of \nlegislation passed by Congress.\n  Today I am introducing the ``Stop Secret Spending Resolution'' along \nwith Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri. This bi-partisan legislation \nwould provide transparency and accountability by prohibiting a bill or \njoint resolution from passing without a vote until the hotline \nnotifications are available on a public website for at least 72 hours. \nThe public notice much include: a cost analysis completed by the non-\npartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO); the number of new programs \ncreated by the legislation; and the actual legislative text.\n  The new 72 hour rule would not apply to noncontroversial item such as \npost office namings and sense of the Senate resolutions; nominations; \nany legislation relating to an imminent or ongoing emergency; or a \nunanimous consent request made when a quorum of the Senate is present.\n  Voters are demanding Congress bring greater accountability to the \nlegislative process. Ending secret spending represents a meaningful \nfirst step to guaranteeing increased accountability and transparency by \nproviding sufficient time for the public to review legislation before \nit is passed by Congress.\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support of \nthis legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/15/senate-section/article/S7138-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7138-S7139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 623--COMMENDING THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF INTEREST IN \nSCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS BY THE ENTERTAINMENT \n                    INDUSTRY, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mrs. Boxer) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                              S.

Awards Show this year to \n     award accurate and impactful portrayals of STEM in movies, \n     television series, radio and television news programs, and \n     print and online journalism: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the effective use of the substantial influence \n     and resources of the entertainment industry of the United \n     States, by those members of the entertainment industry, such \n     as the Entertainment Industries Council, who are working to \n     encourage interest in the fields of science, technology, \n     engineering, and mathematics; and\n       (2) urges the entertainment industry to continue to use the \n     creative talent, skills, and audience-reach at its disposal \n     to communicate the importance of science, technology, \n     engineering, and mathematics.\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the efforts of \nthe entertainment industries to encourage interest in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM. As the only serving \nSenator who has worked as an engineer, I am proud to sponsor a \nresolution acknowledging the essential role STEM professionals play and \nthe important work that they do.\n  I would also like to thank Senators Feinstein and Boxer for joining \nme in introducing this resolution.\n  I truly believe that, whether one considers our dependence on fossil \nfuels, efforts to promote global health, new challenges in homeland \nsecurity, or reinvesting in America's infrastructure, the next \ngeneration of STEM-educated graduates will be the problem solvers for \nthe most important issues of our time.\n  In fact, through 2018, STEM occupations are projected to provide 2.8 \nmillion job openings. What is more, over 90 percent of STEM occupations \nrequire at least some postsecondary education.\n  Yet, students across the country, particularly women and \nunderrepresented minorities, need a better understanding of, and \nappreciation for, STEM careers. They also need better access to quality \nSTEM opportunities and activities.\n  Fortunately, the entertainment industry has recognized this need.\n  The Entertainment Industries Council--a non-profit organization \ncreated in 1983 by leaders in the industry to raise awareness about \nmajor health and social issues--recently developed a similar initiative \nto elevate the importance of STEM in national entertainment and news \nproductions. Ready on the S.E.T. and . . . Action! will connect STEM \nexperts, companies, and organizations with the entertainment industry \nin order to disseminate accurate information about STEM professionals \nand careers.\n  Moreover, for 14 years, the Entertainment Industries Council has \nproduced the PRISM awards to honor productions and performances that \naccurately portray prevention, treatment, and recovery of substance \nabuse and mental illness. This year, they will produce the first-ever \nS.E.T. Awards Show to honor accurate and impactful portrayals of STEM \nin movies, television series, news programs, and print and online \njournalism.\n  Specific programming has started to take off. PBS has a new show \ncalled SciGirls to support girls' interests in STEM. Each half-hour \nepisode follows a different group of middle school girls who put \nscience and engineering to work in their everyday lives. The young \ngirls are aided in their quests by female mentors and a companion Web \nsite is incorporated into the TV series.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the Science Channel introduced Head Rush. This \none-hour, commercial-free programming is targeted at middle school-age\n\n[[Page S7139]]\n\nstudents and explores STEM through hands-on experiments, video shorts, \nviewer questions and answers, games, and visits from special guests. \nHosted by Kari Byron of Discovery's Mythbusters, there are three \nsegments per show which each address a specific theme of the hour.\n  The entertainment industry of the United States has an extraordinary \nability to reach young people. Whether it is movies, television, radio, \nor video games, the entertainment industries reach many of our nation's \nyouth, multiple times a day. I am so pleased that many in this industry \nare using this opportunity to positively impact their audiences by \nteaching them the wonders of STEM. I commend their efforts thus far and \nencourage them to continue to work to communicate the importance of \nSTEM to their audiences. I truly believe support for STEM--in \ngovernment, entertainment, and business--is essential for our economic \ngrowth and recovery. It is the future of our workforce. It is the key \nto our future prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/15/senate-section/article/S7139-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 624--HONORING THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMY NATIONAL GUARD \n AND AIR NATIONAL GUARD OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA FOR THEIR SERVICE AND \n   SACRIFICE ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Coburn) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
