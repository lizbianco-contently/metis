He, with the \ngracious concurrence of our Chaplain, Dr. Black, has opened the Senate \non other occasions. But it is with a great deal of pride for both \nMarcelle and myself when he is here and has a chance to visit with us. \nFather Pomerleau is a dear friend of all our family and has been a \nguide and spiritual leader for our family for decades.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a short bio of him by \nthe University of Portland, which even speaks about his clarinet \nplaying, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Campus Ministry: Rev.

He began his academic career \n     studying engineering and philosophy at Notre Dame followed by \n     theology in France and Italy. He earned his Ph.D. in \n     International Relations from the University of Denver in 1975 \n     and has taught at the University of Notre Dame and the \n     University of Chile. Since 1991, he has served as an \n     associate professor in the department of history and \n     political science here at the University of Portland and \n     became department chair in 1994. Fr. Claude also currently \n     serves at the Director of the Social Justice Program and is \n     the Religious Superior of the Holy Cross brothers and priests \n     at UP. He enjoys traveling and observing the universe, but \n     especially visiting the University of Chile where he is a \n     visiting professor in the summer. Fr.

Madam President, last night, the Senate took a strong \nstance on protecting taxpayers from the unintended consequences of a \nbill that was originally meant to hold Wall Street accountable for its \nmistakes.\n  Put aside for a moment the latest talking points the other side is \nusing about Republicans. Our goal throughout the debate has been to \nprotect taxpayers who got burned during the last crisis, and last \nnight's vote showed that those efforts are beginning to yield results.\n  A $50 billion fund for failing financial firms that would have \ndistorted the market by encouraging the same kinds of risky investments \nthat led to the last crisis is now out of the bill.\n  A provision that would have given investors in failing firms special \ntreatment is out. Congress will now have to approve any government \neffort to ensure bank debt. So improvements are being made to this \nfinancial regulatory bill in the right direction.\n  Now it is time to focus on what has emerged as another central point \nof contention, and that is the new government bureaucracy this bill \nwould create over at the Fed. The first thing to know about this new \nagency is that Congress would not have any power over it. The second \nthing to know is what it would do. Some of that is still vague, but the \nambiguities are part of the problem.\n  What we do know is that this new agency would be authorized to gather \ninformation on banking and purchasing patterns and on anyone--anyone--\noperating in consumer financial markets. One provision, section 1071, \ncould lead financial institutions to maintain a record on the number \nand dollar amount that each customer deposits at bank branches and \nATMs.\n  Now, understandably, a lot of Americans and a lot of small business \nowners have serious concerns about all of this. They are also concerned \nabout the potential of this bill to further dry up credit at a time \nwhen they are trying to dig themselves out of a recession.\n  We received a letter just yesterday from groups representing hundreds \nof thousands of businesses--from florists to orthodontists to builders \nto car dealers--all concerned about the potential impact this new \nagency would have.\n  Now, let me state the obvious: None of these businesses had anything \nwhatsoever to do with the financial crisis. None of these businesses \nhad anything to do with the financial crisis. Why on Earth would we \nwant to punish them for the reckless behavior we saw on Wall Street? \nWhy on Earth would we want to punish these small businesses for the \nreckless behavior we saw on Wall Street?\n  The fact is, this agency is more about using this crisis as an \nopportunity to slip a vast new European-style regulatory bureaucracy \npast the American people than it is about holding Wall Street \naccountable.\n  I say let's focus on Wall Street and the GSEs and leave ordinary \nAmericans out of this. Let's put the middle-class families and small \nbusiness owners who shouldered the burden of this crisis ahead of the \nbureaucratic wish lists in Washington. At a moment of near double-digit \nunemployment and exploding debts and deficits, let's have at least one \nDemocratic idea for expanding the reach of government on the shelf.\n  Later today, the Senate will have an opportunity to blunt the \npotential impact of this agency. Senator Shelby and I have joined \nseveral cosponsors on an amendment that would deflect the focus of this \nbill from Main Street and back to Wall Street where it belongs. Let's \ntake the bill off Main Street and send it back to Wall Street where it \nbelongs.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business supports our \namendment because, in the place of this new bureaucratic agency, it \nwould establish a new division within the FDIC that would oversee \nmortgage originators and other big financial service providers. That is \nwhere the target should lie--not on the backs of America's small \nbusinesses and middle-class Americans who expected to be protected by \nthe bill, not punished by it.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle not to lose our focus \nin this debate. I also urge everyone to support the Shelby-McConnell \namendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/06/senate-section/article/S3296-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 10 \na.m. will be for debate on amendment No. 3749, with the time equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I am just going to speak for 2 minutes \nthis morning, but I would like to stand to take a moment to voice my \nsupport for the Tester-Hutchison amendment.\n  This amendment will ensure that banks of all sizes pay their fair \nshare by broadening the assessment base that is used by the FDIC. The \nFDIC would determine bank premiums by basing it on total assets, not \njust domestic deposits. For far too long, community banks have paid a \ndisproportionate share of the deposit insurance premiums.\n  This amendment levels the playing field. It is a good piece of \npolicy. It will put community banks on a more equal footing with the \nlarge bank conglomerates. So I urge my colleagues to vote for this \ncommonsense amendment.\n  Let me wrap up by saying, the Independent Community Bankers have \nlooked at this amendment. This amendment would reduce assessments for \n98 percent of the banks with less than $10 billion in assets, keeping \nnearly $4.5 billion in the banks--much needed capital to make our \neconomy grow.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, how much time is on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, would you notify me when I have \nconsumed 5 minutes because there is another speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I rise to join my colleague, Senator Tester, and an increasing number \nof\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\ncosponsors, in support of our amendment which will ensure that banks of \nall sizes pay their fair share in deposit insurance for the risk they \npose to the banking system.\n  Our amendment is intended to level the playing field for our safe \ncommunity banks that for far too long have paid assessments into the \nFDIC insurance fund above and beyond the risk they pose.\n  The FDIC levies deposit insurance premiums on a bank's total domestic \ndeposits, but domestic deposits are not the best means to analyze the \nsafety of banks. Financial assets other than deposits create risk in \nthe system. Nondeposit assets are held disproportionately by larger \nnoncommunity banks and can be more complex and more risky.\n  Community banks with less than $10 billion in assets rely heavily on \ncustomer deposits for funding. This penalizes safe institutions by \nforcing them to pay deposit insurance premiums above and beyond the \nrisk they pose to the banking system.\n  Despite making up just 20 percent of the Nation's assets, these \ncommunity banks contribute 30 percent of the premiums to the deposit \ninsurance fund. At the same time, large banks hold 80 percent of the \nbanking industry's assets. Yet they just pay 70 percent of the \npremiums.\n  We must fix this inequality. That is what the Tester-Hutchison \nmeasure does. It will do so by requiring the FDIC to change the \nassessment base to a more accurate measure: a bank's total assets, less \ntangible capital. This change will broaden the assessment base and will \nbetter measure the risk a bank poses.\n\n  A bank's assets include its loans outstanding and securities held. \nOne need only look back to the last 2 years to know those are the \nassets that are more likely to show a bank's exposure to risk than just \nplain deposits. It wasn't a bank's deposits that contributed to the \nfinancial meltdown. The meltdown was caused by bad mortgages which were \npackaged into risky mortgage-backed securities which were used to \ncreate derivatives. These risky financial instruments and the large \ninstitutions that created and held them are what led to our financial \ncrisis.\n  So our amendment is particularly timely because the FDIC has now said \nbanks are going to have to prepay into the insurance fund for 3 years, \nand all that will be due this year, so a 3-year assessment will be due \nat the end of this year. It is so important to have a fair assessment \nratio, and that is what the Tester-Hutchison amendment will do. It will \nhave a ratio for what a bank owes into the deposit fund that is based \non its risk, based on assets minus capital.\n  I am very pleased to be the sponsor of this amendment. I worked on \nthis amendment in committee. I did the research on it to try to make \nsure we were doing the right thing. I am pleased Senator Tester joined \nme in this effort, and we have a very bipartisan group of supporters of \nthis amendment. It is my hope that we pass by an overwhelming vote this \namendment which will put into the law that the FDIC deposit insurance \nwill be based on a standard that levels the playing field for community \nbanks so big banks don't have an advantage over community banks. It is \nour community banks that are giving the loans to businesses throughout \nour country. They are the ones that were there in the crisis as best \nthey could to try to put liquidity into the market. They didn't cause \nthe crisis and they certainly shouldn't pay the price for it.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the Tester-Hutchison amendment.\n  Madam President, I was going to suggest we allocate the time being \nused against both sides. That would be my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me commend our two colleagues, Senator \nTester and Senator Hutchison, for this proposal. As I said several \ntimes yesterday, I think this is a very sound contribution to this bill \nfor the very reasons outlined this morning by Senator Hutchison and \nSenator Tester earlier--reducing the cost to our community banks at a \ntime when obviously they are all feeling tremendous pressures under \nthis economy. So I am a strong and ardent supporter of their proposal, \nand I am confident it will be overwhelmingly supported by our \ncolleagues.\n  Let me quickly add we are going to be moving on after that vote to \nthe Shelby, et al., amendment regarding consumer protection and \ncomplete replacement for the title. My colleague from Texas has written \nto me along with Jay Rockefeller regarding the Federal Trade \nCommission's interests, and we have worked that out, I believe, to the \nsatisfaction of my colleagues on the Commerce Committee. But I draw to \nthe attention of Members the amendment we will be voting on does great \ndamage to the FDIC's rulings and abilities in this legislation. I urge \npeople to take a good look at what we are going to be asked to support, \nas it deprives the FDIC of some of the very authority and rulemaking \nthat I think we want to preserve in our legislation. So I will address \nthe Shelby amendment after the Hutchison-Tester amendment is disposed \nof.\n  But let me say in response to the minority leader, one of the \nstrongest features of what has happened to our country over the last \nseveral years is we have had seven different Federal agencies that have \ndivisions on consumer protection. They have been around for a long \ntime. The reality is, most of them were asleep at the switch and were \ntreated as second-class operations within their prudential regulator to \nsuch a degree that even though we mandated legislatively to protect \nhome mortgages and people, they never even promulgated a single \nregulation in this area. Small businesses watched credit card rates go \nthrough the ceiling. Many people who rely on that ability are watching \ntheir rates jump from 5 percent to 22 percent, which is not uncommon.\n  So the idea that this has been a division between bureaucracy in \nWashington and what happens on Main Street is a complete aberration. We \nhave seen 7 million people lose their homes, many of them because they \nwere lured into deals they never could afford at the fully indexed \nprice. We saw the outrage expressed by consumers and we saw consumer \ncredit cards again where rates exploded, making it difficult. There are \nall sorts of features.\n  This bill covers only financial products and financial services. That \ndentists and butchers and retailers on the street are going to be \naffected by this is a complete myth, totally so, and the provisions of \nthe bill couldn't be more clear about it. There are no new regulations. \nWe are taking existing consumer laws, things such as truth in lending, \nfair credit. Some legislation goes back 50 years to protect consumers \nand others from the kind of activities people have to worry about every \nday, in terms of making sure they are not going to be abused by people \nwho would take advantage of them. The question is whether anybody is \ngoing to enforce any of this. So by setting up this agency in the \nFederal Reserve, we are giving them independent rulemaking authority, \nappointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate as an operation, \nand then working in consultation with prudential regulators so we don't \nend up with a conflict between the safety and soundness requirements of \nour financial institutions and the consumer protection issues.\n  In the absence of this, what we are confronted with every year is \nhaving to draft legislation to deal with one consumer problem after \nanother, and we all know how long that can take, if it ever gets done \nat all. In the meantime, we see what happens to average citizens who \nhave paid dearly.\n  As to the whole shadow economy, community banks are right to be \nannoyed. Here they are located on one street corner, and they have a \npayday lender on the other corner completely unregulated. Here they are \nas a community bank having to go through a regulatory process to make \nsure things are working right and yet the shadow economy operating \nmaybe 100 yards away and no protections. Under this proposed amendment, \nwe require assessments of community banks to pay for the regulation of \nthe nonbanks. Here they go again. Another cost. Our bill does none of \nthat. The cost of the consumer protection agency comes out of Fed \nmoney; no assessment, no appropriations to support it. This one \nrequires an assessment. Here we are\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\ngoing to adopt an amendment, the Hutchison-Tester amendment, which \nreduces the cost to 98 percent of consumer banks, and the next \namendment adds an assessment onto them. We have to be a little bit \nconsistent about this.\n  So that is what the Shelby amendment does. There is an assessment in \nhis bill on community banks, on the nonbank community. So while \nnonbanks will pay some, the other ones do. We don't do that in our \nbill. I think there are so many assessments out there already. That \nshouldn't be the case. We consolidate so you get clarity, not seven \nagencies telling you what consumer regulation you ought to follow or \nnot. They deserve clarity in thought so there is a consistent line of \nwhat is occurring out there and that consultation and cooperation with \nprudential regulation so we don't have the conflicts.\n  We spent a lot of time going through this. This amendment, the \nprovision of the bill, is one that was worked on, by the way, on a \nbipartisan basis as we were drafting it so we could have this feature \nof the bill.\n  Again, I am willing to listen to ideas on how we can strengthen this \nand make it more clear against some of the accusations that we are \nreaching into Main Street on this legislation. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. We are not reaching into it at all. Obviously, any \nproposal deserves to be looked at again and other ideas that can tweak \nit and make it look better. But the idea that we are going to level \nassessments--the FTC gets damaged, in my view, as it is presently \nwritten. I think people need to read carefully what they are going to \nbe asked to vote on in the Shelby amendment and then walk away from it. \nIt is worse than the status quo in many ways. It takes a huge step \nback. If there is anything we have learned in the last 2 years, it is \nthose small businesses, those people out there who rely on the flow of \ncredit, the access to capital, to see to it there is going to be \nsomeone watching out on a consistent basis to what happens to them, we \nbelieve we have a very strong provision in our legislation.\n  Senator Tester is here to close on the amendment. I apologize for \ndrifting off into this other area. I see my colleague and friend from \nMassachusetts. But I know Senator Tester wishes to be heard on the \nHutchison amendment. So I apologize to my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, the Senator from Montana, I believe, \nis gesturing that the Senator from Massachusetts could have up to 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you to \nmy colleague from Montana. I have enjoyed working with him very much \nover the last couple days and the Senator from Texas as well. I know we \nhave been working very hard on this amendment. I wished to commend the \nSenator who just finished speaking as well--I have privately and \npublicly--for taking this effort and trying to work through it in a \nbipartisan manner because, as I have said many times, this is an issue \nthat affects the American people in very serious ways. I don't want to \nrush in. I want to do it right so we don't have to come back next year \nor next month and try to fix problems we may have inadvertently \ncreated. So I appreciate the Senator from Connecticut allowing me to \ncome and speak to him privately in his office and his staff and work \nthrough this and I am hoping we can continue with that bipartisan \neffort.\n  As a reflection of that, I have signed on to many amendments, some by \nmy Democratic colleagues and some by my Republican colleagues, and I am \nthankful the majority leader has said publicly that we are going to get \na full and fair discourse on these issues. The one I am referring to \ntoday is the Tester-Hutchison amendment, of which I am also a \ncosponsor, amendment No. 3749.\n  For more than 75 years, the presence of FDIC deposit insurance has \nmeant that Americans who deposit savings in insured banks sleep soundly \nat night. That is kind of the basic small community bank. You know when \nyou are giving your money to a bank it is not going to be treated as a \ncasino; it is going to be protected. But as our banking sector has \nconsolidated and large national banks have emerged, our smaller \ncommunity banks have been getting squeezed. These small banks pay \napproximately 30 percent of the total of the FDIC assessments but hold \nonly 20 percent of the Nation's banking assets.\n  I feel it is time for the larger institutions to pay their fair \nshare. This amendment will improve competition in the marketplace and \nhelp small businesses. Everyone knows small businesses across the \ncountry are having a hard time getting loans. Lowering the assessments \non these community banks, I believe and others who are sponsoring this \namendment believe, will help increase loans to small businesses. On a \nrelative basis, our small community banks are far more active in the \nmarket compared to larger banks. As someone who was, in a prior life \nbefore I got here, involved in representing some of those banks, I can \ntell my colleagues they are the ones that are continuing to keep the \neconomic engine going in these small towns.\n  I am pleased the amendment we will vote on today also makes sure the \ninstitutional custodial banks and bankers' banks are protected from \nunfair assessment levels that are not in line with the true role in the \nfinancial system. This matters a great deal to my State of \nMassachusetts--the global hub of institutional asset management--and \nwill allow us to restore fairness to the FDIC assessment system without \nimposing large, unjustified assessment increases on custodial banks.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. Thank you, Madam \nPresident, and the Senators from Montana and Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, first of all, I wish to thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts for his comments. I very much appreciate his \ncosponsorship and support of this amendment. I also wish to thank \nSenator Hutchison for her hard work on this amendment. I very much \nappreciate her ability to get things done in a fair way, and I thank \nher very much for that.\n  Senator Hutchison and I have come to the floor several times to talk \nabout this bipartisan, commonsense amendment to hold banks accountable \nfor their behavior and to preserve the integrity of the FDIC deposit \ninsurance fund. It has been said before that this would direct the FDIC \nto base assessments on assets rather than deposits, forcing big banks \nto pay their fair share into the fund. This amendment will ensure that \nthe community banks that make rural America run will pay only their \nfair share into the fund--no more and no less--fixing the lopsided \nsystem we have now. It would also protect the integrity of the deposit \ninsurance fund, which is critically important, ensuring that it has the \nresources to be self-sufficient and prepared to address any future \ncrises.\n  Let me say, Senator Hutchison and I think this amendment makes a \ngreat deal of common sense, as do the other 13 cosponsors of this \nlegislation. I am pleased we are joined by so many of our colleagues on \nthis important amendment and that it is one of the first amendments up \nfor consideration. It is a question of equity. It is a question of \nmaking sure the FDIC insurance fund is solvent for years and decades to \ncome.\n  I wish to thank all the people who have cosponsored it, and once \nagain let me thank Senator Hutchison as well as the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Senator Dodd, for working with us on this amendment.\n  Madam President, is it appropriate to ask for the yeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  All time is yielded back. Under the previous order, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 3749.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Utah (Mr. Bennett).\n  The result was announced--yeas 98, nays 0, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3299]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 132 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     LeMieux\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Bennett\n     Byrd\n       \n  The amendment (No. 3749) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the consumer \nprotection piece of the financial reform bill we have been debating.\n  Let me start by expressing my appreciation for the good work of \nChairman Dodd and the good work of Ranking Member Shelby and others who \nare making their way through a thoughtful process to try to get an \noverall bill that will work.\n  This piece of the bill, though, in my judgment, needs a tremendous \namount of effort, attention, and work yet. The consumer protection \npiece has generated a lot of debate. We have all asked the question in \nBanking Committee hearings and on the floor: What is the best way to \nprotect consumers? Let me underscore that. This has not been a debate \nabout whether we do or not. No one is talking about ignoring this piece \nof the legislation. No one is advocating that we do nothing on consumer \nprotections. What we are trying to focus on is the best way of doing \nit. We need to keep that perspective in mind as this debate unfolds and \nmotives and words get distorted and stretched.\n  The bill before us establishes a consumer protection regime that is \ngoing to be housed at the Federal Reserve. But let me emphasize, that \ndoes not mean it is under its supervision. It functions like a stand-\nalone agency.\n  This new ``bureau'' will have what I would describe as unprecedented \npowers. It will reach into nearly every area of our economy with power \nover nearly everything. Anything that resembles the term ``financial in \nnature'' will come within the purview of this bureau.\n  I must admit, as this debate was going on, I found it surprising, if \nnot shocking, that folks such as car dealers, accountants, and lawyers \nwere showing up at my office to talk about the impact on them. It is no \nwonder that so many business groups have come out in opposition to this \ncurrent piece of this legislation. I am not talking about banks. I am \ntalking about business groups.\n  The Chamber of Commerce sent a letter outlining concerns on April 28 \non behalf of--and I am using their language--``hundreds of thousands of \nnonfinancial services businesses.'' These hundreds of thousands of \nbusinesses--many of them small businesses--had absolutely nothing to do \nwith the last crisis. Yet with this new bureau, I believe they will be \npunished or, at a minimum, tied up in redtape.\n  There are many pieces of this on which I could spend a lot of time \ntalking on the floor, but what I have tried to do today is to \nencapsulate my thoughts into five areas, five concerns, if you will.\n  The first area is the unlimited rulemaking authority provided for in \nthis legislation. Because the term ``abusive'' was added to the unfair \nand deceptive acts or standards, there is virtually no limit to the \nkinds of rules this new bureau can write.\n  We also know that the term ``abusive'' is entirely subjective. So how \ndo you determine abusive? Will you make each customer take a financial \nliteracy test? Is abusive different for Mike Johanns than it is the \nnext customer? Because ``abusive'' can be defined so differently from \none customer to the next, we can see the unlimited problem that is \ncreated.\n  The second area, no veto power. I consistently said that it is a \nmistake to separate consumer protection from the issues of safety and \nsoundness of the institution. If a proposed rule will have a negative \neffect on the safety and soundness of financial institutions, then we \nneed some kind of checks and balances. Checks and balances are good. In \nthis bill under debate, this new agency only has to list the \nregulator's concerns, not take them into any kind of meaningful \nconsideration.\n  The third area, privacy rights. While there are a lot of privacy \nconcerns here, two major ones come to mind.\n  Let me go to the language of the bill itself. Section 1022 mandates \nthe bureau to:\n\n       . . . gather information . . . regarding the organization, \n     business conduct, markets, and activities of persons \n     operating in consumer financial services markets.\n\n  A person is defined in the bill as an ``individual.'' So do you \nfollow me? What this means is the bureau can look into the business \nconduct of the average person out there.\n  Section 1071 requires any deposit-taking financial institution to \ngeocode customer addresses and maintain records of deposits for at \nleast 3 years.\n  As Jim Harper from the Cato Institute described it:\n\n       Think of the government having its own Google map of where \n     you and your neighbors do your banking.\n\n  Is that what Americans want out of this bill?\n  The fourth item is the preemption standard. The current bill really \nchanges current Federal law under the guise of giving States more power \nover their consumer protection laws. This worries me. This will wreak \nhavoc for financial companies operating in more than one State. What we \nwould be saying is they will have to comply with a patchwork of 51 \nState laws, and State AGs will have the power to enforce State and \nFederal laws against national banks. If this were the way since the \nbeginning of time, one might say: Well, they have adapted to it. But to \nput them in this kind of regimen is literally to say to them: You are \ngoing to have to chew up mountains of capital to try to comply with all \nthese various rules and regulations and laws of the various States.\n  The fifth item I wanted to mention is the expansive reach. This bill \nincludes what I regard as an overly broad definition of ``consumer \nfinancial product or service'' and ``service provider.'' Specifically, \nsection 1027 will subject numerous merchants to the regulation of this \nnew bureau just because the business provides the ability to their \ncustomers to repay in four installments.\n  Imagine that you order a camcorder for the holidays off a home \nshopping network. This company provides you with the flexibility of \nmaking four installment payments. This new company could be swept under \nthis new bureau. How long do you think companies will continue to \nprovide that kind of flexible option to consumers if they are going to \nbe buried in regulation? That is why the dentists, the lawyers, the \nadvertising agencies, the accountants, and even florists are concerned \nwith this bill and are showing up in our offices saying: What are you \ndoing? I don't know about anyone else, but I can make the case without \nany hesitation that my local florist doesn't come to mind when I think \nabout the players who brought our economy to the edge.\n  In response to this expansive and unfettered bureau, I am proud to \nannounce my support for an alternative. This alternative, led by \nSenator Shelby, is well thought out, is a reasonable approach and I \nbelieve a compromise to a very difficult issue in this legislation. It \nwould establish a consumer protection division within the FDIC, which I \nbelieve is a natural fit since this agency is already tasked with \nprotecting consumer deposit accounts. This new division would have \nauthority to make rules relative to consumer protection. All rules, \nregulations, and\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\norders would receive the approval of the board of the FDIC--an \nimportant check and balance. This is a very important distinction in \nterms of what we are debating today. Board approval will ensure that \nactions taken by the division appropriately consider safety and \nsoundness of the financial institution, while ensuring that consumer \nsafeguards are in place. While it allows primary supervision and \nenforcement to exist with the existing regulators, it does not bring in \nnonbank mortgage originators for supervision.\n  I will end on a final thought. Many have claimed that these mortgage \ninsurers acted unfairly and that they preyed upon unsophisticated \nborrowers during the last crisis. This ensures the mortgage broker \noperating out of his garage or whatever is going to be regulated.\n  Finally, this new agency will be able to go after the bad actors, and \nthat is what we should be doing. Anyone who shows a pattern of material \nviolations will be brought under this new FDIC division.\n  Let me wrap up where I began. I applaud all my colleagues who have \nspent so much time and energy focusing on the consumer piece of this \nregulatory reform. Chairman Dodd led us through hearing after hearing \ntrying to figure out the best way to protect consumers. Senator Shelby, \nour ranking member, worked on those issues in concert. We can get this \nright, but in my judgment, where we are today, the proposed legislation \non the floor does not get it right. Let's focus on getting it right, \ngetting the bad actors.\n  I believe the approach that is being championed by Ranking Member \nShelby is a reasoned one that elevates consumer protection while \nkeeping safety and soundness as a paramount consideration. I ask my \ncolleagues to support the alternative.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, first of all, if I may, let me acknowledge \nthe contribution of the Presiding Officer, my colleague from New York. \nEveryone brings value to this Chamber from time to time based on what \nthey have done in their earlier lives. I thank her immensely for \nbringing her background and experience to this critical debate we are \nhaving. She spent a lot of years working in this area of the law, knows \nit well, and I have come to appreciate her counsel and advice and \nthoughts on all of this, and I want to acknowledge that, if I may.\n  Madam President, as I said at the outset, there are four major pieces \nof this bill of ours, and I will add a fifth, obviously, dealing with \nthe derivative section that was worked on by the Presiding Officer as a \nmember of the Agriculture Committee, Blanche Lincoln being the chairman \nof the Agriculture Committee. Title VII of this bill deals with that \nsection. The Banking Committee side deals with the four other major \nparts of this bill, and they are, No. 1, end too big to fail; No. 2, \nset up an early warning system--and I am being simplistic in describing \nthese--deal with the derivatives and the so-called exotic instruments; \nand have a strong consumer protection feature to this bill. Those are \nthe four points.\n  We have resolved, I believe to virtually all of our satisfaction, the \ntoo-big-to-fail argument. We did that yesterday. And again, I thank my \ncolleagues, particularly Senator Shelby and others, for helping us work \nthrough that to come to a conclusion that ends the debate as to whether \nthe bill before us ends too big to fail. I think that in itself would \nbe justification for supporting the legislation--knowing that if we \nadopt this legislation, as I am hopeful we will, and Lord forbid we are \nconfronted with another major economic crisis, we will not be faced \nwith the choices we were in the fall of 2008 where the American \ntaxpayer wrote out a check for $700 billion to bail out major financial \ninstitutions that were on the verge of collapse. We were told that if \nthey did so, the financial system of our country, and possibly \nglobally, would melt down, to use their words. What we wanted to avoid \nwas ever being put in that position again, where you had the implicit \nguarantee that the Federal Government would write that kind of check. \nWe have done that now in this bill, so let's check that box. Too big to \nfail is over with, and this bill takes care of that. We need to pass \nthe bill, and we need the President to sign it so that it becomes law. \nBut as of right now, we are far closer to resolving that issue than \never before.\n\n  The derivative section of the bill and so forth--I know people are \nworking on this and working with Senator Lincoln and others on that \nsection of the bill. I respect immensely their efforts to make sure we \ncan arrive at a compromise. We think we have good provisions in the \nbill, but I think all of us recognize other ideas and thoughts are \nalways welcome. So that is being worked on.\n  The sort of radar, the look-ahead approach to our legislation, I \ndon't think there is any debate about, so that box has sort of been \nchecked. Maybe someone has some amendments on what they would like to \ndo to strengthen it but not the idea that we have an early warning \nsystem so that we pick up these problems far earlier than we did or \nwere willing to acknowledge as they were developing within the \nresidential mortgage market as early as 2005 and 2006, beginning to \nexplode in 2007, and then, of course, watching the events of 2008, \nculminating in the fall with the decisions we had to make in order to \nstabilize the financial system in our country. Had we had that early \nwarning system--more than just one set of eyes at the Federal Reserve, \nwhich did, to put it mildly, a very inadequate job of picking up what \nwas occurring in the real estate bubble--we would never have found \nourselves in the situation we did in our country in the fall of 2008.\n  We believe the early warning system will be a major step in limiting \nthe kinds of problems we have seen in the last couple of years. It does \nnot stop the next economic problem. There will be another economic \ncrisis. Future generations will deal with that. There is nothing in \nthis bill that prohibits us or guarantees us that we have once and for \nall avoided economic crises. First of all, we are no longer in total \ncontrol of that within our own country. How many more headlines do we \nhave to read about Greece and what is occurring there--the riots in the \nstreets today because of the economic decisions they are making to \nstabilize their country. These are already having an effect globally. \nSo while we can do a lot to minimize what happens here, we recognize \ntoday that we live in a far more interconnected world that poses its \nown set of risks.\n  Nonetheless, I think the fact that we have established, on a \nbipartisan basis--and again, our colleagues Mark Warner and Bob Corker, \nalong with other Members, did a great job, in my view, in crafting that \npart of our bill. So I think we have done a good job there, and I see \nvery little dissent about it.\n  The fourth piece, the consumer protection, is the one in which we are \nnow engaged. This is a debate that I believe is worth having over the \nnext hour or two and then vote. Let me say to my friend from Alabama, \nthe author of the amendment, and his cosponsors that we have to come \nand debate this stuff. I am here and will be glad to engage in the \ndebate, but I have one other colleague here right now involved in this \nquestion. This is a major part of the bill.\n  People have told me over and over again that this is a big issue for \nthem. I am willing to accept their determination. I think it is a big \nissue too. But we have about 100 amendments people want to offer, and \nwe have about 39 legislative days between now and the end of this \nCongress, with an awful lot to do.\n  Now, I can't get there for you. I can't get your amendments up if \nothers insist upon elongated times on the consideration of their \namendments. We have all been debating consumer protection for years \nnow, particularly over the last 18 months. There is no reason to have a \nprotracted debate on this question. My Republican friends have offered \na substitute to my bill on this issue, and I welcome that substitute. \nWe need to now debate it and then vote on it and move on to the next \nissue.\n  Madam President, I am delighted to see my good friend, who just \narrived to engage in this discussion. So let me address this issue of \nconsumer protections in terms of both what we have in the bill, reading \nthe language of it, and what the alternative would do.\n  Let me first of all say that I listened to my friend from Nebraska, \nSenator\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\nJohanns, a wonderful member of our committee and a person I have come \nto respect very much. He has been very productive and very helpful in \nthe Banking Committee.\n  But the idea, to use his language, that we are covering florists and \naccountants and lawyers and dentists--nothing could be further from the \ntruth. I guess the old adage is, if you say something often enough and \nrepeat it often enough and if it goes unchallenged, it becomes a fact. \nIt is not a fact. In fact, it is anything but a fact. I know they wish \nto use that argument to try to pass their amendment or to defeat the \nsections of the bill I have included, but I cannot say it any more \nclearly to my colleagues. I believe it is section 1027 of the bill. You \nhave all got copies of the bill on your desk. Read section 1027 when \nyou come to the floor. It is not complicated legislative language. It \nsays specifically the only reason you would be covered by the consumer \nprotection language in this bill is if you are significantly involved \nin financial services or financial products.\n  I realize the word ``significantly'' is what people want to work on, \nand I am willing to listen to some ideas as to how we can define that \nword ``significantly.'' That is not a bad point. I understand that. But \ndon't tell me it covers a florist under any definition of the words \n``significantly involved in financial services and products.'' It \nexcludes retailers and merchants across the country. Again, I am \nwilling to debate all sorts of language here but don't make me debate \ncompletely false allegations about what is in the bill.\n  At any rate, we have been working on our bill for a long time. My \ncompliments and thanks to my colleague from Alabama for the efforts \nyesterday and so forth. But this is a very important part of the bill. \nWe have worked to create an early warning system, as I mentioned, and \nof course too big to fail, but consumer protection is critical because \nit goes to the very heart of what we are trying to do. In fact, it was \nconsumers, small businesses, families, individuals, farms that were \nadversely affected. Wall Street did fine, as we have seen. Some people \nlost some jobs along the way. A couple of these large institutions did \ncollapse. But we have heard about the bonuses that went to top \nexecutives. The buildings are still there. They have been making record \nprofits over the last couple of years. But what happened to those \nmillions of people who had a home that now is gone? What happened to \nthose 8.5 million jobs? Gone. What happened to those retirees in our \ncountry who watched 20 percent of their retirement evaporate? What \nhappened to those people who still have a house but the value of that \nhome has declined by 30 percent in the last year and a half? I don't \nknow what you call them; I call them consumers, the average person in \nour country who did not do anything except try to hold body and soul \ntogether, got lured into a bad deal by people who were unregulated and \nwere willing to convince them they could buy a home they never could \nafford, knowing that the fully indexed adjustable rate mortgage was \ngoing to wipe them out.\n  I talked about Dolores King, who was the first witness I brought to \nour committee 3 years ago, in January or February of 2007. She was a \nretiree in Chicago who worked as a librarian for 30 or 40 years. Her \nhusband had died. She had about a $30,000 or $40,000 credit card debt \nand some unscrupulous broker came in and convinced her she needed to \nrewrite her mortgage and an adjustable rate mortgage would work for \nher. She lost everything. She lost her home--70 percent of her fixed \nretirement income went to pay that mortgage.\n  So when people tell me you cannot get consumer protection, when that \nautomobile company a few weeks ago had to recall its cars because the \naccelerator got stuck, they got recalled. Did Dolores King get her \nmortgage recalled because it was faulty, when she lost her home? That \nis what consumer protection does. If you are in the business of \nfinancial services and products, having someone watch out for the \naverage citizen ought not be such a radical idea when we talk about \nfinancial reform.\n  We have this in a way, on a bipartisan basis, I might add, that sets \nup an independent consumer protection agency housed at the Federal \nReserve. Its director is appointed by the President and confirmed by \nthe Senate. It has the authority to write rules on consumer protection \nin the financial services area where financial products are involved.\n  Then of course it has examination and enforcement authority--only for \nthose institutions that have assets more than $10 billion--for \nenforcement; otherwise, it is done at the local level. The rules are \nthe same. We don't write any more rules. The rules are there. They have \nbeen around in some cases for 50 years--truth in lending, fair credit, \nRESPA--all of these laws in place. All we are saying, can someone \nenforce them and examine institutions and determine whether they are \nliving up to them?\n  Right now there are seven agencies that have a consumer protection \ndivision. For a huge part of our economy, no one is watching them. One \nof the very legitimate complaints our community banks make: We get \nregulated but that guy down the street, that payday lender, no one is \nwatching out what he is doing every day, and we are disadvantaged. Our \nbill stops that. If you are a payday lender, you are under the same \nrules that banks would be under--at least have someone watching out \nthere. That is a major step forward. We recognize a major part of our \neconomy's collapse or near collapse was in the shadow area of our \neconomy. Our legislation fills those gaps.\n  We understand, or should understand, how important having an \nindependent agency with rulemaking authority is. Again, the issue is--\nwait a minute, you have to be careful, Senator, because you have safety \nand soundness and the prudential regulators have to be considered in \nall this. That is a legitimate point. I don't disagree with that, \nalthough I think sometimes the accusation that there is this great \nconflict is exaggerated. Our bill says the prudential regulators have \nto examine and look at the rules coming out. If they vote, two-thirds \nof them, and say that rule creates a conflict or some problem, it does \nnot go into effect. There is not another agency in government that can \nhave its own regulations or rules vetoed by another group of \nregulators. That was a suggestion, again, by Republican colleagues to \ninclude in our bill, to provide the kind of safeguards against \npotential conflicts of interest between safety and soundness and \nconsumer protection.\n  Again, that today with seven agencies tasked with consumer \nprotection, not one of which did the job to anyone's satisfaction in \nthe lead-up to this crisis, ought to be justification alone for what we \nare trying to do. Our legislation will have an independent director \nappointed by the President and confirmed by this body, as I said. They \nwill have a dedicated independent budget paid for by the Federal \nReserve Board.\n  The proposal we are being asked to vote on adds additional \nassessments to banks and to nonbanks. We just got through adopting the \nTester-Hutchison amendment regarding assessments, to reduce the \nassessments on community banks. If you adopt the Shelby amendment, you \nare going to add assessments on again. Here we vote on one hand to take \nthem away, and now with an amendment--this asks to put them back on and \nis asking our community banks for additional assessments to cover the \nactivities of nonbanks. I thought I heard my colleagues say around here \nwe ought to be more sensitive to what is happening at the community \nbank level. Yet this amendment my colleagues are going to be asked to \nvote for does the opposite. So be very careful when you get up and vote \nfor this amendment to explain why, later, if in fact it gets adopted, \nthis bill does, why we are adding assessments to those banks.\n  Our bill will have an office of financial literacy to ensure \nconsumers are able to understand the products and services being \noffered, which was a major problem in the last crisis, and a national \ntoll-free consumer complaint hotline so Americans have somewhere to go \nwhen they need to report a problem.\n  Our bill will make us empowered to write consumer protection rules \ngoverning any institution, bank, or payday lender that offers consumer \nfinancial services or products, and only those businesses that do that. \nIn short, we are ending the alphabet soup of distracted and ineffective \nregulators and\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\nreplacing it with one single, empowered, focused cop on the consumer \nprotection beat.\n  Again, a complaint, I think legitimately, is when you have seven \nagencies with consumer protection jurisdiction--I think the lack of \nclarity is important. My colleagues should understand that. My \ncolleague from Alabama has come out with a Republican substitute for \nthe consumer protection bureau. I am surprised. I know my friends were \nnot going to agree with the consumer protection provisions as strongly \nas some of the ones in my bill, and in some of my more pessimistic \nmoments I thought they might want to maintain the status quo, but this \nis worse than the status quo. This is a major step back. This \nsubstitute actually goes backward, making it easier for unscrupulous \nlenders to rip off the American public, businesses, and families. It is \na stimulus package for scam artists, that is what it is, this \namendment; nothing short of that. For the life of me, I cannot \nunderstand, after months of hearings, months of analysis, months of \ndiscussion regarding the fact this financial crisis started with a \nfailure of consumer protection, anyone would think that the right \nsolution is less consumer protection. Yet that is exactly what this \namendment does.\n  It is as though we are in a deep hole and we spent a full year \ndebating how to get out and our Republican friends' solution is: Keep \ndigging.\n  I am going to walk through the provisions of their substitute but, in \nshort, here is why it is simply unacceptable.\n  First, when it comes to writing new consumer protection rules, the \nWall Street substitute--and that is what it is--relies on the same \nregulators who screwed up the country in the first place. Why would you \nask them to do it again?\n  Second, when it comes to enforcing rules, their plan actually makes \nthings worse, reducing regulators' ability to stop rip-offs and leaving \nAmerican families even more vulnerable.\n  Third, the Republicans' substitute wants to raise taxes on community \nbanks and credit unions to pay for the regulation that will not even \nhappen.\n  Fourth, they want to make it easier to sell Americans mortgages they \ncannot afford which, if you have been paying any attention at all to \nwhat has been going on in the last 18 months, is the very reason we got \ninto this mess in the first place, making it easier to sell Americans \nmortgages they cannot afford.\n  Fifth, to top it all off, this substitute eliminates the provision of \nany consumer protection proposal that targets discrimination in \nlending. How on Earth could anyone be against ending discrimination in \nlending? Yet that is also a part of this substitute.\n  If you look at how we got into the crisis and you conclude that the \nanswer is to weaken consumer protection, you are doing it all wrong. \nLet me go into a bit more detail, and then I see my colleagues want to \nbe heard as well.\n  The first important change in the Republican substitute is, instead \nof having an independent agency write consumer protection rules, it \nputs the task in the hands of the same distracted and ineffective \nregulators who failed so badly in the first place.\n  What would that mean for the consumers? Here is a preview. One of \nthose regulators has already demonstrated itself to be anticonsumer, \nopposing proposed rules to keep credit card companies from \nretroactively raising interest rates on outstanding balances.\n  I can speak firsthand. I am the guy who wrote the credit card bill. \nThe agency that fought me on it now is going to be tasked with the job \nof protecting people from it. For the life of me, of all the agencies \nyou could have picked to run this in your bill, you picked the one \nagency that has fought us on credit card reform. It is stunning to me \nthat someone would actually write a substitute tasking this agency, \nknowing this was the agency that did so much damage, was opposed to the \nidea that we put limits on interest rates to be charged on outstanding \nbalances. That is not putting consumer protection at the heart of our \nfinancial system, that is putting consumer protection in the backseat, \nwhere it has been for far too long.\n  That is not the worst of it. The Republican substitute limits \nenforcement powers to ``large nonbank mortgage originators.'' Large \nnonbank mortgage originators--other finance companies will avoid \nenforcement unless they demonstrate a ``pattern or practice'' of \nconsumer abuses. In other words, their version of the consumer \nprotection agency will not be allowed to prevent abuses committed by \ncommercial--or banks, or payday lenders, check cashers, credit card \ncompanies, debt collectors, car dealers who are involved in the finance \nbusiness, and a wide range of the worst actors in the subprime mortgage \nindustry, until it is already too late for potentially thousands of \nconsumers to be protected. It is as though they want to create a police \ndepartment that is allowed to enforce laws against littering. Maybe \nthey will cut down on littering, but to leave the same regulators to \ndeal with the rest of the financial sector, they are essentially \nturning a blind eye to every other kind of crime out there. In fact, it \nis like legalizing those crimes by eliminating the Federal Trade \nCommission authority to police unfair and deceptive financial practices \nin these other sectors. The substitute is worse than the status quo, \nand the status quo is very bad indeed.\n  Meanwhile, the substitute raises taxes on potentially any nonbank \nfinancial services company. It allows the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation to raise assessments on banks, including community banks \nand credit unions. In fact, their plan would ask credit unions to pay \nfor the regulation of their nonbank competitors--the same competitors \nwho will be getting a free ride, exempted from any Federal oversight \nwhatsoever.\n  Our plan is to have the Federal Reserve pay for enforcement. Their \nplan is to have community banks pay for enforcement, and then do not \nhave the enforcement, of course. That is a tax increase they don't need \nand one that our depository institutions, so critical to rebuilding our \neconomy, cannot afford.\n  The amendment also prohibits the establishment of strong mortgage \nunderwriting standards. We all know how important it is to establish \nbetter underwriting standards. If we had rules in place 2 years ago \nthat required banks and mortgage lenders to make loans only to people \nwho could show that they have the ability to repay them, we would not \nbe in this mess--if that had been the case.\n  The amendment before us would prohibit the new division we have \nproposed to create from issuing commonsense rules like these. If you \nhad to pick one thing in this bill to undermine and ensure that we have \nanother financial crisis, in my view, this would be it.\n  The substitute also eliminates as an objective of the new consumer \ndivision the goal of eliminating discrimination. I believe this goal is \nessential to restoring America's faith in our markets.\n  In short, I find it impossible to work with this proposal. There are \nideas I am willing to listen to, that we might define ``significantly'' \nand things like that. That is fine. I understand that. But this \napproach does more damage than you can imagine.\n  Again, to go back to what I said at the outset, we have spent a lot \nof time talking about what happened to the big firms on Wall Street and \nwhat happened to large institutions and large manufacturers. The root \ncause of the problem we are in began because there was a total \ndisregard for small businesses and families and individuals out there; \nthat they could take advantage of them, as they did, because they could \nsell off--they could get paid immediately, they securitized these \ncrummy mortgages out there, leaving that home owner in a situation they \ncould never afford to sustain, and the house of cards came tumbling \ndown. And it all began--it all began--with that problem.\n  I say, respectfully, this proposal goes right at the heart of the \nvery issue we must address in this bill, in addition to all of the \nother aspects we are talking about. There is no more very important \nvote we will cast, in my view, in this debate than this one. If we walk \naway from providing the safeguards for the average American--I do not \ncare what their politics are, what their ideology is, anything else, \nthey deserve to know in this debate, at long last, they are being \nconsidered, that watching out for them is part of this.\n\n[[Page S3303]]\n\n  The outrageous case that this somehow reaches into retailers and \nmerchants is highly offensive to me. It is the last thing I would ever \nsuggest to my colleagues, that we somehow get into the business as \nFederal regulators of poring over florists and dentists and butchers \nand accountants and lawyers. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  This goes after those businesses involved in financial services and \nproducts. It does so in a way that provides clarity, provides an \nopportunity for those institutions to be regulated, to know what rules \nthey have to follow, and who is in charge of insisting that they meet \nthose obligations.\n  So with that, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. My \nhope is we will vote fairly soon. Again, we have hundreds of amendments \nthat people want to be heard on, and we do not have all of the time in \nthe world to deal with it. So we have to move on on these issues.\n  I think people understand the debate. They can read the amendment. I \nurge you to read 1027 in our bill, the section dealing with consumer \nprotection, dealing with who is covered. Then we will have a vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/06/senate-section/article/S3303-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DODD.

The Senator form North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I will join my colleague from \nConnecticut in opposing the amendment on the floor if it weakens the \nunderlying bill, but I do not come to speak about that proposal at the \nmoment. I wanted to speak about an amendment I have discussed \npreviously on the issue of too big to fail.\n  There is much yet to do on this subject of too big to fail. I recall, \nin a room just steps from here, on a Friday, I believe it was, the \nTreasury Secretary leaning over the lectern in a very stern way saying \nto the caucus that I was involved in, if within 3 days a three-page \nbill granting $700 billion to the Secretary of the Treasury, with which \nto provide funds to stabilize some of the biggest financial \ninstitutions in the country, if that did not come about, our economy \ncould very well collapse completely.\n  I remember that moment and remember thinking that it was pretty \nbizarre that our country got to that point: that all of a sudden 1 day, \nafter being told month after month that the economy was strong, the \neconomy was in good shape, that there were some ripples and hiccups \nhere and there, but things were on course and we had confidence in the \nstrength of the economy, that we were now being told the economy may \nwell collapse in days unless the Congress comes up with $700 billion.\n  Why was that the case? Because institutions that were so large in \nthis country, at the top of the financial industry, were so important \nto the economy that their failure could very well result in failure of \nthe entire American economy. That is what is called too big to fail.\n  Let me show a chart that shows the six largest financial institutions \nin the country and what has happened to them since 1995. This is their \ngrowth as a percentage of GDP. It shows that they are getting larger \nand larger and larger and much larger. Even during this period of near \ncollapse, the same institutions that were judged too large to fail and \njudged to represent a grave risk to the entire economy have gotten \nlarger than just too big to fail.\n  We had a vote yesterday, but that cannot be the end of this \ndiscussion about how to address too big to fail. The vote yesterday was \nrather Byzantine, as far as I was concerned. I was not someone who was \na big fan of the $50 billion to be pre-funded for resolution of too-\nbig-to-fail companies. But having said that, to decide that the $50 \nbillion, which would come from the very institutions that are too big \nto fail, should be abolished, and that the funds instead would come \nfrom the FDIC, which are initially funds from the American taxpayer, \nmade no sense to me. Then suggesting that it will be all right because \nthe FDIC will be repaid with the sale of assets--oh, really? Well, \nfirms that are too big to fail that are going to get in trouble in the \nfuture are not going to have very many assets. They are going to be in \ntrouble because of dramatic amounts of overleverage, leverage that goes \nfar beyond their ability to continue to do business. And when the firm \ncomes tumbling down, I fail to see where assets are going to exist in \nsubstantial quantity to repay the taxpayer.\n  But that was yesterday. I did not support that. That was yesterday. \nThis issue of creating a circumstance of early warning on too-big-to-\nfail firms is not satisfactory to me. The only way to resolve too big \nto fail is to abolish too big to fail. I mean abolish too big to fail. \nThat means having firms that are not too big to fail, that will not \ncause a moral hazard or a grave risk to the entire economy should they \nfail.\n  Do you believe that is the case with this graph? Is there anything \nhere that--as this graph shows, we have firms that are too big, far too \nbig to fail. Is there anything here that is going to solve that in this \nbill? The answer is no. The only direct and effective way to address \nthis is to decide, if you are, in fact, too big to fail, then there has \nto be some sort of divestiture or dissolution to bring that firm back \ndown to a point where in size and scope such firm is not too big to \nfail and is not causing the kind of dramatic special risk to the \ncountry's economy that it would bring the economy down with it.\n  That is the only direct and effective solution. Is that radical? \nWell, I have an amendment that requires that if you are determined to \nbe too big to fail, then we begin a process, over 2 years, of breaking \naway those parts that make you too big to fail. Is it a radical idea? I \ndo not think so.\n  One-fourth of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board \nsays we ought to do that. Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed: \nToo big to fail is not a policy, it is a problem. Too big to fail means \ntoo big period. We ought to break them up.\n  Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, James Bullard, president and chief \nexecutive officer: I do kind of agree that too big to fail is too big \nto exist.\n  The economist, Joe Stiglitz, Nobel Prize winner: Too-big-to-fail \nbanks have perverse incentives. If they gamble and win, they walk off \nwith the proceeds. If they fail, taxpayers, pick up the tab.\n  Alan Greenspan--I seldom, if ever, agree with Alan Greenspan, but I \nhave used a quote of his to describe where we are now. He was around \nsitting on his hands for a good many years while these problems \ndeveloped, despite the fact that he had the authority to have avoided \nthem. Then he has written a book acting as if he was exploring the \nsurface of Mars while all of this went on.\n  But now he says: The notion that risks can be identified in a \nsufficiently timely manner to enable the liquidation of a large failing \nbank with minimum loss has proved untenable during this crisis, and I \nsuspect in the future crises as well.\n  Simon Johnson, professor of entrepreneurship, the Sloan School: There \nis simply no evidence, and I mean no evidence, that society gains from \nbanks\n\n[[Page S3304]]\n\nhaving a balance sheet larger than $100 billion.\n  I do not know whether I agree or disagree with that. But his point is \nthat too big to fail means too big.\n  Arnold King, Cato--I seldom quote Cato on the floor of the Senate. \nBut, you know, strange bed fellows: Big banks are bad for free markets. \nThere is a free market case for breaking up large financial \ninstitutions--that our big banks are a product not of economics but of \npolitics.\n  The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, this is the \nthird Fed president: I think they should be broken up. And in doing so, \nI think you will make the financial system itself more stable, more \ncompetitive, and I think you will have long-run benefits over our \ncurrent system.\n  We broke up Standard Oil in this country into 23 different pieces. It \nturned out the 23 pieces were more valuable than Standard Oil was. I am \nnot saying just go in and break up things just for the purpose of \nbreaking up. I am saying this: If there is a standard by which we judge \nthat an institution is too big to fail and causes a dramatic risk to \nthe economy as a whole should it fail, a moral hazard, unacceptable \nrisk to the entire economy, then it seems to me like this issue of \ncreating early warnings and stop signs and sirens and so on is largely \nirrelevant.\n  What we need to do is do something direct and effective and something \nwe all knew we should do; that is to say, if you are too big to fail, \nand judged to be so, and judged to pose those kinds of risks to our \neconomy, then you must break off pieces. We would, over a 2-year \nperiod, require that to happen until you are not too big to fail.\n  Let me show a couple of quick charts. This one shows the top \nfinancial institutions: The Big Get Bigger. This chart shows the same \nthing, measuring assets and liabilities: The Big Get Bigger. Much, much \nbigger. The first chart I showed today demonstrates why, if we do not \npass the amendment I suggest, we can thumb our suspenders and crow all \nwe want in every hallway in this Capitol Building, but we will have not \ndone what was necessary to be done to address too big to fail. We just \nwill not do it.\n  So I have an amendment. I am here because I am pestering those who \nare lining up amendments to make certain I have a chance to debate and \nvote on that amendment, and that will be the test of whether this \nCongress has learned a lesson; whether, when someday a Treasury \nSecretary leans over a lectern and says: If I do not get $700 billion \nto bail out the big interests that ran this country into the ditch, our \nwhole economy is going into the ditch.\n  So I hope very much that we will have the opportunity to both simply \nand effectively do what is necessary to finally and thoughtfully \naddress this issue of too big to fail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I see our chairman and the ranking member over here from the Banking \nCommittee on which I serve, and I want to congratulate them for their \nhard work in getting this legislation to the floor. We are finally \ndoing some work around here, and we are doing it in a bipartisan way.\n  I think this bill is going to improve over the course of this debate. \nIt is an enormously important opportunity to safeguard our economy from \nthe reckless danger that got us into this financial mess. I am hopeful \nwe can wade through all this Washington wrangling and get something \ndone to protect America's financial future.\n  There is a shared understanding of what got us here, and that is the \ngood news. Some on Wall Street took all the risk. Yet it is the \nAmerican people who paid the price. Small businesses, homeowners, and \nworking families were forced to come in and clean up this mess.\n  It is our responsibility to learn the lessons from the last collapse \nto help this economy recover and to head off the kinds of problems that \ncould lead to another financial crisis. In short, we have to fix this \neconomy, ensuring there will never have to be another taxpayer-\nsponsored bailout.\n  As someone who sits on both the Agriculture and Banking Committees \nwhich share jurisdiction over this bill, I can assure you that this \npackage reflects months of hard work and incorporates ideas and \nconcepts from both political parties. We have examined the problems \nthat brought us to the financial brink nearly 2 years ago, and together \nthese two committee bills created a thoughtful and comprehensive plan \nto increase transparency, reduce systemic risk, and strengthen our \ncommitment to protecting consumers.\n  In reviewing the merits of the bill, I think it is important to \nanalyze how it would have addressed so many of the problems that led to \nthe financial collapse in 2008. Too often, we do not ask the question, \nWhat problem is it we are trying to solve, and then we get busy either \nsolving problems that did not exist or creating unintended consequences \nfrom our work. I think we have worked hard on this legislation for this \nnot to be so.\n  Had this legislation been the law of the land, we would not be \ntalking about that $700 billion taxpayer-funded rescue of our Nation's \nlargest bank holding companies. We would have been able to see many of \nthe dangerous trends develop earlier, and we would have required these \nsystemically risky companies to have more capital and less debt. Had \nany of these companies failed, we would have resolved them without \ntransforming them into wards of the state, like AIG.\n  Second, had a strong consumer protection infrastructure existed, we \ncould have stopped the subprime mess before it spiraled out of control. \nFor example, subprime giant Ameriquest would have been subject to \nmeaningful rulemaking and enforcement authority. And while I prefer a \nwholly independent agency, this bill represents substantial and \nmeaningful progress on a consumer protection front.\n  Third, had the bill's derivatives reforms been in place, it is much \nless likely--much less likely--that the Federal Government would have \nbeen forced to spend tens of billions of taxpayer dollars to rescue AIG \nfrom its own sloppiness and greed.\n  In total, the plan before us represents a strong and thoughtful \nmeasure that rewrites the rules of the road for Wall Street. And \nthrough the amendment process, we can make it even better.\n  For example, I think we need to ensure that certain State-chartered \ncommunity banks that did little to contribute to the current crisis do \nnot have to change their prudential regulator. In so many of our towns, \ncommunity banks play an important role in providing credit to our local \neconomies. Many of these small institutions are struggling due to this \ndifficult economy, which means less available credit for families and \nsmall businesses. I have concerns that a change in prudential \nregulation may exert further pressure on these small banks which \ncontinue to serve their local communities. It is my hope we can balance \nthe need to reduce regulatory arbitrage while preserving the existing \nprudential supervisory structure for some of these State-chartered \nbanks.\n  I also believe it is time for us to take advantage of this \nopportunity to begin to move away from the last bank bailout, the TARP. \nWhile there are 100 opinions in this Chamber about how effective TARP \nwas, there really is a broad consensus here and in the country that it \nis time to wind down TARP, recapture what we can for taxpayers, and \nprevent banks from tapping into the Treasury going forward. That is why \nin the coming days I will be pushing bipartisan legislation that will \ndo exactly that. It would use recaptured TARP funds, borrowed from our \nchildren--$180 billion so far and counting--for deficit reduction, and \nit would take important steps to end the TARP.\n  More broadly, I also think we need to be aggressive about \nstrengthening this bill to further protect consumers. I will be \nsupporting amendments which do exactly that.\n  When it comes to Wall Street reform, we simply cannot afford to delay \nany longer. Recently, the TARP inspector general underscored this point \nbetter than I could. He stated:\n\n       [E]ven if TARP saved our financial system from driving off \n     a cliff back in 2008, absent meaningful reform, we are still \n     driving on the same winding mountain road, but this time in a \n     faster car.\n\n  In short, bailing out companies has made the future risk to our \nfinancial system even worse, by creating the\n\n[[Page S3305]]\n\nmoral hazard that a financial firm that participates in risky behavior \nis going to somehow be bailed out by the government, by the taxpayer. \nThis Wall Street reform package takes a strong step toward restoring \nsome degree of sanity in our financial system and making that moral \nhazard a thing of the past.\n  Finally, Coloradans and the American people are expecting us to act. \nI am confident we are going to succeed. Lobbyists may have been able to \nslow down Wall Street reform temporarily, but the American people want \nit, as well they should. We are getting closer and closer every day to \nsustaining a workable bill that can pass this Chamber and that we can \neventually send to the President for his signature. We cannot allow the \nstatus quo to maintain its grip on our financial system. We have to \nwork together and pass this groundbreaking reform package.\n  I want to close, again, by thanking the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, who is here in the Chamber, for his leadership throughout \nthe months, not just on this issue but on health care as well but \nparticularly for sticking with this issue. I do not think we would be \nhaving this debate right now were it not for the work the chairman did. \nAs a member of the Banking Committee, I appreciate it very much.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before turning to my colleague from New \nYork, let me say how fortunate I have been as chairman of the committee \nto have Senator Bennet as a member of our committee. I want to thank \nhim immensely. He is a new member of the committee, but, again--like \nthe Presiding Officer, like my other colleague from New York--I cannot \ntell you how valuable it has been having people who understand this \nissue and who bring to this Chamber a previous life rich with the \nexperience of understanding these issues. So let me thank the people of \nColorado for having the Senator here. What a difference the Senator has \nmade in the consideration of this legislation.\n  Some of the newest members of the committee--and I think my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from New York, would acknowledge this--\nsome of the newest members of our committee made some of the most \nvaluable contributions to this product, which is further evidence that \nyou do not have to be here that long. In fact, sometimes maybe the \nshorter time you are here, you bring that kind of fresh experience from \nour States and across the country.\n  So I did not want the moment to pass without expressing to Michael \nBennet of Colorado my deep, deep appreciation. I say to the Senator, I \nthank you for your leadership, your thoughtfulness, and the \ncontributions you have made not only to this product but to others \nduring your tenure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, Madam President, I wish to join my friend from \nConnecticut in praising Senator Bennet, who has had an amazing effect \nand a steady hand in bringing this bill to the floor. I also thank my \ncolleague from Virginia, Senator Warner. The new Members have had a \ntremendous effect on this bill. This reflects the way the Senate works \nthese days, and I think it is all for the better. Having their input \nand experience has been vital.\n  But, Mr. Chairman, I would also say that you are full of fresh ideas \nand vim and vigor. Just because you have been around here a long time \ndoes not mean that----\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In fact, you have had the wisdom to encourage some of \nour new Members to actively participate, and confidence to do that as \nwell.\n  I also do not want to fail to note my colleague from New York, \nSenator Gillibrand, the Presiding Officer, who has done a fabulous job, \ntoo, particularly on the agriculture portion of the bill on the \ncommittee on which she sits.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3826\n\n  Madam President, I come to the floor today and rise against the \nconsumer amendment posed by Senator Shelby that is before us. I come to \nthe floor to speak about the need for a strong independent consumer \nwatchdog. I am here to talk about the proposal put forward by some of \nmy Republican colleagues to place a new consumer protection division \nwithin the FDIC and significantly reduce the ability of that division \nto carry out its mission.\n  The amendment before us greatly weakens the bill in terms of consumer \nprotections. In fact, it is not just a step backward from the bill \nbefore us, it is a step backward from the status quo. If we were to \npass the amendment on the floor, consumer protections, weak as they are \ntoday, would be even weaker. This amendment would leave the consumer \nnaked and unprotected. This amendment strips the bill of some of its \nstrongest protections. Not every financial institution preys on \nconsumers, but those that do would be given too free a hand if this \namendment were to pass. I urge strong opposition to it.\n  Let me explain. One of the roots of this financial crisis was, \nundoubtedly, that total failure of our consumer protection regime. \nAmericans were sold products they did not understand and could not \nafford by mortgage originators eager for a fee and happy to sell those \nloans off into the great securitization machine which was given a \nvirtual carte blanche by the credit rating agencies.\n  After the events of the last several years, no one can argue that \nfundamental reform of our consumer protection regime is not necessary. \nNo one can argue the status quo is the way to go. The status quo simply \nwill not do. There is no accountability in the current system. Consumer \nprotection is split among seven different regulatory agencies. For that \nreason, I was an early supporter of efforts to create a truly \nindependent consumer protection agency, and I am still working with \nmany of my colleagues, including Senator Jack Reed and Senator Durbin, \nto strengthen the provisions of the bill proposed by Chairman Dodd.\n  One of the key authorities of any new consumer protection division or \nagency is that it must be able to adopt rules to protect consumers \nwithout being overruled by banking regulators who would rather allow \nbanks to pad their bottom lines by fleecing consumers with hidden fees.\n  Some argue that you cannot split consumer protection from safety and \nsoundness. But historically, in the present setup, every time there is \na conflict, the consumer loses. Consumers deserve an accountable \nregulator with oversight of consumer financial products as its primary \nobjective, not as an afterthought.\n  The Republican proposal being discussed is totally inadequate. It \nwould allow the same bank regulators, who have stood in the way of \nmeaningful consumer protections for years, to veto consumer protection \nrules proposed by the head of the new division.\n  For example, the Comptroller of the Currency, who publicly opposed \nthe Fed's new credit card rules, would, under the Shelby amendment, get \nto vote on future credit card rules. So the regulators who do not \nreally care--some of them--about consumer protection would be given \nveto power.\n  The division would have no examination or enforcement power over any \nbank of any size or any of its affiliates. Some of the worst actors in \nthe subprime mess were bank affiliates or subsidiaries. Even worse, it \ncould only do examinations of nonbank consumer finance companies if \nthey ``demonstrate a pattern or practice of violations'' of consumer \nlaw--in other words, only after consumers have been harmed repeatedly. \nThat is what one could call too little, too late. Even the Fed recently \ndeleted this requirement from rules governing subprime mortgages \nbecause it hampered enforceability of those rules so severely.\n  Even the banks want the new consumer division to be able to enforce \nits rules at nonbanks. This is amazing. Some of the most rapacious \ninstitutions that prey on consumers are not banks. They operate outside \nthe scope of the Federal regulatory authorities. They are often \nresponsible for many of the most egregious abuses and predatory lending \npractices. Many of the products provided to consumers by these nonbanks \nplayed a direct role in the financial crisis. And many of these \nbusinesses--payday lenders, rent-to-own companies--currently operate \nbelow the radar screen to prey on vulnerable communities. How can we \nexempt some of these payday lenders and\n\n[[Page S3306]]\n\nrent-to-own companies? I have seen them prey on poor people in my \nState. How can we exempt them from regulation when they often are worse \nthan many of the financial institutions?\n  The Republican amendment would also prohibit the consumer division \nfrom issuing any rules ``that affect any underwriting standards'' of \ndeposit institutions and their affiliates. After the crisis we just \nwent through, which was in large part created by bad mortgage \nunderwriting standards, I cannot believe anyone can propose this with a \nstraight face because--let me repeat what it does. The consumer \ndivision cannot issue rules ``that affect any underwriting standards'' \nof deposit institutions. It is saying: Let's repeat the mortgage \ncrisis. It makes no sense.\n  If this consumer division were in place in 2008--the one proposed by \nmy colleagues here--it would not have had the power to write the \nmortgage rules establishing the minimum ability to pay standards the \nFed issued. As we know, the Fed was not an extreme watchdog in any \n     sense. I have worked long and hard in the area of consumer \nprotection. I have worked with these regulators. I have seen how slowly \nthey work. It took more than 10 years to get them to go along with the \nso-called Schumer box, where credit card interest rates were made clear \nand visible to prospective credit card purchasers. It worked. But why \ndid it take so long? Then, when the banks came with new ways of getting \naround the rules, again, it took me forever to get the Fed to move \nbecause the Fed, frankly--and Chairman Bernanke to his credit admitted \nthis--did not make consumer protection a high enough priority.\n\n  So we need, in my judgment, an independent agency. That would be the \nbest solution. Second best would be an agency, even if it is within the \nFed, that is largely independent in both the rules it can promulgate \nand its enforcement. We need strong, forward-looking financial reform. \nI have always said I want the reform to be constructive, not punitive. \nBut if we go through all this and fail to leave consumers better \nprotected than they were before this crisis, we will have totally \nfailed in our mission to serve the American people.\n  I strongly urge that this amendment be rejected by a large and \nhopefully bipartisan majority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am glad the Senate is finally \nconsidering the critically important issue of financial regulatory \nreform. Few things are as important as ensuring we never again suffer \nthe kind of meltdown of the financial markets that shoved our economy \ninto the worst recession since the Great Depression. I think it still \nremains to be seen if this bill will do that. While it certainly \nincludes some good reforms, more needs to be done, and the track record \nof Congress in this area is, at best, checkered.\n  For the last 30 years, Presidents and Congresses have consistently \ngiven into Wall Street lobbyists and weakened essential safeguards. As \nhas been the case in so many areas, members of both political parties \nare to blame. Legislation that paved the way for the creation of \nmassive Wall Street entities and removed essential protections for our \neconomy passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. From the savings \nand loan crisis in the late 1980s to the more recent financial crisis \nthat triggered the horrible economic downturn from which we are still \nrecovering, those three decades of bipartisan blunders have been \ndevastating to our Nation. The price of those blunders has been paid by \nhomeowners, Main Street businesses, retirees, and millions of families \nfacing an uncertain economic future.\n  The impact of the recent financial crisis on the Nation's economy has \nbeen enormous. Millions have lost their jobs and millions more who are \nlucky enough to have a job are forced to work fewer hours than they \nwant and need to work. According to a study done by the Pew Trust, the \nfinancial crisis caused American households an average of nearly $5,800 \nin lost income. Of course, families lost a significant amount of their \npersonal savings. As a nation, we lost $7.4 trillion in stock wealth \nbetween July 2008 and March 2009 and another $3.4 trillion in real \nestate wealth during that same time. We simply cannot afford to \ncontinue down the path policymakers have set over the past 30 years.\n  The test for this legislation then is a simple one: Whether it will \nprevent another financial crisis. Central to that test will be how this \nbill will address too big to fail. This is a critical issue that has \nbeen growing for some time now as increased economic concentration in \nthe financial services sector has put more and more financial assets \nunder the control of fewer and fewer decisionmakers.\n  Years ago, a former Senator from Wisconsin, William Proxmire, noted \nthat as banking assets become more concentrated, the banking system \nitself becomes less stable, as there is greater potential for \nsystemwide failures. Sadly, Senator Proxmire was absolutely right, as \nrecent events have proved. Even beyond the issue of systemic stability, \nthe trend toward further concentration of economic power and economic \ndecisionmaking, especially in the financial sector, simply is not \nhealthy for the Nation's economy.\n  Banks have a very special role in our free market system: They are \nrationers of capital. When fewer and fewer banks are making more and \nmore of the critical decisions about where capital is allocated, then \nthere is an increased risk that many worthy enterprises will not \nreceive the capital needed to grow and flourish. For years, a strength \nof the American banking system was the strong community and local \nnature of that system. Locally made decisions made by locally owned \nfinancial institutions--institutions whose economic prospects are tied \nto the financial health of the community they serve--have long played a \ncritical role in the economic development of our Nation and especially \nfor our smaller communities and rural areas.\n  But we have moved away from that system. Directly as a result of \npolicy changes made by Congress and regulators, banking assets are \ncontrolled by fewer and fewer institutions, and the diminishment of \nthat locally owned and controlled capital has not benefited either \nbusinesses or consumers. Of course, most dramatically, taxpayers across \nthe country must now realize that Senator Proxmire's warning about the \nconcentration of banking assets proved to be all too prescient when \nPresident Bush and Congress decided to bail out those mammoth financial \ninstitutions rather than allowing them to fail. That was a bailout I \nstrongly opposed.\n  The trend toward increased concentration of capital was greatly \naccelerated in 1994 by the enactment of the Riegle-Neal Interstate \nBanking and Branching Act and especially in 1999 by the enactment of \nthe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which tore down the protective firewalls \nbetween commercial banking and Wall Street investment firms.\n  Those firewalls had been established in the wake of the country's \nlast great financial crisis 80 years ago by the Banking Act of 1933, \nthe famous reform measure also known as the Glass-Steagall Act.\n  Prior to Glass-Steagall, devastating financial panics had been a \nregular feature of our economy, but that changed with the enactment of \nthat momentous legislation, which stabilized our banking system by \nimplementing two key reforms. First, it established an insurance system \nfor deposits, reassuring bank customers that their deposits were safe \nand, thus, forestalling bank runs. Second, it erected a firewall \nbetween securities underwriting and commercial banking so financial \nfirms had to choose which business to be in. That firewall was a \ncrucial part of establishing another protection--deposit insurance--\nbecause it prevented banks that accepted FDIC-insured deposits from \nmaking these speculative bets with that money.\n  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act tore down that firewall, as well as the \nfirewall that separated insurance from Wall Street banks, and we have \nseen the disastrous results of that policy. I voted against tearing \ndown the firewall that separated Main Street from the Wall Street \nbanks. I did it for the same reason I voted against the Wall Street \nbailout: because I listened to the people of Wisconsin who did not want \nto give Wall Street more and more power. Wall Street was gambling with \nthe money of hard-working families and too many Members of Congress \nvoted to let them do it. I didn't support it before and I will not \nsupport it now. We\n\n[[Page S3307]]\n\nhave to get this legislation right and protect the people of Wisconsin \nand every State--protect them from something such as this ever \nhappening again.\n  So I was pleased to join the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, \nand the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, in introducing legislation to \ncorrect that enormous mistake Congress made in passing Gramm-Leach-\nBliley. I look forward to supporting an amendment to this measure based \non the Cantwell-McCain-Feingold bill.\n  The measure before us seeks to make up for the lack of a protective \nfirewall between the speculative investment bets made by Wall Street \nfirms and the safety net-backed activities of commercial banking by \nimposing greater regulatory oversight. We have seen how creative \nfinancial firms can be at eluding regulation when so much profit is at \nstake. No amount of regulatory oversight can take the place of the \nlegal firewall established by Glass-Steagall. So when it is offered, I \nurge my colleagues to support Senator Cantwell's amendment to restore \nthat sensible protection. Rebuilding the Glass-Steagall firewall is \nessential in preventing another financial crisis.\n  But even if we restore Glass-Steagall, there are additional steps we \nshould take to address too big to fail in this bill. I am pleased to be \njoining the Senator from North Dakota in offering his amendment to \naddress the problem directly by requiring that no financial entity be \npermitted to become so large that its failure threatens the financial \nstability of the United States. I am also looking forward to supporting \nan amendment that will be offered by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown, \nand the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Kaufman, who is in the Chamber, that \nproposes bright line limits on the size of financial institutions. The \ndisposition of those three proposals I have just reviewed will go a \nlong way in determining my vote for the final version of this measure. \nI very much want to craft in this body a bill that can prevent the kind \nof crisis we experienced in the past, but the bill before us needs some \nwork before we can legitimately make that claim.\n  I thank the President and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, the Republican side has submitted a \nconsumer protection amendment that can be briefly summarized: Buyer \nbeware because they won't help you. This flows from the very simple \npremise that they have announced from the very beginning of these \ndiscussions and deliberations they do not want an independent consumer \nprotection agency that has the authority to make rules and enforce \nrules to protect consumers. So what they have suggested is a classic \nbait and switch. We will create an ``agency'' within the FDIC, and then \nwe will deny them the power to regulate most of the financial sectors \nand institutions that affect the daily lives of Americans: payday \nlenders, car loans, all those things. They are just off the table. So \nit amounts to a gesture, not good legislative policy.\n  We are working, and we have been working--and Senator Dodd has taken \nthe lead--to ensure that there is real consumer protection built into \nthis Wall Street reform legislation. We believe consumers need \ninformation to make good choices. The thrust of our efforts is to \nensure that the agency is able to provide that information through \nsimplified forms, through simple products, through those mechanisms \nthat allow men and women who are engaged in raising children, keeping \njobs, coaching Little League, to understand what they are putting their \nresources into.\n  That is not what the Republican amendment is proposing to do. They \nare creating a six-person council within the FDIC with no real \nindependence and even less authority, and one could question why the \nFDIC is the logical place to put in a council such as this. They would \ncreate an oversight agency but exempt, as I said, virtually an entire \nfinancial sector or sectors from oversight. It is not like a watchdog; \nit is like a lapdog. It is bureaucracy with no bite.\n  The Dodd bill, in contrast, contains a very robust consumer \nprotection provision. It creates a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nwith resources--I wish to emphasize resources--and authority to \nprohibit abusive practices and deceptive financial products, ranging \nfrom credit card companies to mortgage brokers to banks and to others. \nFor example, it would hold the credit card companies accountable and \neliminate unfair lending practices, such as penalty fees for paying off \nyour debt on time.\n  One of the big efforts we are undertaking is increased transparency \nfor Wall Street, and this consumer protection agency will provide that \nprotection to consumers. Basic economics, Econ 101: In a competitive \nmarketplace, one of the presumptions is perfect information. We have \nseen, frankly, that individuals on Wall Street have made billions of \ndollars operating on imperfect information; in fact, one could even \nsuggest deliberately manipulating products so they have the information \nand the consumer doesn't.\n  I think we were all taken aback when we were listening to the \nhearings conducted by Senator Levin which talked about Goldman Sachs, \nand their trader, Fabrice Tourre, described the system in rather \nevocative terms. In his words:\n\n       More and more leverage in the system, the entire system is \n     about to crumble any moment . . . the only potential survivor \n     the fabulous Fab . . . standing in the middle of all these \n     complex, highly leveraged, exotic trades he created without \n     necessarily understanding all the implications of those \n     monstrosities.\n\n  Well, that seems, to me, very chilling--the fact that somebody would \nadmit they didn't even know the products they were selling to \nconsumers--who assumed not only that they knew but also that they would \nnot be deliberately misleading them. That is an example. The example \ndoesn't stop on Wall Street. It extends out to Main Street, to people \nwith credit arrangements, payday lenders, organizations charging huge \ninterest charges, and it is designed to exploit consumers.\n  The Republican proposal does little, if anything, to prevent that. I \nhope, on a bipartisan basis, as Senator Schumer suggested, we reject \nthis amendment. It is, as they say in some places, all hat and no \ncattle. We have an agency, but we have no enforcement powers. We have \nan agency, but they can't enforce their rules and regulations on \ncertain sectors; i.e., most of the sectors. So if we want to protect \nconsumers and if we want to have efficient markets--I think one of the \ninaccurate premises that some people are suggesting is that consumer \nprotection somehow is bad for business. I argue strenuously that \nconsumer protection is very good for business.\n  If you take care of the consumer, if they feel, and you provide, \nvalued and good service--that used to be the American sort of maxim. \nThat used to be the American byword for business: the consumer is \nalways right; the consumer comes first.\n  In the Republican legislation, the consumer comes last, not first. \nThe consumer should come first. I hope this amendment will be rejected \nand that we support not only the underlying Dodd bill, but I think it \ncan be improved. I commend the Senator from Connecticut who has done a \nremarkable job crafting the consumer protection agency. To accept the \nRepublican amendment would be to turn our backs on consumers and reject \nessentially the old American maxim that the consumer is always right \nand the consumer comes first, and it will leave everybody in this \ncountry where we are today: buyer beware of the monstrosities in the \nmarketplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I also commend Chairman Dodd for his \nwork on this bill. We have a good bill. I will be opposing the \namendment presently on the Senate floor. We need a strong, independent \nconsumer product finance protection agency. I have heard many different \nproposals to put the consumer product finance protection agency here, \nthere, and everywhere. The problem with putting it in any institution \nlike the FDIC or the Fed is that those institutions' No. 1 \nresponsibility is, and should be, the safety and soundness of the banks \nand financial institutions they are regulating. That is their key \ncharge.\n  I think the reason the Fed had a consumer product agency, which did \nnot act to help consumers during the recent meltdown, was that they \nfirst were concerned about safety and soundness.\n\n[[Page S3308]]\n\n  At the same time, we have to be very careful we don't put an undue \nburden on community banks. They were not involved in what happened. We \nshould make sure while we are looking out for consumers that we don't \noverregulate these local banks.\n  We have a good bill. I think the too-big-to-fail part we are getting \naround to. The recent amendments on the resolution that if, in fact, \nthe bank gets in trouble, we can resolve it, is a good approach. I am \nsure we will be talking about it more. It is a good approach to deal \nwith the too-big part of too big to fail. We have not done enough on \nthe too-big part of too big to fail.\n  Let me go over a chart that shows how big these banks have become. \nThis is the average assets of our major banks relative to gross \ndomestic product. If you look at this chart--and I encourage comments \nfrom my colleague, the Senator from Ohio. If you look at this chart, \nyou will see that just about the time we removed Glass-Steagall, this \nchart went absolutely through the roof.\n  When you look at the concentration of the U.S. banking system, you \nsee on this chart that is very similar to the first chart. It shows an \nexponential increase in concentration. This is not good for the \ncountry. This is not organic growth. I hear people say it is organic \ngrowth. This is growth from mergers. Neither chart includes the massive \nmergers that went on during 2008. This is through 2007. It doesn't show \nthat Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns were consumed in JPMorgan \nChase. It doesn't show the fact that Wachovia went into Wells Fargo, \nand Merrill Lynch went into Bank of America. It clearly shows that the \nincredible concentration just goes on.\n  Alan Greenspan made a number of decisions and statements while this \nwas going on about how we should proceed during the 1990s and early \n2000. He said himself that he thought self-regulation would work and \nwas dismayed that it didn't. He came out with a couple statements \nrecently that I was so incredibly surprised about.\n  He said this:\n\n       For years, the Federal Reserve had been concerned about the \n     ever-larger size of our financial institutions. Federal \n     research has been unable to find economies of scale in \n     banking beyond a modest-sized institution. A decade ago, \n     citing such evidence--\n\n  By the way, moderate size, according to Andrew Haldane, the executive \ndirector of financial stability for the Bank of England, is $100 \nbillion. He said he can find no reason to have the need for economies \nof scale at banks larger than $100 billion. As you know, the present \nsize of top banks are in the $2 trillion range, as high as $2 trillion.\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       A decade ago, citing such evidence, I noted that megabanks \n     being formed by growth and consolidation are increasingly \n     complex entities that create the potential for unusually \n     large systemic risks in the national/international economy \n     should they fail. Regrettably, we did little to address the \n     problem.\n\n  I hear people now talking about: We can't undo this. We need big \nbanks to compete internationally. Alan Greenspan is saying we don't \nneed these for the economies.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. If the Senator would yield, I thank the Senator \nfor bringing out that there is such broad support, as we are seeing, \nfrom economists as conservative as Alan Greenspan and as progressive as \nBob Reich, and others, who say too big to fail means simply too big. \nOur amendment will only affect the six largest banks--affect their \nsize--and it will affect smaller banks in helping them be more \ncompetitive.\n  You said something on the Senate floor yesterday that, in effect, the \nsize of these banks gives them a subsidy, a roughly 75 basis point or \nthree-quarters of 1 percent advantage in the capital markets. This \namendment we have, which is gaining increasing support--we have now 10 \nor 11 cosponsors to it, and we are working with people on both sides--\nsimply to say too big to fail is too big.\n  Talk to us for a moment about how these banks get the subsidies. \nSomebody in my office said in a sense we are giving welfare to the Wall \nStreet banks. Because of their size, they are getting advantage on the \ncapital markets because investors, with their dollars, understand these \nbanks are never going to be able to fail unless we really keep them \nfrom getting too big.\n  Explain that Wall Street welfare that we see with these 50 literally \ntrillion-dollar-plus banks, which they extract from the system.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Sure. I don't come at this from any other area except \nhow important our capital markets are. I am a market guy. I think the \ntwo greatest things we have are democracy and our capital markets and \nthe credibility of the markets. So when I want to find out what is \ngoing on in a financial area, I don't do a survey of 27 people. I say: \nWhat is the market telling us? That is the best way. What does the \nmarket tell us about what is going on?\n  What the market says is, if you are a big bank like one of these top \nbanks--referring to the study I talked about yesterday--if you are one \nof the big banks, you get a 70 to 80 basis point advantage when you \nborrow money. You pay less than other people.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. So that means when one of the huge Wall Street \nbanks--these six banks--is getting a three-quarters percent, roughly, \ninterest rate differential--a bonus, perhaps--that means that banks in \nDelaware and Ohio that aren't so big are at a competitive disadvantage. \nI assume that also means those big banks have opportunities to get \nlarger. If the playing field is not level, those toward whom it tilts \nget other advantages and grow larger and larger, making the point of \nour amendment that much stronger.\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Absolutely. Obviously, that is a key point. I am \nsurprised that more of our smaller banks aren't coming forward and \nsaying this isn't fair. The market says it is not fair.\n  The second point is the too big to fail. You can argue that you are \nnot too big to fail. But the market thinks you are, and I listen to the \nmarket. That is one of the important considerations. Unless people \nmisunderstand--people say you want to destroy the banks, and the rest \nof that. But under our amendment, Citigroup would be reduced to the \nsize it was in 2002.\n  Now, were they able to compete overseas and do all the things they \nhad to do then? Goldman Sachs, which is now at about $850 billion, \nunder the Brown-Kaufman amendment would be down to a more reasonable \nlevel of just above $300 billion or around $450 billion if Goldman \nexits the bank holding company structure. You may say that is a 50-\npercent decrease and that is going to hurt their opportunity. In 2003, \nthey had $100 billion in assets. So all we are shrinking Goldman Sachs \ndown to is 3 to 4\\1/2\\ times what they were in 2003.\n  This is not some draconian effort. The second point we have been \nfocusing on is that we also limit risk. This is not about size; we \nlimit risk. I recommend everybody to read the Washington Post today--\nthat is where I read it--about Jimmy Cayne, former CEO of Bear Stearns. \nHe testified to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that, in his \nopinion, as CEO of Bear Stearns, they failed because it was leveraged \n40 times over its capital base--40 times over its capital base.\n  Brown-Kaufman would cap leverage at 16 times the capital base. What \nhe is basically saying is that if Brown-Kaufman had been in effect, \nBear Stearns would not have failed.\n  A lot of people have different opinions, but that is what he says. \nThis is not just about size; this is about risk. What we are trying to \ndo is target risk. These banks don't fail--banks are doing great now; \nprofits are out the roof. You don't fail on a nice sunny day. You \ncannot sit here today and say no problem. That is why regulators don't \ndo anything because, basically, banks are doing well.\n  Time and again, when we had hearings before the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, we heard from Washington Mutual and \nGoldman Sachs. They said they were doing so well. How can you make them \nchange? The fact that they were doing so well by turning out mortgages \nthat were absolutely doomed to fail is an indication that they should \nhave moved in, but the regulators didn't.\n  I will not hold this out, but if you want to see what can happen \nunder the worst case, look at Europe today. Look at the mess unfolding \nin Europe. Greece falters and that affects confidence in other \ncountries such as Portugal, Spain, and Ireland. Europe and other banks \nhave massive exposures to these countries. German and French banks \ncarry a combined $119 billion in\n\n[[Page S3309]]\n\nexposure to Greek borrowers and more than $900 billion to Greece and \nother vulnerable Euro countries, including Ireland, Portugal, and \nSpain.\n  People say: How can we compete with those big banks? Remember, we are \nonly reducing Citibank to its size in 2002. How can we compete with \nEurope? Why do we want to do that? Why do we want to go in with their \nmegabanks and deal with the problems they have?\n  The Royal Bank of Scotland had a balance sheet basically 1\\1/2\\ times \nthe size of the UK economy when it failed in the fall of 2008. See \nthese numbers. It is 63 percent right now. Our six largest banks make \nup 63 percent of the GDP. The Royal Bank of Scotland's was 1\\1/2\\ times \nthe size of the United Kingdom when it failed. People say the big banks \ndidn't fail; it was the small banks that failed.\n  I keep hearing that J.P. Morgan and Bank of America did not fail. It \nwas Washington Mutual. They say there is no correlation. Megabanks, \nsuch as Citigroup, only survived through massive capital infusions, \nregulatory forbearance, and Federal monetary easing. Even J.P. Morgan \nhas benefited from not having to write down its second lien mortgages \nand commercial real estate.\n  The next thing they said when Washington Mutual failed was: How about \nthat, that was a smaller bank. That was a big bank. The reason it went \ndown is because we knew at the time when it failed that JPMorgan Chase \nwould come in and grab it.\n  I ask the question: Who is going to bail out, if something goes \nwrong, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, or any of these six larger \nbanks? Remember, going back to Citigroup, Citigroup essentially failed \nand had to be bailed out three times in the last 30 years: in 1982 \nbecause of the emerging market deck, 1989-1991 because of commercial \nreal estate, and 2008-2009 because of residential real estate.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, will the Senator yield? I \nappreciate this analysis. I hear, as we talk about the Brown-Kaufman \namendment--and it has gotten increasing attention because an increasing \nnumber of people said too big to fail is too big and that if we allow \nthese six banks--that chart the Senator showed originally--the largest \nsix banks in the United States 15 years ago were 17 percent of our GDP \nand today they are 63 percent and growing, as Senator Kaufman \nmentioned.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Exponentially.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Look at the rate of growth. They did not grow a \nwhole lot until the last 10 years, and look what happened. They are \ngoing to continue to grow since the Glass-Steagall repeal.\n  The argument opponents of our amendment use most frequently is: We do \nnot have the largest banks in the world anymore. There are larger banks \nother places. And how are our banks going to compete with these huge \nbanks?\n  I am intrigued by that because our banks are trillion dollar banks. I \nknow there are studies that banks with assets of $300 billion and $400 \nbillion and $500 billion have all the economies of scale. Economies of \nscale do not work forever.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. According to Alan Greenspan.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. A bank that is $300 billion, $400 billion, $500 \nbillion has all the economies of scale as a trillion dollar bank.\n  The point they make about European--we cannot compete \ninternationally--it is clear from what the Senator from Delaware said, \nall of our banks, when they were smaller--smaller than the largest \nbanks in the world--could compete internationally 10 years ago, and \nthere is no reason they cannot compete like that today.\n  I found the huge lumbering bureaucracies, whether they are a bank or \nwhether they are the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, are not \nas flexible and nimble and cannot keep up with the market nearly as \nwell if they are that big.\n  The Brown-Kaufman amendment, again, does not apply to very many \ninstitutions. No more than five or six will be even unwound a little \nbit. We are not going to split them all up so they are small, little \ncommunity banks. They are still clearly going to be able to compete. \nThere is no question about it under the Brown-Kaufman amendment. We \ngive 3 years to banks to sell off some of the assets, to spin off a \nline of business, to sell regional operations they may have in one area \nof the country to comply with this amendment.\n  It is clear that as increasing numbers of people say, ``Too big to \nfail is too big,'' that if we allow these banks to keep getting bigger \nand bigger--and we see this chart where the six largest banks in total \nassets end up being 70 percent, 80 percent, 90 percent of GDP--it is \nhard for me to think that if one stumbles and is about to fail that we \nare going to let it fail, that government will let it fail because it \nwill have huge repercussions because of the economic power these \ninstitutions have.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. We all agree the present bill is a good bill and has a \ngood resolution authority that has been worked on for years. My basic \nconcern is we need a little prevention in the mix.\n  As I said before, when people say we cannot compete overseas, do we \nwant to go where the Royal Bank of Scotland went? The Royal Bank of \nScotland was 1\\1/2\\ times the UK economy when it went down. Do we want \nto get into this mix in Europe? Is this the place we want to be with \nthese banks facing the problems they are going to have right now, as we \nwent through this earlier? Is this the place we want to be?\n  I think we go back to what Senator Dorgan was saying earlier, and I \nwish to add to that with a couple comments. Once again I quote Alan \nGreenspan. He said: ``Too big to fail, too big.'' ``Too big to fail, \ntoo big.''\n  The idea that we should turn this over to the regulators and let the \nregulators set the rates--that is the alternative. The alternative is \nto let the regulators do it. We have good regulators now. I think that \nis fine.\n  Remember several things. No. 1, the regulators did nothing. The \nregulators had the power to do most of what we are talking about. They \ndid nothing in the past.\n  The second thing is, we could have a new President come in and adopt \nthe same policy as before that self-regulation works, hire a bunch of \nregulators to go in there, such as a number of regulators we had in our \nregulatory agencies--they were not bad people. They were smart people. \nThey just basically believed self-regulation works. To quote Alan \nGreenspan for the third time in this speech, he said: ``I really \nthought self-regulation would work. I'm dismayed that it didn't.''\n  We can have it come back. There are still people today who believe--\nwe hear it sometimes on the floor--we do not need these regulators. The \nexample I use is a football game where somebody gets up and says: The \nreferees keep blowing the whistle and stopping the play. Let's get the \nreferees off the field and play football. That is what was going on \naround here.\n  As many of my colleagues on the other side point out, there was not \nenough oversight on these regulators. But you pull the football \nreferees off the field, maybe the first pileup will not be bad, but by \nthe time you get to the second and third pileup, I do not want to be in \nit.\n  I think we ought to go back to what our colleagues did in 1933, and \nwe should regulate not for 5 years, 10 years, 15 years; we should \nregulate for generations. Much of the stuff in this bill does regulate \nfor generations. We should put in the bill hardline, adopted by us to \nsend a message for generations that this is not going to happen again. \nBear Stearns is not going to be able to leverage up to 40 times their \ncapital base. That is what we need to do. We need to legislate for \ngenerations.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I am here to speak about the consumer \nprotection title in the Dodd bill. I do want to say that while I \ndisagree with my friends from Delaware and Ohio in their approach, I \nappreciate the way they have conducted themselves. I think the debate \nwe have had on the floor on this bill, I say to the Senator from \nConnecticut, has been of the highest level that I can remember in a \nlong time. I thank him for setting that tone. I thank my caucus for \noffering nothing but constructive amendments. People on both sides of \nthe aisle have tried to do that.\n  It took a while to get here, but we are on the floor. Obviously, \nthere are a\n\n[[Page S3310]]\n\nlot of improvements people would like to make to this bill, and I think \npeople are focused on doing that. I thank the Senator for setting that \ntone.\n  At the same time, I do want to talk about the consumer protection \ntitle on which I wish to see vast improvement. I wish to see consumer \nprotection take place. I think everybody in this body wishes to see \nthat happen. But I believe that the consumer protection title that \nexists in this bill is one that gets back to the essence of what the \nWhite House has said many times, and that is: Never let a good crisis \ngo to waste.\n  I think the consumer protection title in this bill is a vast \noverreach. It is my hope--I know we will have a vote later today on a \ndifferent title. If that is not successful, maybe there will be \nsurgical attempts to deal with some of the problems in this title.\n  For the first time in our country's history, we will be giving vast \npowers to an individual to be involved in almost every aspect of any \ntype of financial transaction. Without a board, without any kind of \ncheck and balance, the Dodd bill creates someone heading consumer \nprotection who has no one as a check and balance. This person is going \nto be able to write rules, and this person is going to be able to \nenforce those rules over our entire economy as they relate to financial \ntransactions.\n  I know there is a process by which if a rule is felt to be \nproblematic after it is put in place--not before--after a rule is put \nin place, there is the ability of a board to actually look at those \nrules. The fact is, if a standard is set so high, it would be very \ndifficult to ever overturn the rules that would be put in by this \nconsumer protection agency.\n  It has a vast budget. It sets its own budget, I might add. Again, \nCongress has nothing whatsoever to do with that.\n  Some of the biggest problems with the consumer protection agency are \nnot just that it has no checks and balance, it writes rules and \nenforces rules, it sets its own budget. On top of that, it overturns \nthe way our national banking system has worked for years. Congress \nyears ago decided we wanted to have a national banking system, that we \nwanted the ability of banks to operate across our country in a way that \nthey had consistency, they knew under what rules they would be \noperating.\n  The Dodd bill overturns that. It says there is no Federal preemption \nanymore. If States want to change laws, write laws--we could have a \nbank that operates in 50 States that has 50 different sets of \nregulations if this bill passes. That is highly problematic with banks \nthat operate across our country serving companies that operate across \nour country. One can imagine a bank that tries to adhere to all of \nthose States laws that might come up as a result of this bill.\n  In addition, this bill then unleashes 50 attorneys general on these \nbanks. That is something, again, that is not the case today. This is a \nhuge overreach, and it is going to be highly disruptive to our banking \nsystem.\n  What it is going to do, because there is no Federal preemption, is \nactually encourage general assemblies, State legislators across this \ncountry to become hyperactive. One of the things that State banks--not \nFederal banks, not national banks--one of the things State banks like \nabout our existing laws--by the way, State banks are not these huge \nmegabanks about which my friends from Delaware and Ohio were talking.\n  I think State banks across the country have enjoyed--again, these are \nthe smaller institutions--the fact there is something called Federal \npreemption. That has discouraged hyperactivity on behalf of State \nlegislators to create laws that might be populist in nature, that might \nbe done to, in essence, use our financial system for other ends.\n  One of the things I think is most disruptive about this legislation \nis that--if you can imagine this--I think all of us realize what led to \nthis last crisis is the fact that we had very poor underwriting of \nloans. That is the essence of this last crisis. It got spread around \nthe world, the fact we had incredibly poor underwriting.\n  I hope to fix that, by the way, with an amendment in a few days. I \nhope it comes up, and I hope it is adopted.\n  What the Dodd bill does is give to a consumer protection agency loan \nunderwriting standards. If you can imagine that. I would like for \npeople in this body to think about that. A consumer protection agency \nbeing involved in setting underwriting standards for loans has to \nundermine the safety and soundness of our financial institutions. To \nme, that is a huge problem.\n\n  All of us would like to see consumer protection take place. All of us \nwould like to see it, I hope, take place in a way that is balanced, so \nthe consumer protection laws that are put in place are put in place in \na way that is balanced against ensuring that our financial institutions \nacross this country are safe and sound; that people know they can go to \nthose institutions and they are going to operate.\n  I believe the Dodd bill, as it relates to consumer protection, is a \nvast overreach. I know people on the other side of the aisle have come \nup to me and said: Look, this is problematic, and if you guys can help \nus figure out a way to peel this back, we would like to be able to do \nthat.\n  We are going to have a chance, later today, to vote on a consumer \nprotection amendment that has certainly brought this more in balance. \nThere may be other ways of getting at it. I would urge the chairman to \nconsider looking at ways to peel this back because I do believe that, \nagain, we are going to awake in this country--if the Dodd bill passes \nin its present form--in 10 or 15 years and realize consumer protection \nhas gotten out of hand; that consumer protection has been used, in many \nways, to create social justice, if you will, in our financial system. \nTo me, that is something that is very dangerous.\n  Let me just add one other thing. There is a new word in this title \nthat is undefined. It is a word that says they will also be looking to \nsee if practices were abusive. But nobody knows what that means. Nobody \nknows what that means. Under this bill, by the way, if someone were to \ncome in after the fact and find that something was ``abusive,'' it \nwould negate the financial transaction that was entered into. So you \ncould have a zealous consumer advocate come in and say: I am sorry, \nthis loan that was made between two parties was abusive, and it would \nnegate that transaction.\n  This bill is a huge overreach. It obviously goes right along the \nlines of the White House saying you should never let a good crisis go \nto waste. This bill is going to be around for a long time, if it \npasses. So I hope what we can do, over the course of the next several \ndays, during this time when we are having one of the most civil debates \nI think we have had in the Senate since we have been here--a high level \nof civil debate--I hope we will be able to put this back in balance.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is from a State where people care a \ngreat deal about their financial institutions. So I hope to work with \nher and my friend from Minnesota and others to try to achieve that \nbalance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I will respond more fully a little later \nbecause my colleague and friend from Minnesota is on the floor to be \nheard, but I just wish to say that a lot of work went into this bill on \nconsumer protection.\n  You don't have to wait 10 or 15 years to find out what can happen. We \nhave watched painfully what can happen over the last several years, \nwhen the very people--the prudential regulators--should have been \nstanding and saying: No-doc loans are wrong and dangerous. In fact, it \nwas consumer groups that warned about the real estate bubble. We were \nbeing told everything was safe and sound because people were making \nmoney, and it looked like it might go on forever.\n  Of course, everyone has 20/20 hindsight looking back as to what \noccurred. But had we had in place someone saying: No-doc loans, no \ndownpayments, adjustable rate mortgages at fully indexed prices are \ngoing to cripple people's ability to meet those obligations, we \nwouldn't be in the situation we are in today. None of the seven \nagencies that have jurisdiction over consumer protection were doing \ntheir job very well.\n  I will address more specifically the alternative idea being \nsuggested, and let me also say I have never claimed our proposal on \nconsumer protection is perfect. I acknowledge the word ``abusive'' does \nneed to be defined, and we\n\n[[Page S3311]]\n\nare either talking about striking that word or defining it better. \nDeceptive and fraudulent cover the ground pretty well, but I thought \nabusive was a pretty good explanation point. Because it was abusive, in \ncommon language.\n  So I will come back later, but I wished to acknowledge that we have a \nnumber of organizations that have endorsed this bill of ours, strongly \nsupport our committee bill, ranging from the Americans for Financial \nReform, the Consumers Union, Center for Responsible Lending, the \nConsumer Federation of America, U.S. PIRG, Public Citizen, the National \nConsumer Law Center, Consumer Watchdog, and AARP.\n  Of course, we are all familiar with the group representing older \nAmericans. In fact, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord, at this point, a letter from AARP, opposing the Shelby \nsubstitute on the consumer protection title.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                              Retired Persons,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 2010.\n     Re Oppose Shelby substitute Consumer Protection title to S. \n         3217.\n\n       Dear Senator: A key priority for AARP in the financial \n     reform legislation is strengthened consumer protection that \n     will help restore market accountability and responsibility, \n     rebuild confidence, and ensure the stability of the financial \n     markets. Surveys conducted by AARP demonstrate that Americans \n     50+, regardless of party affiliation, want Congress to act to \n     hold financial institutions accountable.\n       AARP supports the creation of a Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau, as incorporated in S. 3217, that would \n     have as its sole mission the development and effective \n     implementation of standards that ensure that all credit \n     products offered to borrowers are safe. We have been clear \n     that such an agency should be truly independent in its \n     leadership, funding, staff and decision-making; that it \n     should have the authority to oversee all lenders and products \n     in the marketplace; and that it should have broad rulemaking, \n     enforcement and supervision powers over all types of \n     providers. We also have insisted that the states must be the \n     ``cops on the beat'' with the authority to move against \n     abusive practices that arise locally.\n       Judged against this criteria, the Shelby substitute \n     Consumer Protection title fails in virtually every instance. \n     The consumer protection agency will not be independent; \n     rather the FDIC Board of Directors must approve all \n     rulemaking. Inadequate resources will cover rulemaking and \n     supervisory expenses only; there is no funding for \n     enforcement. Oversight and enforcement is extremely limited. \n     For example, the new agency will have no enforcement \n     authority over any bank or other type of depository \n     institution. Non-mortgage companies will be subject to \n     supervision only if they demonstrate a pattern or practice of \n     violating the law within the past three years. And, the bill \n     does not give the states the authority to take action where \n     necessary.\n       We respectfully urge you to vote NO on the Shelby \n     substitute Consumer Protection title when it comes up for a \n     vote today. If you have questions, please feel free to call \n     me or have your staff contact Mary Wallace of our government \n     relations staff at (202) 434-3954 or mwallace@aarp.org.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              David P. Sloane,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                Government Relations and Advocacy.\n\n  Mr. DODD. So major groups, ones that are consumer oriented as well as \nthose that watch out for older Americans--many of whom have to pay \nmortgages, are on fixed incomes--are worthy of note.\n  Again, I wish to thank my colleagues for their comments and thoughts \non this amendment, and I will address more of that later, but I will \nyield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3808\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise to speak about the need to \nfurther address the problems of the credit rating agency industry. \nSenator Dodd has presented us with a very good bill that takes major \nstrides in addressing many of the problems that brought our economy to \nthe brink of collapse. It reins in too big to fail, brings derivatives \nout of the shadows, and creates a new consumer watchdog that will \nprioritize consumer protection over Wall Street profits.\n  Senator Dodd's bill includes several provisions on credit rating \nagencies. It holds rating agencies accountable in court for being \nreckless in their duties, it requires increased disclosure, creates new \ncomplaint systems, and requires raters to use information beyond what \nis provided by issuers.\n  These are a few of the many provisions the Dodd bill includes to \nbegin to address issues with credit rating agencies, and they are all \ngood. But one thing it doesn't do is get at the underlying problem--the \nconflict of interest inherent in the issuer-pays model, where the \nissuer pays the rating agency.\n  To root out conflicts of interest completely, we must change the \nvested interests of each of the players. The central conflict of \ninterest can be boiled down to this: The issuer has an interest in \nobtaining a high rating so it can sell its product. The credit rating \nagency has an interest in giving out a high rating so it can sell its \nservice. Tom Toles, of the Washington Post, depicts the problem quite \nwell in this comical cartoon.\n  Here we see the rating agencies--he labels them that so you know it \nis them--giving three 10s to a figure skater--labeled Wall Street, and \nhe is kind of fat there. You see he says: ``I pay their salaries.'' \nThat is why he is getting three 10s--or a AAA--and yet he is a figure \nskater and he is dumping trash. We see an apple core, there is a fish \nhead, skeleton, a banana. You don't want those on the ice. You just \ndon't want that. That is bad. Then there is a little figure here, the \nlittle garbageman. It says: ``Somebody else pays to clean the ice.'' \nThat, of course, is us--the taxpayers.\n  I think after seeing this cartoon, if there is anyone who doesn't \nsupport my amendment, I don't know what to do. Anyway, this actually \nmakes the point very well that the issuer is paying the rating agency \nand, hence, the AAA.\n  However, the credit rating agency should have an interest in \nproviding accurate ratings--unlike the triple 10s in this cartoon--so \ninvestors are provided with the accurate information they need to make \ninvestment decisions. But for the reasons I just described, there are \nvery few incentives to provide accurate ratings. The market simply \ndoesn't reward accurate ratings.\n  The best way to fix this problem is to change the way the market \nworks so it rewards accurate ratings. Once we start getting accurate \nratings, investors can make better decisions about the products they \nare selecting for inclusion into pension funds. Having safe products in \npension funds protects the retirement security of hard-working \nAmericans.\n  Let me give you an example of the perverse incentives that have been \ndriving the credit rating agency industry thus far. My friend and \ncolleague Senator Levin recently held a hearing in the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations. His investigators released many e-mails \nfrom the industry that reflect the conflicts of interest that drove the \nsystem.\n  Here is a good example. There is a rating agency employee writing to \nhis own rating agency people about a group of theirs, a group within \nhis rating agency.\n\n       We are meeting with your group this week to discuss \n     adjusting criteria for rating CDO's of real estate assets \n     this week because of the ongoing threat of losing deals. Lose \n     the CDO and lose the base business.\n\n  So here the credit rating agency is proposing to change its rating \ncriteria to avoid losing business. This is exactly what was at the root \nof all these AAA-rated, subprime, mortgage-backed securities that were \nleveraged and had the CDOs on them--these exotic instruments that were \nrated AAA--and what created this entire mess. It is clear the \nincentives are to keep customers coming back, to make sure accurate \nratings aren't driving customers into the arms of other rating \nagencies--don't want to let accuracy get in the way of more business.\n  We need to change the incentives. I believe my amendment, No. 3808, \nwill do that. The amendment tasks a board--a self-regulatory \norganization--with selecting a pool of qualified credit rating \nagencies. The board would then choose a system to assign, one at a \ntime, one of these qualified credit rating agencies to each request for \nan initial credit rating. Issuers could no longer shop around for the \nbest rating. They could, however, get a second, third or fourth rating \nfrom any agency they choose. But the first assigned rating would \nprovide a check against the next agency inflating its rating.\n\n[[Page S3312]]\n\n  The amendment would require the board to consider a rating agency's \npast performance and could adjust the number of rating assignments \nbased upon demonstrated accuracy. If a small rating agency began \nperforming extremely well, the board could start giving it more \nassignments, breaking the oligopoly of the big three raters, which \nserved us very poorly, or maybe the big three would get their act \ntogether under this new system.\n  The point is, when the agencies are finally operating in a market in \nwhich accuracy is valued, they will compete on the basis of accuracy. \nWhen accuracy is driving growth, not preexisting relationships or \nsweetheart deals, smaller rating agencies will have an opportunity to \ncompete and grow, making the industry more robust.\n  So properly addressing conflicts of interest in the credit rating \nagency industry necessitates realigning the interests of rating \nagencies with the interests of investors. The way to do that is by \npromoting and rewarding accuracy. My amendment will create these \nincentives, increase accuracy, promote competition and stability, and \nrestore integrity to the credit rating industry system.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Schumer and Senator Nelson, for \nhelping me lead this effort and Senators Whitehouse, Brown, Murray, \nMerkley, and Bingaman for joining us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the amendment \nthat Senate Republicans are offering to greatly improve consumer \nfinancial protection.\n  This amendment recognizes that our existing financial regulatory \nsystem fails to adequately provide consumer protection. Our system is \nbroke, and it needs fixing.\n  The recent financial crisis has revealed that our financial \nregulators were asleep at the switch and had neglected to uphold their \nbasic responsibilities for consumer protection.\n  Far too often, our regulators were more concerned about pleasing the \nentities they regulated than looking out for consumers. It is clear \nthat we need to refocus the priorities of our financial regulators and \nensure that consumer protection gets the attention it deserves.\n  Make no mistake. Republicans want to strengthen consumer protection.\n  We need to make sure that consumers get clear and understandable \ndisclosure so that they can make good decisions.\n  We need to make sure that regulators have sufficient authority to \ncombat fraudulent practices.\n  We also need to make sure that our consumer protection laws and \nregulations keep up with changes in our dynamic and innovative \nmarketplace.\n  Any changes to consumer protection, however, need to reflect that \nconsumer protection does not stand in isolation. It is inherently \nlinked with safety and soundness regulation.\n  This is most dramatically illustrated by the fact that an ill-\nconceived consumer protection law, such as allowing for no down \npayments, could cause banks to fail.\n  Given that taxpayers are ultimately on the hook for bank failures, it \nwould be irresponsible not to require regulators to consider the impact \nproposed consumer protections could have on the deposit insurance fund.\n  After all, one of the most important consumer protections is a \nhealthy financial system, where financial institutions are able to keep \nlong-term commitments to consumers, like annuities, insurance, and \nretirement funds.\n  The amendment we are proposing embodies this approach. It would put \nthe FDIC in charge of writing consumer protection regulations. That \nresponsibility currently rests with the Fed.\n  As a prudential regulator, the FDIC has the experience necessary to \nensure that the right balance is struck between consumer protection and \nsafety and soundness.\n  To raise the status of consumer protection, a new division will be \nestablished at the FDIC. The division will be led by a Presidentially \nappointed and Senate-confirmed director.\n  The director will serve a term of 4 years and will be required to \ntestify before Congress at least twice a year. This will help ensure \nthat regulators are held accountable for their actions on consumer \nprotection.\n  In addition, this amendment does not disrupt the century and a half \nof precedent on preemption with respect to national banks.\n  We should be very cautious about allowing national banks to be \nregulated by 50 different States and opening up the door to needless \nstate litigation that only enriches trial lawyers and raises costs to \nconsumers.\n  The Republican amendment also grants the FDIC primary supervision and \nenforcement authority over large nonbank mortgage originators, and \nother financial services providers that have violated consumer \nprotection statutes.\n  This will give the FDIC broad authority to clamp down on the worst \noffenders of our consumer protection laws without needlessly subjecting \nlaw-abiding businesses to expensive regulation.\n  The Republican approach to consumer protection sharply contrasts with \nthe approach of the Dodd bill.\n  Under the Dodd bill, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would \nissue rules without considering their impact on the safety and \nsoundness of financial institutions.\n  Need I remind my colleagues that this is the same regulatory model \nthat produced the fiascos at Fannie and Freddie. In that case, HUD \nwrote rules on their housing goals and underwriting standards, while \nOFHEO regulated them for safety and soundness.\n  Do we need a better example of the foolishness of divorcing consumer \nprotection from safety and soundness?\n  How did that regulatory model help consumers? It certainly left them \nwith a huge tax bill to cover the government bailout.\n  An examination of the powers and size of the bureau established by \nthe Dodd bill shows further how the Republican approach differs from \nthe approach advocated by the Obama administration and the Democrats.\n  They start with the assumption that small busiesses are, in President \nObama's words, ``bilking people'' and that heavyhanded regulations and \nan extensive bureaucracy are the only ways to ensure that small \nbusinesses do not take advantage of their consumers.\n  I do not believe that the tens of thousands of small businesses--the \nflorists, the retailers, the dentists, the auto dealers--that fall \nwithin the regulatory reach of their new bureaucracy are ``bilking'' \npeople. I also know that these entities had nothing to do with the \nfinancial crisis.\n  Unfortunately, the Dodd bill would create a massive new bureaucracy \nwith unprecedented powers to regulate small businesses and consumers.\n  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could dictate exactly what \nforms business must use, who they provide services to, and how they \nsell their products.\n  Control over American businesses would shift further from \nentrepreneurs to bureaucrats in Washington.\n  Perhaps the most troubling aspect of their approach is that it \nassumes that consumers need benevolent bureaucrats to make decisions \nfor them. In order to make that happen, the Dodd bill authorizes the \nnew consumer agency to collect any information it desires.\n  Small businesses across this country fear the massive and potentially \nvery intrusive new bureaucracy created under the rubric of consumer \nprotection. They have every right to be afraid.\n  This massive new government bureaucracy has the power to place \nindividuals under oath and demand information about their personal \nfinancial affairs.\n  The new bureaucracy is also required to report to the IRS any \ninformation it gets that it believes may be evidence of tax evasion.\n  Why does their new bureaucracy need these incredible powers? Because \ntheir bill envisions the bureau analyzing and monitoring Americans' \nbehavior and then issuing regulations to stop them from doing things \nthe bureaucrats deem ``irrational'' or ``inappropriate.''\n  Just read the writings of the Assistant Secretary of Treasury for \nFinancial Institutions, one of the chief architects of this expansive \nnew bureaucracy. He has written how ``regulating . . . appropriately is \ndifficult and requires substantial sophistication by\n\n[[Page S3313]]\n\nregulators, including psychological insight.''\n  Let me translate this academic jargon.\n  He is saying that all-knowing regulators should be empowered to make \ndecisions for consumers because benevolent regulators are the only ones \nwho possess the right ``psychological'' mind set to do things \n``appropriately.''\n  Think about it a minute.\n  Regulators are wise and should be heeded; consumers are foolish and \nshould do as they are told. That is what we are talking about here.\n  The architects of this massive new bureaucracy have long argued for a \nconsumer bureaucracy with the right ``culture.''\n  Whether that ``culture'' focuses on consumer protection and a safe \nand sound banking system or it becomes a way for community organizers \nand groups like ACORN to grab Federal resources is left wide open.\n  One of the strongest proponents for the new consumer bureaucracy has \nbeen Treasury's Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, as I \nsaid.\n  Allow me to read into the Record a couple of quotes from a paper \nentitled ``Behaviorally Informed Financial Services Regulation'' \ncoauthored by the Assistant Secretary Barr in October of 2008.\n  The Secretary writes, ``Because people are fallible and easily \nmisled, transparency does not always pay off. . . .''\n  He writes that: ``. . . regulatory choice ought to be analyzed \naccording to the market's stance towards human fallibility.''\n  On regulation, he writes that: ``Product regulation would also reduce \ncognitive and emotional pressures related to potentially bad \ndecisionmaking by reducing the number of choices. . . .''\n  He is talking about choices in the market place. Yes, the \nadministration's chief advocate believes that benevolent regulators \nneed to reduce choices for the consumer so that they can be protected \nfrom bad decision making and their own inherent fallibility.\n  He also opines on the topic of disclosures where he states that:\n\n       [D]isclosures are geared towards influencing the intention \n     of the borrower to change his behavior; however, even if the \n     disclosure succeeds in changing the borrower's intentions, we \n     know that there is often a large gap between intention and \n     action.\n\n  I believe that regulators need to ensure that consumers have the \ninformation they need to make their own decisions based on their needs \nand circumstances.\n  The proponents of behavioral economics believe, however, that \nregulators need to influence peoples' intentions and change their \nbehavior so that they make decisions that the regulator deems \nappropriate for them. As I have said before, this is the nanny state at \nits worst.\n  Finally, he writes of a proposal on late fees charged by financial \nservice providers.\n  He writes:\n\n       Under [his] proposal, firms could deter consumers from \n     paying late or going over their credit card limits with \n     whatever fees they deemed appropriate, but the bulk of such \n     fees would be placed in a public trust to be used for \n     financial education and assistance to troubled borrowers.\n\n  The translation is that behavioral economists not only believe that \nthey are best positioned to make decisions for us, but they are also \nbest positioned to decide how private companies spend their money.\n  Needless to say, this is a disturbing perspective, but it does reveal \njust how much the Obama administration wants to empower bureaucrats.\n  We should remember that the failure of our existing regulators, \nprimarily the Federal Reserve, to properly enforce consumer protections \nhelped cause the crisis. Yet the Dodd bill's response is to create a \nbigger bureaucracy and hire more bureaucrats at the Fed.\n  In contrast, the Republican amendment would make the changes and \nimprovements that we all can agree need to be done, but would do so in \na more focused and prudent manner.\n  The expansive reach of the Dodd bill means that the new bureau is \ngoing to be expensive. The budget for the bureau is approximately $650 \nmillion in new taxpayer costs, funded Argentina-style by tapping the \ncentral bank's money-printing powers.\n  In comparison, the budget for the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency, our national bank regulator, is currently $750 million, and \nthat agency does both consumer protection and prudential supervision.\n  Under the Republican plan, industry, not taxpayers, would pay the \ncosts of consumer protection.\n  Despite giving the bureau a huge budget and vast powers, the Dodd \nbill fails to take any reasonable steps to hold the bureau accountable.\n  The bureau receives all of its funding from the Federal Reserve, \nbeyond both congressional and executive oversight.\n  The bureau has complete discretion on how it spends its budget, \nallowing it to devise programs for backdoor funding of special interest \ngroups like ACORN and other liberal activist groups.\n  The more we learn about the Dodd bill's approach to consumer \nprotection, the more I believe the Republican approach makes more sense \nand strikes the right balance.\n  The Republican amendment wisely places consumer protection in a \nfinancial regulator, the FDIC, but enhances the status of consumer \nprotection by creating a new division of consumer protection.\n  It holds regulators accountable and ensures that repeat violators of \nconsumer protection laws face stiffer penalties and regulation.\n  The Republican amendment avoids creating costly new bureaucracies and \nimposing unnecessary costs on small businesses that had nothing to do \nwith the crisis.\n  We all agree that consumer protection needs to be modernized and \ngiven more attention by our regulators.\n  I believe the Republican approach does this. And it does so without \nbuilding the expansive and expensive bureaucracy contained in the Dodd \nbill.\n  Most importantly, the Republican approach ensures that consumers are \nprotected, but that they, not bureaucrats, are ultimately the ones \nmaking decisions for themselves.\n  I have heard from productive American companies--from tractor \nmanufacturers to beer brewers--from motorcycle manufacturers to public \nutilities that provide heating fuel to your home--and they strongly \noppose this bill because it will increase their operational and risk \nmanagement.\n  I have heard small responsible business owners, who offer their \ncustomers the convenience of installment payments, express serious \nconcerns about the potential for an out-of-control consumer bureaucracy \nthat the Dodd bill creates.\n  Although the bill's supporters have and will argue that the fears are \nunfounded because the bill says that merchants not engaged \n``significantly'' in offering consumer financial services are excluded \nfrom the new consumer regulatory bureaucracy.\n  The bill does not, however, define what the word ``significantly'' \nmeans--leaving that to the discretion of the benevolent bureaucrats.\n  The supporters of this massive new government agency trust the \nbureaucrats. I trust American small business owners.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from \nAlabama for his comments and for his proposal, which he described as a \nRepublican proposal. Of course, what all of us hope is that it becomes \na bipartisan proposal as our friends on the other side look carefully \nat it. That is what happened with the big bank bailout provision we \nworked on yesterday. Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby worked for a \nwhile, Senators Corker and Warner had worked before that, and we came \nup with a conclusion that all but five Senators agreed to. Now we have \nmoved to address two of the other major deficiencies in the Dodd bill \nthat we have wrapped up in one proposal here, and it is really wrapped \nup with the central issue that is before the American people.\n  President Obama said in September of last year that the health care \nbill was a proxy for a larger issue about the role of government in \nAmericans' lives. The President was exactly right about that, and we \nhave seen the issue of government's role over and over again. I don't \nthink it will change between now and the November election. In fact, \nthe President said at our health care summit that is why we have \nelections, and\n\n[[Page S3314]]\n\nI think he is correct about that. We have seen a Washington takeover of \nbanks; we have seen a Washington takeover of car companies; we have \nseen a Washington takeover of many aspects of health care; we have seen \na gratuitous Washington takeover of student loans. In this financial \nregulation bill, instead of dealing with the high jinks of big banks, \nwe are going to take over Main Street lending and, on top of it, create \na new czar or czarina to make decisions about millions of transactions \nacross America that are on Main Street.\n  So what Senator Shelby's proposal offers--and we hope it receives the \nsame kind of bipartisan consideration that the resolution authority or \nthe big bank bailout discussion did yesterday that we finally agreed \non--is that we would like to change this bill in two ways. Republicans \nwould like to say: Let's take Main Street lending out of it. The \nSenator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, said it is not in there. But the \nlanguage makes it look as if it is in there. It looks like we're about \nto start regulating your daughter's dentist bill, the plumber, and the \nstore owners up and down Main Street who give you flexible credit. In \nother words, if you say: You can pay me over time--it looks as if \nCongress is going to start regulating that transaction.\n  That is going to make credit harder to get because the dentist or the \nplumber or the store owner is going to say: I'm not going to fool with \nit. I don't want to be regulated by some Washington bureau, so if you \nwant to buy my goods, go to the bank and get some money or get another \ncredit card.\n  And you know what that is going to do? That's going to slow down the \neconomy. That's going to make jobs harder to create because it is going \nto make credit harder to obtain and credit harder to offer.\n  Making credit harder to get is not what we need at this time. We just \nhad the reports of the economic growth of our country during the first \nquarter. It was 3.2 percent. That is not very good. I can vividly \nremember flying on a helicopter with President Bush when I was \nEducation Secretary in 1992, and the economic growth of the third \nquarter of the year was better than that; it was 4.2 percent. And Bill \nClinton beat George Bush, Sr., on the ``It's the Economy, Stupid'' \ncampaign. So 3.2 percent is not going to cut it for our country. Most \neconomists say that if our economy continues to grow over the next \nyear, through 2010, at the same rate it grew in the first quarter, the \nunemployment rate will not change. The unemployment rate will still be \nabout 9 or 10 percent at the end of this year, as it is today.\n  What can we do to change that? Well, we have to create an environment \nfor job growth. We have done pretty good in creating job growth in \nWashington. The one place the stimulus has really worked is in \nWashington, DC. Salaries are up. Jobs are up. There are plenty of new \njobs around here. But out across America, we are not creating enough \nnew jobs, and too many of the things we are doing here make it harder \nto create new jobs.\n  The health care bill makes it harder to create new jobs because it \nimposes taxes on job creators and it imposes taxes on investors. Tax \nincreases make it harder to create new jobs. Running up the debt--the \nPresident's budget doubled the debt in 5 years and tripled it in 10 \nyears--makes the economy less certain and it makes it harder to create \nnew jobs. And the threat of creating a czar or czarina in Washington, \nDC, and a new bureau to supervise and make Main Street lending more \ndifficult and expensive makes it harder to create new jobs. We should \ntake it out of the bill.\n  If the Senator from Connecticut, who is one of our finest Senators, \nand is well intentioned, wants Main Street lending out of the bill, \nlet's just take it out of the bill. Let's don't leave in there the \npossibility that someone might come along and interpret \n``significantly'' involved financial activities to include the plumber \nand the dentist.\n  This has attracted the attention of a lot of people from Tennessee: \ncommunity bankers, credit unions, and the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses. They are talking about office suppliers, \njewelers, health professionals, and furniture stores who are all \nconcerned with this bill. The NFIB estimates that about 50 percent of \nsmall businesses let you pay over time. In other words, they offer you \ncredit. They make special arrangements. They say: OK, we know you don't \nhave all of the cash right now. You might not want to run up your \ncredit card or maybe your credit card is near the limit, so we will \nsell you whatever we have to sell you or we will provide the service \nyou need. You can pay us in 6 months. You can pay us in 5 months.\n  Well, under this bill, if you offer payment plans you could be \n``significantly'' involved in financial activities. Then this czar or \nczarina in Washington, DC, is going to be regulating you. You might be \na very small business and you might not have a lot of extra money to \nfill out regulatory forms, but you are going to be filling out forms \nand suffering more regulations. And you are going to be offering less \ncredit and credit will be harder to get up and down Main Street.\n  If our real intention in this body on both sides of the aisle is to \nnot interfere with Main Street lending, then let's actually do that. \nThat is what the Republican amendment--which we hope becomes a \nbipartisan--does.\n  Then there is the second big idea that is in this Republican \namendment. So far as I am concerned--we don't need another czar. This \nbill is supposed to be about big banks, about financial high jinks on \nWall Street, about this recession we are in, and about issues that will \nchange the regulations in a sensible way that will avoid as many future \nrecessions as possible and, at the same time, about creating an \nenvironment in which we can grow the largest number of good new jobs. \nBut suddenly, we have this new Washington agency not only possibly \nregulating Main Street lending but creating an unaccountable person at \nthe top to write the rules and the regulations. When I say \n``unaccountable,'' that means she or he is just over here at the Fed. \nOnce confirmed by the Senate, this person has no boss. This person \ndoesn't report to the President, doesn't have to come before Congress \nfor appropriations, and has a steady stream of money and really \nunlimited authority. There is nothing to keep this new czarina or czar \nfrom writing the kinds of regulations and rules that got us into \ntrouble in the first place with housing. Nothing to keep this person \nfrom writing rules that might encourage irresponsible home ownership. \nThat is what we had before. So the Dodd bill might encourage \nirresponsible borrowing.\n  So the second major idea in the Republican amendment is, let's make \nthis person accountable. The President appoints a Director who is \nconfirmed by the Senate, but this person would be in the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation. This Director would be accountable to \nother people appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate and \nwould have to come before the Congress multiple times annually to give \nus a chance to inquire about things.\n  I have come to the floor today to say we made an important step in \nthe right direction when we worked on the first part of this bill \nyesterday across party lines. We addressed one of the five issues we \nneed to deal with.\n  The issue of, what to do with banks that are too big to fail and get \nthe rest of us into trouble, has been addressed.\n  But we have four more big issues to deal with here and other smaller \nissues. Two of the big issues are addressed in this Republican \namendment. One is: let's not take over Main Street lending and make it \nharder to loan money, harder to get money, and harder to create jobs.\n  No. 2 is: let's not create another czar in Washington. The last thing \nwe need is another Washington takeover and another Washington czar.\n  We hope our amendment will attract significant bipartisan support, \nand then we can move on to the other important questions in this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, first, let me thank Senator Dodd for \nbringing forward a strong bill to regulate Wall Street. The bill \nprovides for strict new regulations to stop Wall Street's reckless \ngambling.\n  I think one needs to understand the current system and how we got to \nwhere we are today. We have eight Federal regulatory entities that \noversee\n\n[[Page S3315]]\n\nthe financial sector. Their authority is different, their powers are \ndifferent, their ability to respond to a particular problem is \ndifferent, and the entity that is regulated today can shop for the \nregulator they want by what they call themselves and the types of \nactivities they try to define themselves as. They can shop and look for \nthe regulatory entity they believe they can circumvent the easiest. \nThey can escape and did escape proper supervision.\n  Well, this legislation ends that practice by a clear regulatory \nframework in order to regulate all financial institutions. The \nregulatory entity that does the regulation is based upon size and \njurisdiction. And we have the Financial Stability Oversight Board that \nprovides uniformity. No more gaps in the regulatory system. And it \nprovides the tools for the regulators for early intervention. That \nmeans we end, once and for all, too big to fail. By early intervention \non takeovers, closing down financial institutions, requiring the sale \nof financial institutions, we can prevent the need for too big to fail. \nThe risk will be on the investors, not on the taxpayers of this \ncountry. The Boxer amendment makes that clear.\n\n  Tools that are needed for orderly liquidation to minimize the impact \non the financial sector and our economy are provided in this \nlegislation.\n  It recognizes the need for special attention to our community \nfinancial institutions. They were not the cause of the financial crisis \nwe went through. We know it came from Wall Street. Our community banks \nwere very much vulnerable as a result of the financial collapse. We \nneed to streamline the regulatory process as it relates to our \ncommunity banks. Regulation is cost. We have to have regulation. We \nneed regulation. They need regulation. But we need to make sure it is \nsensible. This bill streamlines the regulatory structure as it relates \nto our local financial institutions.\n  We need strong and adequate regulation, and it provides it. We need \nto write a balance, and this legislation provides that. I might say, \nthere are amendments we have already considered that I think were the \nright thing in order to make sure this balance is correct. I am sure \nthere will be other amendments we will consider to make sure we get \nthat balance right between adequate regulation and the cost of \nregulation to small community financial institutions.\n  This legislation puts the consumer first, as it should, with a strong \nconsumer bureau. Some say: Why do we need that? Isn't the current \nregulation adequate? The answer is no. All you need to look to is what \nhappened in the residential mortgage marketplace. All you need to look \nat are the advertisements that were taking place just 2 years ago for \nno-doc or stated-income loans or no-down-payment loans--loans that \nprovided over 100 percent of the cost. And look at the subprime lending \nin each of our communities, where home buyers who could have qualified \nfor traditional home mortgages were steered into the subprime market \nbecause the mortgage company or the seller made more money by steering \nthem into subprime loans. Well, those practices have to come to an end. \nThose housing practices sparked, as we know, the trigger for this \nrecession. These practices helped create that bubble that burst and the \ndamage that was caused when it did burst.\n  We can take a look at the cost of this recession. The Pew Financial \nReform Project estimated that just a slowdown in economic growth will \ncost every family in America close to $6,000. Well, that is money that \nwill never be made up. We have to make sure it never happens again. The \nFederal spending, in order to prevent the economic collapse of Wall \nStreet, is estimated to cost $2,000 per household. If you look at just \nthe decline in real estate values, in 9 months, from July 2008 to March \n2009, the wealth lost equaled about $30,000 per household in real \nestate and over $60,000 per household in the stock market. We lost \nmillions of jobs. I could go on and on. We have an obligation to make \nsure our economy and our people are protected from that type of \nfinancial meltdown in the future.\n  This legislation properly regulates risky gambling by financial \ninstitutions by putting in place prohibitions and disclosures. It puts \nan end to derivatives markets that have no economic value to our \neconomy. It requires disclosure on the derivatives markets, so we can \ntake Justice Brandeis' advice and use sunlight as the best \ndisinfectant. It provides for the Volcker rule, codifying that, by \nrestricting certain types of high-risk financial activities by banks \nand bank holding companies.\n  This legislation regulates credit rating companies. We know credit \nrating companies--their rating will very much affect the price of a \nsecurity and the viability of the security.\n  In this recession, many Marylanders and people from every State in \nthis Nation have lost their homes, their jobs, and savings. We have a \nresponsibility to act to end the reckless practices on Wall Street that \nhelped plant the seeds for this recession. This legislation is a giant \nstep forward.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3732\n\n  Madam President, I will now speak briefly about an amendment I intend \nto offer.\n  I rise to urge the inclusion of amendment No. 3732 to S. 3217. This \namendment is a critical part of the increased transparency and good \ngovernance we are striving to achieve in the financial industry.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment that would require all foreign and \ndomestic companies registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange \nCommission, the SEC, to report in their annual report to the SEC how \nmuch they pay each government for access to their oil, gas, and \nminerals. Most of the world's extractive industries companies would be \ncovered by this law, setting a new international standard for \ntransparency, for openness.\n  We have seen the devastating effects of a lack of transparency in \nthis country, what happens when Wall Street is left unchecked and \nbarons cloaked in secrecy make off with millions while others lose \ntheir homes. This is why we are addressing openness and transparency in \nthe underlying legislation today. We would be remiss to create this \nsweeping reform of our financial sector without addressing the need for \nadding a new layer of transparency to a set of companies already under \nthe SEC's jurisdiction--the oil, gas, and mining companies that make up \nthe extractive industries.\n  This amendment would create an environment of transparency to \nreassure investors, help stabilize global energy markets, and thus \nsupport goals of energy security.\n  Current Federal Accounting Standards Board standards require reports \nof tax, royalty, and bonus payments to host governments, but the \nnumbers need only be reported in aggregated categories, such as \n``production costs excluding taxes'' and ``taxes other than income.'' \nThese payments are reported on a country level where a company's \noperations are very substantial, but otherwise they are reported on \nsuch a broad basis that a company can simply report on which continent \nit was operating. Such disclosure is not useful in determining the \nextent of a company's operations in or its ongoing financial \narrangements with a country.\n  In terms of energy security, the oil, gas, and mining revenues are \ncritically important economic sectors in about 60 developing and \ntransition countries which are paradoxically home to more than two-\nthirds of the world's poorest people. Despite receiving billions of \ndollars per year from extractive revenue, these countries rank among \nthe lowest in the world on poverty, economic growth, authoritarian \ngovernance, conflict, and political instability. Unaccountable \nmanagement of natural resource revenues by foreign governments leads to \ncorruption and mismanagement, which in turn creates unstable and high-\ncost operating environments for multinational companies and threatens \nthe security of the energy supply of the United States and other \nindustrialized nations. So we are talking about in these countries \nwhere mineral wealth becomes a mineral curse. It becomes a source of \nrevenue for corruption rather that a source of revenue for economic \ngrowth so a country can grow. It runs counter to our foreign policy \nobjectives of good governance and economic growth for the developing \nworld. Transparency will help make sure the mineral wealth goes to the \npeople of that nation.\n  The provisions of this amendment would apply to all oil, gas, and \nmining companies required to file periodic reports with the SEC; \nnamely, 90 percent\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\nof the major internationally operating oil companies and 8 out of the \n10 largest mining companies in the world--only 2 of which are U.S. \ncompanies. We are talking about foreign-owned companies, not U.S. \ncompanies, by and large. Of the top 50 largest oil and gas companies by \nproven oil reserves, 20 are national oil companies that do not usually \noperate internationally. These companies are not registered with the \nSEC or any other exchange and only operate within their own country, \nwhich means these national oil companies do not compete with \ninternationally operating companies. Of the remaining 30 companies that \ndo operate internationally, 27 would be covered by this legislation--27 \nof the 30. These include Canadian, European, Russian, Chinese, \nBrazilian, and other international companies.\n\n  We currently have a voluntary international standard to promote \ntransparency. A number of countries and companies have joined the \nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the EITI, an excellent \ninitiative that has made tremendous strides in changing the culture of \nsecrecy that surrounds the extractive industries. But too many \ncountries and companies remain outside this voluntary system.\n  The notion of transparency has been endorsed by the G8, the IMF, the \nWorld Bank, and a number of regional development banks. It is clear to \nthe financial leaders of the world that transparency in natural \nresources development is key to holding government leaders accountable \nto the needs of their citizens and not just building up their personal \noffshore bank accounts.\n  It is now time to create in law an international standard for \ntransparency. It will only happen if the United States is in the \nleadership. The international community looks to us to be a leader on \nthis issue.\n  Investors need to be able to assess the risks of their investments. \nInvestors need to know where, in what amount, and on what terms their \nmoney is being spent in what are often very high-risk operating \nenvironments. These environments are often poor developing countries \nthat may be politically unstable, have lots of corruption, and have a \nhistory of civil unrest. The investor has a right to know about the \npayments. Secrecy of payments carries real bottom-line risks for \ninvestors.\n  Creating a reporting requirement with the SEC will capture a larger \nportion of the international extractive industries corporations than \nany other single mechanism, thereby setting a global standard for \ntransparency and promoting a level playing field.\n  Investors should be able to know how much money is being invested up \nfront in oil, gas, and mining projects. For example, oil companies \noften pay very large signature payments to secure the rights for an \noilfield, long before the first drop of oil is produced. Such payments \nare in addition to the capital investment required. In Angola, for \nexample, $500 million is not an unusual signature bonus that has to be \npaid for a single field, and a single field can cost more than $2 \nbillion to develop. Such costs take years for companies to recoup \nthrough their production-sharing arrangements with host companies. For \nthis reason, it is in the interest of the investors to know the amount \nand timing of payments of high-risk operating environments.\n  When a company they have invested in becomes targeted by a campaign \nof misinformation, only the transparency of their financial information \nwill help the investor. Disclosure of payments is one way to address \nrisk, helping companies protect themselves from false or unfair \naccusations and blame-shifting by host governments that can tarnish \ntheir image in the investor community and the general public.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the creation of a \nhistoric transparency standard that will pierce the veil of secrecy \nthat fosters so much corruption and instability in resource-rich \ncountries around the world.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, Americans have sent Congress a message: \nReform Wall Street, hold the bad actors accountable, but do not hurt \nthe folks on Main Street who had nothing to do with the financial \ncrisis. That is what we are debating about here in the Senate this \nweek.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle agree on one thing: All of us \nwant to hold Wall Street accountable for the havoc wreaked on Main \nStreet. We all agree we need to enact reform to prevent another \nfinancial crisis. But we have some disagreements on what responsible \nreform looks like.\n  While we all agree on the need to reform Wall Street to protect Main \nStreet, the current bill, even with amendments so far, does not, in my \nview, do the trick. We are making progress, but there is still a lot of \nwork to do because, in its current form, the bill is still a massive \ngovernment overreach, punishing Main Street, hurting families, and \ncosting jobs by stifling small business and entrepreneurs.\n  Today, I will highlight some of the concerns I have heard from Main \nStreets in Missouri and elsewhere and some of the amendments that have \nbeen filed to improve the bill.\n  First, on the GSEs, none of us can deny that Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac were significant contributors to the financial crisis. Just like \nany real reform, to prevent a future financial crisis, we have to deal \nwith Wall Street, and we must also deal with Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac. Unfortunately, this bill totally ignores it. It turns a blind eye \nto these government-sponsored enterprises, these GSEs which contributed \nto the financial meltdown by buying high-risk loans banks were directed \nto make to people who could not afford them.\n  The irresponsible actions in the marketplace by Fannie and Freddie \nturned the American dream into the American nightmare for far too many \nfamilies who faced foreclosure. They then devastated entire \nneighborhoods with the foreclosed homes and communities where property \nvalues diminished. Ultimately, it led to a national and international \nfinancial crisis. No one--especially those of us who are taxpayers--can \nforget what happened after Fannie and Freddie got done wreaking havoc \non families and neighborhoods. They went belly up. That is right. Over \na year and a half ago, the government had to take over the GSEs, \nleaving taxpayers to foot the bill.\n\n  To make matters worse, I am sure everybody read with shock just \nyesterday when the press reported that Freddie lost $8 billion in the \nfirst quarter. That is a lot of work. Then they had the nerve to \nrequest another $10.6 billion from the American taxpayers and warned \nthat this $10.6 billion is just a downpayment on the money they will \nneed in the future. Is it time to call a halt? Is it time to get a \nhandle on it? It is well past time.\n  In case my colleagues need a reminder, this latest $8 billion Freddie \nlost is on top of the $126.9 billion Fannie and Freddie had already \nlost through the end of 2009. The Wall Street Journal today hit the \nnail on the head when they referred to Fannie and Freddie as the \n``toxic twins.'' These toxic twins are far and away the biggest losers \nin the entire financial crisis--bigger than AIG, Citigroup, and all the \nrest.\n  So when we focus our anger, let's not forget our friends at Fannie \nand Freddie. You talk about doing some damage. Here is where the damage \nis. Here is where the burden comes, not just on us but on the credit \ncards of our children and grandchildren, the young people here as \npages. They don't realize how heavy a debt burden we have already put \nin their wallets. Sorry about that, folks, but you and your generation \nand generations to come are going to be paying for it.\n  Taxpayers now and taxpayers in the future will be the biggest losers, \nsince according to the Congressional Budget Office's optimistic \nestimates, these toxic twins will cost the taxpayers close to $380 \nbillion. Even for those of us in Washington, $380 billion is a big \nnumber.\n  After all this pain to families, neighborhoods, and taxpayers, one \nwould think the oversight of Fannie and Freddie would be a top \npriority, which is why it is stunning to me that the Obama \nadministration has only recently nominated someone to fill the \ncritically important position of inspector general of the Federal \nHousing Finance Agency to oversee the GSEs. How can we have proper and \neffective oversight of Fannie and Freddie when the office has been \nvacant at the highest level for so long?\n\n[[Page S3317]]\n\n  The bottom line is, responsible reform must address Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac. Responsible reform would put an end to the taxpayer-funded \nbailout of Fannie and Freddie and refocus them on affordable housing. \nSenators McCain, Shelby, and Gregg have filed an amendment to protect \ntaxpayers and put an end to the government bailout of Fannie and \nFreddie. In short, this amendment cuts up the Federal credit card by \nputting an end to the limitless line of credit Fannie and Freddie \ncurrently enjoy, compliments of us as taxpayers.\n  This amendment puts an end to the conservatorship and requires each \nto operate eventually without government subsidies and on a level \nplaying field with the private sector.\n  Next of great importance is seed capital. It is critical in reforming \nWall Street that we not punish Main Street and the very specific small \nbusiness startups that are so critical to job creation. If there is one \nthing we are worrying about it is, Where are the jobs? Well, I will \ntell my colleagues where the jobs are. They are the jobs the \nentrepreneurs and the innovators and the inventors can start. \nUnfortunately, in the current form of this bill, there are provisions \nthat will kill the business startups. While title IX of the Dodd bill \nhas been little talked about--far too little, in my opinion--it could \nhave devastating consequences. Specifically, this provision would kill \nsmall business startups by delaying and eliminating the availability of \nprivate investor seed capital, and that is essential for these startups \nto survive and grow.\n  According to new regulations by the SEC, innovators and entrepreneurs \nwould be subject to registering with the SEC for a 4-month review; \nthus, tying up vital venture capital needed for immediate use by new \nbusiness. This could cripple new businesses.\n  Next, the bill proposes to add a further requirement to raise the net \nworth threshold on those who can invest to $2.3 million and raise the \nannual household income to $450,000. This would disqualify two-thirds \nof current accredited investors, according to the Angel Capital \nAssociation.\n  Small businesses and startup companies are the backbone of our \ncountry. They are where we are looking to get the new jobs of the \nfuture, and a critical role is played by angel investors in creating \nand developing new companies, small or large.\n  I will confess, this is of particular concern to my State of \nMissouri, where I have been working for a long time to build an \nagricultural biotech corridor across the State. In Missouri, we have \nthe research institutions, the scientific leaders, and advanced \nagricultural research and biotechnology. Research in the biotech \nindustry is our best hope for a stimulus to create high-paying, skilled \njobs in rural as well as urban Missouri and, I would say, across \nAmerica.\n  The stimulus these biotech and research companies are spurring in \nMissouri is also happening today across the Nation. According to the \nKauffman Foundation, between 1980 and 2005, companies less than 5 years \nold accounted for all--all--the net job growth in the United States. As \na matter of fact, that same study showed that in 2008, angel investors \nprovided roughly $19 billion to help start up more than 55,000 \ncompanies. Why would we want to limit that? The bill, if enacted, would \ndeny immediate access to the capital and, if enacted, would say to \nthese innovators and entrepreneurs: You are too small to succeed, too \nsmall to survive--not too big to fail.\n  But there is good news here, and there is a bipartisan solution in \nthe works. I am very thankful and grateful to Senator Dodd, who has \nagreed to work with me to fix the problem. We both want to protect \nthese small business startups that are vital to job creation across the \ncountry. I think we are close to an agreement to fix this, and we hope \nto have a bipartisan amendment soon. I urge all my colleagues to take a \nlook at it and to join us in supporting it.\n  Next and finally for today, one of the biggest problems in the bill--\nwhich I believe will undoubtedly hurt ordinary Americans who had no \nrole in causing the financial crisis--is the creation of the so-called \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB. Those initials could, in \nthe future, scare people more than all the combined deadly 10 acronyms, \nincluding the IRS, EPA, and SEC. This new massive supergovernment \nbureaucracy would have unprecedented authority to impose expensive \nmandates on any entities that extend credit. We are not talking about \nGoldman Sachs or big Wall Street banks. Instead, this new \nsuperbureaucracy could hit hard the community banker, farm lender, \nlocal dentist or auto dealer. The pain on Main Street will not just be \nborne by small business, but the costs will be passed on to consumers, \nthe ordinary Americans the bill seeks to protect. It might even cost \nthem their jobs.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business, a strong voice for \nsmall business, stated their concern clearly when they said:\n\n       These small businesses had nothing to do with the Wall \n     Street meltdown and should not be faced with onerous, new, \n     and duplicative regulations because of a problem they did not \n     cause. Further, as the most recent NFIB Small Business \n     Economic Trends survey shows, small businesses continue to \n     struggle with lost sales, and such regulations could make \n     these problems worse, stifling any potential small business \n     recovery.\n\n  That is why I have joined with Senators McConnell, Shelby, Gregg, and \nothers on an amendment to fix the problem. Instead of creating a \nbrandnew superbureaucracy with unlimited authority and reach, our \namendment would empower the FDIC to look out for consumers. This makes \nsense. The FDIC is the one that has a strong record of providing \nconsumer protections. It has a record of being able to deal with \nfinancial institutions. It deals with the financial institutions that \nget into problems. It is in the banks. Any institution that is \nregulated by the FDIC, they are in there looking over their shoulder.\n  Our amendment would create a division of consumer financial \nprotection within the FDIC so they can protect consumers without adding \nburdensome and duplicative regulations. It would avoid costs being \npassed on to consumers, the very folks we are trying to protect, not \nsaddle them with new costs. The amendment will ensure that the consumer \nprotection division focuses on the real problems currently operating \nunder the radar--the shadow banking I call it--or, as I like to say, \nthe clicks, not the bricks. These are the people who have preyed on \nvulnerable Americans.\n  Before the financial crisis that was brought on by bad loans, \nespecially too-good-to-be-true home loans pushed on families who could \nnot afford the loans, my fax and inbox were cluttered, despite my best \nspam filters, with 1 percent or no down payment loan offers. These \noffers were not regulated effectively by State regulators, the SEC, the \nFederal Reserve or the OCC. They succeeded in escaping effective \nregulation entirely, although some have later fallen to regulation by \nU.S. attorneys who filed criminal fraud suits a little bit too late in \nthe game.\n  Also, it is important this new division be tasked with providing \nfinancial literacy, as I will continue to stress. We have to improve \nconsumer education in any and all areas where loans are made. While \nforeclosure counseling is important--another bipartisan program on \nwhich I worked with Senator Dodd in December of 2007 and in which we \nput $180 million to reach out to financial counseling groups. They are \ndoing a good job trying to help counsel families in danger of losing \ntheir home and ways to solve the problem. Those counselors came back to \nus unanimously and pleaded with us to make available preloan counseling \nbefore somebody buys a home, to make sure they understand the terms and \ncan afford to service the loans.\n  These are just some of the things we need to do.\n  Missourians and people across America are angry. They are angry bad \nactors caused the financial crisis that left many of them with a pink \nslip instead of a paycheck. They are angry Wall Street bad actors left \nthem with a nightmare of foreclosure instead of the American dream of \nhome ownership. They are angry government has committed trillions of \ntaxpayer dollars for rescuing the financial industry when so many of \nthem are still struggling to pay bills. Is it any surprise that \nMissourians and Americans across the country are skeptical about \nfinancial reform?\n  These folks were made more skeptical when they heard and saw on TV \nand read in the paper that it is the actors on Wall Street, with whom \nthe bill\n\n[[Page S3318]]\n\nwas supposed to deal and who caused the financial crisis, who are now \ncheerleading this bill. Missourians ask me how this bill can be real \nreform when the head of the investment bank Goldman Sachs, who is \nsupporting the bill, said--let me make sure you understand. This is \nfrom the head of the largest investment bank on Wall Street: ``The \nbiggest beneficiary of reform is Wall Street itself.''\n  That is a quote about the original bill.\n  Missourians have asked me not to pass a bill that will bail out Wall \nStreet. We need to take care of Main Street. There is no bailout for \nstruggling families. We don't want anymore Wall Street bailouts. We \nneed to pass a bill that reforms Wall Street and protects Main Street. \nI believe we have an opportunity to pass real, responsible, and \nbipartisan reform, if Senators of both parties will listen to the \nconcerns raised by ordinary Americans who didn't cause but are paying \nfor the financial crisis.\n  I have heard similar concerns discussed by speakers on the other side \nof the aisle who seem to indicate we share the same concerns. I hope we \ncan work together to get a good, strong reform bill that will deal with \nthe problems that caused the last financial crisis, protect consumers, \nand ensure the safety and soundness of all financial institutions and \nnot subject them to special interests who may have pushed for the bad \nloans that caused the last crisis.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the pending business, or the \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 3826, offered by Senator Shelby, \nis the pending business.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to take some time to speak out \nagainst the Shelby amendment and urge that it be defeated. If that is \nappropriate at this time, I will use as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a pivotal point in the debate on \nWall Street reform. We never want to see what happened to this country \nhappen again, where they essentially crashed the stock market. People \nhad been talked into very difficult to understand and exotic subprime \nmortgages. We had such greed running rampant on Wall Street, and \ninstruments were created that were even difficult for the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to explain--derivatives that were so complex they were in \nabout the third order.\n  If we were to adopt the Shelby amendment, we would weaken this bill. \nAs a matter of fact, we will weaken current law, and not only will \nconsumers be hurt but they will actually lose ground--when the purpose \nof the Dodd bill--our bill--is to elevate consumers, give them \nprotection from these kinds of schemes that brought our economy to its \nknees and resulted in 700,000 jobs a month being lost then, and the \nwealth of the average American, who had even a 401(k), was down 20, 30, \n40, and maybe 50 percent and, as a result of that, the lack of consumer \nconfidence that followed.\n  We know our economy is based on consumer confidence. Seventy percent \nof our economy is attached to consumer spending. When people see the \nstock market and their wealth going down, and see neighbors losing \ntheir homes and jobs, they feel threatened and they pull back, and \nrightly so. It started from deregulation on steroids on Wall Street, \nwhere the regulators didn't even use the powers they had to protect \nconsumers. An essential part of this bill is putting a cop on the beat \nfor consumers, finally. So whether you are a consumer of credit cards, \nor a consumer in terms of the housing market, or a consumer in terms of \nthe stock market or the commodities market, you are finally going to \nhave a watchdog.\n  We know the regulators didn't care about consumers. We know that. We \nknow, for example, that the Fed had the authority to intervene in the \nhousing market, if they felt these subprime loans were wrong, and stop \nthem. They didn't do it. We know the SEC was warned about Madoff. There \nwere whistleblowers to that Ponzi scheme, and many more Ponzi schemes \nwere going on. They didn't even follow the lead.\n  We need to have a strong, independent consumer agency that says to \nthe regulators: You are not doing your job. We are going to make sure \nyou do it.\n  That is what is in the bill before us. But the Shelby amendment takes \nus back. The new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will enforce \nexisting consumer protection laws--those same laws that went unenforced \nby current regulators. I gave you the example of the SEC and the Ponzi \nschemes, and of the Fed overlooking the mortgage crisis, and there are \nmany others. It would also ensure clear disclosure to consumers of all \nthe terms and conditions of the financial products they buy.\n  Believe me, you would have to have a degree in economics and finance \nand everything else to understand some of the fine print in a credit \ncard bill. People are stunned to know they are paying 20, 30-percent \ninterest rates on their credit cards, because there is no clear way of \nknowing.\n  In this bill, that is over. You have to know the terms and conditions \nof the financial products you buy. This bill will bring protections to \nhome buyers from the kinds of exotic mortgages that led to the current \ncrisis.\n  Let me give you an example. People were offered mortgages at a teaser \nrate--a very low rate--and were not being told in clear terms that in a \ncouple of years that teaser rate would go up and go up and go up.\n  I have to say, some in the mortgage business were paid more \ncommissions to put unsuspecting consumers into these exotic mortgages. \nSo they pushed those mortgages. That is wrong. We need a consumer \nprotection agency that notes it is wrong and puts a stop to it.\n  We have a situation that weakens the current law. If you think that \nis right, if you think, for example, that consumers caused the Wall \nStreet meltdown--I think you are living on another planet--vote for \nthis amendment. We know who caused this crisis. We know the greed on \nWall Street. We know even while these companies were getting bailed \nout, they were paying their people huge bonuses. The word \n``outrageous'' really can be defined by what these people did.\n  If my colleagues want more of the same--I cannot understand why they \nwould--but if they want more of the same, if they do not want to \nstrengthen consumer protection, then vote for the Shelby amendment.\n  Let's be clear. This amendment is a gutting amendment. Instead of \ncreating an independent consumer watchdog, the Shelby amendment creates \na weak sister, a weak division of the consumer protection in the FDIC. \nThis new idea of Senator Shelby's, this new division of consumer \nprotection, would no longer be independent. It would be under the FDIC. \nIt would not have any authority to adopt any rule without the approval \nof the same bank regulators who have routinely ignored or opposed the \nneeds of consumers.\n  Let me repeat that. The weak consumer protection agency created in \nthe Shelby amendment would have no authority to adopt any rule without \nthe approval of the same bank regulators who have routinely ignored or \nopposed the needs of consumers. It even would give bank regulators a \nveto over consumer protection regulations. That is totally \nunacceptable.\n  If my colleagues are for Wall Street reform, they have to vote no on \nthe Shelby amendment. This is the moment of truth. Either my colleagues \nare going to stand with the people of this country who are innocent \nvictims of greed on Wall Street or they are not. If they want to stand \nfor the greed on Wall Street, if they want to stand for no protection \nfor consumers, a weakening of the protections they already have, which \nare far too weak, vote for this amendment, and let's go forward with a \nDodd bill which has a strong independent consumer protection agency.\n  I would add that the Shelby amendment would burden the new consumer \nprotection division that he has in his amendment with incredible \nprocedural hurdles--hurdles that have effectively\n\n[[Page S3319]]\n\nprevented the FTC, that has similar rules, from writing any new rules \nprotecting consumers since 1984.\n  Mr. President, 1984 was an interesting year for me. It was a long \ntime ago. I was a lot younger. It was before my hair turned blond. In \nthat year, I was in the House of Representatives, and I was pushing the \nFederal Trade Commission to help consumers. They had too many hurdles. \nThey have not done anything in all those years. Yet this is the \ntemplate that Senator Shelby is using for this watered-down consumer \nprotection division.\n  I see Senator Merkley on the floor, and I am going to yield in a \nminute. He is such a leader on all these issues and such a great \npopulist leader in this Senate.\n  Maybe my colleagues who support this amendment think the regulators \nwho allowed all of these abuses to happen under their watch, despite \nrepeated warnings, did a fine job and are the best protectors of \nconsumers.\n  But even if those regulators have somehow had a change of heart and \nare determined to change their ways, this amendment would leave them \nwith even fewer powers to protect consumers than exist under the \ncurrent system..\n  The Shelby amendment would burden the new Consumer Protection \nDivision with the same incredible procedural hurdles that face the \nFederal Trade Commission--hurdles that have effectively prevented the \nFTC from writing any rules in the consumer finance area since 1984.\n  In addition, the amendment would actually prohibit the proposed \nconsumer division from doing any rulewriting under the FTC Act for \npayday lenders, debt collectors, foreclosure scam operators, mortgage \nbrokers and other nonbank consumer finance companies.\n  If the new division did somehow manage to get new rules written, the \namendment would make sure that they could not be enforced.\n  Under this amendment, the new weakened consumer division could do \nexaminations of some finance companies only after consumers have been \nharmed repeatedly.\n  This after-the-fact authority closes the barn door after the horse is \nout, and handcuffs regulators from protecting consumers until the harm \nis already done.\n  Some of my colleagues want us to believe that the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau that we have proposed in our Wall Street reform bill \nwould harm small businesses.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Merchants, retailers, and sellers of nonfinancial goods are \nspecifically excluded from the oversight of our proposed new Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau.\n  This includes retailers who provide ordinary credit to their \ncustomers to buy their goods.\n  Even for small businesses that do sell financial products--including \ncommunity banks and all kinds of small lenders--the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau will have no direct enforcement authority. \nEnforcement of rules will be handled by the current regulator or State \nattorneys general.\n  I will give one more example I think is very important. I told you \nthe template for Senator Shelby's new consumer protection agency is the \nFTC. I told you under those rules, the FTC has not done anything since \n1984. Let's say they were able to get new rules written. Let's say they \nwere able to do that. Senator Shelby ensures that the rules they write \ncould never be enforced.\n  How does he do that? Because he says the only time the weakened \nconsumer division could do any examinations of some financial companies \nwould be after consumers have been harmed repeatedly. This is after-\nthe-fact authority. I have seen too many people crying because of what \nhappened on Wall Street. I have seen too many people crying because \nthey lost their jobs because of what happened on Wall Street. I have \nseen pictures in the paper of Americans crying because of what Bernie \nMadoff did to them and their children.\n  I want this stopped. I do not want it stopped after the fact. Yes, \nthank goodness Bernie Madoff is in prison where he belongs. But it is \nvery difficult to make the people whole who were harmed by that Ponzi \nscheme.\n  We do not want after-the-fact authority; we want before-the-fact \nauthority. We want this consumer protection agency to be on its toes, \nto intervene, to see if there is a scam going on; to see if there is a \ncredit card scam that leads to 30, 40, 50 percent interest rates; to \nsee if there is a scam on mortgages where people unknowingly walk into \na mortgage where the rate goes up to 12 percent.\n  At the end of the day, we know consumers were hurt hard by Ponzi \nschemes, by markets in the dark, confusing mortgage options, some \nbordering on fraud by credit card scams and worse.\n  Let's take a stand in a bipartisan way and vote no on this amendment \nand support the consumer protection agency, the strong one that is in \nthis bill. I can tell my colleagues, if we do that, the American people \ncan take a deep breath and know that they will be protected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I applaud my colleague from California \nwho has been an extraordinary champion of consumers throughout her \ncareer. She understands that the basis of a successful nation is \nsuccessful families. That depends on them having a strong financial \nfoundation. We should not measure the success of our country by the \nmillion-dollar bonuses or the billion-dollar quarterly profits on Wall \nStreet. We should measure it by the success of our families.\n  This bill is absolutely essential to restoring those financial \nfoundations; whereas this amendment before us does the opposite. The \nShelby amendment No. 3826 carves the heart out of this bill. This dog \ndon't hunt. In fact, this dog doesn't bite. I don't even think this dog \nbarks. For that matter, I am not so sure it is a dog. That is how bad \nthe Shelby amendment is.\n  The background is this: Predatory mortgages and securitization of \nthose mortgages on Wall Street built a house-of-cards economy that came \nfalling down last year. The predatory mortgages were done at the retail \nlevel, but the securitization and selling of those packages occurred on \nWall Street. They built investments that were taken in by every major \nfinancial house practically in the world, and those investments, those \nsecurities had a 2-year fuse on them, essentially a 2-year teaser rate \non every underlying mortgage.\n  At the end of the 2 years, interest rates doubled, families could not \nmake the payments, securities went bad, and we had financial firms one \nafter another collapse. We had Lehman collapsing. We had Bear Stearns \ncollapsing. We had Merrill Lynch collapsing. We had major problems at \nBank of America needing a bailout, a $4 billion TARP bailout. We had \nCitibank collapsing. We had Washington Mutual collapsing--all built on \npredatory mortgage practices, every single piece. That is why consumer \nprotection is so important. That is why it is at the very heart of this \nbill. And that is why we need a Federal consumer protection agency.\n  I have friends back in Oregon who write to me, citizens back in \nOregon, constituents who will say: Here is what went on, and how can \nthat be fair? Let me just give an example.\n  A woman from Salem wrote to me and said: I always pay my credit card \non time, always have for years and years. But I got my credit card \nstatement, and it had a late fee. So I called up the credit card \ncompany, and I said: How is it possible? I always mail my payment on \nthis day. It should have had plenty of time to get there.\n  The credit card company said: Yes, as a matter of fact, your payment \ndid come on time. But you know, Madam, we are not required to post your \npayment on the day we receive it. In fact, in the contract we have, we \ncan sit on your payment for 10 days and then post it, and then your \npayment is late and we get to charge you this fee. We are just \nfollowing the rules.\n  She said: How can that be fair?\n  It is not fair. Everyone knows it is not fair. Let me give another \nexample.\n  Citizens wrote saying: Hey, I had a whole series of transactions with \nmy bank, and then the bank changed the order of those transactions to \nput the biggest transaction first. It so happened that biggest \ntransaction made\n\n[[Page S3320]]\n\nme $10 over the funds I had in the bank. I had an overdraft. By putting \nthat big transaction first, it meant instead of one overdraft fee, I \nhave 10 overdraft fees. Instead of only $35 for one overdraft, I owe \n$350 for an overdraft series. How can it be fair that the order of the \ntransactions was changed in order to multiply the fees I owe tenfold?\n  Everyone knows that is not fair. Everyone knows it. We simply need to \nhave an agency that is able to say that is not OK. We do not want to \nhave a process where something that is unfair goes on for 10 years or \n15 years or 20 years before there is legislation to address it.\n  You cannot address a consumer product's choking hazard by doing it in \nlegislation. You have to empower an agency to say: No, that part is too \nsmall. You cannot address lead paint by doing legislation every time \nsomething is painted. No, you have to have an agency that says they \nwill test that paint and say lead paint is not OK.\n  It is the same with consumer financial products. We need the same \npower to fix traps and tricks in real time for fairness to America's \nfamilies so they can rebuild their financial foundations because that \nis what a strong country is, families with strong financial \nfoundations, not million-dollar bonuses, not billion-dollar quarterly \nprofits based on stripping funds from working Americans. It all comes \ndown to the heart of it: fairness in consumer financial documents.\n  Let's take a look at amendment No. 3826 and why it carves the heart \nout of this important bill for America's families, America's Main \nStreet families and businesses.\n  Here is what it does: First, it says virtually no one is covered. \nLet's look at the list. What is covered under the language of the \namendment are large nonbank mortgage originators. Large nonbank \nmortgage originators do not exist anymore. So it covers firms that do \nnot exist anymore. It is kind of like saying we are going to have the \nregulation of safety on cars, but it is only for cars that are powered \nby gasoline and were built before 1850. No such cars exist. All the \nother cars, the ones actually on the road, we are not going to cover \nthem.\n  We have a list. We have commercial banks, not covered; investment \nbanks, not covered; credit card companies, not covered; car lenders, \nnot covered; payday lenders, not covered; nonbanks that sell financial \nproducts of a whole sort, not covered.\n  I think you get the picture that this amendment is meant to make sure \nnothing is covered. Then, just in case there is some little piece that \ndoes get covered, it says: You know what. This agency is not \nindependent. It cannot write rules. It has to have everything it does \napproved by the financial world--the financial world that brought us \nall these problems, that brought us to tricks and traps, that stripped \nwealth from working Americans. They are going to decide what is \ncovered.\n  I echo my constituent from Salem and say: Where is the fairness in \nthat?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Certainly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me ask the Senator: As I understand the amendment of \nthe Republican Senator, it goes back to the old days when there was \nvirtually no consumer financial protection. The bill we have before us \nhere--that Senator Dodd and the Banking Committee brought forward--has \nthe strongest consumer financial protection law in the history of the \nUnited States. It has an agency with independent authority to protect \nAmericans, but more importantly to empower Americans to make the right \ndecisions when they are taking out a mortgage, a loan for a car, a home \nloan or a student loan. What the Republicans are suggesting in the \nShelby amendment is to go back to the old days when there was no \nprotection, there was no authority.\n  The argument is made about the fact that when it comes to mortgages, \nthey weren't the problem, the problems were with Wall Street. But at \nthe heart of the issue on Wall Street was the mortgage being signed by \nthe family in Springfield, IL, and Portland, OR. So I ask the Senator: \nIn your State, in your experience, as you look at this, if the \nRepublicans have their way and move us back to the old days when it \ncomes to this consumer empowerment, consumer protection, don't we run \nthe risk of falling into another economic crisis, losing millions more \njobs across America? Isn't that the risk we run if we go the route \nsuggested by the Republican amendment?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. My colleague is absolutely right. Because predatory \nmortgage practices were at the heart of this crisis that led to \nsecurities that blew up the economy and led to the loss of millions of \njobs around our Nation, with an unemployment rate in my State that has \nbeen over 12 percent. We not only have the risk of going back there, we \nare perhaps more at risk because we have fewer larger banks. Many \ninvestment houses that were independent are now inside those banks, in \na position where, if they blow up, they will blow up the banks as well.\n  So unless we have this strong consumer financial protection agency, \nit is like taking this bill before us and sticking it in the shredder, \nand with it shredding the hopes and aspirations of America's working \nfamilies to build strong finances in the future.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for another question.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not true that last week, on three different \noccasions, the Republicans filibustered this bill to stop us from even \nstarting the debate on this bill, and it was only when we reached the \npoint after the Goldman Sachs hearing--when there was this embarrassing \ntestimony from executives, telling America what they were up to, and it \nall became very public--that the Republicans finally backed off their \nfilibuster, backed off their delay of this legislation and let us come \nforward to debate; and that now, one of the first amendments they offer \nis to weaken this bill so the financial institutions and the banks are \ngoing to have more power over the economy, more power over consumers \nthan this bill provides?\n  Isn't that the real history of how we got to this moment in this \ndebate?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. My friend and colleague is absolutely correct; that, \nindeed, my colleagues across the aisle, the Republicans, voted three \ntimes to say they did not want to proceed to the bill, where their \nideas would bear public scrutiny. Instead, they wanted to talk behind \nclosed doors. You know what they were looking to do was not to \nstrengthen this bill.\n  Now that the amendment has come out and been placed before us \npublicly, we do see that it does what we feared. It is designed to take \na knife and carve the heart out of this financial reform.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would ask the Senator from Oregon if he would yield for \none last question.\n  Now that we have been through this experience where we have lost $17 \ntrillion in American value in this economy--$17 trillion accounted for \nin the savings accounts of ordinary Americans in Illinois and Oregon, \n$17 trillion in businesses that failed and jobs that were lost--isn't \nit critically important that this bill from the Senate Banking \nCommittee move forward, and that each amendment take this strong bill \nand make it stronger, instead of the Republican amendments, which \nclearly are designed to weaken this amendment and to open us up to the \nvulnerability of facing more job loss and more economic crisis?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Well, my colleague is absolutely correct. The failure of \nfinancial rules has become so obvious and had such devastating impact \nfor our families--as my colleague put it, $17 trillion worth of damage. \nThat means families lost their retirements, families lost their savings \nfor their children to go to college, and it means families have houses \nunder water, if they are lucky. For many families, it means the loss of \na job, the loss of income, and the inability to make those mortgage \npayments, which means they are in foreclosure and have lost their dream \nat every single level. That is the damage $17 trillion did to our \nfamilies, and that is why every amendment to the bill we have before us \nshould seek to say: Here is the bill and here is how we should make it \nstronger.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague would yield quickly, I appreciate everyone \nwanting to make my bill stronger. We have a pretty good bill here, but \nevery\n\n[[Page S3321]]\n\nbill could use a little improvement, I admit.\n  I want to compliment the Senator from Oregon, a member of the Banking \nCommittee. He has been a very valued member of the committee. I \nmentioned earlier--I say to the majority whip--in the committee \nmeetings we have had, it is by seniority, and so I have this cluster of \nnew members down at the end of that committee table. The Senator from \nIllinois and I have been in that position at those tables over the \nyears. But Senator Tester, Senator Merkley, and Senator Bennet kind of \noccupy those last three seats on the Banking Committee.\n  I say that with great respect to all the rest around the committee. \nThose three new members on the committee have added tremendous value to \nour debates, and in particular, the Senator from Oregon has been \nwonderful in his concern about mortgages, prepayment penalties, what \nhas happened to the 7 million foreclosures in our country, the 8\\1/2\\ \nmillion jobs that got lost in our Nation, why we need to address this \nissue, and why it is so critically important.\n  I want to make one more point about this Shelby amendment that may be \nlost on our colleagues, and that is in our bill there is no assessment \non a nonbank or a bank, but there are assessments in this amendment. We \njust went through the Tester-Hutchison amendment to actually lower the \nassessments on community banks. What a great irony that the next \namendment--there will be those having supported the earlier amendment \nto reduce cost--sets assessments. In fact, it asks community banks to \nhave assessments on the nonbanks out there in order to pay for their \nconsumer bureau within the FDIC.\n  So for those who are concerned about the burdens on community banks--\nand I think it is a legitimate concern, one I think the Hutchison-\nTester amendment did a great deal to alleviate--we are going to turn \nright around on these institutions that are struggling to stay alive to \nserve their communities and add a financial burden to them. So for all \nthose reasons the Senator from Oregon mentioned, plus that one, the \nShelby amendment deserves to be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to point out that you have just seen \nan example of why there isn't bipartisanship in this Chamber. You \ncannot denigrate the other party and denigrate every single thing they \nput up as an amendment and suggest there is going to be bipartisanship. \nThe amendment that is before you is an attempt to correct some of the \nthings that are in the bill.\n  The filibuster was mentioned. Well, the filibuster bought enough time \nthat Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby were able to work out the \nagreement for the amendment that has passed--a major amendment, a major \nchange, a wanted change, an expected change, and a change that makes \nthe bill far better. If every amendment the Republicans bring up is \ngoing to get the kind of treatment this amendment is getting and not \nlooking for that piece in there that might make a difference, we are \nnot going to have much success on this bill.\n  I heard the other side mention Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs said they \nlike this bill; one of the offenders, and they like it. That encourages \nme that it is a good bill.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Oregon giving the examples of some \nthings that are terrible in our economy--some of the credit card \nexamples he gave. It absolutely shouldn't happen in America. I don't \nthink this bill fixes it, and I will explain that in a few minutes.\n  If our amendment is too open-ended, the Democratic amendment raises \nthe possibility of controlling every single thing for middle America--\nevery single thing--and I will explain how that works. I don't think it \nwas what was intended, and that is why we go through an amendment \nprocess, to clear up problems such as that.\n  But I am going to talk today about consumer financial protection. I \nwant to be clear when I speak about this protection that I am talking \nabout protecting consumers from bad actors. I am talking about \neducating consumers. When I talk about consumer protection, I am not \nseparating consumer protection from the health of the economy. I rise \ntoday to talk about what is flawed in title X--called the Consumer \nProtection Title--of the financial reform bill, and to raise awareness \nabout an alternative to the current language in title X.\n  I believe an alternative to this section is desperately needed \nbecause the Federal Government should not be involved in our daily \nlives and everyday decisions. Under the proposed consumer protection \ntitle, we would be opening the floodgates of government involvement. \nThe Federal Government could be telling us how we can spend our money, \nhow we save for the future by making decisions for us, and could truly \nlimit financial markets to the point of economic decline. The Federal \nGovernment should not operate with the belief that it is protecting us \nfrom ourselves. However, that is where title X language begins to work.\n  From supporters of this bill, we have heard that in order for \nconsumer protection to be truly effective it needs its own independent \nagency--or bureau now--and that this Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau should be free from outside influence. Independence from outside \ninfluence is a fine goal, but our government was built on using a \nsystem of checks and balances and this bureau would be totally \nunchecked. It would have unprecedented power and authority to write its \nown rules--no review. It would have an uncontested budget--no \nappropriation. And decisions made by the bureau would be made without \nregard to the impact those rules would have on the health of our \neconomy. Where is the transparency in this power? Where is the \naccountability of this proposal? I haven't even touched on what the \ntitle could do to consumers' personal information or financial \ndecisions.\n  To achieve independence, this bureau would consolidate all financial \nprotections and efforts from the various Federal Government agencies, \nall in the name of better protecting consumers. Don't get me wrong, \nthere are issues needing to be addressed for consumer protection. But \nright now, each Federal agency acts as a check on its neighbor when it \ncomes to consumer protection. My fear is that once this bureau has \nconsolidated power, it will not stop at protecting consumers from fraud \nor deceptive practices. This agency would only be getting started.\n  I am deeply troubled about the creation of this bureau because it \nwould place the bureau within the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve. \nToo many of my constituents already believe the Federal Reserve gaining \nadditional power is an alarming thought. However, what is most alarming \nto me is the fact the Federal Reserve would have little authority over \nthis proposed bureau. Mostly, they provide the money.\n  Right now, as this bill is written, the Federal Reserve would be \nrequired--required--to give the bureau a designated 12 percent of their \noperating budget. The catch here is that Congress would have no \nbudgetary authority and would not approve this money. And it is \nadjusted for inflation. If you are going to get a percentage of a \nbudget, how do you adjust a percent for inflation? But aside from that, \nit is adjusted for inflation. It works up to be 12 percent of the \noperating budget of the Federal Reserve.\n  In addition, they can even invest any of the money they do not spend. \nYou will find that on page 1,073. I know it is a huge book, so I didn't \nwant you to have to look through the whole thing. On page 1,074, it \neven says these aren't government funds. You know why. That way it \ndoesn't cost under the scoring. Even though it will drive up the \ndeficit and the debt, it doesn't count that way. It looks like a free \nprogram, but that is not true. So they get to keep the money and invest \nwhat they do not spend--I don't know of another entity that gets that \nright--and it is not considered to be government funds. That provides a \nlittle latitude.\n  The bureau not only has an uncontested budget, but the bureau would \nbe the single most powerful agency in the Federal Government. Not only \ncould the bureau write their own rules for our States' businesses and \nlocal banks to follow, it would oversee consumer decisions, and the \nbureau would be the enforcer of their own rules. No other agency has \nthat kind of unchecked power. Where is the accountability in this? \nUnchecked power\n\n[[Page S3322]]\n\ndoesn't lend itself to accountability either.\n  What is important is for the public, for the average American, to \nknow this bill could protect people. But it could also go potentially \n10 steps further and take some of their decisionmaking power and \ntransfer it to the Federal Government. We don't do that in America.\n  For example, as the bill stands, it is so overreaching and ambiguous \nin areas that it could impact everyday purchases for most Americans. \nHow would they do that? Under the rules they write that nobody takes a \nlook at. There is nothing to hold this bureau in check.\n  Here is how the bureau would regulate consumer financial products or \nservices, as well as service providers, sweeping thousands of already \nregulated small businesses into the bureau's purview. Then you add in \nsection 1027 of the bill, and it could penalize anyone who buys or \nsells something on an installment plan or it could affect any local \nsmall business that offers some kind of monthly payment on credit. That \nis why we are being flooded right now with people who want to be \nexempted from this bill. They are worried about not being able to \nprovide their service anymore.\n  Have you ever bought a car and paid for it over a few years with a \nfinancing plan from the dealer? Many of us probably have. This bill's \nlanguage is so ambiguous and unclear that it looks like people who want \nto pay for a service on an installment plan or those who offer those \nplans will be penalized and regulated by the new consumer protection \nagency--I should say consumer protection superagency. Nobody has ever \nhad this kind of power.\n  Small business owners, regular people off the streets and from our \nStates have been streaming into the congressional offices, looking for \nthese exemptions that I just talked about because of this title in this \nbill. As drafted, this title is so ambiguous, so far-reaching, that \nconsumers and good actors are being swept up with the bad.\n  Anyone who ever paid for dental care in installments could, in the \nnear future, be facing the prospect of paying for dental work upfront, \nas dentists realize they cannot afford to keep up with the new \nregulations, additional regulators or the cost of compliance with the \nbureau's demands.\n  For auto dealers, where financing is hardest to come by in rural \ntowns in small America, this would, in fact, be a direct hit on their \nbusiness. Right now the financial burdens of the bureau would also be \nborne by auto dealers that direct clients to available financing but \ndon't originate or authorize car loans themselves. That is pretty far-\nreaching.\n  Additionally, though, if a consumer purchases something on an \ninstallment plan, whether the loan is for a bike, a minivan, braces, an \nengagement ring, livestock or a home, if there are more than four \ninstallments, the government, through the bureau, would have a say in \napproving that loan.\n  The bureau, also in the name of protecting us from ourselves, would \nrequire banks to keep and maintain records of all bank account activity \nand financial activity of their clients for at least 3 years, while \nalso requiring this information be sent regularly to the bureau for \nsafekeeping. I have serious concerns about our Government collecting \ninformation on the daily activities of our citizens and equal concerns \nabout the Government approving or disapproving the financial choices of \nits citizens.\n  I have just outlined why the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is \nbad for consumers, why it is bad for small businesses and our \ncommunities, and why it is bad for individual consumer choices and \nfreedoms. I point out all these things to you because there is an \nalternative to this bureau that is being proposed by my colleagues from \nKentucky, Alabama, and Tennessee. This alternative proposal addresses \neach of the concerns I have just raised about accountability, \noversight, consumer protections, consumer education, and consumer \nrights. This new proposal keeps our current regulatory infrastructure \nintact and improves on it. This alternative would not scramble all our \ncurrent regulators in the name of a change, but, instead, has carefully \nand thoughtfully made our current system better, creating more \neffective checks and balances. The consumer protection alternative \ntitle would create a consumer protection division to be housed within \nthe FDIC.\n  The FDIC already oversees consumer deposit protection, so it is a \nlogical step to place consumer protection interests here. While the new \nconsumer protection division is shielded from outside influence and has \nautonomy, the division is, at the same time, prevented from wielding \nabsolute power like the bureau. When rule changes or actions are \nproposed, the FDIC Board would be better able to use their regulatory \nexperience to protect consumers, while at the same time ensuring safety \nand soundness are not disregarded.\n  This division would still have a Presidentially appointed and Senate \nconfirmed Director who serves a 4-year term in office. Instead of \nneedlessly looping all kinds of small businesses into the fold for \nadditional regulation, the division's mission would be of a proactive \nconsumer education, ensuring consumers are able to receive timely and \nunderstandable information on consumer financial products. The division \nwould partner with other agencies, such as the Federal Trade \nCommission, to develop guidelines for market oversight. Through these \ntypes of partnerships, the division would pursue fraudsters and the bad \nactors in our market. They would be developing best practices for \noverseeing nondepository mortgage originators and addressing the risk-\nbased supervision of our nondepository institutions.\n  Very importantly, this new alternative leaves current prudent \nregulators in place for banks, savings associations, and credit unions. \nWhile the division would watch over the large institutions that have \nalready violated consumer protection statutes, this alternative would \nprovide an infrastructure with regulatory experience that would also \nmeet the demands of growing consumer financial protection concerns. \nThis proposal creates a balance between past regulating experience and \nthe call by consumers to have more protection, without losing the \nrights to make personal financial decisions.\n  I am a cosponsor of the title X alternative because I believe in its \nability to address consumer protection without regulating consumers out \nof their rights as citizens. I am a cosponsor because I believe this \nalternative regulates the bad actors without tossing small business \ninto the mix and regulating them out of business.\n  It doesn't form a new agency that has to go through a whole \nrulemaking process over a period of time before we even know what they \nare doing.\n  Putting this bureau under the Federal Reserve, with all the concerns \nand pressures focused on the Fed right now, is a very bad idea. Moving \nconsumer protection to an unregulated, nontransparent, not accountable \nnew agency that can write its own rules without review and operate \nusing unchecked money is beyond my comprehension, and I think it is \nbeyond the comprehension of the American people when they find out \nabout it. I am not sure they are aware of it or I think there would be \na huge hue and cry across this country. People are more concerned over \ntheir freedoms right now than they ever have been, and this will take \naway freedoms. You have to have the freedom to make your choices and \neven to make bad choices. But in America that is the way it works and \nBig Brother is not allowed to hang over your shoulder and decide for \nyou whether you are making a good decision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I could not have said better what my \nfriend and colleague from Wyoming just talked about in terms of this \nconsumer protection bill. Every Member of this body is in favor of \nconsumer protection. The goal is to get it right, not to do too much \nand not to do too little.\n  I think it is important for us to remember what we are trying to \naddress. We are trying to address the financial market meltdown that \nhappened in 2008 and the ramifications that have been so devastating to \nthis economy. They were very devastating in my home State of Florida. \nBut what we should do is address the problem. What we should do is try \nto make sure the\n\n[[Page S3323]]\n\nproblem does not happen again and not use this crisis as an opportunity \nto create a huge, new, all-powerful bureau of government that is going \nto regulate orthodontists and folks who had nothing to do with this \nfinancial crisis.\n  Let's think back about what happened. To me there are three or four \nparts of this story where you can find culpability, places where we \nshould be regulating, some of which is not done in this bill. One is we \nknow mortgages were given to people who should not have had mortgages--\npeople who had no income and no jobs. They called them ninja loans--no \nincome, no jobs. There were a lot of them in my State of Florida. Why \nwere they written? Many of them were written because they were written \nby mortgage brokers and banks that did not have to retain any of those \nmortgages on their books. There were no underwriting standards. They \ncould just ship them off. They had no skin in the game and no \nresponsibility.\n  Then, on Wall Street, this huge market was created to suck in all \nthese mortgages, to create these new investment vehicles that put all \nthese mortgages together--mortgages that did not have the underwriting \nstandards so you could make sure they were sound. In the need to create \nmore and more investment instruments, they created what are called \nsynthetic investment entities. Those are not even ones that held these \nactual mortgages. They were just merely a shadow that tracked them. So \nwe compounded the problem into hundreds of trillions of dollars, \nbetting on mortgages that should never, in many ways, have been written \nin the first place.\n  Then, what was the third part of the problem? These mortgages got \nbundled into these mortgage-backed securities, sold on Wall Street, and \nthe world looked to the rating agencies to stamp their approval on \nthem. The Morningstars and the Moody's and the Fitches and the S's \nstamped their rating and said they are AAA, without understanding them, \nwithout evaluating them. That is another one of the culprits that \ncaused this financial crash that we had that has devastated our \neconomy. But for those rating agencies putting the AAA grade on these \nmortgage-backed security investments, I don't believe we would have had \nthe crash that occurred. People would not have placed their confidence \nin them.\n  Why did that happen? Why did these rating agencies stamp them? Why \ndid so many people rely upon them? What we come to find out is these \nrating agencies are written into law. They are written into the Federal \nlaw as the way to determine the creditworthiness of investments. The \nFDIC abdicates its authority and allows rating agencies to be the ones \nthat say something is a good investment or not. That is in the law.\n  How do these rating agencies get paid? They get paid by the very \nbanks that put products in front of them for them to rate. So here is a \nreal easy way to understand this. We all buy Consumer Reports Magazine. \nConsumer Reports Magazine evaluates everything from toasters to \nToyotas, but they don't take any money from the people they rate. They \ndon't have advertisers. But for these rating agencies, they are paid by \nthe people they rate, by the products these banks bring in front of \nthem. Our law says they are the ones that are going to determine \nwhether something is creditworthy.\n  I wish to make sure we have, as Senator Shelby has put forward, a \ngood consumer protection law in this country. But I also wish to make \nsure we are addressing the problems that caused this failure in the \nfirst place, and one of the ways to do that is to make sure we have \nunderwriting on these mortgages so people have some skin in the game: \nYou are putting a downpayment on your house, you are showing you are \ncreditworthy. That is the way it always was. It is only recently that \nwent away. We need to go back to that.\n  That is why I join my colleagues, Senator Corker, Senator Isakson, \nSenator Gregg, on their amendment to put the underwriting back in the \nmortgage business.\n  But another thing we need to do, we need to take the credit rating \nagencies and write them out of the law. They should no longer get their \npreferential treatment. No longer should the FDIC abdicate its \nresponsibility to determine creditworthiness. The market should take \ncare of this. If people know they can't just rely upon three or four or \nfive rating agencies and they are going to have to do their evaluation \nthemselves, we may prevent this problem from happening in the future \nand the next way this problem may manifest itself.\n  I have filed an amendment, amendment No. 3774, which will do this. It \nwill take these credit rating agencies out of law. In that way, I \nbelieve we can stop one of the reasons why we had this financial \ncollapse. It is not just me who believes in this. On the other side of \nthis building, in the House of Representatives, this same language was \nput forward in the package that was passed.\n  So this should not be a Republican issue, it should not be a \nDemocratic issue because the Democrats in the House supported something \nvery similar to what I am proposing. This just makes common sense. \nLet's go after one of the problems that caused this financial mess.\n  I would like to point to the August 21 edition of the Wall Street \nJournal. In their editorial they say:\n\n       When the government ordains Moody's and Standard and Poor's \n     as official arbiters of risk, the damage can be catastrophic \n     because so many people rely on them.\n\n  Well, let's no longer abdicate the government's responsibility. Let's \nno longer enshrine these rating agencies in Federal law. Let's get rid \nof one of the reasons we had this financial meltdown to start with. \nLet's not create a whole now huge consumer agency that does way too \nmuch, gets involved in too many things that had nothing to do with this \nfinancial meltdown. Let's go after the problem, solve that problem.\n  I believe we can do so by passing the amendment I have introduced \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Florida. He \nhas addressed an issue which is an important part of this debate; that \nis, making sure loans that get made in this country, both on the \nborrower side and the lender side, are responsible loans.\n  I think the amendment he will offer is one on which we ought to have \na debate and on which we ought to have a vote. I hope this body will \nact in a way that leads to more responsible practices, a higher level \nof responsibility, both with borrowers and lenders in this country, \nwhich was at the heart of why we ended up where we did.\n  It is interesting to me that we continue to watch the problems we are \nexperiencing in our economy. Probably by far the most important one is \nthe high level of unemployment. That has become sort of a chronic \nproblem. Even though the economy appears to be recovering and growing \nagain, we still continue to see these very high rates of unemployment, \ncertainly worse in some parts of the country than in others, but, \nnonetheless, something that we cannot tolerate.\n  We ought to be attacking every single day. Everything we do ought to \nbe focused on what we can do to eliminate this high level of \nunemployment, to provide incentives to small businesses to create jobs, \nto grow their businesses and expand, get the economy going again, and, \nobviously, in my view at least, the small businesses in this country \nare the economic engine of our economy. They are our job creators.\n  We ought to be focused on making it easier for them to create jobs \nrather than harder. That is why I think it is ironic that almost \neverything the Congress has been doing of late makes it even more \ndifficult for small businesses to do that.\n  We passed a big, massive expansion of the health care entitlement in \nthe Congress a while back. That is going to impose lots of new taxes, \nlots of new mandates on small businesses. It is going to raise their \ninsurance premiums, which we are seeing now more and more. The CMS \nActuary, with their recent report, suggests what we suggested all \nalong; that is, this is going to drive up the cost of insurance and \nhealth care in this country. It is not going to drive it down, it is \ngoing to drive it up.\n  So I think what we are going to see with small businesses across this \ncountry is not only a higher tax burden associated with paying for \nthat, and also\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\nmany of the new mandates that are associated with it, but you are also \ngoing to see them having to deal now with higher insurance costs that \nwill be associated and come with this massive health care expansion \nthat was passed, not to mention the fact that, in my view, this is \ngoing to end up in a tremendous amount of growth in the debt in the \noutyears when we realize this is going to cost way more than it was \nanticipated, and that many of the offsets or pay-fors are probably not \ngoing to come to fruition.\n  But that being said, it seems to me at least that having all of this \nuncertainty coming out of Washington, whether it is the implementation \nof the new health care bill, whether it is questions about a climate \nchange bill that could impose a crushing new energy tax on our economy, \nquestions about what is going to happen with tax rates with regard to \ndividends and capital gains and marginal income tax rates next year, \nwhat is going to happen with the death tax--all of this uncertainty is \njust hanging a cloud over this economy and making it very difficult for \nour small businesses to do what they do best; that is, to exercise that \nentrepreneurial spirit, to grow the economy, to create jobs.\n  It is very difficult to do that when you pile more and more burdens \nand more and more costs on top of the very small businesses that we are \nhoping will lead us out of this recession. That is why I think in all \nof our efforts we ought to have a very close eye on what impact they \nare going to have on the small business sector of our economy.\n  This is no exception. The debate on financial services reform is \nabout some very critical issues, issues that need to be addressed, \nissues that we should be focused on: how to deal with the issue of \nsystemic risk and make sure that systemically risky enterprises in this \ncountry, that that risk is constrained, that there is appropriate \noversight, there is appropriate transparency.\n  I think there is an important issue to be debated in terms of \nderivatives, which is a $600 trillion economy in this country that has \nbeen operating in the shadows. The legislation that is before us, I \nthink if it is amended the right way--and I hope it will be on the \nSenate floor--will bring all of that into the light. There will be \ntransparency, something that I think is desperately needed in that \narea.\n  I hope this will be done in a way that does not impose new burdens on \nend users, those who are trying to legitimately hedge against higher \ncommodity prices, currency rates, and interests rates and those sorts \nof things. But there is work to be done in this legislation to deal \nwith the issue of systemic risk, to ensure that we take all of the \nsteps we possibly can to avoid and prevent the type of economic \ncollapse and meltdown we witnessed a couple of years ago.\n  I think it is ironic this legislation does not encompass something \nthat was at the very heart of that economic meltdown; that is, the \nissue of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. It is ironic to me, at least, the \nfocus of this legislation is to deal with the issues that lead to the \neconomic malaise that we found ourselves in and the collapse that we \nexperienced a couple of years ago that would attempt to accomplish the \nobjective of preventing that in the future, absent dealing with Freddie \nMac and Fannie Mae, which was a huge contributing factor to what we \nwitnessed a couple of years ago.\n  So it does not include that. It does get at derivatives; it does \naddress, in some fashion, the issue of too big to fail. Then it also \naddresses this issue that we are debating right now, which is the issue \nof consumer protection. I would argue this is an important part of the \ndebate when it comes to the regulation of our financial markets, \nperhaps even the most important part; that is, protecting consumers.\n  Having said that, I think what the recent financial crisis \nhighlighted was the fact that there were a number of bad actors out \nthere in the marketplace who were out for a quick profit, without \nconcern for the consumer, and this consumer protection effort as part \nof this legislation is designed to correct that, or at least address \nand get at that problem.\n  I strongly support some of the consumer protection ideas that have \nbeen put forward. There is a Republican alternative amendment that has \nbeen offered to the base bill. But as is typically the case in the \nCongress, instead of just dealing with the issue that needs to be \nfixed, trying to fix the issue that needs to be fixed, it seems like \nthe pattern is that we try to go beyond that and fix issues that do not \nneed to be fixed; in fact, in this particular case, with a whole new \nbureaucracy, creating the whole new Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau manned with lots of new Federal Government employees with lots \nof new powers, in my view, extending a reach way beyond what should \never have been contemplated to deal with the important issue of \nprotecting consumers in this country.\n  Why do I say that? I had in my office last week a bunch of community \nbankers. I have met with credit unions. I have met with auto dealers. I \nhave met with a lot of small businesses. I would argue these are not \nthe types of entities that led to all of the problems we experienced. \nThose are not systemically risky entities or companies. These are hard-\nworking, in most cases, small businesses.\n  When I sat down with my community bankers--I am not talking about big \nWall Street banks; I am talking about Main Street banks, local banks, \nbanks that are about their customers because they care about their \ncustomers; they are their neighbors; they are the folks they hang out \nwith; their friends and their kids go to school together; these are \npeople who are far removed from Wall Street--they told me about how \nthis bill does not level the playing field and how they are going to be \nsubject to a whole now layer of regulation they cannot afford. They \ntold me stories about how they would make sure their customers are \nalways satisfied and how they cannot afford to make bad loans. In these \nsmaller banks in smaller communities where there is a tremendous amount \nof accountability, obviously these are not the types of banks at which \nthis legislation should be targeted or directed.\n\n  These are banks that provide capital to our farmers, our small \nbusiness owners. In my State of South Dakota, these are the people \nwho--most of my constituents would rather bank with these big, large \nchain banks that we talk about when it comes to the issue of systemic \nrisk. The Democrats' bill, in its current form, places new burdens on \nthese banks, costly regulation on banks that are already heavily \nregulated, that have already proved to be sound financial entities.\n  I also recently sat down with some car dealers from my State, again \nsmall Main Street businesses in South Dakota, who have personal \nrelationships with their customers. They told me how they may have to \ncut some of the services that they provide to their customers because \nof the broad authority that is granted to this brandnew agency, this \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  These business take great pride--when I say ``these,'' the auto \ndealers--in the service they provide to their friends and neighbors who \ncome into their businesses to buy a car. To have bureaucrats in \nWashington, DC, looking over their shoulder does not seem like the \nright approach to me.\n  I have heard the arguments that these small banks are somehow not \ngoing to be affected because of the $10 billion exemption, but I think \nit is important that we point out here, and that we clear up some of \nthe facts on this issue. That $10 billion exemption is from enforcement \nand examination authority by the new Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau. The new bureaucracy still has the ability to oversee every \nproduct and loan and transaction these small banks enter into with \ntheir customers.\n  I have also heard the argument that section 1027 excludes many of the \nsmall businesses that are calling me and e-mailing me and coming to my \noffice because they are concerned. However, it seems to me, once a \nsmall business decides to give their customers an option to pay for \ntheir goods or services over time, this new Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau can come knocking on their door. What Washington \nbureaucrats are going to tell them is what is in the best interest of \ntheir customers in South Dakota. So you can imagine the implications of \nthis type of authority. Currently, the legislation provides very few \nchecks on this new bureau's broad new authorities.\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\n  I want reforms to our current regulatory oversight structure. We need \nbetter protections for our consumers. But the bill that is before us \ncreates a new bureaucracy that has a funding stream outside of \ncongressional oversight with very few checks and balances, and that is \nnot reform.\n  What I would like to see is this bureau removed from the bill. There \nare other ways to provide better protection for consumers without \nburdening small businesses, which, as I said earlier, are the engine of \nour economy.\n  Just to illustrate or to put a fine point on that, I have a letter \nfrom the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents \nbusinesses all across this country, has a very large membership, \nincluding many businesses in my State. They write to express their \nconcerns with certain parts of the bill that are too far reaching and \nwould impose major new costs on small business.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection \n     Bureau will cover many small businesses strictly because they \n     set up flexible payment arrangements with their customers.\n\n  According to a study they did a few years back on getting paid, \napproximately 50 percent of small businesses offer special terms or \ncredit-type arrangements to allow customers to pay for goods or \nservices. Then they go on to describe the nature of some of those \narrangements. But I think it is fair to say a lot of small businesses--\nand car dealers are probably the most notable example. But as was said \nearlier, that could extend to furniture stores, jewelers; that could \nextend to orthodontists and dentists. People who allow their customers \nto spread out the payments over time to pay on terms and have these \nflexible types of payment arrangements would be covered by this.\n  That makes no sense. At a time when we are trying to have our small \nbusinesses help lead us out of this recession, start creating jobs \ninstead of dealing with the systemically risky entities that got us \ninto this mess in the first place, we are talking about piling a whole \nnew burden and lots of new costs on top of our small businesses at a \ntime when they can least afford it.\n  So I would hope the amendment that is being offered, the alternative \nto the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau in this bill, will be \nadopted; that my colleagues in the Senate will take steps to improve \nthe way this bill treats consumer protection and in the way it treats \nsmall businesses under this bill.\n  I, frankly, as I said earlier, would like to see this title removed \nentirely and us deal with this in a way that makes more sense; that \ndoes not create a whole new bureaucracy, with all kinds of new \ngovernment employees with all kinds of new powers. There are certainly \nways in which we can address the issue of consumer protection absent \nhaving to go to these great lengths and this great cost, expense to the \ntaxpayer, and great new burdens imposed upon small businesses in this \ncountry.\n  So I am one who will be supporting not only the amendment that is \nbefore us but other amendments that address this title in the bill. I \nhave one I am working on that would exempt many of the small businesses \nthat would be covered by this bill, some of which I mentioned in my \nremarks earlier. But I think this is an issue that is incredibly \nconsequential in this legislation and so far removed--so far removed--\nfrom the purpose of this bill in the first place.\n  As I said earlier, we ought to fix the things that need to be fixed. \nBut we should not try to fix things that do not need to be fixed, \nparticularly when it calls for creating a whole new government \nbureaucracy in Washington, DC, with new government employees, at great \nadditional cost and, of course, as I said earlier, at great additional \nexpense to America's small businesses, which are the economic engine \nand job creators in our economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor to talk \nabout the Shelby amendment. I think we need to be 100 percent clear \nabout one thing; that is, we need to pass a consumer protection bill--\nnot a Wall Street protection bill--with a strong independent agency \nthat can aggressively defend families in all sectors of the financial \nindustry. That is consumer protection.\n  A weak agency that cannot defend families against commercial banks, \ninvestment banks, credit card companies, car dealers, payday lenders, \nand entities such as AIG, that is Wall Street protection. That is, in \nessence, what this amendment does. The fact is, the Republicans' \nproposal on this issue seems to symbolize America's worst fears about \nhow the powerful operate--the powerful protecting the powerful. The \nproblem isn't that families have too much protection on Wall Street; \nthe problem is they have not been protected enough.\n  The Shelby substitute is just the status quo. It is a cynical attempt \nto pretend they are doing consumer protection. In reality, it is meant \nto make sure there is no meaningful consumer protection at the end of \nthe day. It willfully ignores the lessons we should have learned: that \nleft to their own devices, there are lenders who can and will take \nadvantage of consumers. That is what the marketplace--as it is right \nnow--has taught us.\n  We absolutely need a muscular, independent agency--however it is \nconfigured, wherever it is housed--one that will have full and \ncomprehensive authority to develop and implement real, honest, \nproconsumer rules so they will no longer be fooled by 30 pages of fine \nprint that no one except bank lawyers could possibly understand; one \nthat has independent rule-writing authority and authority over banks \nand nonbanks, while maintaining strong State consumer protection laws; \none that will stop the ongoing attempts by credit card companies to \ncircumvent the rules this Senate and Congress have already enacted. \nThey are already working at it.\n  As Harvard Law Prof. Elizabeth Warren has noted: Thanks to product \nsafety rules, you can't buy a toaster that would burn down your house. \nBut you can buy a faulty mortgage that could take your house away.\n  The bank regulators have been of no great help because they are \nlooking out for the banks--not for us, not for you, not for \nunsuspecting families who need the full force protections of robust \nregulations implemented by a muscular agency that is on your side.\n  In my view, a new independent agency would provide not only the \ncomfort they need but the protection they deserve. We can argue about \ndetails, but I doubt there is much disagreement after what we have been \nthrough that Wall Street needs a watchdog, one that has jurisdiction \nover all financial products no matter who offers them, not just the \nproducts offered by big banks.\n  Chairman Dodd has worked very hard over many months to craft the \ndetails of an agency that strikes the right balance. I was happy to see \nthat finally our Republican colleagues were saying: We are on the Wall \nStreet reform train. But now I begin to wonder--when I see amendments \nsuch as this--that they jumped on the train to strike the emergency \nbrake on consumer protection enforcement.\n  The Shelby amendment offers nothing in the way of consumer \nprotection. There is no independence. The CFPB would simply be a \ndivision within the FDIC with no autonomy of its own. It could not even \nfinalize a rule without FDIC approval. It will not have any resources. \nAnd that is how Republicans want it: no resources, no supervisory \nauthority, no enforcement power. Guess who wins in that scenario.\n  Nonmortgage companies will never be subject to supervision unless \nthey have a pattern or practice of breaking the law within the past 3 \nyears. So what does that mean? ``Let's have a lot of people get hurt \nbefore we actually would say we should now give them protection.'' It \nis not my sense of how the law should operate.\n  The Shelby amendment would establish the Division of Consumer \nProtection at the FDIC. It maintains, in essence, the status quo. \nConsumer protection rule writing will still be under the same \nauthority, the same regulators who routinely ignored or opposed the \nneeds of consumers. The amendment provides no safeguards to prevent the \nFDIC Chair or board from overriding decisions by the division director.\n  The amendment would actually prohibit--prohibit--the proposed \nconsumer division from doing any rule writing\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\nunder the Federal Trade Commission Act for payday lenders, debt \ncollectors, foreclosure scam operators, mortgage brokers, and other \nnonbank consumer finance companies. It could only do examinations of \nnonbank consumer finance companies if they ``demonstrate a pattern or \npractice of violations'' of consumer law. So only after the consumer \nhas been harmed repeatedly--after they have been harmed repeatedly--\ncould the consumer division do any examination of the business.\n  This is simply saying: I am going to tell you that I am going to put \na cop on the beat. He has no uniform, he has no equipment, and he \ncannot stop the bad guys. What a falsehood. We need to defeat this \namendment, and we need to have a bill that ultimately gives strong \nconsumer protections for millions of families in this country who have \nalready faced the consequences of the system that is going on \nunregulated in a way that it allows greed and excesses to take place \nand that puts protections, yes, for Wall Street but not for Main \nStreet.\n  Senator Dodd has struck the right balance. We need to preserve it. I \nlook forward to supporting him and opposing this amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me briefly express my gratitude to my \ngreat pal and friend from New Jersey, Bob Menendez, once again. We look \naround. There are 100 of us here. I do not often acknowledge these \nthings, but if I had to pick one of our colleagues to be in my corner \nas an advocate, I would pick Bob Menendez every time. He is a strong \nadvocate. When he is focused and passionate about a matter, as he is on \nthis one, there is no better advocate in the Senate. He has been a \ngreat member of our committee and a great help over the last few years \nwhere we have worked together on a number of bills coming out of the \ncommittee.\n  His understanding of this issue is exactly right. I say, there are \nideas people can offer on which they can make a case that they \nstrengthen our particular provision. But I say, respectfully, this is \nsuch a step backward, it is even hard to imagine someone could actually \nconjure up an amendment that would step us this farther away from even \nthe status quo.\n  I thought I might get an amendment that would strike this and leave \nthe world as it is. Senator Thune made that argument, that somehow this \nis not broken, leave it alone. Yet there is not a person I know of in \nthe country who does not recognize this problem all began because there \nwere unscrupulous brokers, there were people willing to put ratings on \nbundled securities that were worthless, there were bankers willing to \nturn a blind eye and a deaf ear, pushing out mortgages they knew people \ncould not possibly afford, luring them into it by promising them they \ncould meet all their obligations.\n  To suggest the system is not broken--you would almost have to have \nbeen living on a different planet over the last few years not to \nrecognize what happened because consumers were forgotten. Safety and \nsoundness, we were told, were in great shape. Institutions were making \nmoney. This was a very stable situation.\n  We had a hearing almost 3 years ago in our committee. It was in June \nof 2007. A guy by the name of David Berenbaum from the National \nCommunity Reinvestment Coalition came before the committee. Let me \nquote, if I can--this is 3 years ago--from his testimony:\n\n       For the past 5 years, community groups, consumer protection \n     groups, fair lending groups, and all of our members in the \n     National Community Reinvestment Coalition have been sounding \n     an alarm about poor underwriting--underwriting that not only \n     endangered communities, their tax bases, their municipal \n     governments, their ability to have sound services and \n     celebrate home ownership--but [underwriting that] was going \n     to impact on the safety and soundness of our banking \n     institutions themselves. Those cries for action fell on deaf \n     ears, and here we are today.\n\n  I remember my colleague from New Jersey, almost 3 years ago--I \nremember his words--I do not have them written down in front of me, but \nI remember them very clearly. I say to the Senator, your words that day \nwere: This is going to be a tsunami. It was the first time I heard \nthose words used to describe the looming foreclosure crisis.\n  We were told then there would be maybe 1 million, maybe 2 million \nforeclosures. Now we know the number is in excess of 7 million that \nhave occurred--not to mention job loss and the like.\n  The consumer people were arguing for underwriting standards. It was \nthe safety and soundness regulators who were refusing to acknowledge we \ndid not have underwriting standards or were refusing to acknowledge we \nneeded to do something about it. So I wanted to commend my colleague.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, if I may ask my distinguished chairman \nto yield for a moment, the Chairman is absolutely right. As a matter of \nfact, when I made that comment that we were going to have a tsunami of \nforeclosures, the administration witnesses at the time--the previous \nadministration, of course--said, with all due respect, that is an \nexaggeration.\n  Mr. DODD. Right.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I wish they had been right and we had been wrong. But I \nthink the chairman hits it right on point. In the context of the rating \nagencies, they were playing coach and referee. When you are playing \ncoach and referee, somehow the game does not work out quite all that \nwell.\n  I appreciate what the Senator done in that respect here as well.\n  I think the chairman makes the case very clearly that the definition \nof insanity is doing the same thing time and time again and expecting a \ndifferent result. If we want to see what has happened to the American \nconsumer in this country continue--facing the same consequences they \nhave had to face over the last couple years--then we adopt this \namendment. But if we want to change that, then we would support the \nunderlying provisions in his bill.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  The last point I want to make on the amendment is, under this \nproposal, any person who is subject to one of the enumerated statutes \ncould be assessed--under this bill, in section 1015(a)--and this \namendment, by the way--talk about a bureaucracy, it is a long \namendment--but in 1015(a), it says:\n\n       The Chairperson shall establish, by rule, an assessment \n     schedule--\n\n  So we are going to assess now these various institutions that are \nalready burdened with assessments--\n\n       including the assessment base and rates, applicable to \n     covered persons subject to section 1023. . . .\n\n  I know this sounds like a lot of gibberish, but what is section 1023? \nWhat does it say? Section 1023 talks about nondepository institutions \nsubject to consumer laws--just consumer laws. One of the complaints \nabout our underlying bill--which is totally false--is that florists and \nbutchers and dentists and accountants and lawyers would be subject to \nthe provisions of this act. Nothing could be further from the truth, \nand the language in our bill makes it explicitly clear that you must be \nsignificantly involved in financial services or products. That is the \nlanguage of our bill.\n  Section 1023: Nondepository institutions subject to consumer laws \ncould be levied with assessments. That is your florist, your butcher, \nyour dentist, your accountant, your lawyer. So as to those who argue \nagainst my bill and argue for this alternative--in fact, explicitly in \nhere, at least as I read this--it could very well impose assessments on \nthe very people they claim are affected by our legislation.\n  Again, I invite my colleagues to read it. It is not a speech I am \nreading. I am reading from the proposed amendment. That section 1023--\nspecifically, you can look it up in here; it is a section of the bill--\nit speaks about nondepository institutions subject to consumer laws. \nAnd the definition, accordingly, is the very people who are not \nfinancial institutions, who could be levied with those assessments.\n  So for all those reasons, respectfully, I would urge my colleagues to \nreject this amendment. I do not claim perfection in our underlying \nconsumer protection language. We think we have a very strong bill. I am \nalways anxious to hear from people who think they can make it stronger \nor better in some way. Fine. But to propose a whole new\n\n[[Page S3327]]\n\nregulatory structure here, with new people coming on, at great cost, \nwith no power whatsoever to do anything about the very problem that \nconfronts us, seems to me to be the height of what we are trying to \navoid: creating a bureaucracy that does not do much. That, it seems to \nme, is what the American taxpayers want us to avoid.\n  With that, we have completed on our side the debate against this \namendment. Unless there is some further comment, then I would ask for \nthe yeas and nays on the amendment and call for a vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose the Shelby amendment.\n  In our zeal to protect consumers from egregious banking and lending \npractices, I fear the Senate is paying too little attention to basic \nconstitutional tenets.\n  The Shelby amendment proposes to create a division for consumer \nfinancial protection within the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \nFDIC, to exempt that new entity from the congressional appropriations \nprocess. The underlying substitute amendment proposes a similar model--\na new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protections within the Federal \nReserve System, which would also be exempt from the congressional \nappropriations process. This is in addition to several exemptions \nproposed in the underlying substitute amendment--exemptions for the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, and for new funds for the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and exemptions for the Commodities \nand Futures Trading Commission fund to reward whistleblowers.\n  I understand the desire by some to create a new consumer agency, and \nto elevate its status to that of a banking regulator but, these \nproposals--the Shelby amendment, and the underlying Democratic \nsubstitute--are alarming in the aggregate spending latitude they are \nrecommending for one agency. The usual procedure of executive review by \nthe White House budget office, and public discussion of the President's \nbudget submission through hearings, testimony, questions, debate and \namendment--would not apply to the new consumer agency under both the \nRepublican and Democratic proposals. I support stronger consumer \nprotections in the financial services industry, but I do not believe \nthat the elected representatives of the people have to forfeit their \nconstitutional oversight responsibilities in order to make that happen.\n  We need to remember that the financial regulators have their \ndirectors appointed by presidents, and that the Congress needs to be \nable to exercise oversight. If enforcement is inadequate, or abusive, \nthe people's most potent weapon to effect change is the congressional \npower of the purse.\n  In the bill passed by the House of Representatives last year, the \nHouse proposed to create a new consumer protection agency, and to \nsubject its funding--at least in part--to the annual appropriations \nprocess. That model is a better way of helping consumers than exempting \nthe budget of the consumer protection agency from congressional review.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Chairman Dodd \nhas asserted that the Shelby consumer protection substitute would lead \nto additional assessments on community banks. I want to make it clear \nfor the record that this is not true.\n  But before doing so, I do want to highlight that the basic thrust of \nChairman Dodd's assertion is based on the belief that placing the \ntaxpayer on the hook for the costs of regulating Goldman Sachs, \nCitigroup, and J.P. Morgan is the preferential way of proceeding.\n  Again, Chairman Dodd believes that taxpayers paying the freight for \nGoldman is the way to go.\n  But I want to set the record straight about my amendment. First, my \nprovision ensures that any nonbanks that are subject to regulation pay \nthe full cost of that regulation themselves. They get no handouts from \nthe taxpayer.\n  Secondly, community banks are not presently assessed by the FDIC for \nthe cost of regulation, and my amendment does not provide the FDIC with \nany new authority to make such assessments.\n  Funding for the new division will be provided by assessments on \nnonbank mortgage originators, the other nonbank entities that are \nsubject to regulation and large banking institutions. I would point out \nthat the assessments on large banks will increase considerably \nfollowing passage of the Tester amendment, which Chairman Dodd \nsupported.\n  Finally, in an effort to protect deposit insurance, my amendment \ncreates a separate consumer financial protection fund which will ensure \nthat funds for deposit insurance and consumer protection are never \ncomingled.\n  Mr. President, let's be clear about the differences in the funding \nsources in the two bills. The Dodd bill uses taxpayer funds to give a \nfree ride to Goldman Sachs and the other big Wall Street Banks while my \namendment makes big banks and bad actors cover their own costs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before calling for the vote, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate now proceed to a vote with respect to the \nShelby amendment No. 3826, with no amendment in order to the amendment \nprior to the vote; further, that the previous order with respect to the \nSanders amendment remain in effect, and provided that after the Sanders \namendment has been called up and reported by number, Senator McCain be \nrecognized to call up an amendment relating to GSEs; that after the \nMcCain amendment has been reported by number, the Senate then resume \nconsideration of the Sanders amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, again, before we get to this vote, let me \nmake this appeal. We are going to have this vote, and then we will go \nto the Sanders amendment and then to the McCain amendment. Again, we \nare going to try to go back and forth and move along. The number of \namendments now has increased to over 150. I say to my colleagues, there \nare actually more amendments on the Democratic side than the Republican \nside--not many more but more. I urge my colleagues, if you have very \nlike minded amendments, it may be in your interests to combine these \nideas in a single amendment--maybe rally around one that actually makes \nthe point, to either extract from the bill or add to the bill because \nwe all realize we are not going to be on this bill forever, and I want \nto accommodate as many people as I can and have the kind of discussion \nwe just had on this amendment. But to do that in the timeframe we have \nis going to require cooperation and some indulgence on the part of \npeople to not be demanding.\n  To the extent you have an amendment up, let's try to get to it and \nhave a good discussion but not too long so we give other people a \nchance to be heard as well. I make that plea to everyone involved.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3826 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Utah (Mr. Bennett).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me give my colleagues some idea of how \nwe are going to proceed.\n  Senator Sanders has the next amendment. We entered into a unanimous \nconsent agreement a few minutes ago. Senator Sanders has asked for 80 \nminutes to be equally divided on his amendment. We then turn to the \nMcCain amendment. I am hoping we get a time agreement on that amendment \nas well.\n  There are 141 amendments, about equally divided between us. I want to \naccommodate everybody as much as I can. If some people take too much \ntime, it means others do not get a chance to offer their amendments.\n  I make a request of my good friend Senator Shelby to inquire, before \nwe get to the McCain amendment, what kind of time agreement we can have \non his amendment. Then my intention is to go to a Democratic amendment \nand possibly a Republican amendment tonight.\n  There are going to be votes tomorrow. I am letting my colleagues know \nwe will have votes tomorrow. I gather Monday and Friday of next week \nare nonvote days. If we have 141 amendments and Members want to be \nheard--and I want to give them time to be heard and have good debate--\nobviously we cannot go on forever.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for all the Senators here, we may have 141 \namendments, but this is not the first time we have had 141 amendments \non a bill. I have looked at a catalog of the amendments, and a lot are \non the same subject. What we are trying to do is find out different \ncategories and not have everybody offer the same amendment.\n  Our goal tonight should be to try to get rid of four amendments. If \nwe could have four amendments out of the way tonight, we could look--\nand I thank my friend because I told him we are going to have votes in \nthe morning, or at least a vote. I can create a vote. I hope we don't \nhave to start creating votes. I hope they are on amendments people want \nto debate.\n  Senator Sanders has an amendment. Has he agreed to a time?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, he has.\n  Mr. REID. Senator McCain, has he agreed to a time?\n  Mr. SHELBY. It is on GSE. It will take a while.\n  Mr. DODD. If everybody demands more time, everyone suffers. There is \nnot unlimited debate. With 141 amendments equally divided between us, \nwe have to provide time for people. I cannot do that if people insist \non unlimited time or more time. We know these issues pretty well. It is \nnot as if it is a new bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If my friend from Connecticut will yield for an \nobservation, Mr. President, we may have 141 amendments, but they are \nnot all equal. We are going to try to work our way through the major \namendments in a serious way. This is a very important piece of \nlegislation. The majority leader and I had a conversation earlier today \non how to go forward. We will keep working on it in a systematic way \nand maximize a way for people to have votes on important amendments.\n  Mr. DODD. I agree. I say to my friend the Republican leader, we spent \n24 hours on one amendment. We have to do better than that. I cannot \naccommodate people if we are going to spend a day on one amendment. It \njust does not work. All amendments may not be equal, but all Members \nare, and all Members deserve an opportunity to be heard.\n  I appreciate the majority leader's point of trying to consolidate if \nseveral Members have the same idea about something. Maybe it can be \nbrought together in one amendment rather than five--I say that to both \nDemocrats and Republicans--as a way of moving the process along, and we \ncan have a good discussion. I cannot spend 24 hours on one amendment \nand accommodate people. It just is not going to happen. That is my \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we are making progress. We might not be \nmaking progress as quickly as some people would like. Maybe we did \nspend a lot of time on this amendment, but it is very important. We \nhave debated it. I guess it has been disposed of, at least that part of \nit, now. But there are a lot of other important amendments coming up. \nWe can work together and work through some of them because a lot are \nduplications to some degree, and some of them we can take. Senator Dodd \nand I can help our staffs on that. Remember, this affects all of our \neconomy--everything.\n  Mr. DODD. I will take advantage of the moment to say that I will be \nhere all weekend. We are not going to have votes on the weekend. I will \nbe here all weekend. For people who would like to have amendments and \nwould like us to consider them, Senator Shelby's staff will be around \nand my staff will be around to work on their amendment to see if we can \naccommodate it, modify it, or talk about it. I will spend Saturday and \nSunday here all day for people to go over their products so maybe we \ncan expedite things next week as well.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may talk to the two managers through \nthe Chair, I know how important everyone thinks their amendment is. But \nyou can have half an hour on each side, an hour for an amendment. \nSomeone can say quite a bit in 5 minutes. I think we are going to have \nto have some guidelines as to what we are going to do. Everyone thinks \ntheir amendment is the most important, and I am sure in their mind it \nis. We have to set some standard. I have been very accommodating in \nthis last 24 hours because I think so much of the comanager of the \nbill, Senator Shelby. We could have moved to table his amendment a long \ntime ago.\n  Let's understand, there are other ways we can move forward. If \nsomebody says: I need 3 hours on an amendment--there is not an \namendment on this bill that is worth 3 hours, OK? We have had a good \nconversation.\n  I hope the two managers can give us some guidelines as to what they \nexpect to do tonight and tomorrow because Members have other things to \ndo than listen to the three of us.\n  Mr. DODD. Senator Sanders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3738 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3738.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Leahy, Mr. McCain, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n     Grassley, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Vitter, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brownback, \n     Mr. Risch, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Graham, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Crapo, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3738 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the non-partisan Government Accountability Office \n   to conduct an independent audit of the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System that does not interfere with monetary policy, to \n   let the American people know the names of the recipients of over \n  $2,000,000,000,000 in taxpayer assistance from the Federal Reserve \n                    System, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 1525, strike line 20 and all that follows through \n     page 1528 line 3 and insert the following: ``to the taxpayers \n     of such assistance.''.\n\n     SEC. 1152.

Mr. President, this amendment, which calls for \ntransparency at the Fed, is, frankly, one of the more unusual \namendments I have ever participated in, not so much for its content but \nfor the kind of coalition that has come together around it. How often \ndo you have the AFL-CIO and FreedomWorks supporting the same effort? \nHow often do you have the SEIU, which is the largest trade union in \nthis country, moveOn.org, which I believe has some 5 million \nprogressive members, and Public Citizen striving for the same goal as \nthe National Taxpayers Union or the Eagle Forum or the Conservative \nAmericans for Tax Reform? There is a coalition representing tens of \nmillions of grassroots activists. Some of them are progressive, some \nwhere I come from, some of them are conservative, but they are all \nunited around a very basic principle: We need transparency at the Fed, \nand we need it now.\n  I want to use this opportunity--and I thank Chairman Dodd for \nallowing me to do this--to talk about the amendment, what it does, and \nwhy so many diverse groups are coming together in support of it because \nyou do have to ask yourself: What is bringing together some of the most \nprogressive groups in the country with some of the most conservative \ngroups, some of the most progressive members of the Senate with some of \nthe most conservative? I also want to tell my colleagues not only what \nthis amendment does but to clarify as best I can what it does not \nbecause there has been some distortion about this amendment, and those \ndistortions are blatantly untrue. I want to touch on that also.\n  The origin for this amendment came on March 3, 2009. That was the \ndate that, as a member of the Budget Committee, I had the opportunity \nto ask Chairman Bernanke what I thought was a pretty simple question. \nChairman Bernanke, obviously, is Chairman of the Fed. What I asked him \nwas: Mr. Chairman, my understanding is that the Fed has lent out some \n$2 trillion to some of the largest financial institutions in this \ncountry. Would you please tell me and the American people who received \nthat money? I thought that was a pretty simple and straightforward \nquestion. Mr. Bernanke said: No. Despite the fact that this was $2 \ntrillion in zero interest or near zero interest loans, he apparently \nbelieves the American people do not have a right to know who received \nthat money.\n  On that very same day, I introduced legislation requiring the Fed to \nput this information on its Web site, just as Congress required the \nTreasury Department to do with respect to the $700 billion TARP. And \nhere we are today. Whatever one may think of TARP, one can get \ninformation as to who received that money, when it was paid back--the \ndetails. It is right there on the Internet. I believe that same \ninformation should be made available in terms of the Fed's zero \ninterest and near zero interest loans.\n  What the Fed apparently does not understand--and this is the \nimportant point--is that this money, these trillions of dollars, do not \nbelong to the Fed; they belong to the American people. It is \nincomprehensible to me--and I think to the overwhelming majority of \npeople in our country--that the Fed believes they can keep this \ninformation secret.\n  This amendment not only requires that the Fed tell us who has \nreceived the $2 trillion it lent out, but, similar to the language \nincorporated in the House bill, it calls for an audit of the Fed by the \nGAO. That is it. That is what we are attempting to do with this \namendment: transparency and a straightforward audit. Who got what when, \non what basis, on what terms, who was at the meetings, who made the \ndecisions, and taking a look at possible conflicts of interest--simple, \nfactual questions that people from the State of Vermont ask me and I \nsuspect people from Minnesota ask you, Mr. President, and people all \nover this country, regardless of their political persuasion, are \nasking.\n  I understand this amendment may not be supported by everyone. Some \nmay suggest, inaccurately, that this amendment--and I quote from a \nstatement--``takes away the independence of the Federal Reserve and \nputs monetary policy into the hands of Congress.'' That is one of the \ncharges being made against this amendment.\n  Let me address that concern by simply reading to the Members of the \nSenate exactly what is in the amendment so that we know what we are \ntalking about. I quote from page 4 of a six-page amendment. It is not a \nlong amendment. It cannot be clearer than this. This is what it says:\n\n       Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as \n     interference in or dictation of monetary policy to the \n     Federal Reserve System by the Congress or the Government \n     Accountability Office.\n\n  If there are people who are saying: Oh, we are going to get involved \nin monetary policy; oh, we are going to be politicizing the Fed; oh, we \nare going to have, before an election, Congress telling the Fed to \nraise interest rates or to lower interest rates, that is absolutely \ninaccurate. That is not what we are doing. That is not, in my view, \nwhat we should be doing.\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\n  We want an independent Fed. We want them to develop monetary policy. \nThat is not--underline not--what this amendment does. This amendment \ndoes not tell the Fed when to cut short-term interest rates and when to \nraise them. It does not tell the Fed which banks to lend money to and \nwhich banks not to lend money to. It does not tell the Fed which \nforeign central banks they can do business with and which ones they \ncannot do business with. It does not impose any new regulations on the \nFed, nor does it take any regulatory authority away from the Fed. Let's \nbe clear about that.\n  I think what the opponents of this amendment are doing is equating \nindependence with secrecy, and there is a difference. At a time when \nour entire financial system almost collapsed, we cannot let the Fed \noperate in secrecy any longer. The American people have a right to \nknow.\n\n  I find it amusing that there are some people who oppose this \namendment. As Chairman Dodd and the Presiding Officer know, we have had \nheated debates on the floor of the Senate over a $5 million amendment, \nover an $8 million provision that goes on for hours. Yet where we have \ntrillions of dollars being lent out, there are some people who think \nthe American people don't have a right to know who got that money. I \nthink, frankly, that is absurd.\n  The American people, as we hear over and over on the floor of the \nSenate, play by the rules. That is what the average American family \ndoes; they play by the rules. Well, what are the rules governing the \nFed? Who makes those rules or are they just made up as they go along \nand they do not have to tell anybody about it? So I have a problem with \nthat, and that is what this amendment is about.\n  Here, to my mind--and these are just my issues; others may have \ndifferent issues, and I am sure they do--are just a few of the \nquestions the American people are asking and why we need a GAO audit of \nthe Fed. These are just a few. Let me throw them out.\n  Why was Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, invited to the New \nYork Federal Reserve to meet with Federal officials in September of \n2008 to determine whether AIG would be bailed out or allowed to go \nbankrupt?\n  When the Fed and Treasury decided to bail out AIG to the tune of $182 \nbillion, why did the Fed refuse to tell the American people where that \nmoney was going? Why did the Fed argue that this information needed to \nbe kept secret ``as a matter of national security?''\n  Here is the point. When AIG finally released the names of the \ncounterparties receiving this assistance, how did it happen that \nGoldman Sachs received $13 billion of this money; AIG, $182 billion; \n$13 billion going to Goldman Sachs--100 cents on the dollar of a \ncompany that was going bankrupt and that was bailed out. How is that--\n100 cents on the dollar? Not bad.\n  Another question people might ask: Did Goldman Sachs use this money \nto provide $16 billion in bonuses the next year? Here you have Goldman \nSachs getting $13 billion out of the $182 billion that AIG got, and the \nnext year they are announcing $16 billion in bonuses. Did they use some \nof this money to provide those bonuses?\n  A GAO audit of the Fed might help explain to the American people if \nthere were any conflicts of interest surrounding this deal. I think the \naverage American would say: Yes, there is a conflict of interest. You \nhave a guy from Goldman Sachs sitting in the room arguing for $182 \nbillion. They got $182 billion; he gets $13 billion. The next year his \ncompany gives $16 billion in bonuses.\n  Is there a conflict of interest? I think so. That is my opinion. My \nopinion isn't the important one, but that is what the GAO will be doing \nif this amendment is passed.\n  Just another question out there. In 2008, it seems to me--I may be \nwrong--there was a conflict of interest at the Federal Reserve Bank of \nNew York, when Stephen Friedman, the head of the New York Fed, who also \nserved on the board of directors of Goldman Sachs--let's back it up. \nThe head of the Fed serves on the board of Goldman Sachs, approved \nGoldman's application to become a bank holding company, giving it \naccess to cheap loans from the Federal Reserve. OK. The head of the New \nYork Federal Reserve, on the board of Goldman Sachs, is applying for \nGoldman Sachs to become a bank holding company to gain cheap loans from \nthe Fed.\n  It looks to me like there may be a conflict of interest, but what do \nI know? That is what we need a GAO report to tell us.\n  Here, interestingly enough, is an article from May 9, 2009, in the \nWall Street Journal. Let me quote briefly from that article:\n\n       Goldman Sachs received speedy approval to become a bank \n     holding company in September of 2008. During that time, the \n     New York Fed's chairman, Stephen Friedman, sat on Goldman's \n     board and had a large holding in Goldman's stock, which, \n     because of Goldman's new status as a bank holding company, \n     was a violation of Federal Reserve policy. The New York Fed \n     asked for a waiver, which, after about 2\\1/2\\ months, the Fed \n     granted. While it was weighing the request, Mr. Friedman \n     bought 37,300 more Goldman shares in December. They have \n     since risen $1.7 million in value. Mr. Friedman, who once ran \n     Goldman, says none of these events involved any conflicts.\n\n  That is the Wall Street Journal article from May 9, 2009. That is \nwhat Mr. Friedman says. Well, I kind of disagree with him, but I would \nlike the GAO to take a look at that. Without a comprehensive GAO \nreport, we have to take Mr. Friedman at his word, and I don't think we \nshould. Who got what? When did they get it? On what basis and what \nterms? Who was at those meetings? Were there conflicts of interest? \nThese are the kinds of questions a GAO audit of the Fed will answer.\n  As a result of the bailout of Bear Stearns and AIG, the Fed--and this \nis a beauty, this is quite something--the Fed now owns credit default \nswaps--listen up on this one--betting that California, Nevada, and \nFlorida will default on their debt. So the Federal Reserve stands to \nmake money if California, Nevada, and Florida go bankrupt. I suspect \nthat the Senators from the great States of California, Nevada, and \nFlorida would be rather interested to know that if their States go \nbankrupt, the Fed makes money.\n  On the surface, this looks a little absurd to me, but again, I think \nthis is an issue that the GAO might be taking a look at.\n  It has been reported that the Federal Reserve pressured the Bank of \nAmerica into acquiring Merrill Lynch--making this financial institution \neven bigger and riskier--allegedly threatening to fire its CEO if the \nBank of America backed out of this merger. When the merger went \nthrough, Merrill Lynch employees received $3.7 billion in bonuses. Was \nthis a good deal for the American taxpayer? A GAO audit can help us \nfind out.\n  When the Federal Reserve provided a $29 billion loan to JPMorgan \nChase to acquire Bear Stearns, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, \nserved on the Board of Directors at the New York Federal Reserve. Let \nme repeat that. When the Federal Reserve provided $29 billion to \nJPMorgan Chase, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase served on the Board of \nDirectors of the New York Fed. Did this represent a conflict of \ninterest? I think the average American would say yes. Maybe some people \nwould have a different point of view. But I think a GAO audit can help \nexplain all this to the American people.\n  Currently--and I think we have to appreciate this as well; we have to \nshed some light on these issues--some 35 members of the Federal \nReserve's Board of Governors are executives at private financial \ninstitutions which have received nearly $120 billion in TARP funds, but \nwe don't know how much these big banks received from the Fed. We know \nwhat they got from the TARP, not from the Fed. A GAO audit could answer \nthis question.\n  All of us--I believe all of us--are deeply concerned that small- and \nmedium-sized businesses around this country--I know it is certainly the \ncase in Vermont--are begging for affordable credit. They have the \nopportunity to expand. We are beginning to see some economic recovery, \nbut they want to expand, they want to create new jobs, and they are \nfinding it extremely difficult to acquire those desperately needed \naffordable loans. I find it an important issue to ask how much of the \ntrillions of dollars in zero or near zero interest loans that financial \ninstitutions received from the Fed went out to those small businesses \nor, perhaps, as I personally believe is the\n\n[[Page S3331]]\n\ncase, were simply invested in Federal Government bonds, earning an \ninterest rate of 3 or 4 percent.\n  A number of observers believe--and the GAO can help us discover--the \nFed provided zero interest loans to a large bank, which then took that \nmoney and bought government bonds at 3 percent. If that was the case, \nand I suspect it was, you are looking at a huge scam--a huge scam--when \nsmall- and medium-sized businesses needed the money. That was the \nintention of these loans. But I don't know how much of this was \ninvested in growth bonds, you don't know, and the American people don't \nknow. It is time we found out.\n  This amendment I am offering is virtually identical to legislation \nthat I have offered on this subject that has 33 cosponsors. The \namendment, I think, has 20, 22 Democrats and Republicans. The original \nlegislation had 33 cosponsors. Just so you can get a sense of the \ndiversity of ideological opinion behind this amendment, let me tell you \nthe names of the people on board the legislation--not the amendment, \nthe legislation: Senators Barrasso, Bennett, Boxer, Brownback, Burr, \nCardin, Chambliss, Coburn, Cochran, Cornyn, Crapo, DeMint, Dorgan, \nFeingold, Graham, Grassley, Harkin, Hatch, Hutchison, Inhofe, Isakson, \nLandrieu, Leahy, Lincoln, McCain, Murkowski, Risch, Sanders, Thune, \nVitter, Webb, Wicker, and Wyden.\n  Those are people who are on the original legislation--33 cosponsors. \nAs you can see, they range from some of the most progressive Members to \nsome of the most conservative Members. The amendment that is now on the \nfloor has, I believe, 22 cosponsors, Republicans and Democrats alike, \nand I wish to thank all of them for their support.\n  The American people are asking: Can people work together? Can they \ncome together on important issues? If there is an important issue that \npeople with different ideological backgrounds have come together on, \nthis is that one. So I wished to thank my Republican friends and my \nDemocratic friends who, every other day, are fighting like cats and \nmice but on this issue have come together, and I appreciate that.\n  But it is not only the Members of the Senate. In terms of progressive \ngrassroots organizations, this amendment enjoys the strong support of \nthe AFL-CIO; the Service Employees International Union, the single \nlargest union in the country; the United Steelworkers of America; \nPublic Citizen; the New American Foundation; Center for Economic \nPolicy; U.S. Public Interest Research Group; Americans for Financial \nReform, which is a coalition of over 250 consumer, employee, investor, \ncommunity, and civil rights groups. There is a huge amount of support \nfrom the progressive community. It also has a huge amount of support \nfrom the conservative community.\n  Let me read, briefly, a letter I received from the legislative \ndirector of the AFL-CIO. This is what he says:\n\n       On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I am writing to urge you to \n     support the Sanders-Feingold-DeMint-Leahy-McCain-Grassley-\n     Vitter-Brownback amendment to increase transparency at the \n     Federal Reserve. Working people want to know who benefitted \n     from the liquidity provided by taxpayers during the crisis \n     and this amendment will ensure that we receive this \n     information.\n\n  I received another letter, which came from the president of the SCIU, \nthe president of the United Steelworkers, the president of Public \nCitizen and many other progressive groups and this is what they say:\n\n       Since the start of the financial crisis, the Federal \n     Reserve has dramatically changed its operating procedures. \n     Instead of simply setting interest rates to influence \n     macroeconomic conditions, it rapidly acquired a wide variety \n     of private assets and extended massive secret bailouts to \n     major financial institutions. There are still many questions \n     about the Fed's behavior in these new activities. The Federal \n     Reserve's balance sheet expanded to more than $2 trillion, \n     along with implied and implicit backstops to Wall Street \n     firms that could cost even more. Who received the money? \n     Against what collateral? On what terms and conditions? The \n     only way to find out is through a complete audit of the \n     Federal Reserve. That's why we support the amendment to \n     increase transparency at the Fed.\n\n  That is from the SEIU, and many other unions.\n  That is what some of the progressive groups, quite frankly, that I \nwork with quite often have to say about this amendment. But let me \nquote from some of the conservative organizations that, frankly, I \nusually do not have very good voting records with. Very often they \noppose what I bring forth.\n  Here is the National Taxpayers Union. I don't know how many folks \nthey have, but they are a big organization. This is what the National \nTaxpayers Union says:\n\n       The National Taxpayers Union urges all Senators to vote \n     ``yes'' on S. Amendment 3738 to the financial regulatory \n     reform legislation. This amendment, introduced by Senators \n     Sanders and DeMint, would require the Government \n     Accountability Office to conduct an audit of the Federal \n     Reserve. . . .\n\n  I like their next sentence.\n\n       Transparency is not a Democrat or Republican issue, but \n     rather an issue of right or wrong. If the Senate insists on \n     further expanding the Fed's reach, Americans deserve to know \n     more about the workings of a government-sanctioned entity \n     whose decisions directly affect their economic livelihood. A \n     ``yes'' vote on S. amendment 3738 [this amendment] will be \n     significantly weighted as a pro-taxpayer vote in our annual \n     Rating of Congress.\n\n  That means I may have at least a 1-percent approval vote from the \nNational Taxpayers Union. I appreciate their support. That is from the \nNational Taxpayers Union.\n  Let me quote from another letter of support I received from a group \nof conservative organizations that includes the Americans for Tax \nReform, the Campaign for Liberty, the Rutherford Institute, the Eagle \nforum, Freedomworks, and the Center for Fiscal Accountability--again, \nsome of the more conservative groups in the country, groups that \nusually do not support my issues. This is what they say:\n\n       We urge you to vote for Senators Sanders, Feingold, DeMint, \n     and Vitter's Federal Reserve Transparency Amendment. . . . \n     This amendment does not take away the ``independence'' of the \n     Fed. It simply requires the GAO to conduct an independent \n     audit of the Fed and requires the Fed to release the names of \n     the recipients of more than $2 trillion in taxpayer-backed \n     assistance during this latest economic crisis. Any true \n     financial reform effort will start with requiring \n     accountability from our Nation's central bank.\n\n  Let me thank all of the conservative groups--in this case the \nAmericans for Tax Reform, the Campaign for Liberty, and the others--for \ntheir very strong grassroots effort in supporting this amendment. It is \nan indication, again, that on certain issues progressives and \nconservatives can come together.\n  Let me mention this because I think it is possible that some of the \nMembers do not know this. This amendment is not a radical idea. As part \nof the budget resolution debate in April of 2009, the Senate voted \noverwhelmingly in support of this concept by a vote of 59 to 39. I \nbrought that up. It was a nonbinding vote, part of the budget \nresolution, 59 to 39. So many Senators have already gone on record \nsupporting that.\n  Here is also an important piece of information. In the House of \nRepresentatives, this concept passed the House Financial Services \nCommittee by a vote of 43 to 26 and was incorporated into the House \nversion of the Wall Street reform bill that was approved by the House \nlast December.\n  Again, what we are talking about is something that was passed in the \nHouse, and it is in the House bill. There is a variation. We are not \nthe same, to be honest, but the same concept--for a Fed audit--already \nexists in the Wall Street reform bill passed in the House.\n  This concept has the support of the Speaker of the House, Nancy \nPelosi, who has said Congress should ask the Fed to put this \ninformation ``on the Internet like they've done with the recovery \npackage and the budget.'' That is exactly what this amendment would do.\n  Here is another point many people don't know. A lot of this language \nis in the House bill. A lot of this language has already been supported \nin the Senate last year as part of the budget resolution. But here is \nan important point many people do not know. Bloomberg News service did \na very good job, and they have aggressively demanded, as a news \norganization, this information about who the Fed lent money to be made \npublic. As a result of their efforts, two Federal courts--not one, two \nFederal courts--have ordered the Fed to release all the names and \ndetails of the recipients of more than $2 trillion in Federal Reserve \nloans since the financial crisis as a result of a Freedom of \nInformation Act lawsuit.\n  So Bloomberg News filed suit and two Federal courts supported\n\n[[Page S3332]]\n\nBloomberg. The Fed had argued in court in opposition to Bloomberg that \nit should not have to release this information, citing, according to \nReuters--this is what the Fed said--``an exemption that it said lets \nFederal agencies keep secret various trade secrets and commercial or \nfinancial information.''\n  However, the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York disagreed. Here is \nwhat a unanimous three-judge appeals court panel wrote in their \nopinion:\n\n       To give the Fed power to deny disclosure because it thinks \n     it best to do so would undermine the basic policy that \n     disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective. If the \n     Board believes such an exemption would better serve the \n     national interest, it should ask Congress to amend the \n     statute.\n\n  This appeals court decision upheld an earlier ruling by the Southern \nFederal District Court of New York that also ordered the Fed to release \nthis information. In other words, we now have 59 Senators who, as part \nof the budget resolution, voted on this issue; 320 Members of Congress, \nthe House, and two U.S. courts that have all told the Fed in no \nuncertain terms: Give us transparency. That is what we have.\n  As I wind down and conclude my remarks, let me just simply say that I \nam thankful for all of the support, all the grassroots support from \nprogressive and conservative groups, and from my fellow Senators. The \nAmerican people have a right to know when trillions of their dollars \nare being spent and who gets it. The American people have a right to \nknow whether there are conflicts of interest.\n  I thank my colleagues--there are so many cosponsors, I will not \nmention them all--but I thank all of them.\n  Let me conclude by saying I am very proud to say we have been working \nwith Senator Dodd's office and some other offices.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3738, as Modified\n\n  I am going to ask that my amendment be modified with the changes that \nare at the desk. I am proud to say these modifications have been worked \nout with Senator Dodd and would allow the GAO to conduct a top-to-\nbottom audit of all of the Federal Reserve's emergency lending \nactivities since December 1, 2007. In addition, the modifications \nrequire the Fed to put on its Web site all of the recipients of over $2 \ntrillion in emergency assistance since December 1, 2007.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3738), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title XI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1159. GAO AUDIT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE FACILITIES; \n                   PUBLICATION OF BOARD ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) GAO Audit.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding section 714(b) of title \n     31, United States Code, or any other provision of law, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States (in this subsection \n     referred to as the ``Comptroller General'') shall conduct a \n     one-time audit of all loans and other financial assistance \n     provided during the period beginning on December 1, 2007 and \n     ending on the date of enactment of this Act by the Board of \n     Governors under the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money \n     Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Term Asset-Backed \n     Securities Loan Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, \n     the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Term Securities \n     Lending Facility, the Term Auction Facility, Maiden Lane, \n     Maiden Lane II, Maiden Lane III, the agency Mortgage-Backed \n     Securities program, foreign currency liquidity swap lines, \n     and any other program created as a result of the third \n     undesignated paragraph of section 13 of the Federal Reserve \n     Act.\n       (2) Assessments.--In conducting the audit under paragraph \n     (1), the Comptroller General shall assess--\n       (A) the operational integrity, accounting, financial \n     reporting, and internal controls of the credit facility;\n       (B) the effectiveness of the collateral policies \n     established for the facility in mitigating risk to the \n     relevant Federal reserve bank and taxpayers;\n       (C) whether the credit facility inappropriately favors one \n     or more specific participants over other institutions \n     eligible to utilize the facility;\n       (D) the policies governing the use, selection, or payment \n     of third-party contractors by or for any credit facility; and\n       (E) whether there were conflicts of interest with respect \n     to the manner in which such facility was established or \n     operated.\n       (3) Timing.--The audit required by this subsection shall be \n     commenced not later than 30 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, and shall be completed not later than 12 months \n     after that date of enactment.\n       (4) Report required.--The Comptroller General shall submit \n     a report on the audit conducted under paragraph (1) to the \n     Congress not later than 12 months after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, and such report shall be made available to--\n       (A) the Speaker of the House of Representatives;\n       (B) the majority and minority leaders of the House of \n     Representatives;\n       (C) the majority and minority leaders of the Senate;\n       (D) the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and of the \n     Committee on Financial Services of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (E) any member of Congress who requests it.\n       (b) Audit of Federal Reserve Bank Governance.--\n       (1) Audit.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall complete \n     an audit of the governance of the Federal reserve bank \n     system.\n       (B) Required examinations.--The audit required under \n     subparagraph (A) shall--\n       (i) examine the extent to which the current system of \n     appointing Federal reserve bank directors effectively \n     represents ``the public, without discrimination on the basis \n     of race, creed, color, sex or national origin, and with due \n     but not exclusive consideration to the interests of \n     agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor, and \n     consumers'' in the selection of bank directors, as such \n     requirement is set forth under section 4 of the Federal \n     Reserve Act;\n       (ii) examine whether there are actual or potential \n     conflicts of interest created when the directors of Federal \n     reserve banks, which execute the supervisory functions of the \n     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, are elected \n     by member banks;\n       (iii) examine the establishment and operations of each \n     facility described in subsection (a)(1) and each Federal \n     reserve bank involved in the establishment and operations \n     thereof; and\n       (iv) identify changes to selection procedures for Federal \n     reserve bank directors, or to other aspects of Federal \n     reserve bank governance, that would--\n\n       (I) improve how the public is represented;\n       (II) eliminate actual or potential conflicts of interest in \n     bank supervision;\n       (III) increase the availability of information useful for \n     the formation and execution of monetary policy; or\n       (IV) in other ways increase the effectiveness or efficiency \n     of reserve banks.\n\n       (2) Report required.--A report on the audit conducted under \n     paragraph (1) shall be submitted by the Comptroller General \n     to the Congress before the end of the 90-day period beginning \n     on the date on which such audit is completed, and such report \n     shall be made available to--\n       (A) the Speaker of the House of Representatives;\n       (B) the majority and minority leaders of the House of \n     Representatives;\n       (C) the majority and minority leaders of the Senate;\n       (D) the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and of the \n     Committee on Financial Services of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (E) any member of Congress who requests it.\n       (c) Publication of Board Actions.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, the Board of Governors shall publish \n     on its website, not later than December 1, 2010, with respect \n     to all loans and other financial assistance it has provided \n     during the period beginning on December 1, 2007 and ending on \n     the date of enactment of this Act under the Asset-Backed \n     Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, \n     the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, the Primary \n     Dealer Credit Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding \n     Facility, the Term Securities Lending Facility, the Term \n     Auction Facility, Maiden Lane, Maiden Lane II, Maiden Lane \n     III, the agency Mortgage-Backed Securities program, foreign \n     currency liquidity swap lines, and any other program created \n     as a result of the third undesignated paragraph of section 13 \n     of the Federal Reserve Act--\n       (1) the identity of each business, individual, entity, or \n     foreign central bank to which the Board of Governors has \n     provided such assistance;\n       (2) the type of financial assistance provided to that \n     business, individual, entity, or foreign central bank;\n       (3) the value or amount of that financial assistance;\n       (4) the date on which the financial assistance was \n     provided;\n       (5) the specific terms of any repayment expected, including \n     the repayment time period, interest charges, collateral, \n     limitations on executive compensation or dividends, and other \n     material terms; and\n       (6) the specific rationale for each such facility or \n     program.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I will just take 30 seconds. I will speak longer on this a \nlittle later. But let me thank our colleague from Vermont. He is a \nremarkable individual who brings great intelligence and passion to this \ncause. He does not get involved in every issue that comes up on the \nfloor of the Senate. I admire that. Some believe they have to have \nsomething to say about everything.\n\n[[Page S3333]]\n\nBut when Senator Sanders gets involved with something, you better \nbelieve he does it with a great deal of conviction and passion and \npurpose.\n  I am a cosponsor of this amendment he has just modified. I think it \nis absolutely correct. On the transparency issues, there are no \nexcuses. When as much American taxpayer money has been exposed as has \nbeen, we have the right to know where it is going and who is involved \nin it. There was a concern about whether the independence of the Fed \nwould be compromised. He has guaranteed in his language that is no \nlonger an issue whatsoever. I thank him for it. It is a great \namendment.\n  I know Senator Grassley wants to be heard, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, you have heard me say many times to my \ncolleagues that the public's business ought to be public. I don't know \nwhy that does not apply to the Federal Reserve, at least on its \nregulatory activities when it gives out money. There are all kinds of \nreasons it should not apply to monetary policy. But for everything \nelse, the Federal Reserve is acting at the behest of Congress through a \nlaw going way back to 1913 giving them certain powers. If Congress \nexercised these same powers--and under the Constitution we have the \nauthority to do that--it would be the public's business; in fact, even \nmore than what this amendment does. So the public's business ought to \nbe public.\n  With transparency, and that is what this amendment is all about, you \nget accountability--it seems to me, with what has happened over the \nlast 10 years, more transparency leading to accountability. If we had \nthat transparency we probably would not have had the bubble in the \nfirst place that broke in 2008, which brought us to this recession.\n  So I rise not hesitantly but forthrightly to support the pending \namendment by the Senator from Vermont. I appreciate all of his hard \nwork on making the Federal Reserve more accountable to the people of \nthis country. I am a cosponsor of his stand-alone bill, so I am glad to \nbe a cosponsor of this amendment, to bring sunshine to the Fed.\n  During the last 2\\1/2\\ years, the Fed has gone well beyond what was \nviewed as its historical authority. It has taken on more and more risk, \nin complicated and unprecedented ways. It intervened in the market to \nprop up certain firms. It intervened in the market to protect these \nfirms from failing, using an unlimited source of taxpayers' dollars to, \nin effect, pick winners and losers.\n  The risks they have taken will ultimately be borne by the American \ntaxpayers. So in the interest of accountability, the taxpayers deserve \nto have answers on who got money and how it was spent.\n  Under law, the Federal Reserve has lending authority for unusual and \nexigent circumstances. Under section 13(c) of the Federal Reserve Act, \nthe Reserve can ``discount for any individual, partnership or \ncorporation, notes, drafts and bills of exchange when such notes, \ndrafts and bills of exchange are endorsed or otherwise secured to the \nsatisfaction of the Federal Reserve bank.''\n  Essentially, this means the Fed can lend to any entity or person when \nit believes there is an emergency. This is an extraordinary amount of \npower and discretion, and it should be exercised in the light of day. \nTransparency, accountability--the public's business ought to be public. \nTrillions of dollars were provided to financial institutions and \ncorporations since the financial crisis began. The Fed helped rescue \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Fed propped up Bear Stearns and AIG \nwhen they were on the brink of failure. They intervened in the business \nefforts of Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/06/senate-section/article/S3333-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3333-S3353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TEXT OF AMENDMENTS\n\n  But how much has been doled out and to whom is still a mystery. This \namendment would allow the independent arm of Congress, the Government \nAccountability Office, to review the decisions made by the Federal \nReserve. And the Government Accountability Office is nothing but a \ngroup of professional people without a political motive and the right \ngroup to get the job done and do it on an ongoing basis. An objective \nreview of the Fed's actions will serve our country well in the future.\n  We can learn from the mistakes that may have been made. We can \ndetermine if the losses or profits from the Fed's investments help \nserve the economy well. Did the Federal Reserve act in an appropriate \nand ethical manner? Was the relationship between regulators and the \nfinancial industry too cozy, hampering the ability to make an objective \ndecision?\n  Proponents of the Federal Reserve should not consider this as a \nthreat to the independence of the Fed--an independence I support. They \nshould embrace an independent evaluation as an opportunity to improve \nits operations and, most importantly, strengthen public trust for \nfuture generations who may be faced with similar financial crises.\n  As the Senator from Vermont has made very clear, the intent of his \namendment is not to interfere in monetary policy. I share that same \nfeeling he has, and I would not support an amendment that went into \nmonetary policy. But the Fed's extraordinary power outside of monetary \npolicy should be subject to the light of day, transparency and \naccountability. The public's business ought to be public. We should \nallow the Government Accountability Office to audit the Fed since they \nhave moved far beyond their traditional and primary mission of \nconducting monetary policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator from Iowa not only for his support \nbut for his long fight for transparency. It has been a pleasure working \nwith the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleagues, \nSenators Sanders and DeMint, for putting forward, bringing this \namendment to the floor. I am a cosponsor of this amendment, along with \nseveral of my other colleagues.\n  I would say as well to my colleague from Vermont, my colleague from \nSouth Carolina, and others who are sponsors, this is an issue I hear a \nlot about when I am traveling around my State, which is often. When I \nam traveling around and listening to people, this is something people \nare concerned about. They are concerned about the monetary policy. They \nare concerned about the money system. They are concerned.\n  I would note to people, and to my colleagues in particular, that the \nCongress created the Fed, the Fed didn't create the Congress. So the \nCongress does have control over this issue, and I think we need to look \nat it and say: Let's look at what is appropriate and what is proper. \nAnd this is clearly one piece of it.\n  I think the Fed has done a number of things quite well and quite \nright. Yet I don't see any problem whatsoever with having a simple \naudit; that that is going to somehow reveal the genie in the bottle and \nlet out all of these secrets that are going to be harmful to the \ndevelopment of monetary policy. There seems to me to be a fair amount \nof overstatement on the other side of the terrible damage this audit \nwould do. That does not seem right to me. It does not seem right to my \nconstituents. My constituents look at this and say: Well, I do not want \nto harm the development of monetary policy. I want it to be wise and \ngood and sound. But I do not see how it is harmed by an audit of an \nentity that is created by the government, that is created by the \nCongress. So why shouldn't we do something like this?\n  That is why I think this is a prudent amendment. It is a good \ncommonsense amendment, and I think it will be well received by the \nconstituents of this great country who I think are pretty wise on these \nand other decisions; that as we go around, if we will listen to what \npeople are saying, I think there is a lot of wisdom in that. They are \nsaying we ought to know more about what is taking place in the Fed.\n  I know we would all like to move forward on financial regulatory \nreform legislation. I have some serious problems in this bill. I think \nthe consumer financial product piece shouldn't penalize auto dealers \nand orthodontists and others who did not cause any of these problems.\n\n[[Page S3334]]\n\n  So I have an amendment. I have other amendments I am a part of as \nwell, along with this one, that I think we need to consider before we \nmove on forward, even though I have some problem with the basis of the \nbill. I think it hits more Main Street than it does Wall Street. The \ndifficulty is that we just have different ideas and beliefs about the \nbest way to move forward, and that is normal.\n  This amendment is not just about the choices, though, that we have on \nreforming the financial sector. I believe it gets to the heart of a \nmore fundamental issue: what the American people have a right to expect \nand know from their governmental institutions.\n  The fact that this amendment is brought forward by the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Sanders, and the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint, \ntwo Members who could not be further apart on the ideological spectrum, \nshould be a sufficient warning and measure to make everyone sit up and \ntake notice of what it is that is here that is so troubling.\n  This amendment isn't about whether the legislation will put an end to \ntaxpayer-backed bailouts. It isn't about whether the legislation will \nend too big to fail. It isn't even about how to best protect the \nAmerican people and taxpayer dollars. It is about something I believe \nis even more fundamental: the accountability of governmental \ninstitutions to the people of the United States and to the Congress.\n  I think it is important, as I stated, to remember--I want to state \nthis again--one single fundamental reality in this debate: Congress \ncreated the Federal Reserve, not the other way around. We created the \nFederal Reserve System to serve the interests of the citizens of this \nNation, not to serve the interests of large financial institutions.\n  In establishing the Federal Reserve, Congress recognized the \nimportance of a central bank that could operate with independence to \nensure the orderly functioning of the banking systems and to maintain \nprice stability. That is the core function of the Fed. More recently, \nthe Federal Reserve mandate was expanded to charge them with \nmaintaining price stability and maximum employment. That was an \nexpansion piece that was added.\n  The Government Accountability Office is also a creation of Congress. \nGAO is an independent, nonpartisan agency that works for Congress. What \nis GAO's mission? GAO's mission is to support the Congress in meeting \nits constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance \nand ensure the accountability of the Federal Government for the benefit \nof the American people.\n  In my view, the real issue here is whether you believe the Congress \nhas the right to ask GAO--in many respects, our auditor--to review \nactions and activities of an institution that we, the Congress, \ncreated.\n  I certainly understand the importance of the Federal Reserve's \nindependence in the execution of monetary policy. I understand and I \nsupport that. I understand the importance of not interfering with the \noperation of the FOMC. That is not what this amendment is attempting to \ndo. That is not my intention. I am confident, as well, it is not the \nintention of the main sponsors of this amendment. But I do believe it \nis relevant to know whether the Federal Reserve is operating in a \nmanner that is consistent with its statutory authority. It is relevant \nto know whether the Federal Reserve is following its own established \nrules and procedures or whether it is just making it up as it goes \nalong. I do think it is relevant for Congress to know who was involved \nin decisions to take extraordinary measures by exercising emergency \npowers, as well as who was and was not consulted before those actions \nwere taken. Those are prudent and proper things for us to know.\n  I think it is equally important to know whether the policy statements \nand subsequent minutes of FOMC meetings accurately reflect what went on \nin those meetings.\n  Recent news reports surrounding the release of transcripts from 2004 \nmeetings of the Fed contained some serious, distressing information. \nThose reports revealed that as far as back as 2004, there were \nsignificant concerns raised by regional Reserve Bank presidents about \nan emerging housing bubble that, indeed, did emerge and burst. Did we \nsee any indication of that in the meeting minutes or the policy \nstatements? We did not. And what that tells me is the minutes did not \naccurately--I will even say they did not directly portray what went on \nin the meetings. I do not believe that is right.\n\n  Disturbingly, the transcripts reveal that the Federal Reserve Bank \npresident from Atlanta warned that:\n\n       A number of folks were expressing growing concern about \n     potential overbuilding and worrisome speculation in the real \n     estate markets, especially in Florida. Entire condo projects \n     and upscale residential lots are being pre-sold before any \n     construction, with buyers freely admitting that they have no \n     intention of occupying the units or building on the land but \n     rather are counting on ``flipping'' the properties--selling \n     them quickly at higher prices.\n\n  That is a direct quote.\n  Disconcertingly, at the same meeting, the former Chairman of the \nBoard of Governors, Alan Greenspan, made the following statement:\n\n       We run the risk, by laying out the pros and cons of a \n     particular argument, of inducing people to join in on the \n     debate, and in this regard it is possible to lose control of \n     a process that only we fully understand.\n\n  Let me repeat that quote. This is from former Chairman Greenspan:\n\n       We run the risk, by laying out the pros and cons of a \n     particular argument, of inducing people to join in on the \n     debate, and in this regard it is possible to lose control of \n     a process that only we [the Federal Reserve Board] fully \n     understand.\n\n  Now, I serve as the ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee. \nSenator DeMint is also a member of our committee. We believe in free \nmarkets and a free enterprise system. We recognize the importance of a \nstrong financial system. Yet a fundamental requirement for the orderly \noperation of free markets is transparency and accurate reporting--\ninformation. I think the suggestion that only the Federal Reserve was \ncapable of fully understanding is evidence enough that this amendment \nis necessary.\n  Congress needs to demand change and greater accountability so people \ncan have more information. What if the people had known about this \ndebate going on at the Federal Reserve as the housing bubble was \ndeveloping? How would people have acted? My guess is, they would have \nacted quite prudently, saying: The Federal Reserve is concerned about \nthis. This is legitimate information. Maybe we should pull back on \nhousing investments. Maybe we should be watching this as well.\n  I think people can get it; they need the information, though.\n  While this amendment does not address the issue of the time delay in \nreleasing transcripts, I do believe the current 5 years, which amounts \nto almost 6 in many cases, is indefensible, between the actual minutes \nand them being released--5 years between the actual minutes and their \nbeing released to the public. In my judgment, that time limit should be \nreduced to no more than 2 years. Members of this body should have had \naccess to these and other transcripts before we were asked to reconfirm \nthe current Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. I would \nsuggest it would have been helpful to have had access to this \ninformation before the housing market collapsed and before it turned \ninto a financial crisis.\n  The American people are mad at Washington. They are mad at the \ngovernmental institutions that they view as increasingly unresponsive \nand unaccountable. Let's take this step in the direction of \ntransparency, accountability, and disclosure of information. The \nAmerican people have a right to know whether their interests were \nprotected or simply placed on the back shelf. They have a right to know \nthe information.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I urge the \nFederal Reserve to work with us to address real concerns about this \namendment, rather than trying to defeat it or amend it with the purpose \nof making it a symbolic and meaningless gesture. Let's remind the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors that they are not the only people \ncapable of fully understanding issues on which all of our economic \nfuture depends.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I wish to thank the Senator from Kansas for his remarks \nand for his strong support from day one for this concept of \ntransparency of the Fed.\n\n[[Page S3335]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, as we have watched the debate the last 6 \ndays on the financial regulation reform bill, I thought it would be \ninteresting just to raise a few questions. The Congress--both the House \nand the Senate--created what was called the Financial Inquiry \nCommission. As a matter of fact, they had a meeting today. The purpose \nof that Commission--that will turn in their report in December of this \nyear--was to take a thorough and complete look at what happened to us \nin 2008--the causes, the regulatory failures, the poor incentives--and \nthen make recommendations to the Congress on what we should do.\n  The question I have for my colleagues is, we have a bill on the floor \nthat has given no credence to the Commission we created, and we are \nactually, according to the majority leader, going to finish this bill \nnext week without the benefit of that Commission's inquiry. So a couple \nquestions I would ask are, No. 1: Why? Why are we doing that? And, No. \n2--by the way, the people on that Commission are learned people with \ngreat exposure and great experience in the areas of which we are \ndiscussing--Why are we allowing the Commission to continue spending \nmoney if we are not going to pay any attention to them? Why don't we \njust end the Commission, since we have obviously decided what they are \ngoing to have to give to us is not of value as we make the decision \nabout what we need to change? I thought that is what we had the \nCommission for.\n  So I find it peculiar that in our rush to blame somebody, our rush to \ntake the focus off of where it belongs--by the way, that is right here \nin the U.S. Congress because 90 percent of what went wrong was our \nfault--our fault; that is where it lies--in our rush to shield and \nreflect that away from us, we are going to pass a bill with all sorts \nof unintended consequences of which we fully do not understand right \nnow. It is a bill that is going to treat the symptoms, not the \nunderlying disease of the financial problems we had. It rings well from \na populist standpoint, but in the long run it does a disservice to our \ncountry. That does not mean this bill may not hit it 100 percent on \nwhat this Commission recommends, but we have no idea what they are \ngoing to recommend.\n  So I think it is a great question for the public to be asking us: Why \nare we doing that? And why are we continuing a Commission that we \nobviously are not paying any attention to? One, it was created so we \ncould offload the problem. That is why we created the Commission. We \nobviously did not care what they thought because we are not going to \npay any attention to them. No. 2, we are going to continue to spend \nmoney on a Commission that we are not going to value. If we were going \nto value it, we would at least either give it a mandate to hurry up so \nwe can make appropriate decisions and use their expertise or we would \neliminate it.\n  Now to the bill that is in front of us. What really happened to us. \nThis is my opinion of what happened to us. The Congress created \nincentives to increase with ease the ability to own a home in this \ncountry. Then we created incentives through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nto do that even greater. Then we created the ability to package and \noffload what Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had taken and securitized it.\n  We wonder why people would take advantage of that. There was not one \noversight hearing on the Office of Thrift Supervision, which absolutely \nfailed in terms of loan originators. There was one hearing in 4 years \nat the SEC that had nothing to do with their oversight of the packaging \nof these incentives before they became a problem. There was no \noversight--significant oversight--on the explosive nature of \nderivatives trading in this country and around the world. We are so \nquick to point the finger at the people who took advantage of the \nincentives we set in motion.\n  So now what do we have? We have $6 trillion or $8 trillion worth of \nexposure for the U.S. taxpayer in terms of guaranteed mortgages by the \nFederal Government through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA, and we are \nhustling along so none of that ends up getting focused on us. We have a \nbill on the floor that does not address the core problem of what went \nwrong.\n  Here is the core problem of what went wrong: There were no mortgage \norigination standards that were enforced by the Federal Government, as \nthey took American taxpayers, to guarantee what was going to be an \nasset. What did we find at the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations? That in the last year before this, for one company \nalone that originated a vast majority of the loans in California--Long \nBeach Mortgage--90 percent of the mortgages were based on fraudulent \ndata.\n  OTS knew it and did not do anything about it. Why did they not do it? \nBecause they got 16 percent of their revenue from Washington Mutual, \nwho owned Long Beach Mortgage.\n  So we set up all these systems, we incentivized this system, and now \nthat it blew up in our faces--because we did not look at it, we did not \noversight it, we did not do our fiduciary responsibility--we want to be \nquick and get rid of that blame from us by pointing the finger \nsomewhere else.\n  We have minimal leverage requirements in this bill. If we are going \nto create an incentive for people to act badly, at least we ought to \nput a block somewhere else that will limit the exposure of financial \ninstitutions based on capital ratios. We have not done that. We have \nnot accomplished that in this bill. That is something that has to be \nthere. We had companies leveraging to 40 and 50 times their net worth. \nYet we are not addressing that issue to a significant extent. It is one \nsmall portion of the bill.\n  Then we are going to take a consumer protection agency--which we \ncreated the problems for--and create a massive government bureaucracy \nthat is going to filter all the way down to every small business in \nthis country and isolate that power within one individual who is not \naccountable to the Congress and not accountable to the President, and \nwe are going to say: You fix it. There will be an unlimited funding \nstream that is going to be totally out of control that is going to \nimpede and impact the freedom of Americans' ability to make a living in \nthe name of consumer protection.\n  If you think I am giving a speech to protect the banks, you are \nwrong. I like them about as much as I like insurance companies. But we \nhave to think about what we are doing, and we ought to be about fixing \nthe real disease. That real disease is us--us not doing oversight, us \nnot being responsible for the legislation we created, and setting up \nincentives, and then yawn as it goes awry and point our fingers \nsomewhere else.\n  There is no question we need to change the regulatory structure in \nthis country. But there is something we need to change more than the \nregulatory structure; that is, the demand on the Congress to start \ndoing its job in terms of oversight. We are quick to whip a bill out \nwhen it is politically expedient to do it and create a whipping boy, or \nseveral whipping boys, and say we are addressing things. But it is kind \nof like the pea under the three walnut shells. You never know where the \npea is. The reason you never know is because there is not really even a \npea there. There was when it started, but it went away. Then it gets \nput back.\n  So we are playing the game. We are playing the American people that \nwhat we are doing is substantive, and that, in fact, it is going to \nenhance capital formation, when what we are doing is going to decrease \ncapital formation.\n  We have one section in this bill that says every small bank in \nOklahoma--if they write a mortgage and sell it, forever they have to \nkeep 5 percent of it. Well, if they are a small capitalized bank, guess \nwhat they are going to do. They are never going to create another \nmortgage in Oklahoma. So we are going to concentrate all the mortgages \nin the big banks in the country. That is why Goldman Sachs loves this \nbill. That is why Citibank loves the bill. We are not making the big \nbanks smaller; we are making the big banks bigger. We are going to \nundercut the small and\n\n[[Page S3336]]\n\nmedium-sized banks in the country because we are going to put a 5-\npercent retention on every mortgage they write, when, in fact, all we \nwould have to say is: If you write a mortgage and you package it and \nsell it, there is recourse back to you, the originator of the loan; \nthat mortgage, when it becomes nonperforming, comes back to you. That \nis all we have to do. That does not tie up their capital. That does not \nlimit their incentive to create housing in our own regional markets \nthat is made available with capital in those regional markets.\n  No, we are going to make the big boys bigger. All the regulation that \nis in this bill none of the big banks will ever have a problem with. \nThey already have thousands and thousands of staff to handle government \nregulation. They will not add a person. But every small community bank \nin this country, every small financial institution in this country, is \ngoing to drown in the requirements of this bill.\n  I know the chairman of the Banking Committee has worked hard to try \nto bring a forth bill. I know there have been great deliberations with \nmany from our side of the aisle on the bill. But I think we have thrown \ncommon sense out the window. The motives are good. The goal--fix the \nproblem--is good. But if we treat the symptoms of this and convince the \nAmerican people we have fixed it when, in fact, we have not, when we \nhave not eliminated too big to fail--because we are going to make the \nbig banks bigger--what we are going to see is a further decline in \nconfidence.\n  In the name of fixing things, we are going to be taking massive \namounts of freedom away from small businesses in this country. We are \ngoing to take discretion away from capital risk that has minimal risk \nto the country but has every bit of risk to the person lending the \ncapital. We are even going to take away ``sugar daddy'' investors who \nare the only hope for some ideas--not venture capitalists. We are going \nto take away the ability for somebody to come in and say: I will invest \nin 40 percent of your business and give you the capital to try \nsomething. We have actually created requirements for that.\n  As we look at what we are about to do, the American people ought to \nask three questions, three very important questions: No. 1, does it fix \nthe problem? No. 2, does it grow the government and require increased \nspending? And, No. 3, is there anything to make you think--since we \nwere regulating all these industries already--the Congress might \noversight the next set of regulations we put out there to fix this \nproblem? I think the answer to that--all three of those questions--is \nno. I am in a minority, I understand that.\n  I said previously, I think we ought to change the regulations in this \ncountry. I think we also ought to eliminate too big to fail by making \nthose that are too big become so small they won't make a difference if \nthey do fail. We ought to create the market circumstances that would \nforce that to happen. But this bill doesn't do that. This bill won't do \nthat.\n\n  So as we go through this rather large bill, which I think has had \nthree or four accepted amendments thus far and which is 1,409 pages \nlong, one of the other questions we ought to be asking is how many \nMembers have read the entire bill. How many Members understand what is \nin the bill? How many Members can have the capability to anticipate the \nunintended consequences of what is in the bill? I think we will find \nthe answer to that is zero. Yet we are in a hurry to do this for a \npolitical reason.\n  So I will go back to what I started on. We created the Financial \nInquiry Commission. What are we going to do with it? What happens if \nthey come out in December and say everything we did was wrong? Why did \nwe create it? I would love to read back some of the speeches that were \ngiven on this floor about why we were creating it, because we had to \nknow what went wrong. Now we have a commission that has been charged to \ntell us what went wrong, but we are going to ignore them. We are going \nto pass a bill before they have even completed their hearings.\n  I think it is no wonder the country has a low level of confidence in \nour deliberations, because they don't make sense to the average \nAmerican. They understand the political spin. They understand pinning \nthe tail on the donkey. They understand placing blame so you can \ndeflect it from yourself. They get all that. They see it and they see \nright through it. But we are creatures of habit.\n  There are good things in this bill. Let me end on that. The \nelimination of the Office of Thrift Supervision had to happen. The \nreason they were ineffective is they got their money from the very \npeople they were supervising and when their biggest customer is doing \nsomething wrong, rather than lose some of their revenue, they turn \ntheir eye the other way. Consequently, billions and billions and \nbillions of dollars out of Washington Mutual became junk. Most of it \nwas junk to begin with. It is the concept of greed.\n  Other good things: Changing the rating agencies and what they are \naccountable for. This bill goes in a direction different than I would \nhave gone, but the point is there needs to be a change. They need to \nnot get paid by the very people who are asking them to rate something \nthey are getting ready to sell, and they ought to be paid by the person \nwho is getting ready to buy what they are getting ready to sell, so the \naccountability will be there. But we haven't done that.\n  We recovered, and our recovery from this financial fiasco is because \nof the resilience of the American people. The price is enormous, with \nhaving 14 million people unemployed. That is a tremendous price to pay. \nThe loss in terms of dignity, the loss in terms of the ability to \nprovide for your family, the loss of losing the skill set you had and \nno longer can find a job to do it is a tremendous price that has been \npaid. But the American people are resilient. What they don't want to \ntolerate, however, is a Congress that fails to recognize and continues \nto repeat mistakes of the past.\n  We can say, Well, we have been working on this for 6 months. We have. \nThere have been negotiations going on for a long time. My question is, \nDo we have the answers? Do we know what the answers are? And if the \nanswer to that question is yes, then let's disband the Financial \nInquiry Commission right now. Let's not waste those folks' time. Let's \nnot spend another penny of Federal taxpayers' money if we think we \nalready have the answers. We are going to do just as we do on every \nother program: We are going to create another one and we are going to \nkeep spending on the first one.\n  Needless to say, I think this bill is fixable. I think we ought to \naddress the real key issues: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Why are we not \naddressing them? Because we don't want to put out the bucks, the cost \nto do that. That is why. That is why we are not addressing it. We know \nthe issues.\n  We have taken an unlimited amount of our kids' money and put it in \nexposure and we have given an absolute implicit and implied guarantee \nto both of those organizations. The President in late December took \noffice, and they are now buying back close to $400 billion worth of \nmortgages from the Treasury--nonperforming mortgages--and our kids are \ngoing to pay all that back. It will be 20 or 30 years before any of \nthat property actually reaches the level at which it was sold.\n  So what is coming next? What is coming next is we are going to \nmandate principal reduction on mortgages across this country. Who does \nthat impact? What that says is that everybody who paid their mortgage \non time and kept up with their payments by making tremendous sacrifices \nother places, guess what. You are going to get to pay for the mortgage \nof everybody who didn't through your taxes and through your kids' \ntaxes. You acted responsibly, but what is coming down the pike is we \nare going to lift the load for those who didn't. You met your \nobligations. You signed the contract on the bottom line, and those who \nwere less fortunate than you, you now are going to get to pay for them \ntoo. That is what is coming. Mark my words. You will hear it before \nNovember. That is what is coming through the HAMP, through the 40-\npercent reduction in the principal amount on many of these mortgages.\n  So what is going on? We are rushing the financial reform bill that \ndoesn't attack the three major underlying diseases of the financial \nsystem, and then right after we pass that, we are going to force \nprincipal reductions on hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of\n\n[[Page S3337]]\n\nmortgages, on which you, the taxpayer, are going to pick up the bill. \nThat is what is coming. We are going to hear that it is not. That is \nwhat is coming.\n  Watch carefully what we do. Watch how we spin things. Watch how we \ncreate demons when, in fact, we are the source of the problem. Watch \nhow we point our fingers at others whom we incentivized to take \nadvantage of systems we created and say, Oh, no, we are not culpable at \nall. Oh, it wasn't us. We did all the oversight hearings. We changed \nit.\n  When we saw the writing on the wall, we didn't do any of that. The \nCongress created this mess, and we are going to continue to act in the \nsame way that is going to create more. Because we are going to create a \nwhole new set of regulations and then we are not going to have the \noversight hearings: Are you doing it? Where is the metrics? How do we \nmeasure whether you are doing it? Are you, Mr. Bureaucrat, doing what \nthe Congress directed? As a matter of fact, we don't even put in the \nregulations. We let somebody else write the regulations. We are so \nknowledgeable that we are getting ready to fix this problem, and \nbesides the fact the Financial Inquiry Commission hasn't said anything \nto us yet about what the causes are and the potential solutions, but we \nare not even going to write the regulations, just as we didn't in the \nhealth care bill. The Department of HHS is going to write 1,690 \nregulations on the health care industry in this country. The same thing \nis going to happen in this bill.\n  As I say, I hope we can fix the bill because I think we need to make \nmajor changes. There are some good things in this bill.\n  We are in danger of losing what confidence is left of the American \npeople in our actions. We ought to be asking the right questions for \nthe right reasons that shouldn't have anything to do with politics, \nshouldn't have anything to do with partisanship, and ought to have \neverything to do with what is the best, right solution for our country \nin the long run.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have come to speak in support of the \nSanders amendment. I am intrigued by my colleague's presentation, so I \nwill respond to a bit of it. There are a couple of areas where we agree \nand some where I profoundly disagree, but let me start with the \nagreement.\n  When my colleague says, If you are too big to fail, you are too big \nand you ought to get smaller, I fully agree with that. I have an \namendment that says if you are too big to fail--judged by the council \nin this bill that you are too big to fail, at that point you require \nthe breaking up or the paring back of whatever is necessary of that \ninstitution to bring it below the level at which its failure would \ncause a moral jeopardy or an unacceptable risk to this country's entire \neconomy. If we end this process and too big to fail still exists--that \nis, we have companies that are, in fact, too big to fail--then we will \nhave failed, in my judgment.\n  Too big to fail means you are too big. We have broken up Standard Oil \ninto 23 pieces and it turns out that 23 pieces are more valuable than \nthe whole. AT was broken up. I am not interested in breaking up \ncompanies for the sake of it, but I am saying this: We know what has \nhappened.\n  This chart shows what has happened to the largest financial \ninstitutions in this country. It shows that with respect to assets and \nliabilities, the top six commercial financial institutions in this \ncountry have gotten bigger, bigger, bigger, and much, much, much \nbigger. Does that cause jeopardy to this country? Well, if you have \nbeen awake the last few years to watch $700 billion be pledged to avoid \na calamitous event to this economy, then you understand that this is \ntoo big and something has to be done about it. Create early warnings? \nNo, I don't think so. Stop signs? How about deciding that if you are \ntoo big, you are too big, and you have to pare back those portions of \nyour institution that make you too big to fail and a moral hazard to \nthis country that is an unacceptable risk to the future of this \neconomy.\n  Here is another chart that shows about the same thing. It shows the \ngrowth of these institutions going back to 1995. It is relentless, \naggressive growth. If we end this without having addressed it, we will \nnot have been able--we won't be able to tell the American people: We \ntook care of too big to fail. So I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma \non that point.\n  Where we disagree is the notion that the problem here is us. Well, I \nwill tell my colleagues what. The ``us'' bears plenty of \nresponsibility, but let me talk about the ``us.'' It wasn't the ``us'' \nwho decided in Countrywide Mortgage, which was the largest single \nmortgage company in this country, to write liars' loans, to decide to \nsay to people, Hey, you want to get some money from us? We are a big \ncompany. We are making a lot of fees. We are paying a lot of money to \nour executives and we want you to come to us. In fact, I have an ad \nthey ran, Countrywide, the biggest mortgage company in the country. \nHere is the ad: Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \nmortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? Call us. We \nhave money for you. Are you a bad risk? Are you a bad person? You can't \npay your bills? Come to us.\n  It wasn't the Congress that did that, I would say to my friend. This \nwas Countrywide Mortgage. By the way, the guy who ran this organization \ngot off with $200 million. So he is now under criminal investigation. \nBut don't suggest to me that somehow that was the responsibility of \nsomebody other than the guy running the company that puts up ads such \nas: Zoom Credit. It says: You have been bankrupt, slow credit, no \ncredit, can't pay? Who cares? That is what was advertised to the \nAmerican people. That wasn't somebody in this Chamber going out and \nsaying, Hey, how about letting us give you a loan if you have bad \ncredit. Was it somebody in this Chamber who decided we are going to \ncreate credit default swaps? That is like saying ``the devil made me do \nit'' from the old TV show. No, no, no. It was a group of people who are \nhigh fliers, hotshots, wearing silk shirts and monogrammed sleeves, and \nthey go out and create all of these exotic instruments such as credit \ndefault swaps, and they weren't enough; they have to do synthetic or \nnaked default swaps with no insurable interest on the other side of the \ntransaction. It was simply wagering. It had nothing to do with \ninvestment. It wasn't somebody in this Chamber who said please do this. \nIt was the most unbelievable greed and avarice I have ever seen in the \nhistory of this country by a lot of folks. It created big \ninstitutions--I am not saying everybody did it, but enough did it to \nimperil this country's economy and to require emergency action to, as \nthe Treasury Secretary then said, ``save the American economy.''\n\n  All this was going on. Everybody was having a carnival and making \nlots of money. In 2008, Wall Street had a net loss of $35 billion and \npaid bonuses of $16 billion. I got a master's degree in business. I \nwent to business school. There is no place that teaches that--to go \nlose a bunch of money and then pay huge bonuses. This was a carnival of \ngreed that went on in this country and steered this country right into \na ditch.\n  When my colleagues say it is government that did that, I am sorry, \nthat is flatout wrong. What government did--and they did it for a \nnumber of years in the last decade--is they hired a bunch--and the \nprevious administration is especially responsible--of regulators who \ndidn't like government and didn't want to regulate. One of the key \npeople who came to this town in a key position of regulatory \nresponsibility said: Hey, this is a new day. This is a business-\nfriendly place. Understand that. We are going to be willfully blind \nhere for a number of years. So do what you want; we won't watch and we \ndon't care.\n  So the responsibility for regulatory authority is not in this \nChamber.\n  I am not somebody who comes here to blame previous administrations \nvery often, but when the Bush administration came to office--about the \nsame time that Gramm-Leach-Bliley, by the way, with the support of the \nClinton administration, repealed Glass-Steagall and said you can create \nbig financial holding companies as big as you want and you can merge \ninvestment banks with commercial banks and security sales, and you can \ndo it all--a one-stop financial shop. It will be great, and we will \ncall it modern. About the time that passed--over my\n\n[[Page S3338]]\n\nobjections, as I was one of eight Senators who voted no, and I was out \nhere six, eight times opposing it--about that time, we had a new \nadministration come in and say: We are going to put regulators in place \nwho have no interest in watching what you do, so do what you want. They \nput out naked credit default swaps and trillions of dollars for them. \nWho cares? If you want to increase your leverage from 12 times, to 20 \ntimes, to 30 times your capital, fine. We will have a meeting in the \nbasement of the SEC, and we will, just like that, approve you to be \nable to increase your leverage to 30 times your capital. And it will \nhardly be reported by anybody because we are not watching anything. \nThey were blind regulators--dead blind. Unbelievable.\n  Don't blame this on someone else. We can blame it on bad legislation \na decade ago. That is fair. Those who were making bad loans and taking \nbig checks to the bank and filling it with millions of dollars were \ndoing it because they were greedy and nobody was willing to stop them. \nThat avalanche of greed built into a bubble of speculation that really \ninjured this country and nearly ran it off a cliff.\n  By the way, at the same time all of this was happening in the last 15 \nyears or so, the financial institutions decided they were going to \nsecuritize everything. Doesn't matter; find some debt, and we have \npeople who can roll it into a security. Once they do that, they can \nsell it three, four times, to an investment bank, to a hedge fund, you \nname it, and they can get a rating agency--because the investment banks \npay the costs of the rating agencies that rate their securities, which \nis a pretty big conflict of interest--to help roll these forward, and \nnobody has any skin in the game.\n  My colleague talks about how unfair it would be to ask somebody to \nsave at least a portion of a loan they are providing. Do you know what? \nThe only way you have proper underwriting of loans in this country is \nif you sit across the table from somebody who wants to get a loan and \nlook at their credit reports and determine if they are eligible. The \nonly way you ever ensure that happens the right way is to have that \nkind of underwriting, and you would do that if you are going to have \nsome continuing risk.\n  But if you are going to give a $750,000 loan to somebody who makes \n$17,000 a year--and it happened, by the way--a liar's loan, requiring \nno documentation, with no interest or principal paid because he put it \nall on the back side--if you can sell that in a security to somebody \nelse and you have no further risk, you get your money free and clear. \nThat is what was going on at every single level. It was just the most \nunbelievable, irresponsible lack of regulation, perhaps, in the history \nof this country.\n  I want to say that the government has made plenty of mistakes, but \ndon't blame this Chamber or people who were elected to the Senate for \nthe bad behavior of somebody who takes $200 million away from the \nbiggest mortgage finance company in this country and was selling liar's \nloans and advertising that if you have bad credit, no credit, slow \ncredit, and bankruptcy, come to us, we are going to give you money. \nDon't blame that on somebody else. Put that blame where it rests--the \nunbelievable greed among the people who should have known better and \nshould not have been able to do it in the first place because the \nregulators should have been all over them in a moment, saying: You \ncannot do it. That didn't happen.\n  This demonstrates the need for effective regulation. The free market \nsystem works, but when people try to subvert it, when people commit \nfouls in the free market system, it needs a referee with a whistle and \na striped shirt. That was missing in the last decade.\n  Mr. President, one final point. Part of this argument is excusing \ncriminal behavior because there wasn't a cop on the beat. Don't excuse \nthe criminal behavior. We need cops on the beat. We need legislation \nthat will make sure we close the loopholes that exist. We need to \nlegislate soberly and thoughtfully and give the American people some \nnotion that this behavior cannot happen again.\n  By the way, I think the way we do that is to make certain you cannot \nbe too big to fail. By what justification should the major financial \ncompanies of this country continue this kind of concentration and \nescalation of size in a manner that jeopardizes this country should \nthey fail? By what justification should we allow that to continue? The \nanswer is that it should not.\n  There are two amendments to address that I am aware of--one by \nSenators Brown and Kaufman, which creates a numerical limit on size, \nand I fully support. The other one, which I prefer because it has my \nname on it, is to flatout break up firms that have gotten too big to \nfail to the point where they are not too big to fail. That is the most \neffective way, in my judgment, to do this.\n  I will speak ever so briefly about the Sanders amendment. I got \nsidetracked by my colleague from Oklahoma, as is so often the case.\n  My colleague from Vermont has offered a piece of legislation that I \nthink has great merit. Let me tell you what it doesn't do. It does not, \nas those who fear the amendment say, invoke the tentacles of the U.S. \nCongress in the construction of monetary policy. That area belongs to \nthe Federal Reserve Board.\n  The Federal Reserve Board is a creature of legislation that Congress \ncreated. If you went back and read the debate, the country was assured \nthat this was not creating a strong central bank. There were just lead \npipe assurances to that, but, of course, that turned out not to be the \ncase. Nonetheless, the Federal Reserve Board creates monetary policy, \nand there is a thought--and I agree with it--that we don't want \nmonetary policy created on the floor of the Senate. We don't want to \nintrude on the creation or development of monetary policy. We do fiscal \npolicy, the taxing and spending side. The monetary side is the Federal \nReserve Board's terrain.\n  But the Federal Reserve Board ought not be unaccountable to anybody \nfor anything. The Federal Reserve Board, it seems to me, deserves, No. \n1, to be audited properly--a Government Accountability Office audit--\nwhich the Sanders amendment would require. And I know the Fed is having \nan apoplectic seizure thinking that maybe this amendment will pass. You \nknow what. It is the right thing to do, to say at long, long last, \nthere should be an audit of the Federal Reserve Board. I am not talking \nabout auditing monetary policy but what it does generally. It is \nnecessary, and I support this and think it is the right policy.\n  No. 2, this legislation does what I and many others have been pushing \nthe Fed for, for some while. Last July of 2009, I had a letter signed \nby 10 of my colleagues to Chairman Bernanke saying: You have now used \nyour emergency powers for the first time in U.S. history to open your \nloan window to investment banks, as never before in the history of our \ncountry. Serious financial problems, you say? Open the loan window and \ncome and get some money. So we write and say: OK, you did that on an \nemergency basis for the first time in our history. What was the result? \nWho got the money? What were the terms and the conditions?\n\n  The American people deserved to have that information. I wrote again \non March 19 of this year. On both occasions, we received letters from \nChairman Bernanke that were polite, thoughtful, but that said: You know \nwhat. We don't intend to provide you or the American people information \nabout what happened at our loan window. We don't intend to talk about \nthe loans we gave to investment banks for the first time in history.\n  I wonder--and this is idle curiosity--did we have investment banks \nshow up at this window and get near zero interest rate loans and then \ninvest them back into Treasury bonds? How much money did they make on \nthat transaction? I know many of these organizations--the largest \ninvestment banks--are now making record profits. But it is not as a \nresult of loaning money to businesses in this country that need the \nlending; it is by trading securities--once again, right back in the \nsame trench.\n  This legislation that my colleague, Senator Sanders, has offered is \nlegislation that will put in law a requirement that the Federal Reserve \nBoard disclose the activities, in a certain period of time, of who \nreceived the lending from the Federal Reserve Board, what the \nconditions were, and what the amounts of funding were.\n\n[[Page S3339]]\n\n  The Chairman of the Fed, who said this might make it very difficult \nand it will undermine this and that, undermine these programs, publicly \nreleasing names--look, two Federal courts have required the Federal \nReserve Board to do this. Two Federal courts--the district court and \nthe appellate court--have said the Federal Reserve Board does not have \nthe authority to withhold this information. The Federal Reserve Board \nhas once again said: It doesn't matter, we intend to appeal again. \nThey, apparently, intend to keep this tied up in the court system as \nlong as they can. This amendment in this piece of legislation will say \nto the Federal Reserve Board: You cannot do that. The law requires you \nto disclose to the American people what you have done.\n  I come here to say I think this is a good bill. I had introduced a \nseparate amendment on the disclosure by the Fed, but if we pass the \nSanders amendment, that will take care of my amendment. Some people \ntalked earlier about duplicates. Mine will be taken care of if we pass \nthe larger amendment offered by Senator Sanders.\n  I support the amendment. I know a good many of my colleagues will \ntoo. It has been a long time to try to get an audit of the Federal \nReserve Board--not an audit of the monetary policy but an audit of the \nFederal Reserve Board. But if we do that, this will be a significant \nstep forward for those of us who believe that is necessary and \nimportant for the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I join Senator Dorgan and Senator Sanders \nin the amendment to audit the Federal Reserve.\n  Let me begin with a perspective on what happened in the stock market \ntoday. Clearly, someone got it wrong, and it created a domino effect of \none thing falling after another, and before we knew it, the stock \nmarket was down 1,000 points. Fortunately, it climbed back up before it \nclosed today.\n  It reminds us how volatile, how vulnerable we are in a world where so \nmany systems are involved with our financial system.\n  It is good Congress is looking at financial reform. I only regret we \nare not dealing with the real causes of our financial crisis.\n  Wall Street is clearly jittery. We can see that from the stock market \ntoday. Everyone is waiting for the dominos to fall. We see what is \nhappening in Greece, one country that continued to spend more than it \nwas bringing in until it went bankrupt. Unfortunately, the American \npeople are on the hook for yet another bailout, not even a bailout in \nthis country but billions of American tax dollars are headed for Greece \nright now.\n  As other European countries head toward bankruptcy, last year in this \nCongress we created another credit line for the International Monetary \nFund to be drawn down. The real irony is, we are borrowing money from \ncountries such as China in order to bail out other countries in the \nworld at a time when the United States is carrying $13 trillion of debt \nand projections of tens of trillions of more dollars in the future. It \nis clearly unsustainable.\n  The stock market and investors have a reason to be jittery, and \nAmericans have a reason to be angry. We saw what the failure of large \ngovernment organizations such as Fannie Mae did and how it cost \nAmericans trillions of dollars. People who had been saving and \ninvesting all their lives found out almost overnight that the system \nthey counted on and that we were supposed to oversee was not what they \nthought it was, and suddenly wealth was gone.\n  If Fannie Mae could do that much damage to our country, that is small \nin comparison to what would happen if the Federal Reserve does it \nwrong.\n  The Constitution gives Congress the responsibility for our monetary \npolicy. Congress, years ago, delegated that to an independent agency we \ncall the Federal Reserve. But we are still responsible for monetary \npolicy. If something is done wrong with that policy, all we worked for \nin this country, everyone's savings and investments, everyone's wealth, \nnot only in this country but because we are the reserve currency for \nthe world, the whole economic system of the world is resting on top of \nwhat the Federal Reserve does.\n  The fact is, while it is our responsibility to oversee monetary \npolicy, we do not know what the Federal Reserve is doing. Keep in mind, \nwe were assured only months before Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \ncollapsed--and, by the way, we bailed them out and Freddie Mac for \nanother $10 billion this week--only months before they collapsed, we \nwere told by Chairman Bernanke at the Federal Reserve and many other \neconomic experts that there was no problem. But there was a problem. \nThe real problem was we did not know it, and that was a company created \nby this Congress. It was our responsibility to oversee it, and we did \nnot carry out our responsibility.\n  We need an independent Federal Reserve. We do not need political \nmanipulation and second-guessing of our monetary policy. But we do not \nneed a secret Federal Reserve. We have to know what they are doing if \nwe are going to be responsible for what they are doing. It is not going \nto be enough if they do something wrong and we point our finger at them \nand say it was their fault because it is our responsibility.\n  For years, the Federal Reserve has been avoiding any kind of audit, \nany kind of accountability, any kind of transparency. Every time we ask \nfor any type of disclosure, they say we are violating their \nindependence. We are not violating their independence by this amendment \nproposed by Senator Sanders. All we are doing is uncloaking the secrecy \nthat exists within the Federal Reserve.\n  It is important to know what we do know. We know the Federal Reserve \nhas bailed out Bear Stearns and AIG. The taxpayers are stuck holding \nfailed bets on everything from toxic subprime mortgages to strip malls \nand hotels. Thanks to the bailouts, taxpayers now own stakes in \nbankrupt Hilton hotels in Malaysia, Russia, and Singapore. I am not \nsure that is what the Congress had in mind when they started the \nFederal Reserve.\n  The Federal Reserve owns part of the Civic Opera building in Chicago \nand the Crossroads Mall in Oklahoma City. I thought it was bad when the \nFed was printing money to keep up the government's shopping spree, but \nI never expected they would buy a mall to go shopping in.\n  They say it is over when the fat lady sings. Well, now the Fed has an \nopera house ready for her singing.\n  Americans deserve to know if the Federal Reserve is being honest with \nthe Congress and with the American people. We know what they say behind \nclosed doors does not square with what they say publicly.\n  Recently released transcripts show, in 2004, members of the Federal \nReserve publicly downplayed specific concerns they discussed internally \nabout the coming housing crisis. They knew we had a problem. At that \ntime, Chairman Alan Greenspan said, if they were to encourage the \npublic to talk about it ``it's possible to lose control of a process \nthat only we fully understand.'' Meanwhile, they were telling the \nCongress and the public everything was fine.\n  By doing that, they cost millions of Americans a lifetime of savings, \nand they are still struggling. Millions of people are out of work \nbecause of mismanagement by the Federal Reserve. Yet they seem to think \nthey require no supervision, no accountability, no transparency. We \nneed to end that with this amendment today.\n  Within 30 days of the President signing this amendment that has been \nproposed, the Federal Reserve will have to tell us who got all this \nbailout money, how much they got and the reasoning for giving it and \nwhat terms of repayment there are. It is a pretty simple request. True \nfinancial reform must include a full audit of the Federal Reserve and a \nbreakup and a winddown of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. But the people \nwho run the government are not willing to hold the government \ninstitutions responsible.\n  Those who understand what happened in this financial crisis know that \nthe easy money policy of the Federal Reserve, Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac buying subprime mortgages and securitizing them and selling them \nall over the world were a large part of the meltdown of our financial \nsystem. Yet this financial reform bill we are talking about does not \neven address the real causes of our financial meltdown.\n\n[[Page S3340]]\n\nOne thing we can do if we adopt this amendment is make sure there is \nmore transparency, more accountability at the Federal Reserve.\n  As I already mentioned yesterday, Freddie Mac posted an $8 billion \nloss. That is now fully owned by the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment is clearly mismanaging Freddie Mac, and they asked for \nanother $10 billion bailout from the taxpayers. This time that does not \nhave to go through Congress. President Obama has taken the caps off \nanything that can go to these bankrupt companies. Billions of dollars \nare going to flow from taxpayers directly to these government-owned \nentities.\n  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae together have lost at least $126.9 billion \nso far. It is pretty amazing in a time when this country is overcome \nwith debt. There is no end in sight. There is no cap on how much \ntaxpayers can bail them out. Yet they are not even mentioned in this \nfinancial reform bill. We heard about greed on Wall Street, but we have \nnot even addressed the greed within the government and within the \ngovernment agencies.\n  The Democratic House Financial Services chairman, Barney Frank, does \nnot think these government-run institutions are good candidates for \nreform. He wrote a memo to the White House saying they were ``being \nmanaged responsibly and aren't doing any further economic damage.'' \nFortunately, Senator McCain has an amendment to address this issue, and \nI hope it is adopted. But if there is one place the blame can be placed \nfor this financial meltdown, it comes back to Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac.\n  Wall Street certainly deserves a lot of the blame for the financial \ncrisis because they took advantage of a lot of the mismanagement in \ngovernment to their own benefit. But the Federal Reserve, Freddie Mac, \nand Fannie Mae also deserve a lot of the blame, and they should be \naddressed as well.\n  The Sanders amendment at least begins the process in letting us know \nwhat the Federal Reserve is doing. The audit-the-Fed amendment has more \nthan 300 cosponsors in the House and 32 in the Senate. It is supported \nby a broad spectrum of political groups from FreedomWorks all the way \nto very liberal groups. Within the Senate, if America wants bipartisan \nactivity, it could not be more bipartisan than Bernie Sanders and Jim \nDeMint.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. Let's reform not \nonly the financial system but our own house, and that includes the \nFederal Reserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise to speak very briefly, following \nthe comments of my colleague from South Carolina on the pending \namendment that I know has received broad bipartisan support. I also \nwish to comment on what happened in the market today.\n  The stock market was down about 347 points. But what was more telling \nwas the stock market, at one point today, approached a loss of 1,000 \npoints which, if it had held, would have been the largest single-day \nloss in modern history.\n  There were a number of causes. My colleague mentioned some clear \nconcerns about the crisis in Greece. What it appears to be in terms of \nreal-time reporting going on right now is that part of this precipitous \ndrop took place because it appears there was a technology glitch on an \norder put in that had no backguard or safeguards to stop it.\n  I am going to quickly go into an area that is actually the expertise \nof Senator Kaufman. I know Senator McCain's amendment will be up in a \nmoment.\n  I have heard, while sitting in that chair, my friend, the Senator \nfrom Delaware, come to this floor time and again to talk about the \nchallenges that have been created in the marketplace with the increased \nuse of high-speed trading, flash trading, colocation, sponsored \naccess--a whole series of technical terms but terms that we may have \nseen the first inkling today with what happens when these tools of \ntechnology do not work the way they are supposed to.\n  I ask my friend, the Senator from Delaware, who has spent time on \nthis issue much more than I, today we saw--and I have become a believer \nand I know the SEC has started moving forward on the flash trading \nissue, but there is a series of other activities that as we go through \nthis financial reform bill, we at least need to have more facts. I \nbelieve the SEC needs to have the resources to keep up with the \nmarketplace. We saw a living, breathing real-time example of the \npotential catastrophe that could take place if we do not have the \nability to adequately use the technology and have safeguards and \nrealize how some of these firms are using this technology to get an \nadvantage over the everyday Main Street investor.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, the Senator from Virginia right from \nthe beginning has been sympathetic. Because of his great knowledge on \nWall Street and finance, he has been a great source of encouragement to \nme. I have spoken on this floor repeatedly, and this is not a surprise. \nIf this turns out to be the worst case of what we are talking about--we \ndo not know.\n  What happened over the years is that we basically went from a market \nthat was a floor-based market to a market that was digitalized and \ndecimalized, where we began to have tenths using decimals as opposed to \neighths. What happened is that markets, computer firms--if you want to \nread a great story, a book called ``The Quants,'' by Scott Patterson. \nPeople came into the market and began to develop these high-speed \ncomputers. Human beings were no longer doing the trading, computers \nwere. They developed these algorithms. It ran automatically. It grew \nand grew, and now it is something like--they went from 30 percent to 70 \npercent of all the trades on our markets are in this high-frequency \ntrading, using these high speed computers. There is no way to know what \nis going on. They trade 2,000 to 3,000 shares in a second. No one knows \nwhat is happening in the exchanges when this trading is going on. No \none knows.\n\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission has said--after repeated \nrequests--that we are going to go look at market structure. This is \nmonths ago. They say we are going to look into this. Now they are \nhaving a group look into it. Right now, there is no way to know what is \nhappening in this marketplace. All we have been requesting from the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission is that they take a look at what is \nhappening.\n  Remember, you have 2,000 to 3,000 trades a second. The only records \nthat are kept are of the actual trades. But 90 percent--to let you know \nhow complicated this is--90 percent of the trades are canceled. Why are \nthey doing that? There are a lot of allegations about why they are \ndoing this and what is going on, but right now we have this gigantic \nbusiness--70 percent of our trading--and we have no idea what is going \non.\n  I will say one final thing, because it reflects on this bill. What \nwill happen if we allow our banks to be mingled with our investment \nbanks and don't put some kind of cap on it? That is my big concern. \nInvestment banks are into high risk things, and that is where most of \nthese things are taking place. If you go back and look at derivatives, \nwhat we had under derivatives is a whole lot of money. Nobody argues, \nderivatives are gigantic. This is now gigantic. You had a lot of \nchange. We went from very few derivatives to massive numbers of them. \nWe went from 30 to 70 percent of all our trades being high frequency \ntrading. We have no transparency as we have with derivatives. We didn't \nknow what was going on in the derivatives market. We had no regulation, \nbecause you don't know what the trades are. And what happened? We had \nthis gigantic meltdown.\n  I am saying that I totally agree with the Senator from Virginia. We \nhave a very dangerous situation.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will wrap up very quickly.\n  We saw today, for example, in a matter of a moment or two, Procter & \nGamble--one of America's premier companies--fall from $60 to $39. We \nsaw another company fall from around $30 to a penny stock. This was not \nthe result of a market, this was the result of, I believe, some lack of \noversight. There is nobody in this Chamber who is more of an advocate \nof technology and the powerful tool that technology can be, but we are \nseeing what the Senator from Delaware has been an early leader on. I \nhave listened to his speeches for\n\n[[Page S3341]]\n\nmonths, and everything in my gut says he is onto something here.\n  I have asked the chairman of the Banking Committee to make sure as \nthis piece of legislation proceeds that we make sure that whether it is \na study, whether it is an appropriate question of the SEC, this high \nspeed, high frequency trading, colocation, sponsored access, all of \nthese series of tools that seem to give the big guys a slightly bigger \nadvantage over the everyday investor, be an appropriate subject of some \nadditional study.\n  We may disagree about how we go into the last crisis, but I believe \nthe Senator from Delaware is potentially on to what could be the next \ncrisis. I think we perhaps saw a little window into that possibility \ntoday when the stock market got close, for moments in time--based on \nwhat appeared to be technology errors and high speed trading--to \nperhaps the single biggest loss in modern American history--a thousand \npoint loss for a moment in time this afternoon.\n  I know the Senator from Arizona wants to talk about his issues as \nwell. But there was a warning sign shot across the bow today, and if we \ndon't deal with this as part of the mix, I think we are not acting \nappropriately.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I will yield, but this is a case where I think we have \nto look into this and see what is going on.\n  I yield for the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to discuss amendment No. 3839. \nThis amendment is designed to end the taxpayer-backed conservatorship \nof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by putting in place an orderly transition \nperiod and eventually requiring them to operate without government \nsubsidies on a level playing field with their private sector \ncompetitors.\n  Events of the last 2 years have made it clear that never again can we \nallow the taxpayer to be responsible for poorly managed financial \nentities which gamble away billions of dollars. Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac are synonomous with mismanagement and waste and have become the \nface of too big to fail. The time has come to end Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac's taxpayer-backed free ride and require them to operate on \na level playing field.\n  I want to quote from an AP story yesterday entitled: ``Freddie Mac \nseeks $10.6B in aid after 1Q loss.'' Freddie Mac is asking for $10.6 \nbillion in additional Federal aid after posting a big loss in the first \n3 months of the year. It is another sign that the taxpayer bill for \nstabilizing the housing market will keep mounting. The McLean, VA-based \nmortgage finance company has been effectively owned by the government \nafter nearly collapsing in September of 2008. The new request will \nbring the total tab for rescuing Freddie Mac to $61.3 billion. Freddie \nMac says it lost $8 billion, or $2.45 a share, in the January-March \nperiod. That takes into account $1.3 billion in dividends paid to the \nTreasury Department. It compares with the loss of $10.4 billion or \n$3.18 a share, in the year-ago period.\n  So the beat goes on and the drainage goes on. Here on this chart we \nhave the money yet to be repaid by institutions that received $10 \nbillion or more in taxpayer bailouts. Obviously, these organizations \nhave paid back. GMAC still has $16 billion they owe the taxpayer; \nCitigroup, $25 billion; GM--despite their PR stunt the other day, where \nthey say they paid back, with TARP money, they paid the taxpayers with \ntaxpayer money--$43.7 billion; AIG, $69.8 billion; and, of course, \nFannie and Freddie, $125.9 billion plus.\n  I wish to begin today by calling my colleagues' attention to an \neditorial in this morning's Wall Street Journal, which states:\n\n       Fan and Fred owned or guaranteed $5 trillion in mortgages \n     and mortgage-backed securities when they collapsed in \n     September of 2008. Reforming the financial system without \n     fixing Fannie and Freddie is like declaring a war on terror \n     and ignoring al-Qaida.\n\n  I want to repeat that sentence for the benefit of my colleagues. This \nis from the Wall Street Journal this morning.\n\n       Reforming the financial system without fixing Fannie and \n     Freddie is like declaring war on terror and ignoring al-\n     Qaida.\n       Unreformed, they are sure to kill taxpayers again. Only \n     yesterday, Freddie said it lost $8 billion in the first \n     quarter, requested another $10.6 billion from Uncle Sam, and \n     warned that it would need more in the future. This comes on \n     top of the $126.9 billion that Fan and Fred had already lost \n     through the end of 2009. The duo are by far the biggest \n     losers of the entire financial panic--bigger than AIG, \n     Citigroup and the rest.\n       From the 2008 meltdown through 2020, the toxic twins will \n     cost taxpayers close to $380 billion, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office's cautious estimate.\n\n  The numbers, I say to my colleagues, are staggering--staggering.\n\n       The Obama administration won't even put the companies on \n     budget for fear of the deficit impact, but it realizes the \n     problem because last Christmas Eve--\n\n  Strangely enough on Christmas Eve--\n\n     . . . it raised the $400 billion cap on their potential \n     taxpayer losses to . . . infinity. Moreover, these taxpayer \n     losses understate the financial destruction wrought by Fan \n     and Fred. By concealing how much they were gambling on risky \n     subprime and Alt-A mortgages, the companies sent bogus \n     signals on the size of these markets and distorted decision-\n     making throughout the system. Their implicit government \n     guarantee also let them sell mortgage-backed securities \n     around the world, attracting capital to U.S. housing and thus \n     turbocharging the mania.\n\n  Specifically, this amendment does several things:\n  It provides for a finite end to the current conservatorship period \nfor both government-sponsored enterprises--GSEs--at 2 years of date \nfrom the enactment. The Federal Housing Finance Agency has an option to \nextend conservatorship for 6 months if the FHFA Director determines and \nnotifies Congress that adverse market conditions exist. If at the end \nof conservatorship a GSE is not financially viable, the FHFA must place \nthat GSE in receivership. If the GSE is financially viable, then \nit would be allowed to reenter the market under new operating \nrestrictions.\n\n  It provides for the following changes to existing operating \nstructure:\n  It calls for the repeal of the affordable housing goals mandates for \nthe GSEs.\n  It calls for new limits for mortgage assets held on its books of no \nmore than 95 percent of mortgage assets owned on December 31 of the \nprior year, reduced an additional 25 percent by the end of year 1, \nreduced an additional 25 percent by the end of year 2, and reduced to \n$250 billion by the end of year 3.\n  It strengthens capital standards and allows them to be increased by \nthe FHFA as necessary.\n  It calls for the repeal of the temporary increases in conforming loan \nlimit and high cost area increases, and a return to the $417,000 \nconforming loan limit for the first year, subject to annual adjustments \nby FHFA.\n  It provides for a prohibition on the purchase of mortgages exceeding \nthe median home price for that area.\n  It calls for a minimum downpayment requirement of at least 5 percent \nfor all new loans purchased by the GSE, increasing to 7.5 percent in \nthe second year, and 10 percent in the third year.\n  It repeals the GSE exemption from having to pay State and local \ntaxes.\n  I wonder how many of my colleagues and fellow citizens knew that \nFannie and Freddie did not have to pay State and local taxes.\n  It calls for a repeal of the exemption allowing GSE securities to \navoid full SEC registration.\n  In other words, given their enormous clout here in the Congress, \nFannie and Freddie were able to have an exemption from their securities \nfalling under SEC registration.\n  It calls for an assessment of fees on GSEs to recoup full value of \nthe benefit due to guarantee provided by the Federal Government. And \nGAO will conduct a study to determine current value of government \nguarantee.\n  The amendment establishes a 3-year period after the end of \nconservatorship for GSEs to operate under new operating restrictions \nuntil their government charter expires. Upon charter expiration, it \nprovides for a 10-year period with the creation of a separate holding \ncorporation and a dissolution trust fund for any remaining mortgages or \ndebt obligations held by the GSE.\n  It establishes a Senate-confirmed special inspector general within \nthe Government Accountability Office with responsibility for \ninvestigating and reporting to Congress on decisions made with respect \nto the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The SIG would \nprovide quarterly reports to Congress.\n  While GSEs remain in conservatorship, it reestablishes the Federal \nfunding limit of $200 billion per institution\n\n[[Page S3342]]\n\nfor the GSEs and requires the GSEs to reduce their portfolio holdings \nby 10 percent of the prior year's holdings. It also establishes an \napproval process for any further agreements that put the taxpayers at \nrisk.\n  It places Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as part of the Federal budget as \nlong as either institution is under a conservatorship or receivership.\n  Again, my colleagues might be interested that Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac, and what we are doing with them now, is not part of the Federal \nbudget--remarkable.\n  It requires the FHFA to establish minimum prudent underwriting \nstandards for mortgage loans eligible for government-sponsored entities \npurchase. Minimum requirements will include verification and \ndocumentation of income and assets relied upon to qualify the borrower \nfor the mortgage loan and determination of borrower's ability to repay \nthe mortgage loan.\n  I might add that the Congressional Budget Office has indicated this \namendment would save the taxpayers several billions of dollars \nannually. I repeat, the Congressional Budget Office states--and, by the \nway, it has not been given any phony assumptions such as a doc fix--\nthis amendment would save the taxpayers several billions of dollars \nannually.\n  During the debate on this financial reform bill, we will continue to \nhear a lot about how the U.S. Government will never again allow a \nfinancial institution to become too big to fail. We will hear \ncontinuous calls for more regulation to ensure that taxpayers are never \nagain placed at such tremendous risk.\n  Sadly, and I say very sadly, the underlying bill completely ignores \nthe elephant in the room because no other entity's failure would be as \ndisastrous to our economy as Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's. Yet this \nbill does not address them at all.\n  In a recent Opinion Piece in the Wall Street Journal, Robert Wilmers \nwrote:\n\n       Congress may be making progress crafting new regulations \n     for the financial-services industry, but it has yet to begin \n     reforming two institutions that played a key role in the 2008 \n     credit crisis--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n       We cannot reform these government-sponsored enterprises \n     unless we fully confront the extent to which their outrageous \n     behavior and reckless business practices have affected the \n     entire commercial banking sector and the U.S. economy as a \n     whole.\n       At the end of 2009, their total debt outstanding--either \n     held directly on their balance sheets or as guarantees on \n     mortgage securities they'd sold to investors--was $8.1 \n     trillion. That compares to $7.8 trillion in total marketable \n     debt outstanding for the entire U.S. government. The debt has \n     the implicit guarantee of the federal government but is not \n     reflected on the national balance sheet.\n       The public has focused more on taxpayer bailouts of banks, \n     auto makers and insurance companies. But the scale of the \n     rescue required in September 2008 when Fannie and Freddie \n     were forced into conservatorship--their version of \n     bankruptcy--was staggering. To date, the federal government \n     has been forced to pump $126 billion into Fannie and Freddie. \n     That's far more than AIG, which absorbed $70 billion of \n     government largess, and General Motors and Chrysler, which \n     shared $77 billion. Banks received $205 billion, of which \n     $136 billion has been repaid.\n       Fannie and Freddie continue to operate deeply in the red, \n     with no end in sight. The Congressional Budget Office \n     estimated that if their operating costs and subsidies were \n     included in our accounting of the overall federal deficit--as \n     properly they should be--the 2009 deficit would be greater by \n     $291 billion.\n\n  The op-ed continues:\n\n       All this happened in the name of the ``American Dream'' of \n     home ownership. But there's no evidence Fannie and Freddie \n     helped much, if at all, to make this dream come true. Despite \n     all their initiatives since the early 1970s, shortly after \n     they were incorporated as private corporations protected by \n     government charters, the percentage of American households \n     owning homes has increased by merely four percentage points \n     to 67%.\n       According to a 2004 Congressional Budget Office study, the \n     two GSEs enjoyed $23 billion in subsidies in 2003--primarily \n     in the form of lower borrowing costs and exemption from state \n     and local taxation. But they passed on only $13 billion to \n     home buyers. Nevertheless, one former Fannie Mae CEO, \n     Franklin Raines, received $91 million in compensation from \n     1998 through 2003.\n\n  Amazing.\n\n       In 2006, the top five Fannie Mae executives shared $34 \n     million in compensation, while their counterparts at Freddie \n     Mac shared $35 million. In 2009, even after the financial \n     crash and as these two GSEs fell deeper into the red, the top \n     five executives at Fannie Mae received $19 million in \n     compensation and the CEO earned $6 million.\n       This is not private enterprise--it's crony capitalism, in \n     which public subsidies are turned into private riches. From \n     2001 through 2006, Fannie and Freddie spent $123 million to \n     lobby Congress--the second-highest lobbying total in the \n     country. That lobbying was complemented by sizable direct \n     political contributions to members of Congress.\n       Changing this terrible situation will not be easy. The \n     mortgage market has come to be structured around Fannie and \n     Freddie and powerful interests are allied with the status \n     quo.\n       Nonetheless, Congress must get to work on the reform of \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A healthy housing market, a \n     healthy financial system and even the bond rating of the \n     federal government depend on it.\n\n  There have been countless warnings about the mismanagement of both \nFannie and Freddie over the years. In May of 2006, after a 27-month \ninvestigation into the corrupt corporate culture and accounting \npractices at Fannie Mae, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise \nOversight--OFHEO--the Federal regulator charged with overseeing Fannie \nMae--issued a blistering, 348-page report which stated that:\n\n       Fannie Mae senior management promoted an image of the \n     Enterprise as one of the lowest-risk financial institutions \n     in the world and as ``best in class'' in terms of risk \n     management, financial reporting, internal control, and \n     corporate governance. The findings in this report show that \n     risks at Fannie Mae were greatly understated and that the \n     image was false.\n       During the period covered by this report--1998 to mid-\n     2004--Fannie Mae reported extremely smooth profit growth and \n     hit announced targets for earnings per share precisely each \n     quarter. Those achievements were illusions deliberately and \n     systematically created by the Enterprise's senior management \n     with the aid of inappropriate accounting and improper \n     earnings management.\n       A large number of Fannie Mae's accounting policies and \n     practices did not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting \n     Principles (GAAP). The Enterprise also had serious problems \n     of internal control, financial reporting, and corporate \n     governance. Those errors resulted in Fannie Mae overstating \n     reported income and capital by a currently estimated $10.6 \n     billion.\n       By deliberately and intentionally manipulating accounting \n     to hit earnings targets, senior management maximized the \n     bonuses and other executive compensation they received, at \n     the expense of shareholders. Earnings management made a \n     significant contribution to the compensation of Fannie Mae \n     Chairman and CEO Franklin Raines, which totaled over $90 \n     million from 1998 through 2003. Of that total, over $52 \n     million was directly tied to achieving earnings per share \n     targets.\n       Fannie Mae consistently took a significant amount of \n     interest rate risk and, when interest rates fell in 2002, \n     incurred billions of dollars in economic losses. The \n     Enterprise also had large operational and reputational risk \n     exposures.\n       Fannie Mae's Board of Directors contributed to those \n     problems by failing to be sufficiently informed and to act \n     independently of its chairman, Franklin Raines, and other \n     senior executives; by failing to exercise the requisite \n     oversight over the Enterprise's operations; and by failing to \n     discover or ensure the correction of a wide variety of unsafe \n     and unsound practices.\n       The Board's failures continued in the wake of revelations \n     of accounting problems and improper earnings management at \n     Freddie Mac and other high profile firms, the initiation of \n     OFHEO's special examination, and credible allegations of \n     improper earnings management made by an employee of the \n     Enterprise's Office of the Controller.\n       Senior management did not make investments in accounting \n     systems, computer systems, other infrastructure, and staffing \n     needed to support a sound internal control system, proper \n     accounting, and GAAP-consistent financial reporting. Those \n     failures came at a time when Fannie Mae faced many \n     operational challenges related to its rapid growth and \n     changing accounting and legal requirements.\n       Fannie Mae senior management sought to interfere with \n     OFHEO's special examination by diretstOg the Enterprise's \n     lobbyists to use their ties to Congressional staff to No. 1, \n     generate a Congressional request for the Inspector General of \n     the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to \n     investigate OFHEO's conduct of that examination and No. 2, \n     insert into an appropriations bill language that would reduce \n     the agency's appropriations until the Director of OFHEO was \n     replaced.\n       OFHEO has directed and will continue to direct Fannie Mae \n     to take remedial actions to enhance the safe and sound \n     operation of the Enterprise going forward. OFHEO staff \n     recommends actions to enhance the goal of maintaining the \n     safety and soundness of Fannie Mae.\n\n  A remarkable report.\n  So what steps were taken by the Congress to punish Fannie Mae for \nsuch deliberate manipulation and outright corruption? Basically: NONE. \nAccording to published reports--including\n\n[[Page S3343]]\n\nFannie Mae's own news release--Daniel Mudd, the president and CEO of \nFannie Mae at the time, was awarded over $14.4 million in 2006--the \nyear this report was issued, and over $12.2 million in 2007 in salary, \nbonuses and stock. And Fannie Mae continued their risky behavior--\nsuccessfully posting profits of $4.1 billion in 2006.\n  The blatant corruption reported by the OFHEO led me to come to the \nSenate floor back in 2006 and call for the immediate consideration of \nGSE regulatory reform legislation. At the time I said:\n\n       For years I have been concerned about the regulatory \n     structure that governs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the \n     sheer magnitude of these companies and the role they play in \n     the housing market. OFHEO's report this week does nothing to \n     ease these concerns. In fact, the report does quite the \n     contrary. OFHEO's report solidifies my view that the GSEs \n     need to be reformed without delay.\n       If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue \n     to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and \n     Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial \n     system, and the economy as a whole.\n\n  Additionally, also in May, 2006, I joined 19 of my colleagues in \nwriting to the majority leader urging him to bring the Federal Housing \nEnterprise Regulatory Reform Act to the floor for debate.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2006.\n     Hon. William H. Frist, MD,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Chairman, Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, U.S. \n         Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist and Chairman Shelby, We are \n     concerned that if effective regulatory reform legislation for \n     the housing-finance government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) \n     is not enacted this year, American taxpayers will continue to \n     be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie \n     Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, \n     and the economy as a whole. Therefore, we offer you our \n     support in bringing the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory \n     Reform Act (S. 190) to the floor and allowing the Senate to \n     debate the merits of this bill, which was passed by the \n     Senate Banking Committee.\n       Congress chartered Fannie and Freddie to provide access to \n     home financing by maintaining liquidity in the secondary \n     mortgage market. Today, almost half of all mortgages in the \n     U.S. are owned or guaranteed by these GSEs. They are mammoth \n     financial institutions with almost $1.5 trillion of debt \n     outstanding between them. With the fiscal challenges facing \n     us today (deficits, entitlements, pensions and flood \n     insurance), Congress must ask itself who would actually pay \n     this debt if Fannie or Freddie could not?\n       Substantial testimony calling for improved regulation of \n     the GSEs has been provided to the Senate by the Treasury, \n     Federal Reserve, HUD, GAO, CBO, and others. Congress has the \n     opportunity to recommit itself to the housing mission of the \n     GSEs while at the same time making sure the GSEs operate in a \n     manner that does not expose our financial system, or \n     taxpayers, to unnecessary risk. It is vitally important that \n     Congress take the necessary steps to ensure that these \n     institutions benefit from strong and independent regulatory \n     supervision, operate in a safe and sound manner, and are \n     primarily focused on their statutory mission. More \n     importantly, Congress must ensure that the American taxpayer \n     is protected in the event either GSE should fail. We strongly \n     support an effort to schedule floor time this year to debate \n     GSE regulatory reform.\n           Sincerely,\n         Chuck Hagel; John E. Sununu; John McCain; Elizabeth Dole; \n           Lindsey Graham; Jeff Sessions; Wayne Allard; Mike \n           Crapo; Jim Bunning; Jon Kyl; Rick Santorum; Mel \n           Martinez; Judd Gregg; John Thune; Richard Burr; John \n           Ensign; Larry Craig; Jim DeMint; James M. Inhofe; Tom \n           Coburn.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The letter stated in part:\n\n       Substantial testimony calling for improved regulation of \n     the GSEs has been provided to the Senate by the Treasury, \n     Federal Reserve, HUD, GAO, CBO, and others. Congress has the \n     opportunity to recommit itself to the housing mission of the \n     GSEs while at the same time making sure the GSEs operate in a \n     manner that does not expose our financial system, or \n     taxpayers, to unnecessary risk. It is vitally important that \n     Congress take the necessary steps to ensure that these \n     institutions benefit from strong and independent regulatory \n     supervision, operate in a safe and sound manner, and are \n     primarily focused on their statutory mission.\n       More importantly, Congress must ensure that the American \n     taxpayer is protected in the event either GSE should fail.\n\n  Sadly, the bill which had passed the Senate Banking Committee under \nthe leadership of then-Chairman Shelby, with the support of all the \ncommittee's Republicans and none of the Democrats, was not brought up \nfor consideration before this body.\n  It is critical to note, it was in 2005 that the GSEs, which had been \nacquiring increasing numbers of subprime loans for many years in order \nto meet their HUD-imposed affordable housing requirements, accelerated \nthe purchases that led to their 2008 insolvency.\n  If legislation along the lines of the Senate Banking Committee's bill \nhad been enacted that year, many if not all the losses Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac suffered, and will suffer in the future, may have been \navoided. I wish to make it clear to my colleagues: Failure of Congress \nto act could have prevented--if they had acted--many of the failures we \nare now facing.\n  Any criticism leveled at Congress for the failures in Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac is very well placed. On October 3, 2008, the Wall Street \nJournal reported on how Congress pushed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to \nincrease the purchases of low- and moderate-income borrowers. They \nwrote:\n\n       Beginning in 1992, Congress pushed Fannie Mae and Freddie \n     Mac to increase their purchases of mortgages going to low- \n     and moderate-income borrowers. For 1996, the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development (HUD) gave Fannie and Freddie \n     an explicit target--42 percent of their mortgage financing \n     had to go to borrowers with income below the median in their \n     area. The target increased to 50 percent in 2000 and 52 \n     percent in 2005.\n\n  For 1996, HUD required that 12 percent of all mortgages purchased by \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac be ``special, affordable'' loans, typically \nto borrowers with income less than 60 percent of their area's median \nincome. That number was increased to 20 percent in 2000 and 22 percent \nin 2005. The 2008 goal was to be 28 percent.\n  Between 2000 and 2005, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac met these goals \nevery year, funding hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of loans, \nmany of them subprime and adjustable rate loans made to borrowers who \nbought houses with less than 10 percent down.\n  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also purchased hundreds of billions of \nsubprime securities for their own portfolios to make money and help \nsatisfy HUD affordable housing goals. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were \nimportant contributors to the demand for subprime securities. Congress \ndesigned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to serve both their investors and \nthe political class.\n  Demanding that Fannie Mae and Freddie do more to increase home \nownership among poor people allowed Congress and the White House to \nsubsidize low-income housing outside the budget, at least in the short \nrun. It was a political free lunch. The Community Reinvestment Act, \nCRA, did the same thing with traditional banks. It encouraged banks to \nserve two masters, their bottom line and the so-called common good.\n  First passed in 1977, the CRA was ``strengthened'' in 1995, causing \nan increase of 80 percent in the number of bank loans going to low- and \nmoderate-income families. By the way, there is nothing wrong with that \nas long as they meet the fundamental criteria, that they are borrowing \nmoney they can pay back.\n  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were part of the CRA story too. In 1997, \nBear Stearns did the first securitization of CRA loans, a $384 million \noffering guaranteed by Freddie Mac. Over the next 10 months, Bear \nSterns issued $1.9 billion of CRA mortgages backed by Fannie Mae or \nFreddie Mac.\n  Between 2000 and 2002, Fannie Mae securitized $394 billion in CRA \nloans, with $20 billion going to securitize the mortgages. Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac played a significant role in the explosion of subprime \nmortgages and subprime mortgage-backed securities.\n  Without Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's implicit guarantee of government \nsupport, which turned out to be all too real, would the mortgage-backed \nsecurities market and the subprime part of it have expanded the way \nthey did? Perhaps. But before we conclude that markets failed, we need \na careful analysis of public policy's role in creating this mess. \nGreedy investors obviously played a part, but investors have always \nbeen greedy, and\n\n[[Page S3344]]\n\nsome inevitably overreach and destroy themselves.\n  Why did they take so many down with them this time? Part of the \nanswer is, a political class greedy to push home ownership rates to \nhistoric highs, from 64 percent in 1994 to 69 percent in 2004. This was \nmostly the result of loans to low-income, higher risk borrowers. Both \nBill Clinton and George W. Bush, abetted by Congress, trumpeted this \nrise as it occurred.\n  The consequence, on top of putting the entire financial system at \nrisk, the hidden cost has been hundreds of billions of dollars funneled \ninto the housing market instead of more productive assets. Beware of \ntrying to do good with other people's money.\n  Unfortunately, that strategy remains at the heart of the political \nprocess and a proposed solution to this crisis. Congress had the \nresponsibility to ensure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were properly \nsupervised and adequately regulated. Congress failed. The devastation \ncaused by that failure continues to reverberate across the Nation as \nmore and more families face foreclosures every day.\n  In September 2008, the Washington Post published an in-depth article \ntitled: ``How Washington Failed to Rein in Fannie, Freddie. As Profits \nGrew, Firms Used Their Power To Mask Peril.'' It is extremely \ninformative and raised many troubling questions about the culture of \ncorruption which is evident in the operations of both enterprises.\n  The Post piece begins:\n\n       Gary Gensler, an undersecretary of the Treasury, went to \n     Capitol Hill in March 2000 to testify in favor of a bill \n     everyone knew would fail.\n       Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were ascendent, giants of the \n     mortgage finance business and key players in the Clinton \n     administration's drive to expand home ownership. But Gensler \n     and other Treasury officials feared the companies had grown \n     so large that, if they stumbled, the damage to the U.S. \n     economy could be staggering. Few officials had ever publicly \n     criticized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but Gensler concluded \n     it was time to rein them in.\n       ``We thought this was a hand-on-the-Bible moment,'' he \n     recalled.\n       The bill failed.\n       The companies kept growing, the dangers posed by their \n     scale and financial practices kept mounting, critics kept \n     warning of the consequences. Yet across official Washington, \n     those who might have acted repeatedly failed to do so until \n     it was too late.\n       Blessed with the advantages of a government agency and a \n     private company ``at the same time, Fannie Mae and Freddie \n     Mac used their windfall profits to co-opt the politicians who \n     were supposed to control them. The companies fought \n     successfully against increased regulation by cultivating \n     their friends and hounding their enemies.\n       The agencies that regulated the companies were outmatched: \n     They lacked the money, the staff, the sophistication and the \n     political support to serve as an effective check.\n       But most of all, the companies were protected by the belief \n     widespread in Washington--and aggressively promoted by Fannie \n     Mae and Freddie Mac--that their success was inseparable from \n     the expansion of homeownership in America. That conviction \n     was so strong that many lawmakers and regulators ignored the \n     peril posed to that ideal by the failure of either company.\n       In October 1992, a brief debate unfolded on the floor of \n     the House of Representatives over a bill to create a new \n     regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. On one side stood \n     Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican concerned that Congress was \n     ``hamstringing'' this new regulator at the behest of the \n     companies.\n       He warned that the two companies were changing ``from being \n     agencies of the public at large to money machines for the \n     stockholding few.''\n       On the other side stood Barney Frank, a Massachusetts \n     Democrat, who said the companies served a public purpose. \n     They were in the business of lowering the price of mortgage \n     loans.\n       Congress chose to create a weak regulator, the Office of \n     Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. The agency was required \n     to get its budget approved by Congress, while agencies that \n     regulated the banks set their own budgets. That gave \n     Congressional allies an easy way to exert pressure.\n       ``Fannie Mae's lobbyists worked to ensure that [the] agency \n     was poorly funded and its budget remained subject to approval \n     in the annual appropriations process,'' OFHEO said more than \n     a decade later in a report on Fannie Mae. ``The goal of \n     senior management was straightforward: to force OFHEO to rely \n     on the [Fannie] for information and expertise to the degree \n     that Fannie Mae would essentially regulate itself.''\n       Congress also wanted to free up money for Fannie Mae and \n     Freddie Mac to buy mortgage loans and specified that the pair \n     would be required to keep a much smaller share of their funds \n     on hand than other financial institutions. Where banks that \n     held $100 could spend $90 buying mortgage loans, Fannie Mae \n     and Freddie Mac could spend $97.50 buying loans.\n       Finally, Congress ordered that the companies be required to \n     keep more capital as a cushion against losses if they \n     invested in riskier securities. But the rule was never set \n     during the Clinton administration, which came to office that \n     winter, and was only put in place nine years later.\n       The Clinton administration wanted to expand the share of \n     Americans who owned homes, which had stagnated below 65 \n     percent throughout the 1980s. Encouraging the growth of the \n     two companies was a key part of that plan.\n       ``We began to stress homeownership as an explicit goal for \n     this period of American history,'' said Henry Cisneros, then \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. ``Fannie Mae and \n     Freddie Mac became part of that equation.''\n       The result was a period of unrestrained growth for the \n     companies. They had pioneered the business of selling bundled \n     mortgage loans to investors and now, as demand for investors \n     soared, so did their profits.\n       Near the end of the Clinton administration, some of its \n     officials had concluded the companies were so large that \n     their sheer size posed a risk to the financial system.\n       In the fall of 1999, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers \n     issued a warning, saying, ``Debates about systemic risk \n     should also now include government-sponsored enterprises, \n     which are large and growing rapidly.''\n       It was a signal moment. An administration official had said \n     in public that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be a hazard.\n       The next spring, seeking to limit the companies' growth, \n     Treasury official Gensler testified before Congress in favor \n     of a bill that would have suspended the Treasury's right to \n     buy $2.25 billion of each company's debt--basically, a $4.5 \n     billion lifeline for the companies.\n       A Fannie Mae spokesman announced that Gensler's remarks had \n     just cost 206,000 Americans the chance to buy a home because \n     the market now saw the companies as a riskier investment.\n       The Treasury Department folded in the face of public \n     pressure.\n       There was an emerging consensus among politicians and even \n     critics of the two companies that Fannie Mae might be right. \n     The companies increasingly were seen as the engine of the \n     housing boom. They were increasingly impervious to calls for \n     even modest reforms.\n       As early as 1996, the Congressional Budget Office had \n     reported that the two companies were using government support \n     to goose profits, rather than reducing mortgage rates as much \n     as possible.\n       But the report concluded that severing government ties with \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would harm the housing market. In \n     unusually colorful language, the budget office wrote, ``Once \n     one agrees to share a canoe with a bear, it is hard to get \n     him out without obtaining his agreement or getting wet.''\n       Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac enjoyed the nearest thing to a \n     license to print money. The companies borrowed money at \n     below-market interest rates based on the perception that the \n     government guaranteed repayment, and then they used the money \n     to buy mortgages that paid market interest rates. Federal \n     Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called the difference between \n     the interest rates a ``big, fat gap.'' The budget office \n     study found that it was worth $3.9 billion in 1995. By 2004, \n     the office would estimate it was worth $20 billion.\n       As a result, the great risk to the profitability of Fannie \n     Mae and Freddie Mac was not the movement of interest rates or \n     defaults by borrowers, the concerns of normal financial \n     institution. Fannie Mae's risk was political, the concern \n     that the government would end its special status.\n       So the companies increasingly used their windfall for a \n     massive campaign to protect that status.\n       ``We manage our political risk with the same intensity that \n     we manage our credit and interest rate risks,'' Fannie Mae \n     chief executive Franklin Raines said in a 1999 meeting with \n     investors.\n       Fannie Mae, and to a lesser extent Freddie Mac, became \n     enmeshed in the fabric of political Washington. They were \n     places former government officials went to get wealthy--and \n     to wait for new federal appointments. At Fannie Mae, chief \n     executives had clauses written into their contracts spelling \n     out the severance benefits they would receive if they left \n     for a government post.\n       The companies also donated generously to the campaigns of \n     favored politicians.\n       But Fannie Mae wasn't just buying influence. It was selling \n     government officials on an idea by making its brand \n     synonymous with homeownership. The company spent tens of \n     millions of dollars each year on advertising.\n       In tying itself to politicians and wrapping itself in the \n     American flag, Fannie Mae went out of its way to share credit \n     with politicians for investments in their communities.\n       ``They have always done everything in their power to \n     massage Congress,'' Leach said.\n       And when they couldn't massage, they intimidated. In 2003, \n     Richard H. Baker (R-La.), chairman of the House Financial \n     Services subcommittee with oversight over Fannie Mae and \n     Freddie Mac, got information from OFHEO on the salaries paid \n     to executives at both companies. Fannie Mae threatened to\n\n[[Page S3345]]\n\n     sue Baker if he released it, he recalled. Fearing the expense \n     of a court battle, he kept the data secret for a year.\n       Baker, who left office in February, 2008, said he had never \n     received a comparable threat from another company in 21 years \n     in Congress. ``The political arrogance exhibited in their \n     heyday, there has never been before or since a private entity \n     that exerted that kind of political power,'' he said.\n       In June 2003, Freddie Mac dropped a bombshell: It had \n     understated its profits over the previous three years by as \n     much as $6.9 billion in an effort to smooth out earnings.\n       OFHEO seemed blind. Months earlier, the regulator had \n     pronounced Freddie's accounting controls ``accurate and \n     reliable.''\n       Humiliated by the scandal, then-OFHEO director Armando \n     Falcon Jr. persuaded the White House to pay for an outside \n     accountant to review the books of Fannie Mae. The agency \n     reported in September 2004 that Fannie Mae also had \n     manipulated its accounting, in this case to inflate its \n     profits.\n       The companies soon faced new bills in both the House and \n     the Senate seeking increased regulation. The Bush \n     administration took the hardest line, insisting on a strong \n     new regulator and seeking the power to put the companies into \n     receivership if they foundered. That suggested the government \n     might not stand behind the companies' debt.\n       Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac succeeded in escaping once more, \n     by pounding every available button.\n       The companies orchestrated a letter-writing campaign by \n     traditional allies including real estate agents, home \n     builders and mortgage lenders. Fannie Mae ran radio and \n     television ads ahead of a key Senate committee meeting, \n     depicting a Latino couple who fretted that if the bill \n     passed, mortgage rates would go up.\n       The wife lamented: ``But that could mean we won't be able \n     to afford the new house.''\n       Most of all, the company leaned on its Congressional \n     supporters.\n       Fannie Mae even persuaded the New York Stock Exchange to \n     allow its shares to keep trading. The company had not issued \n     a required report on its financial condition in a year. The \n     rules of the exchange required delisting. So the exchange \n     created an exception when ``delisting would be significantly \n     contrary to the national interest.''\n       The amendment was approved by the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission. Fannie Mae would remain on the New York Stock \n     Exchange.\n       As Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were trying to recover from \n     their accounting scandals, a new and ultimately mortal threat \n     emerged. Yet again, the warnings went unheeded for too long.\n       The companies had begun buying loans made to borrowers with \n     credit problems.\n       Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been losing market share to \n     Wall Street banks, which were doing boomtown business \n     packaging these riskier loans. The mortgage finance giants \n     wanted a share of the profits.\n       Soon, the firms' own reports were noting the growing risk \n     of their portfolios. Dense monthly summaries of the \n     companies' mortgage purchases were piling up at OFHEO.\n       An employee at one of the companies said it was already a \n     constant discussion around the office in 2004: When would the \n     regulators notice?\n       ``It didn't take a lot of sophistication to notice what was \n     happening to the quality of the loans. Anybody could have \n     seen it,'' the staffer said. ``But nobody on the outside was \n     even questioning us about it.''\n       President Bush had pledged to create an ``ownership \n     society,'' and the companies were helping the administration \n     achieve its goal of putting more than 10 million Americans \n     into their first homes.\n       Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's appetite for risky loans was \n     growing ever more voracious. By the time OFHEO began raising \n     red flags in January 2007, many borrowers were defaulting on \n     loans and within months Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be \n     running out of money to cover the losses.\n       Finally, as the credit crisis escalated, Congress passed a \n     bill in July of 2008 that established a tough, new regulator \n     for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It was too late.\n\n  Americans are hurting. The economic situation remains depressed in my \nState. Unemployment is at record levels. The time has come to end the \ntaxpayer-funded free ride of the gambling institutions. We cannot \nafford it anymore.\n  Mr. President, for us to somehow say we are going to enact \nsignificant and meaningful financial regulatory reform without \naddressing this situation--these hundreds of billions of dollars of \ntoxic assets that still have not been resolved; two government-\nsupported enterprises that have been propped up by the taxpayers of \nAmerica for too long, while they engaged in the riskiest of \nenterprises, paying obscene profits to their executives and CEOs, their \nboards of directors derelict in their duties, criminally so.\n  We must enact reform of Freddie and Fannie if we are going to perform \nour duties, albeit too late--too late because of the terrible losses we \nhave inflicted on the American taxpayers. But it is not too late to fix \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise to speak for a moment again about my amendment No. 3746, of \nwhich I am delighted that the distinguished Presiding Officer is a \ncosponsor. I ask unanimous consent that Chairman Patrick Leahy, Senator \nJim Webb, and Senator Bob Casey all be added as cosponsors to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Just to recap it briefly, if you go around the \ncountry--\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I will be glad to yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see my friend from Arizona.\n  Can I ask the Senator, did he lay down his amendment? I am unclear.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have not laid down the amendment because I understand \nthe Senator from Connecticut would move to table, and there are \nnumerous Members who want to talk on this issue--this multitrillion-\ndollar issue. So, no, I have not. But I can also assure the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, if I propose the amendment, and it is tabled without \nproper debate, there will be another amendment just like it.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say to my friend from Arizona--and he is my friend--\nI have no intention of immediately tabling anyone's amendment. I have \nnot done that at all in the process. I think most Members appreciate I \nhave been trying to make sure everybody has a chance to be heard and to \nwork out amendments where we can so we can move along.\n  You can also understand my dilemma, in a sense. We have 100 Members \nhere who basically all have amendments on which they want to get heard. \nEveryone thinks their amendment is pretty important, and I respect \nthat. All I am trying to look for are some time agreements so we can \nsay: How long do we need? So we can then set up a schedule whereby, \nwith some predictability--Members want to go home tomorrow. Are we \ngoing to have votes tomorrow? Are we going to have votes on Monday?\n  I am just trying to have a schedule so I can accommodate as many \npeople as I can so they can be heard on their matters. That is all I am \nseeking. I am not trying to shortcut anybody, although I would ask for \nreasonableness on time so everybody gets a crack at what they would \nlike to do. That is all I am inquiring.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In the words of Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca, I was \nmisinformed because I was told by several different individuals that \nyou would be moving to table the amendment if it was proposed. I am \nglad to hear that is not the case. I know of at least 20 Members on \nthis side who want to speak on this issue. I will try to compile that \nand try to come to the Senator with a list and the time they want to \ndiscuss.\n  With all due respect to all the other amendments--and I do not say \nthis very often--when we are talking about trillions of dollars--\ntrillions of dollars--this is a very important amendment. So I will try \nto get to the distinguished chairman--I say with sympathy and respect--\na list of speakers and the amount of time they may consume as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona yield for a \nquestion?\n  Can I ask the Senator from Arizona, while he is working out his list \nand speakers and time, can we move some other amendments?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Sure. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Bring them to a vote on the floor this evening?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator have any objection to that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have no objection to moving other amendments while I am \ndoing that. None whatsoever.\n  Mr. DURBIN. On both sides of the aisle I hope we can work to \naccomplish that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We have to ask our leader but, yes, that is fine. Our two \nleaders say it is fine. I thank you.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  We have Senator Sanders' pending amendment, on which I think we have \nreached a lot of consensus. I would like\n\n[[Page S3346]]\n\nto see us get a vote on it. I know there are some issues that are--I \nwill not mention them at all, but my hope is my colleagues might let us \ngo to this. Is there any chance of that at all? Would someone get back \nto me and let me know it we can--\n  I urge a vote on the Sanders amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. DODD. Is there a sufficient second?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Point of order: How many hands do you need up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty.\n  Ordering the yeas and nays does not force a vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll, and the following Senators \nentered the Chamber and answered to their names.\n\n                          [Quorum No. 3 Leg.]\n\n     Alexander\n     Bennett (CO)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burris\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Isakson\n     McCain\n     Murray\n     Reid (NV)\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Udall (CO)\n     Warner\n     Whitehouse\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kyl), the Senator from Indiana \n(Mr. Lugar), and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sometimes a patient person. I am really \ndoing my best to be patient. I am going into this with good faith, as I \nhope my Republican colleagues are. We have not gotten a lot done. The \nissue we are working on is very important. But I just tell my friends \non the other side of the aisle, we do not need a filibuster by some \nother name. I am approaching this in good faith.\n  People have worked very hard. We have a lot to do. I think it goes \nwithout saying that we were at a meeting today, and we were told we \nhave to complete the supplemental for the war spending by the time we \nleave here. That came from Secretary Gates. We have a lot to do.\n  My suggestion is that people who want to offer amendments work \ntomorrow, they work Saturday and Sunday. The Banking staff will be \navailable and the Agriculture staff will be available. If you have \namendments, bring them together. We have a lot of amendments, but many \nof them are on the same subject. Work with the Banking staff and the \nAgriculture staff to come up with the amendments we can move through as \nquickly as possible. I want people, if they have something to say, to \nsay it, but we don't need hours and hours to say it.\n  One of the most important amendments we are trying to do is one that \nhas been talked about by Senators Kaufman and Brown for weeks. And he \nhas agreed to take 5 minutes on it. It has been talked about. We have \nread it. Senator Brown has agreed to take 5 minutes. We have read about \nit in the press. Everybody knows what he is trying to do. So I \nappreciate very much the Republicans allowing us to move forward on \nthis amendment tonight. But, please, over the next few days we have a \nlot of amendments that are important, and I understand that, but when \nit comes time to offer these amendments, you need a lot of work on \nthem. It always happens because it is a complicated bill. And we only \nneed one amendment. We do not need the same amendment offered by five \ndifferent Senators.\n  I appreciate everyone's patience tonight. We are trying to work \nthrough this. We are not going to have votes tomorrow. We are going to \nhave votes tonight. And it has been hard to get here.\n  I appreciate the conversation I had with the Republican leader \nearlier today, and I know how hard this has been for the two managers \nof this part of the bill, Senators Dodd and Shelby.\n  Senator Shelby has been especially gracious during the whole day. \nThis is his birthday. His wonderful wife is waiting for him for dinner. \nShe has been waiting for an hour now, and she is going to have to wait \na little while longer, as she has waited for him a long time on other \noccasions. So we wish him a happy birthday.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following be the next amendments in \norder: Cantwell amendment No. 3786, to be modified with the changes at \nthe desk, and it is my understanding that is going to go by voice; \nBrown amendment No. 3733, with a second-degree amendment by Senator \nEnsign, amendment No. 3869; that Senator Brown will have 5 minutes, \nSenator Ensign will have 5 minutes, and Senator Dodd will have 5 \nminutes, and then we will proceed to a vote on that matter. I further \nask consent that it be in order for a Democratic side-by-side to the \nMcCain GSE amendment and that the Cardin amendment No. 3840 be \nconsidered tonight, and it is my understanding that amendment will be \ndecided by a voice vote; that after the Cantwell amendment is called \nand modified, there be 10 minutes of debate with respect to that \namendment, with the time equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform; that upon the use or yielding back of the time, the amendment be \nagreed to, and that there be no amendments in order to the amendments \nin this agreement prior to a vote except as we have stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley.) Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I am \ncertainly not going to object; I just wanted to make sure everyone \nunderstands. So tomorrow would be debate only?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, debate only, and the same on Monday.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to echo the comments of the majority leader \nwith regard to getting amendments prepared. It is to our advantage to \nhave amendment votes. We are going to work hard to get them in the \nqueue and to get them voted on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n[[Page S3347]]\n\n         Amendment No. 3786, as modified, to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and call up my amendment No. 3786, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell], for herself, \n     Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Sanders, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3786, as modified, to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 762, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

I further ask unanimous consent that Senators Merkley, \nBrown of Ohio, and Shaheen be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I would like to be added as a cosponsor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd also be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. My amendment strengthens the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission's authority to go after manipulation and attempted \nmanipulation in the swaps and commodities markets. It makes it unlawful \nto manipulate or attempt to manipulate the price of a swap or commodity \nusing any manipulative device or contrivance.\n  Some people might be thinking: Why do we need legislation like that? \nDon't we already have something in place? Unfortunately, current law \ndoes not have enough protections for our consumers, and we have found \nin other areas that it is very important to have a strong bright line, \na law on the books against manipulation. We want the CFTC to have \nstrong tools to go after this kind of behavior. This amendment is about \nprotecting the integrity of markets for people who rely on them for \ntheir business.\n  Current law makes it very difficult for the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission to prove market manipulation. The CFTC has to prove that \nsomeone had specific intent to manipulate, and that is a very difficult \nstandard to prove. Most individuals don't write an e-mail, for example, \nsaying they intend to manipulated prices, but that is currently what \nthe law requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to prove: \n``specific intent'' to manipulate. As a result of this, the Federal \ncourts have recognized that with the CFTC's weaker anti-manipulation \nstandard, market ``manipulation cases generally have not fared so \nwell.'' In fact, the law is so weak that in the CFTC's 35-year history, \nit has only had one successfully prosecuted case of market \nmanipulation, and that case is currently on appeal in Federal court. I \nam going to say that again. In the 35 years of its history, the CFTC \nhas only successfully prosecuted one single case of manipulation.\n  This language in this amendment is patterned after the law that the \nSEC uses to go after fraud and manipulation; that there can be no \nmanipulative devices or contrivances. It is a strong and clear legal \nstandard that allows regulators to successfully go after reckless and \nmanipulative behavior.\n\n  This legislation tracks the Securities Act in part because Federal \ncase law is clear that when the Congress uses language identical to \nthat used in another statute, Congress intended for the courts and the \nCommission to interpret the new authority in a similar manner, and \nCongress has made sure that its intention is clear.\n  In the 75 years since the enactment of the Securities and Exchange \nAct of 1934, a substantial body of case law has developed around the \nwords ``manipulative or deceptive devices or contrivances.''\n  The Supreme Court has compared this body of law to ``a judicial oak \nwhich has grown from little more than a legislative acorn.'' It is \nworth noting that the courts have held that the SEC's manipulation \nauthority is not intended to catch sellers who take advantage of the \nnatural market forces of supply and demand, only those who attempt to \naffect the market or prices by artificial means unrelated to the \nnatural forces of supply and demand.\n  Mr. President, Congress granted the same antimanipulation authority \nto the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2005 in the Energy \nPolicy Act. We did this as a result of the Enron market manipulation. I \nam very proud of this legislation and its ban on manipulation in \nelectricity and natural gas markets. I say that because there was a \nsimilar issue of deregulation of energy markets that led to the Federal \nregulators not doing their job.\n  Since we have implemented this language in the electricity markets, \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, since 2005, has used its \nauthority to conduct 135 investigations. Of those 135 investigations, \n41 have resulted in settlements involving civil penalties or other \nmonetary remedies totaling over $49 million.\n  Two investigations brought about enforcement actions against \nmanipulation, one against Amaranth for $291 million----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator has used 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The alleged market manipulation brought enforcement \naction against Amaranth for $291 million in civil penalties and Energy \nTrading Partners for $167 million in civil penalties. That is just an \nexample of what a statute with teeth and a regulatory entity can do to \nactually stop manipulation when given that authority.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support this strong \nantimanipulation standard being inserted into the Commodity Exchange \nAct. It will truly put a policeman on the beat and stop the kind of \nmanipulation that has occurred in these commodities markets.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as I recall the unanimous consent agreement, \nthere were 5 minutes. Is there time allocated? I do not believe there \nis any opposition to this amendment; therefore, if there is any, we \nyield back the time.\n  I say to the Senator, did you want to be heard on the Cantwell \namendment?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes remaining for debate.\n\n[[Page S3349]]\n\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise this evening in support of my \ngood friend, Senator Cantwell, and her amendment. I would like to thank \nthe Senator from Washington who has for years been a leader in the \nSenate on the complicated issue of derivatives and who has been \nparticularly effective at strengthening manipulation standards. There \nhas not been a more effective champion of consumers and efficient \nmarkets than Senator Cantwell.\n  This amendment comes as a result of hours of thoughtful hard work \nfrom Senator Cantwell and her staff. While the Dodd-Lincoln bill \ncontains a strong antimanipulation authority, Senator Cantwell came to \nme and my staff with ideas on how to strengthen the provision, and I \nwas pleased to have listened. We worked through our concerns and built \non each other's strengths and, in the end, came up with an improved \nproduct. That is the amendment we are accepting here today.\n  Market manipulation is an ever-present danger in derivatives trading. \nDerivatives are leveraged transactions, and it is well known that in \nthese markets there are numerous opportunities for traders to abuse \ntheir positions in order to game the market to their advantage. This is \nunacceptable. These markets are a fundamental part of our economy. They \nare used to manage risk and for price discovery, and their integrity \nmust be preserved.\n  The Dodd-Lincoln bill strengthens existing law to target specific \nmarket abuses that have arisen in recent years. These abuses are \noutlawed as disruptive practices in section 747 of the underlying bill.\n  I wholeheartedly support Senator Cantwell's amendment, which takes \nthe significant step of adding a new and versatile standard for \ndeceptive and manipulative practices under the Commodity Exchange Act. \nIt addresses false reporting and authorizes private rights of action \nthat will aid the CFTC in its enforcement effort. Senator Cantwell's \namendment will supplement the CFTC's existing standards as the \nCommission and the SEC work together to regulate derivatives.\n  The Commodity Exchange Act is a complex statute that covers many \ntrading venues. Senator Cantwell's amendment will give the CFTC a very \nimportant new weapon in its arsenal to combat ever-evolving forms of \nmanipulative trading schemes that undermine public confidence in the \nproper functioning of these markets.\n  I am very proud to be a supporter of what Senator Cantwell has done \nwith this amendment, and I urge all of our colleagues to take a look at \nit and realize she has really helped to improve the bill, the \nunderlying bill, in her actions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3786), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3840 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, I \ncall up amendment No. 3840.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin], for himself and Mr. \n     Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 3840 to amendment \n     No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide whistleblower protections for employees of \n        nationally recognized statistical rating organizations)\n\n       On page 977, line 19, strike ``The Securities'' and insert \n     the following:\n       (a) In General.--The Securities\n       On page 994, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (b) Protection for Employees of Nationally Recognized \n     Statistical Rating Organizations.--Section 1514A(a) of title \n     18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``or nationally recognized statistical \n     rating organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c),'' after \n     ``78o(d)),''; and\n       (2) by inserting ``or nationally recognized statistical \n     rating organization'' after ``such company''.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the Cardin-Grassley amendment extends \nwhistleblower protections to employees of nationally recognized \nstatistical rating organizations, NRSROs. NRSROs are the companies--\nsuch as Moody's and Standard & Poor's--which issue credit ratings that \nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission permits other financial \nfirms to use for certain regulatory purposes.\n  There are 10 NRSROs at present, including some privately held firms. \nThe NRSROs played a large role--by overestimating the safety of \nresidential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt \nobligations--in creating the housing bubble and making it bigger.\n  Then, by marking tardy but massive simultaneous downgrades of these \nsecurities, they contributed to the collapse of the subprime secondary \nmarket and the ``fire sale'' of assets, exacerbating the financial \ncrisis.\n  In the wake of the Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco corporate scandals, \nCongress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in July of 2002. One of the \nprovisions in the act was extended whistleblower protections to \nemployees of any company that is registered under the SEC Act of 1934 \nor that is required to file reports under section 15(d) of the same \nact. The whistleblower provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act protect \nemployees of the publicly traded companies from retaliation by giving \nvictims of such treatment a cause of action which can be brought in \nFederal court.\n  Section 1514(a) delineates which companies are covered by that act \nand what actions are prohibited. The Cardin-Grassley amendment expands \nthe provision to include employees of the rating companies.\n  I think it is important we have the whistleblower protection. S. 3217 \ncontains several provisions to improve SEC and congressional oversight \nof the functioning of the NRSROs. So the underlying bill does provide \nfor the regulatory framework for the rating agencies.\n  What the Cardin-Grassley amendment does is extend the whistleblowing \nprovisions--that protect employees--to all of the rating agencies. I \nwould urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by our colleague from Maryland, which would protect \nwhistleblowers.\n  We have all learned, over the many months of discussions since the \ncollapse and fall in 2008, of the culpability of the credit rating \nagencies--in terms of what was sold in the market place, relying on the \nreputation of the credit rating agencies and their classification of \nthese bundled mortgages. We have had a lot of discussion about how best \nto do this, to rein in the credit rating agencies so we get far greater \nreliability and due diligence out of them.\n  One thing for certain that would clearly help is the Cardin \namendment. It may not solve all the problems with the credit rating \nagencies, but it is going to be a major opportunity for us to be able \nto break down the bales that exist.\n  A significant part of our bill improves, we think, regulation. This \nbill contains several provisions that will make rating agencies more \ntransparent, accountable, and accurate. That will increase the SEC's \nregulatory performance, and that will reduce investors' reliance on \nratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating \norganizations.\n  Senator Cardin's amendment complements this provision in the bill, \nand I commend him for it. It adds employees of nationally recognized \nstatistical rating organizations to a list of already protected \nwhistleblowers. It is a valuable contribution to this bill, and I thank \nhim for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3840) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that motion \non the table.\n\n[[Page S3350]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3733 To Amendment No. 3739\n\n   (Purpose: To impose leverage and liability limits on bank holding \n                   companies and financial companies)\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3733.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Brown], for himself, Mr. \n     Kaufman, Mr. Casey, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Harkin, \n     Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Burris, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3733 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, April 28, 2010, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, the Kaufman-Brown amendment, with \n14 cosponsors, would scale back the six largest banks in the Nation, \nrequiring them to spin off into smaller more manageable banks and \nmaintain sufficient capital to cover their debts.\n  These six banks' assets total $9 trillion. Our amendment ends \nbailouts by ensuring that no Wall Street firm is so big or so reckless \nthat it fails, and then so does our economy. The bill we are \nconsidering today is strong, but it needs to be stronger. It focuses on \nmonitoring risk--risk is the biggest problem--and takes action once \nthere are signs of trouble.\n  But size is also a huge problem. Everyone, from consumer groups, to \nsmall business owners, to former directors, Governors of the Fed, \nChairmen of the Federal Reserve--two of them--understand what is at \nstake if we do not pass this amendment.\n  They have understood because we see it for ourselves that when a few \nmegabanks dominate our financial system, the downfall of any of them \ncan mark the downfall of our entire economy. We have seen millions of \njobs lost. We have seen millions of homes lost. We have seen trillions \nof dollars in savings and wealth drained.\n  Just 15 years ago--just 15 years ago--the six largest U.S. banks had \nassets equal to 17 percent of our GDP. Today, the six largest banks \nhave total assets estimated to be in excess of 63 percent. From 17 \npercent of GDP to 63 percent of GDP--these six largest banks.\n  Alan Greenspan said too big to fail is too big. Too big to fail is \ntoo big. These six banks, in addition to the fact they already have \nsuch dominance in our economy, when borrowing money when going into the \ncapital markets, enjoy an 80-basis point advantage over banks in Denver \nand Cleveland, regional banks in our States, and community banks that \nare even smaller. They have an 80-basis points advantage ensuring that \nif we don't pass the Brown-Kaufman amendment, their advantage will only \ngrow because these banks will grow larger, because the playing field is \ntilted toward them, because they have this interest rate advantage when \nthey borrow money--another reason to understand that too big to fail is \ntoo big.\n  I yield the last 2 or 3 minutes to Senator Kaufman.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I want to say to those who say this is \nDraconian, think of one thing: Citigroup under this will be the size \nthey were in 2002. They competed internationally. Everything was the \nsame.\n  In terms of risk, James Cayne said today, after he spoke before the \nFinancial Crisis Inquiry, that Bear Stearns failed because their ratio \nof assets to capital was 40 to 1. This bill would cap it at 16. Bear \nStearns would not have failed. We should not leave this for the \nregulators. In 1933 our forbears before us made tough decisions after \nthe Great Depression and put in Glass-Steagall. We should do no less. \nWe should be legislating for generations here tonight and support this \namendment.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3898 to Amendment No. 3733\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the definition of the term ``financial company'' for \n         purposes of imposing limits on nondeposit liabilities)\n\n       On page 2 of the amendment, strike lines 11 through 15 and \n     insert the following:\n       (1) Financial company.--The term ``financial company'' \n     means--\n       (A) any nonbank financial company supervised by the Board;\n       (B) the Federal National Mortgage Association; and\n       (C) the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I have a very simple second-degree \namendment actually supporting the underlying amendment. But what my \nsecond degree does is it simply says that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nwill be subject to the same limits. Everybody has been talking about \ntoo big to fail. That is one of the problems. All of this \ninterconnectedness of our financial markets, when one is too big to \nfail, draws the entire market down. That is why TARP was needed. That \nis why people have justified a lot of bailouts. I don't think there is \nanybody who can legitimately argue that Fannie and Freddie aren't too \nbig to fail.\n  What this second-degree amendment says, very simply, is the 3 percent \nof GDP that we are limiting the banks to, we limit Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae to those same limits.\n  We saw yesterday afternoon that Freddie Mac said they needed another \n$10 million in taxpayer bailouts. There is no question it is too big. \nThere is no question that if we actually put their debt on our balance \nsheets, we look much worse, the deficits on our balance sheet, we look \nmuch worse. What we are seeing over in Greece with the rioting and how \nthat is affecting our financial markets, we need to be honest in our \naccounting, but we also need to make sure these things don't continue \nto get larger and larger.\n  Back in December the President took the limits off of Fannie and \nFreddie--took the limits off. That is saying they can grow and keep \nborrowing and keep doing the irresponsible things they did in the past.\n  When we look at the root causes of the financial crisis, people took \nrisks they never should have taken because there were implicit \nguarantees not only in the banks being too big to fail but especially \nin Fannie and Freddie being too big to fail. It skewed the markets. \nPeople took risks they never should have taken.\n  There are other things I believe that need to be done with Fannie and \nFreddie, but certainly we can't allow them to get as large as they are \nnow. So the reasonable limits that have been put on the large banks I \nthink need to be put on these GSEs, the government-sponsored entities, \nand if we do that, I think we will be in better shape in the future for \nnot having another financial collapse.\n  It is a very simple amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Virginia, Senator \nWarner, a member of the Banking Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to both the second-\ndegree amendment and the initial Brown-Kaufman amendment. I understand \ntheir goals. I believe the chairman's bill addresses those goals. We \nhave 10 percent total liabilities in the United States in the existing \nbill right now.\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\nWe only have 4 of the largest 50 banks in the world that are American \ndomiciled. I believe this arbitrary asset cap size is not the \nappropriate restriction. The real question should be the level of \ninterconnectedness and the risk taking. We saw in the crisis of 2008 \nthe character of the firms was not simply the largest firms but firms \nthat did undue risk taking.\n  We have put forward in this legislation two very important ways so \nthat if these firms do take undue risk or if their size is a \ncontributing factor, the Dodd bill does provide the ability for these \nbanks to be broken up, one through the funeral plans, to make sure \nthese large institutions have to show how they can do an orderly \nunwinding process through bankruptcy. If they can't show that, whether \nit is due to the international holdings or the domestic holdings, the \nsystemic risk council can break up these institutions.\n  In addition, there are other parts of the bill that also allow it. If \nthese institutions continue to pose a systemic risk, they can be broken \nup, so I rise in opposition to both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I join the Senator in opposition to the \nBrown amendment, but I wish to speak about the Ensign amendment.\n  We talk about rushing things through around here. I have heard that \nmentioned a lot over the last couple of days. This is going beyond \nrushing through. The entire 97 percent of all mortgages--97 percent of \nall mortgages in the country today--are going through the GSEs, Fannie \nand Freddie. Without them, there is no housing market in the country. \nSo before we decide to do this without any alternative in place--and \nclearly one is needed. I take a backseat to no one on the idea we need \nto reform how the GSEs are functioning.\n  As I think my friend Judd Gregg mentioned the other day, this is far \ntoo complex an issue to include in this bill. We already have 1,500 \npages. We never intended to deal with every financial issue in the \nUnited States, and particularly one where the housing market today is \ncompletely dependent on this. Adopt this amendment and, believe me, by \ntomorrow we will have an economic reaction in the country we won't want \nto believe.\n  So with all due respect, we will deal with this. I will have language \nin this bill that will absolutely guarantee we are going to take up \nthis issue in the coming Congress. It has to be done. But to grapple \nwith that and all of these other matters in the same bill is asking too \nmuch. It doesn't minimize the importance of the issue, but this \nevening, without any other kind of alternative in place, to adopt this \namendment and then have the implications--97 percent of all mortgages \nin the United States go through the GSEs and without them there is no \nhousing market--I urge my colleagues to reject the Ensign amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I think the case has been made that Fannie \nand Freddie are too big. There is no question they are too big. We have \nalso had almost 2 years to deal with it, but we haven't done anything.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague would yield, that is untrue. We passed \nlegislation only last year on the GSEs.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. We have not reformed the GSEs the way we needed to. We \nhaven't done what needs to be done on the GSEs. This is one large step \nto doing that, and I believe we should. They are too big and they can \ntake this entire economy down, and that is why we have to limit the \nsize of them. I would encourage my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Has all the time been used in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 2 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Ohio has 1 minute 45 seconds, as does the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I don't understand this Brown amendment. \nBasically what it says is if you are successful--we are not talking \nabout too big to fail here, we are talking about entities, businesses \nthat are big, yes. They are actually not as big as a lot of the \ninternational banks they compete with, and that we as a Nation compete \nwith, but they are large and they are successful. You are going to \nbreak them up. Where does this stop? Do we take on McDonald's? Do we \ntake on Wal-Mart? Do we take on Microsoft? Do we take on Google? Should \nwe set a standard that we as a body can step in and unilaterally decide \nthat some company has gotten too large and deserves to be broken up, \neven if it is healthy?\n  If it is a systemic risk because it has overextended itself and put \nitself into a situation where we have a question of whether it can \nsurvive, then we have the resolution authority to take care of that. \nBut why would we--we 100 people--think we know enough to start breaking \nup businesses in this Nation which are profitable and which make us \ncompetitive as a Nation? It doesn't make any sense to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield back the remaining time.\n  Mr. DODD. I don't think I have any time left, do I?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I would only say that Alan \nGreenspan, not someone who has been on a crusade to break up America's \nbusinesses, talking about these banks, said too big to fail is too big. \nI think that sums it up pretty well.\n  I yield the remainder of my time, and I ask for the yeas and nays on \nthe Brown amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to ordering the yeas and \nnays on the Brown amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: We are voting first \non the Ensign amendment, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Utah (Mr. Bennett), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), the \nSenator from South Carolina (Mr. DeMint), the Senator from Indiana (Mr. \nLugar), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are no further votes today. As I \nunderstand it, there will be no votes tomorrow. But there will be a \nsession tomorrow for Members to come and to be heard on the remaining \nparts of the bill or amendments we still have to consider.\n  I think we all heard the majority leader, Senator Reid, make the \npoint that I made earlier; that is, I intend to be here all weekend. My \nstaff and Senator Shelby's staff will be as well. So for those Members \nwho still have amendments, we are more than happy to sit down and try \nto resolve and work together on those amendments to see if we can't \nreach agreement on some or at least to work with the authors of the \namendments or their staffs. So we will be here to do that.\n  Let me just thank all Members again. Mr. President, it is Richard \nShelby's birthday today--my seatmate on the Banking Committee, the \nformer chairman of the Banking Committee--and I would just note that, \neven though he was late for his dinner with Annette, his lovely wife, \nwe stepped aside around 4 p.m. this afternoon--the members of the \nBanking Committee, his staff, and I--and we brought out a nice cake for \nSenator Shelby. So we celebrated in the midst of the debate.\n  It is important for the people of the country to know that we have \nvery strong differences--I had strong objections to the Shelby \namendment today, and we debated that. Yet despite those very strong \ndifferences, and while we disagree with each other on substantive \nissues, we can enjoy each other's company on a personal level, on a \ncivil level.\n  So let me, on behalf of all of us today, wish Richard Shelby a very \nhappy birthday on this day. Again, I thank him for his cooperation and \nthat of his staff.\n  I thank our floor staff today as well, working hard every day. They \nare here every day early in the morning and they stay here with us \nuntil late in the evening. So I want to thank them all for their \ntremendous work.\n  With that, Mr. President, I am all done, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to discuss an amendment that would \nexpand the Financial Stability Council established in S. 3217 to \ninclude the Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration. It is \nimportant that the council incorporate a Federal credit union regulator \nto ensure consumer regulation protections. Ninety-two million Americans \nare members of credit unions.\n  Insofar as S. 3217, section 1023 provides that any member agency of \nthe council may set aside a final regulation or provision prescribed by \nthe bureau, a national credit union representative should sit on the \ncouncil to ensure fairness for its members.\n  Moreover, similar legislation passed by the House included the \nChairman of the National Credit Union Administration in its Financial \nServices Oversight Council, so this amendment would make the \ncomposition of the council in both the House and Senate consistent.\n  Finally, given their size, no single credit union poses a systemic \nrisk to the overall U.S. financial system.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this statement \nand the supporting letters from the Credit Union National Association, \nthe largest credit union advocacy organization representing nearly 90 \npercent of America's 8,700 State and federally chartered credit unions, \nNational Credit Union Administration, and the National Association of \nFederal Credit Unions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Credit Union National\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2010.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Credit Union \n     National Association, I am writing in support of your \n     amendment to S. 3217 which would add the National Credit \n     Union Administration (NCUA) to the Financial Stability \n     Oversight Council (the Council). CUNA is the largest credit \n     union advocacy organization representing nearly 90 percent of \n     America's 8,700 state and federally chartered credit unions \n     and their 92 million members.\n       Because of the relative size of credit unions, we believe \n     no single credit union is large enough to impose any systemic \n     risk on the overall financial system. Nevertheless, we \n     believe there would be value in having the federal credit \n     union regulator on the Council if for no other reason than \n     Section 1023 of the underlying bill gives the members of the \n     Council the authority to petition to stay or set aside rules \n     promulgated by the Bureau under limited circumstances when \n     the rules may put the safety and soundness of the banking \n     system or the stability of the financial sector of the United \n     States at risk. Your amendment would ensure that the credit \n     union regulator has a voice in the review of the consumer \n     regulations.\n       The House-passed version of this legislation includes the \n     NCUA Chairman on the Financial Services Oversight Council; \n     therefore, your amendment would eliminate a difference \n     between the House-passed version and the Senate bill under \n     consideration and ensure that all of the federal financial \n     regulators are part of the Council.\n       On behalf of America's credit unions, thank you very much \n     for introducing this amendment. We look forward to working \n     with you to secure its inclusion in S. 3217.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Daniel A. Mica,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   National Credit\n\n\n                                         Union Administration,\n\n                                      Alexandria, VA, May 5, 2010.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins:\n       Thank you for your leadership in drafting an amendment to \n     S. 3217, the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of \n     2010, to add the Chairman of the National Credit Union \n     Administration (NCUA) as a voting member of the Financial \n     Stability Oversight Council (the Council).\n       I have had the opportunity to review the proposed \n     amendment. I wish to express my strong support for both the \n     amendment and the underlying bill.\n       As you know, the NCUA was not included as a member of the \n     Council in the legislation as reported by the Senate \n     Committee on\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\n     Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. Among other duties and \n     responsibilities, members of the Council may petition the \n     full Council to set aside a rule (or a part thereof) issued \n     by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection if that rule \n     threatens the safety and soundness of the U.S. financial \n     sector or our system of depository institutions.\n       It bears noting that the NCUA Chairman is a designated \n     member of the Consumer Financial Protection Oversight Board \n     in the House-passed measure. If adopted, I believe your \n     amendment would help harmonize the House and Senate bills \n     with respect to oversight of the Consumer Financial \n     Protection Agency or Bureau, particularly in regard to the \n     credit union system.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this important \n     matter and for the opportunity to review and comment on your \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Debbie Matz,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                        Federal Credit Unions,\n\n                                       Arlington, VA, May 5, 2010.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing on behalf of the \n     National Association of Federal Credit Unions (NAFCU), the \n     only trade organization exclusively representing the \n     interests of our nation's federal credit unions, in support \n     of your amendment to the Restoring American Financial \n     Stability Act of 2010 (S. 3217) that would add the Chairman \n     of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to the \n     Financial Stability Oversight Council established in the \n     underlying bill.\n       We applaud your efforts to ensure that the voices of credit \n     unions are heard by placing NCUA on the oversight council.

Mr. President, this May 7 is National Public Gardens Day, \na day for us to celebrate the important role public gardens play in our \ncommunities and throughout our Nation. Across this great country, more \nthan 500 public gardens are keeping our Nation connected to our natural \nworld, our history, and our culture. These public gardens include \narboreta, botanical gardens, zoos, historic landscapes, college \ncampuses, and children's gardens. Together they form a web that \npreserves the beauty and complexity of plants and animals and \nhumanity's interaction with them.\n  There is a great thirst for the knowledge and experiences public \ngardens can provide. Gardening is the most popular hobby in the United \nStates, and more than 70 million people visit public gardens annually. \nPeople from all backgrounds, age groups, and geographic regions \nregularly share in the beauty and serenity of natural spaces such as \nour public gardens.\n  Here in Washington, DC, just across the street from the Capitol, is \nthe U.S. Botanic Garden. Called ``America's Garden,'' it is a gateway \nfor people to enjoy the beauty of plants while learning about the role \nplants play in commerce, culture, and kinship. The United States \nBotanic Garden is also responsible for helping to preserve and maintain \nthe Capitol Grounds, which are enjoyed by over 3 million people who \nvisit the Capitol every year.\n  In my own home State of Illinois, our 32 public gardens include \nwonderful and varied institutions, such as the Morton Arboretum and the \nQuad City Botanical Center, places such as the Cantigny Foundation and \nthe Skokie Northshore Sculpture Park.\n  Among Illinois' valued public gardens is the Chicago Botanic Garden, \nwhich serves nearly 1 million visitors annually. Its classes are \nattended by 57,000 visitors, well over half of them school-age \nchildren. Millions of schoolchildren have been educated by public \ngardens about the wonders of nature and the important role of plants in \nour everyday lives, from the food we eat, to the clothes we wear, to \nthe homes we live in. The Chicago Botanic Garden has hosted 22,000 \nchildren on field trips in the past year, providing opportunities for \nthem to interact with nature--a special opportunity for some who may \nnever otherwise get to see a real meadow or visit a lake.\n  Public gardens are not only committed to growing plants; they are \ncommitted to growing minds. As a result, public gardens everywhere are \npartnering extensively with local schools, colleges and universities, \nnonprofit organizations, and civic associations. Together they have \nworked on projects ranging from habitat restoration to landscape \nbeautification, as well as on school-based education programs, public \nhealth education programs, and community and school gardens.\n  The Chicago Botanic Garden is a wonderful example of the partnerships \noccurring between our public gardens and our colleges. Its Windy City \nHarvest program partners with City Colleges of Chicago to provide \nsummer jobs and hands-on training for teenagers at sustainable \nagriculture sites within Chicago. Through this partnership, \nparticipants are trained in producing high-value organic produce, which \nis sold at retail outlets and is made available to local residents. \nProgram participants not only gain important entrepreneurial skills, \nthey learn where their food comes from and the value in nurturing plant \nlife.\n  We can rely on public gardens to deliver timely and critical \nresources for plant and water conservation, ecosystem management, green \nspace preservation, and environmental stewardship. Visitors to public \ngardens have the opportunity to view regionally appropriate landscapes \nthat preserve our precious natural resources--and give them ideas for \ncreating their own.\n  Public gardens also serve as repositories for rare and endangered \nplant species. The research conducted by public gardens on these \nendangered plant species can be crucial to their survival.\n  Through their conservation and propagation efforts, many plants that \nwould have been lost to us forever through extinction have been saved.\n  Therefore, this May 7 we should celebrate our public gardens and the \nmany contributions they make to our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/06/senate-section/article/S3353-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3353-S3354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SECRET HOLDS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining an effort \nspearheaded by the Senator from Missouri, Mrs. McCaskill, to put an end \nto the practice of Senators secretly holding up legislation or \nnominations. Senators who want to block a bill or nomination should be \nwilling to state their objection on the record. Many of us thought we \nhad addressed that problem when Congress approved the Honest Leadership \nand Open Government Act of 2007. Unfortunately, the problem of secret \nholds persists, and the new rule needs to be tightened.\n  As with any Senator, there are times when I object to passage of a \nbill or confirmation of a nominee. It has not been my practice to try \nto keep my objection secret, however. For example, when the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. McCain, and I objected to confirmation of the \nnomination of John Sullivan to a term on the Federal Election \nCommission last year, we released a statement publicly stating our \naction and our reasons. We made clear that, until the White House \nnominates replacements for the two other commissioners whose terms have \nexpired, we would not consent to Mr. Sullivan's confirmation. The FEC \nis currently mired in anti-enforcement gridlock, and the President must \nnominate new commissioners with a demonstrated commitment to the \nexistence and enforcement of the campaign finance laws.\n  Similarly, when I had concerns about legislation introduced by the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, S. 132, I discussed my \nconcerns directly with\n\n[[Page S3354]]\n\nher. I have proposed changes that would make the bill more effective in \naddressing the serious problem of gang-related violence, and I look \nforward to passage of the amended bill.\n  Mr. President, it is not enough to fight for change--you need to lead \nby example, too. So I will make it my practice to have printed a \nstatement in the Record when I object to bringing up legislation or a \nnomination. And I urge my colleagues to do the same, and to support \nefforts to eliminate loopholes in the current rule.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/06/senate-section/article/S3354-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             REMOVING HOLDS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on April 16, 2010, Senator Merkley and I \nobjected to any unanimous consent agreement in connection with the \nnominations of Sharon E. Burke, to be the Director of Operational \nEnergy Plans and Programs at the Department of Defense; Catherine \nHammack, to be the Assistant Secretary of the Army; and Elizibeth A. \nMcGrath, to be the Deputy Chief Management Officer at DOD. At that \ntime, we needed assurance that DOD was taking the appropriate action to \naddress the increasing conflict between national renewable energy \npolicy and national defense.\n  I am pleased to say that we have dropped our objections to any \nunanimous consent agreement to consider these three nominations.\n  I am encouraged with the progress the Department of Defense, along \nwith the Federal Aviation Administration, has achieved to acknowledge \nthe critical nature of our future renewable energy program and its \nimpact to national defense. Both agencies now appear committed to \naddress the systemic process issues associated with siting our \nrenewable energy programs. I hope this commitment continues. Because \nthere is much more work to be done.\n  I believe we must pursue upgrading hardware and software for all of \nour radar arrays and adjust the siting permit process so that companies \nknow in advance, not at the eleventh hour, of any DOD objections. But I \nalso believe there is a need for an impartial entity with the authority \nto consider strategic civilian energy development and national defense \nneeds. I know it won't be easy, but I look forward to working with the \nadministration and Defense Department to establish such an \norganization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/06/senate-section/article/S3354-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3354-S3355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MAYOR LUKE RAVENSTAHL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Pittsburgh \nMayor Luke Ravenstahl, the residents of the city of Pittsburgh and all \nthe citizens of southwestern Pennsylvania on Pittsburgh being \nrecognized yet again, this time by Forbes, as the Nation's most livable \ncity.\n  I have been visiting Pittsburgh every few weeks for over 30 years and \nI have witnessed its transformation into a progressive metropolitan \narea. I am pleased to see people from around the United States and \naround the globe recognize the unique quality of life in the Pittsburgh \nregion. The region has transformed shuttered factories and brownfields \ninto attractive and bustling riverfront developments and a breathtaking \nskyline.\n  People have always been aware of Pittsburgh's rich history from the \ndays of the French and Indian wars to the Industrial Revolution and the \nbirth of Organized Labor, but now people are seeing its transformation \ninto the new economy as well. Steel mills are still here, but the \nregion has also embraced and excelled in life sciences, robotics, green \nbuildings, renewable energy and advanced manufacturing. This \nadvancement has been spurred by world class universities and healthcare \ninstitutions, fueled by innovative entrepreneurs, and supported by a \nvibrant foundation and civic community.\n  The Pittsburgh region enjoys an abundance of natural resources, \noutdoor amenities, world class arts and cultural institutions, low cost \nof living, low crime rates, low housing costs, and of course world \nchampion sports teams.\n  As many of my colleagues understand, we still face many environmental \nand infrastructure challenges with our postindustrial ``Rust Belt'' \nregions, and we must work together to support their rebirth and \ncontinued growth. I am pleased to recognize Pittsburgh and its people \nwho exemplify so well the model for 2lst century economic growth and \nrecovery in America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Forbes article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Pittsburgh Tops List of Most-livable Cities in U.S.\n\n                          (By Francesca Levy)\n\n       Each year Carnegie Mellon's Tepper School of Business \n     attracts some of the brightest master's degree candidates in \n     the country. But the admissions staff occasionally has to \n     sway prospective students with their choice of top schools \n     who wonder why they should relocate to Pittsburgh, Pa. \n     ``Pittsburgh has a really great cultural scene. We have a \n     great ballet and a great symphony that travels the world and \n     performs to packed houses, and there's a restaurant scene \n     that's much more diverse than it ever was when I was growing \n     up,'' says Wendy Hermann, director of student services for \n     master's programs and a Pittsburgh native. ``And it's an \n     easier sell, now that the Steelers and Penguins won their \n     respective titles.''\n       Indeed, Pittsburgh's art scene, job prospects, safety and \n     affordability make it the most livable city in the country, \n     according to measures studied. The city has rebounded from \n     its manufacturing past. Disused steel mills have been \n     repurposed into multimedia art centers, and amid a struggling \n     national economy, Google Pittsburgh, a test site for the \n     company's new high-speed broadband network, has expanded its \n     offices to accommodate more hires.\n       Pittsburgh's strong university presence--the city has over \n     a dozen colleges or campuses--helps bolster its livability. \n     In fact, the key to finding the easiest places to live may be \n     to follow the students. Most of the metros on our list--\n     including Ann Arbor, Mich., Provo, Utah, and Manchester, \n     N.H.--are college towns.\n       ``Universities are large employers in their cities,'' says \n     Alexander Von Hoffman, senior fellow at the Joint Center for \n     Housing Studies at Harvard University. ``In the long term, \n     not only do you have that employment, but you have an \n     educated population, and you have a large youthful population \n     which tends to be a consuming population.''\n       In compiling our list, we measured five data points in the \n     country's 200 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas: \n     unemployment, crime, income growth, the cost of living, and \n     artistic and cultural opportunities.\n       To find out where jobs were available and incomes were \n     steadily growing, we ranked cities both by their rate of \n     income growth over the past five years and the current \n     unemployment rate, based on data from the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics. The stronger the income growth trend and the \n     lower the unemployment, the higher each city ranked. Jobs \n     don't mean everything, though: A city is more livable if a \n     family's income goes further. Using cost of living data from \n     Moody's Economy.com, we ranked cities higher that had lower \n     costs for everyday goods.\n       Some places are inexpensive, but still not desirable, so we \n     included a measure for crime, using the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation's and Sperling's Best Places reports on the \n     number of crimes per 100,000 residents, ranking low-crime \n     cities higher. We also considered a thriving local culture \n     crucial to livability, so we gave higher rankings to cities \n     that scored highly on the Arts & Leisure index created by \n     Sperling's Best Places. We averaged the rankings for each of \n     these metrics to arrive at a final score.\n       Ogden, Utah, No. 2 on our list, is home to Weber State \n     University. Unemployment in the metro is below average, and \n     incomes have increased by 3.4 percent over the last five \n     years. Provo, Utah, a city 80 miles away and our No. 3 most \n     livable, is home to Brigham Young University, the country's \n     largest private college. The metro has the highest five-year \n     income growth, 5.2 percent, of all the cities measured. \n     Lincoln, Neb., (No. 9), home to the University of Nebraska's \n     main campus, boasts the lowest unemployment rate , 4.9 \n     percent, of all the metros we surveyed. Unemployment is also \n     at a low 5.9 percent in Omaha, Neb. (No. 5) home to a \n     University of Nebraska campus and roughly a dozen other \n     colleges.\n       Cities once driven by jobs in steel manufacturing, \n     railroads and textile mills suffered as those industries \n     dried up in the 1970s. But it's a mistake to write off places \n     like Pittsburgh, Pa., Harrisburg, Pa., and Manchester, N.H., \n     Nos. one, five and seven on our list, respectively. \n     Manchester, once dominated by textile mills, is revitalizing \n     itself, converting its maze of mills and foundries into \n     medical centers, museums and apartment buildings that now \n     drive the local economy. The city has the second-lowest crime \n     rate of all the metros we surveyed, incomes have grown 3 \n     percent in five years, and at 7.7 percent, its unemployment \n     rate is below the national average.\n       In only a few of our most livable cities does population \n     growth match prospects for employment and inexpensive living. \n     Provo saw an 8 percent population boom between 2000 and 2006, \n     and the head count in Omaha rose by 7.2 percent over the same \n     period. In most of the cities on the list, however, the \n     population has shrunk, or grown only by meager percentages, \n     suggesting that word\n\n[[Page S3355]]\n\n     about the quality of life there hasn't yet gotten out. Being \n     a well-kept secret is just fine for some residents.\n       ``I'm a big proponent of Pittsburgh,'' says Hermann. ``But \n     I don't want to spread the message too much.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/06/senate-section/article/S3355-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO KATHLEEN McGHEE\n\n  Mr. Bond. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to one of the \nmost widely respected professional staff members in the Senate--\nKathleen McGhee. She recently marked her 30th anniversary with the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence and has been serving here \nlonger than I have been serving as a U.S. Senator.\n  Kathleen joined the committee staff on April 7, 1980, in order to \nassist the committee's arms control expert. She subsequently provided \nadministrative support to the committee's budget director, minority \ncounsel, and minority staff director. In 1987, Chairman David L. Boren \nappointed Kathleen as the chief clerk of the Intelligence Committee, a \nposition she has held ever since. She has served 11 chairmen, 12 vice \nchairmen, and 278 staff members since joining the staff.\n  Kathleen is the longest serving staff member and the longest serving \nchief clerk in the committee's history, but you would not know it by \nlooking at her. I have it on good authority that she is just as bright \nand energetic today as she was more than 20 years ago. If only we all \nwere so fortunate.\n  In a world where politics often seems to define who we are and with \nwhom we associate, Kathleen transcends those barriers. She has earned \nthe deep respect of Members and colleagues on both sides of the aisle. \nHer work ethic--as evidenced by long hours and ready availability--and \nher attention to detail are admired by all.\n  During my tenure on the Intelligence Committee, and in particular, \nsince becoming the vice chairman, I have benefited from Kathleen's \nbehind-the-scenes orchestration of committee activities. She supervises \nthe administrative support staff of the committee, manages all of the \nday-to-day operations, and is responsible for the preparation and \nimplementation of the committee's operating budget. Simply put--the \ncommittee would cease to function without Kathleen at the helm; she has \nkept the place running like a Swiss watch. We all know that the demands \nof working in Congress often take the greatest toll on those who \nsupport us and sustain us in life--our families. For selflessly giving \nKathleen to us for so many years, her husband Mike, son Luke, and \ndaughter Molly deserve our gratitude. We thank them for their \nsacrifices.\n  Ensuring our great Nation's security is a high calling and one of \ntremendous responsibility. Through her service to the Intelligence \nCommittee, the U.S. Senate, and the United States of America, Kathleen \nMcGhee has answered this call with outstanding professionalism, \nintegrity, and perseverance. Although I will be retiring at the end of \nthis Congress, it is my hope that Kathleen will continue to honor the \nSenate with her service for many years to come. May God bless Kathleen \nand her family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/06/senate-section/article/S3355-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               NEW MEXICO'S NATIONAL SCIENCE BOWL WINNER\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I congratulate a group of \nmiddle school students from Albuquerque Academy in Albuquerque, NM, for \nwinning the top prize at this year's National Science Bowl. This is an \noutstanding and well-deserved achievement after all their hard work \nthroughout this competition, both in Albuquerque and here in \nWashington, DC.\n  Every year since 1991 the U.S. Department of Energy has sponsored the \nNational Science Bowl to encourage high school students to excel in \nmathematics and science. In 2002 a contest was introduced for middle \nschool students, which now involves more than 5,000 students \nnationwide. This year there was an academic question and answer \ncompetition as well as a model hydrogen fuel cell car challenge. By \nencouraging math and science education, competitions like these are \nhelping to create a technically trained and diverse workforce for this \ngeneration and the next.\n  Teammates Andy Chen, Jason Frank Hou, Ben Zolyomi, Eric Li, Raya \nKoreh, and their coach Barbara Gilbert came to Washington, DC, to \ncompete against 37 middle school regional Science Bowl champions in the \nNational Finals. On Monday, May 3, they answered many challenging \nquestions pertaining to biology, geology, and other areas of science. \nThey even answered a few bonus questions from First Lady Michelle \nObama, who later awarded them their trophy, along with Secretary of \nEnergy Stephen Chu. I realize how much studying it takes to prepare for \na competition as rigorous as this, and I commend them on their hard-\nearned reward. It has certainly paid off. Their success should be \napplauded as this truly is a remarkable feat.\n  When they return home to New Mexico, I hope their fellow students and \nteachers are as encouraged as I am by their accomplishment. It is \nvitally important that talent like this doesn't go unnoticed as these \nyoung students will likely be among those helping to find solutions to \nsome of the future's most challenging problems. I believe this team's \nsuccess demonstrates how the United States, and New Mexico in \nparticular, has potential to produce some of tomorrow's scientific \nleaders and innovators. That is why I hope these students will continue \nto pursue their intellectual interests and one day join a critical \nsector within our workforce.\n  I have always believed that investing in science and technology in \nour schools is essential in ensuring that the United States maintains a \ncompetitive edge to provide for our nation's economic strength and \nsecurity. Our students' success depends on the quality of their \neducational opportunities today, and the talent demonstrated by these \nstudents makes me very optimistic about the future.\n  Again, I commend them on this outstanding achievement and wish them \nthe best of luck in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/06/senate-section/article/S3355-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING EL CAMINO REAL HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

As a proud supporter of the \nnursing profession, I am pleased to recognize IKE AO PONO, the \nWorkforce Diversity Program for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander \nnursing students at the School of Nursing and Dental Hygiene.\n  On May 7, 2010, IKE AO PONO will commemorate a historic achievement \nin celebrating the graduation of the first 100 Native Hawaiian and \nPacific Islander nurses from its program in\n\n[[Page S3356]]\n\nonly 6 years, contributing more Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander \nnurses to workforce diversity in Hawaii than in the previous 80 years. \nAs an academic support and cultural enrichment program, IKE AO PONO's \nmission is to increase the number of Native Hawaiian and Pacific \nIslander nurses in Hawaii to improve health and health care, with \nspecial attention to at-risk, underrepresented, and underserved peoples \nand communities.\n  IKE AO PONO envisions a lasting improvement, advancement, and \npromotion of health for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander peoples \nand communities by increasing the number of culturally informed and \nsensitive health professionals in nursing. This increase in Native \nnurses will help to address the dire health disparities of both Native \nHawaiian and Pacific Islanders who have higher rates of diseases such \nas cancer, diabetes and obesity, heart disease and an overall mortality \nrate that is significantly higher than other cultural groups in Hawaii.\n  While the 2000 census showed Native Hawaiians as 23 percent of \nHawaii's population, they represented only 7 percent of the University \nof Hawaii's students, only 2 percent of the UH faculty and \nadministration, and only 4 percent of the nursing workforce. Therefore, \nin 2001, IKE AO PONO began as a 3-year pilot program with six Native \nHawaiian students. By year 3, the numbers of Native Hawaiian and \nPacific Islander nursing students had grown to 66 per semester. Between \n2004 and 2010, the number of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander \nnursing students increased again to 80 students per semester in both \nundergraduate and graduate programs. During this time, IKE AO PONO \nhelped graduate the first Native Hawaiian and the first Samoan Ph.D.s \nin nursing in the 80-year history of the School of Nursing and Dental \nHygiene.\n  Through the IKE AO PONO Program, there are currently 14 times the \nnumber of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander nurses at the School of \nNursing and Dental Hygiene than in 2000, and many are focused on higher \ndegrees in advanced public health, community, health, family health and \nnurse practitioner fields, as well as, a full range of other nursing \nspecialties.\n  With the full support of the School of Nursing and Dental Hygiene, \nthe UH Administration and Board of Regents, the Native Hawaiian \nCouncils of Kualii and Pukoa and community partners such as Papa Ola \nLokahi, Kamehameha Schools, Queen's Medical Center and the Office of \nHawaiian Affairs, IKE AO PONO is also preparing Native nurses to return \nto their home communities to support the health, well-being and \nrecovery of underserved Native islanders in rural areas throughout \nHawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/06/senate-section/article/S3356-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR. EARL S. RICHARDSON\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud today to recognize one \nof Maryland's native sons, Dr. Earl S. Richardson, who will retire \nlater this month after a quarter century at the helm of one of \nMaryland's finest institutions of higher education: Morgan State \nUniversity.\n  Situated in the northern part of Baltimore City, Morgan State \nUniversity has been designated as Maryland's Urban Public University. \nIt is also one of four exemplary public historically Black \nuniversities, HCBUs, in the State of Maryland, each of which has been \noffering students a chance and a choice when it comes to higher ed for \nmore than 100 years.\n  Institutions like these across the country have been accruing an \nincredible benefit to African Americans and the communities they serve. \nHistorically Black colleges and universities produce nearly a quarter \nof our Nation's African-American public school teachers. They also \nproduce almost 40 percent of African-American graduates in physics, \nmath, biology, and environmental sciences.\n  Morgan State has been no exception. During Dr. Richardson's tenure, \nthe university has seen enrollment increase by 35 percent--margins that \nexceed any other public college or university in the State. But the \nquality of applicants has not suffered; Morgan State was able to swell \nits student ranks while attracting top-notch students. Morgan State now \noffers 14 doctoral programs and is known nationally and internationally \nfor its doctoral programs in engineering and the sciences. Morgan \nconsistently graduates a majority of all African Americans in Maryland \nwith Ph.D.s in engineering. These graduates are among the most sought \nafter by American industry. In addition, Morgan's patriotic tradition \nthrough its strong Army ROTC program is exemplified by the fact that it \nhas produced more four-star African-American generals in the U.S. Army \nthan any institution in the Nation except West Point.\n  Over the last 10 years, Morgan State has graduated 10 percent of the \nNation's African-American undergraduates pursuing a degree in physics. \nAlso, under Dr. Richardson's leadership, Morgan State currently leads \nall other public institutions in the State in bachelor's degrees earned \nby African Americans. The university also leads the State in graduating \nmath, science and engineering undergrads--a critical achievement given \nour country's need to cultivate graduates ready to enter a 21st century \nworkforce, where mastery of math and science is the name of the game. \nMorgan is also one of the leading producers of Fulbright Scholars in \nthe Mid-Atlantic region.\n  Dr. Richardson's vision and leadership didn't end there. He also \nfound time to sit on President Clinton's advisory board on HBCUs, \nserving as its chair in 1998; was chairman of the National Association \nfor Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, NAFEO; and participate as a \nmember of the American Council on Education, ACE. I have no doubt that \nhis contributions will benefit current and future students from across \nthe Nation for years to come.\n  But more than all of these accolades, Dr. Richardson's tenure as \npresident of Morgan has been about fighting for opportunity for young \npeople from often economically challenging backgrounds and \nneighborhoods, many the first in their family to attend college. His \nsteadfast commitment to provide them with an urban university that \nprovides them with the means to a better way of life and a career in \nthe sciences or business or engineering, is a testament to his belief \nthat a college degree is often the helping hand young people need to \nachieve success and realize their full potential.\n  I have been a member of the Senate nearly as long as Dr. Richardson \nhas been president at Morgan State, and over the past two decades I \nhave had the pleasure of enjoying this great man's support and \nfriendship.\n  On behalf of myself, and speaking for the thousands of students who \nhave matriculated at Morgan over the past 25 years, I would like to \nrecognize and thank my friend, Dr. Earl Richardson, for a lifetime of \nextraordinarily distinguished service in the field of education. Well \ndone!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/06/senate-section/article/S3356-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3356-S3357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING WILDER'S JEWELRY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this weekend, Americans celebrate \nMothers Day, a time to pay tribute to the women in our lives and the \nincredible work that they do every day. As is frequently noted, women \noften juggle the dual roles of being a mother and maintaining a \nprofessional career. This situation is made even more difficult for the \nroughly 10.4 million women who are small business owners. Indeed, \nwomen-owned small businesses are one of the fastest growing segments of \nour Nation's economy. To highlight the work of one mother in my home \nState who is simultaneously running an historic small business in \nnorthern Maine, today I recognize the accomplishments of Cathy \nBeaulieu, the owner of Wilder's Jewelry in Presque Isle, for her \nsteadfast dedication to small business, to her community, and, of \ncourse, to her family.\n  Cathy grew up in the St. John Valley, a stunning beautiful and scenic \nregion at Maine's crest, where she was instilled with the famous work \nethic of Maine's strong people. After exploring other places, she \nreturned to Aroostook County--known to locals as simply ``the County.'' \nShe went to work at Wilder's Jewelry store, a fixture in downtown \nPresque Isle which was originally opened by Ike Wilder nearly 80 years \nago. His son, Harry, continued the family business until 1996, when \nCathy purchased the business from him, along with the historic building \nwhere it is located.\n\n[[Page S3357]]\n\n  Wilder's sells a wide array of jewelry that will fit any budget, from \ntraditional fine diamonds, rings, and watches to more contemporary \ncostume jewelry, as well as stunning giftware items. Wilder's also \noffers customers unique, handmade gifts such as ``knobstoppers''--golf \nballs or old door knobs fitted with wine corks--to cap wine bottles. \nWilder's purchases some of its products from an organization called \nSarah's Hope, which funds microloans to help budding women \nentrepreneurs hone their craft and grow their businesses. By appealing \nto everyone, Wilder's has thrived through some of the most difficult \neconomic times our country has seen in decades.\n  Another reason for her success is Cathy's visible and passionate \nconcern for her community. She has served as the president of the \nGreater Presque Isle Area Chamber of Commerce, as well as president of \nthe Downtown Revitalization Committee, and she remains active in \npromoting the well-being of her city, attending city council meetings \nand speaking out on issues of concern to the community.\n  Cathy also donates time, money, and resources to numerous charities \nthroughout Aroostook County, from the Wintergreen Arts Center to the \nPresque Isle Rotary Club's annual Radio-TV auction, as well as a number \nof veteran causes. She also frequently sponsors trade shows in the \narea, and seven years ago helped begin a new annual Presque Isle \ntradition called Main Street Mania, a block party-style event where \nMain Street is shut to vehicular traffic while downtown businesses \noffer bargains to the maze of expectant shoppers. Cathy is also \nactively involved in a variety of school activities with her three \nbeautiful children.\n  I have had the pleasure of meeting Cathy Beaulieu on several \noccasions to hear her views on the difficulties concerning running a \nsmall business in Maine, and I have always come away impressed by her \npassion, determination, and perseverance. By raising a family and \nrunning a business at the same time, she is a shining example of \nMaine's motto, ``Dirigo''--or ``I lead.'' Cathy Beaulieu is truly a \nleader, and I thank her for all of her noteworthy efforts in running a \nsuccessful business, supporting her community, and raising her \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/06/senate-section/article/S3357-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:11 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2421.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Coburn):\n  S. 3323. A bill to improve the management and oversight of Federal \ncontracts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the bipartisan \nFederal Contracting and Oversight Act. Every year millions of taxpayer \ndollars are awarded to contractors with a history of poor performance \nand misconduct because our federal contracting oversight regime, though \nwell-intentioned, is broken.\n  The problems in our contracting oversight regime were first brought \nto my attention by my constituents in Wisconsin, several of whom are \nsmall businesses that have suffered as a result of misconduct by a \nFederal contractor. In one case, a Federal contractor that has received \nover $6 million in Federal contracts failed to pay small businesses in \nWisconsin that worked as subcontractors. Several years later, the Army \nfinally barred the contractor from receiving Federal dollars, finding \nthat the contractor had ``a documented history of failing to pay \nsubcontractors for services rendered pursuant to government \ncontracts.'' We must ensure that these records of poor performance and \nmisconduct are identified before federal contracts are awarded to \ncontractors, not years later after the damage has already been done.\n  As I studied the issue further, I learned that similar problems were \nwidespread and well documented. The Government Accountability Office \nhas documented numerous instances of suspended and debarred companies \ncontinuing to receive federal contracts. In one case, a company that \nhad been debarred for attempting to ship nuclear bomb parts to North \nKorea continued to receive millions of dollars on an Army contract. In \nanother case, a contractor that had been suspended after one of its \nemployees was found to have sabotaged repairs on an aircraft carrier \nwas awarded three new contracts a month after the incident.\n  We must act to ensure that these incidents do not repeat themselves. \nAmerican taxpayer dollars should be spent responsibly and the flaws of \nour contracting process should never be allowed to affect our security.\n  Our Federal contracting process is in urgent need of reform and \ngreater oversight. To that end, I am introducing the Federal \nContracting and Oversight Act, which is an important step to prevent \nthe continued Federal patronage of private companies unworthy of our \ntaxpayers' hard-earned dollars.\n  I am encouraged that Senator Coburn has also taken note of the flaws \nof the Federal contracting process and has joined me in this effort as \nan original cosponsor. This bill also has the support of experts that \nclosely track our federal contracting process, including the Project on \nGovernment Oversight, the Center for American Progress, Taxpayers for \nCommon Sense, and OMB Watch.\n  This bill will protect the hard-earned dollars of American taxpayers \nby improving the federal contracting system in three ways:\n  First, this bill will make the system more transparent.\n  Sunshine continues to be the best disinfectant; unfortunately, some \nof the most important data concerning contractor performance and \nmisconduct is shielded from the scrutiny of the full Congress and \nAmerican people.\n  This bill will broaden access to the new Federal Awardee Performance \nand Integrity Information System, FAPIIS, database, which contains a \ncomprehensive picture of the records of Federal contractors including \ndetails of criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, contract \ndefaults, suspension and debarments, and other violations of federal \nacquisition laws.\n  Under my bill, every member of Congress will be able to access the \ndatabase in order to review the records of contractors. This is an \nimportant step towards greater transparency in our contracting \noversight system. Each member of Congress has an interest in monitoring \nhow the taxpayer dollars of their constituents are being spent.\n  Second, this bill will empower our contracting officers by giving \nthem the tools and resources they need to adequately vet companies \nseeking Federal dollars.\n  Contracting officers currently make award decisions with only a \nlimited set of information that is insufficient to support an informed \ndecision. These contracting officers often lack the information they \nneed to adequately review a company's contracting history.\n  This bill helps ensure that these officers have a more comprehensive \npicture of a company's contracting history before they make an award \ndecision. Under this bill, the information available to them will \ninclude information on a broader range of misconduct, such as that \noccurring over 5 years ago, pertaining to a wider range of contracts or \nresulting in a more inclusive list of legal proceedings. This bill also \nrequires companies vying for Federal dollars to self-report essential \ndetails about their past performance before they can receive a contract \naward. Together, these provisions will help ensure that those officials \nentrusted with awarding Federal contract dollars have all the resources \nthey need to make an informed decision.\n  Third, this bill will strengthen the current oversight regime by \nfixing loopholes and shortcomings that have undermined its \neffectiveness. An oversight regime can only be effective if it is used, \nand used properly. It is unacceptable that taxpayer dollars continue to \ngo to companies that have already been suspended or debarred, just \nbecause contracting officers have failed to either record or check \ntheir status.\n  Accordingly, this bill tasks the Comptroller General with producing \nan annual report on the extent to which companies that have been \nsuspended and debarred continue to receive federal contracts or waivers \nto receive federal contracts. This is an important step towards \nensuring that the problems in our contracting process receive the \ncongressional and public scrutiny they deserve. This bill also requires \nthe Inspectors General of each federal agency involved in the \nprocurement process to conduct an annual audit to ensure that \ncontracting officials are appropriately considering the past \nperformance and misconduct of contractors.\n  The source of the oversight regime's ineffectiveness also lies in its \ndesign, which is in need of both consolidation and modernization.\n  When contracting officials begin to review a company's contracting \nhistory, the information they need is spread across numerous databases. \nThey have to navigate an unorganized array of databases, including: the \nExcluded Parties List System, Central Contractor Registry, Contractor \nPerformance Assessment Reporting System, Federal Assistance Award Data \nSystem, Federal Awardee Performance\n\n[[Page S3363]]\n\nand Integrity Information System, Federal Business Opportunities \nDatabase, Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation, Past \nPerformance Information Retrieval System, and USAspending.gov, among \nothers.\n  We must integrate these databases to ensure that contracting \nofficials have a one-stop source for relevant contracting information. \nI am pleased that the General Services Administration has taken some \npositive steps in this direction, but any consolidation must be \ncomprehensive. Accordingly, this bill requires the Office of Management \nand Budget to develop and submit a plan to integrate and consolidate \nthe nine most important databases into a single searchable and linked \nnetwork.\n  Another reason why suspended and debarred companies continue to \nreceive federal contracts in error is because the unique identification \nsystem used to track companies is ineffective and in need of \nmodernization. The Government Accountability Office has documented that \nthe current identification system fails to adequately track \nsubsidiaries, spin-offs, shell companies, and other related entities. \nThis weak tracking system permits some suspended and debarred companies \nto access federal dollars to which they are not legally entitled.\n  To that end, this bill requires the Inspector General of the General \nServices Administration to determine whether the existing system of \nidentifying numbers for contractors is adequately tracking Federal \ncontractors, and develop a plan for developing and adopting a new and \nmore robust identification system.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The American people \nentrust us with their hard-earned tax dollars, and we have a \nresponsibility to ensure that their money is being spent appropriately.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BEGICH (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 3325. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nthe waiver of the collection of copayments for telehealth and \ntelemedicine visits of veterans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \namend title 38, related to this Nation's obligation to provide benefits \nto our veterans. Specifically, the bill I introduce today with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Grassley of Iowa will waive collection \nof copayments for telehealth and telemedicine visits for veterans.\n  More than 42,000 veterans are receiving care in their homes, enrolled \nin the Veterans Health Administration, VHA, Telemedicine program as one \nform of treatment. In Alaska, as of March 2010, there were 226 veterans \nreceiving this service. Just over 100 of those live in rural Alaska.\n  Home Telehealth programs provide needed care for the 2-3 percent of \nveterans who account for 30 percent or more of agency resources. These \nmen and women are frequent clinic attendees and often require urgent \nhospital admissions. VHA programs have demonstrated reduced hospital \nadmissions and clinic and emergency room visits, and contribute to an \nimproved quality of life for our veterans.\n  For no group of veterans is this service more important than for \nthose who live in rural and remote Alaska. Telemedicine has become an \nincreasingly integral component in addressing the needs of veterans \nresiding in rural and remote areas, and is critical to ensuring they \nhave proper access to health care, especially in rural areas.\n  While the VHA is saving taxpayers money by using telemedicine, \ncurrently all telemedicine visits require veterans receiving these \ntreatments to make copayments. My legislation would implement a simple \nfix. It would waive the required copayments--sometimes up to $50.00 per \nvisit--to lessen the burden on our veterans, who have sacrificed in \nservice to our great Nation. I believe that waiving these fees may \nencourage more veterans to take advantage of VHA's telehealth programs, \nwhich can be a godsend for rural veterans with few other viable \noptions.\n  For rural veterans in Alaska, who have to travel by small float \nplanes or boats or even snow machines to get to the nearest clinic for \nmonitoring of their diabetes, high blood pressure, or other chronic \nconditions, Congress can go a long way in repaying this Nation's debt \nto our veterans by passing this legislation.\n  The VHA plans to expand Home Telehealth for weight management, \nsubstance abuse, mild traumatic brain injury, dementia, and palliative \ncare, as well as enabling veterans to use mobile devices to access \ncare. I would hate to see these vital services go unused by veterans \nliving in remote Alaskan villages because of the cost of copayments. \nBut, this is not primarily about saving veterans money. This is about \nthe Federal Government doing what is good for our veterans. The \nmonetary benefits for veterans are a plus.\n  Basically, this legislation will amend title 38 to authorize the \nwaiver of the collection of copayments for telehealth and telemedicine \nvisits of veterans by giving the Secretary the authority to do so.\n  In closing, I must say it is an honor for me to serve as a member of \nthe Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. I feel very privileged to be \ninvolved with policy formation that helps our veterans, and indeed to \nbe at the same table as the distinguished chairman of the committee, a \nveteran of World War II himself, Senator Daniel Akaka, who throughout \nhis service in Congress has been a true advocate for our veterans. I \nappreciate the guidance he has provided me, and the assistance his \nstaff has provided mine in preparation of this legislation.\n  This is a bipartisan bill to address an issue with no partisan \nconnection. I strongly encourage my colleagues to join Senator Grassley \nand me in co-sponsoring this legislation, and I urge expeditious \nconsideration of the legislation to address a growing need for our \nrural veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/06/senate-section/article/S3363-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3363-S3364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3860.
