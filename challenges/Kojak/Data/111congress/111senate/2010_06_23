Mr. President, I come to the floor today as someone who \nhas practiced medicine and taken care of families in Wyoming since \n1983. Again this weekend I was home in Wyoming visiting with families \nacross the State. I was in Thermopolis for Father's Day. I was in \nSheridan and in Casper. In all those communities I had a chance to \nvisit with people who are concerned about the direction of the country \nand are concerned about this new health care law.\n  Mr. President, I tell you this because I ran into a number of people \nI have taken care of as their doctor. This happened at church on Sunday \nmorning, where people asked the question: With\n\n[[Page S5284]]\n\nthis new health care law, will I be able to keep my doctor? So I come \nto you because there is more news as a result of the changes in the \nhealth care law in this country. I bring to you my doctor's second \nopinion as to what the impact of this health care law is going to be on \nthe families across the country.\n  Specifically, at church, I was hearing from someone I operated on and \nsomebody on Medicare, and they were saying: Am I going to keep my \ndoctor under Medicare? These people have a right to be concerned. It is \nbecause of what has come out in this past week. It is a front-page \narticle, USA TODAY: ``Doctors Limit New Medicare Patients.''\n  I have said from the beginning, as this body was debating and \ndiscussing the health care bill that has now come to be law, that I \nbelieved this was going to be bad for patients, bad for payers--the \nAmerican taxpayers who have to pay for the care as well as people who \npay for their individual care--and bad for providers, the nurses and \ndoctors and hospitals that take care of all of these patients.\n  So I come to you with a second opinion because I think what has \nbecome law--a bill that cuts Medicare, cuts payment for our seniors on \nMedicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion--not to help seniors, not to help save \nMedicare, but to start a whole new government program for other people \nis resulting in devastating impacts for families all around the country \nwho are on Medicare or will soon be on Medicare.\n  One of the interesting things about this article in USA TODAY--this \nwas Monday's USA TODAY--there is a list, a table of the number of \npeople who are currently on Medicare and who will be on Medicare by the \nyear 2015 and will be on Medicare by the year 2020. What we are seeing \nis, as Americans are living longer due to advances in medicine, \nadvances in technology--people are living longer--more and more people \nevery day are turning Medicare age, so the number of people on Medicare \ncontinues to grow.\n  As a matter of fact, if you do the math, there are over 4,000 \nAmericans every day being added to the Medicare ranks. That is almost \n1.5 million Americans a year. The question is, Who will the doctors be? \nWhere will the health care providers come from to take care of these \npeople? It is fascinating, when you read the article and you see the \ncomplete disconnect between Washington and the reality of the rest of \nAmerica.\n  Because, according to this article, the people from the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services say 97 percent of doctors accept \nMedicare, so do not worry. That is what the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid say.\n  The American Medical Association says 17 percent of over 9,000 \ndoctors who were surveyed are actually restricting the number of \nMedicare patients in their practice. Among primary care doctors--which \nis key for our seniors to be able to see primary care doctors--31 \npercent of primary care doctors are restricting access to Medicare \npatients. Just since the first of the year in North Carolina, 117 \ndoctors have opted out of Medicare. That does not include the ones who \nhad opted out before. We are talking since January 1, 117 doctors in \nNorth Carolina have opted out of Medicare.\n  In Illinois, in the President's home State, 18 percent of doctors \nrestrict the number of Medicare patients in their practice. In New York \nState, about 1,100 doctors have left Medicare. Even the president of \nthe Medical Society of New York is not taking new Medicare patients. No \nnew Medicare patients. You say: Why are these physicians no longer \ntaking Medicare patients? It has to do a lot with the way Washington \ndeals with Medicare patients, Medicare and the doctors around the \ncountry.\n  At this point, there is going to be a cut of 21 percent in what \nMedicare pays doctors for services they give. Prior to that, Medicare \nalways has been kind of a deadbeat payor when it comes to paying for \nhealth care. Medicare has not kept up with medical inflation in this \ncountry. So as physicians, it is a challenge to take care of patients \non Medicare. With 4,000 new people joining the ranks of Medicare on a \ndaily basis, who will care for those people?\n  You can imagine, I was fairly surprised when the President of the \nUnited States yesterday visited with a number of people at the White \nHouse. He put out remarks printed from the White House and talked about \nwhat his new plan does. He says Americans--this is astonishing. The \nPresident of the United States said yesterday: Americans will be able \nto keep the primary care doctor or pediatrician they choose. He says \nthese protections preserve America's choice of doctors.\n  What happens if your doctor cannot afford to keep you? We have the \nPresident of the United States, for well over a year, making statements \njust like the one he made a year ago: If you like your health care \nplan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. That is \nwhat the President said. He said: No one will take it away. Period. No \nmatter what. Period.\n  Yet here we are looking at the facts. Doctors are limiting new \nMedicare patients, and 4,000 new patients every day are joining the \nMedicare rolls looking for doctors. We see it all across the United \nStates.\n  That is why the public remains very skeptical about this new health \ncare law, and why 58 percent of Americans want this law repealed. That \nis why the American people, when they heard Nancy Pelosi say: We have \nto pass the bill before you get to find out what is in it, why the \nAmerican people who are now finding out what is in it are very \ndistressed. They were hoping to take the President at his word when he \nsaid he was trying to lower costs and improve quality and increase \naccess to care.\n  But this body did not pass into law, nor did the House, a reform \npackage that will do those things the American people had wanted, had \nasked for, and had heard from their President they would get--something \nthat would lower costs, improve quality, and increase access to care. \nWhat the American people are seeing is the cost of their care is going \nto continue to go up, and the quality and the availability is likely to \ngo down. That is not what the American people asked for in this health \ncare law. That is why so many Americans are opposed to it. I talked \nwith people all across Wyoming, and they think of what the impact is \ngoing to be on their own lives and their own family. People all across \nthis country are worried for their own health care, that they are going \nto end up paying more and getting less. That is why the public remains \nvery skeptical about what has been passed into law.\n  Twenty States have filed suit against the Federal Government because \nof a national mandate that people have to buy insurance. The Department \nof Health and Human Services, which says 97 percent of doctors are \nstill taking care of Medicare patients, there actually has been a new \nnominee to take care of that Department. We have not yet had hearings \nin the Senate. We have not been able to ask those specific questions of \nthat nominee: What about taking care of these patients? How will they \nfind doctors under this new law and this new plan?\n  Here we are, 90 days after the health care law has been enacted, \nsigned into law, 90 days ago this became law. The White House is \nholding press conferences and again repeating promises to the American \npeople that the American people know have been broken. There is a \nlitany of broken promises. It just seems that every week something new \ncomes out that the American people look at and say: You know, it is \namazing because we saw this coming. Yet this Congress, this Senate, \njammed through a bill that is not going to provide better coverage. It \nis going to jam 16 million more people onto Medicaid--16 million more \nonto Medicaid. We know that almost half of the doctors in the country \ndo not take Medicaid patients.\n  Now we are seeing more and more physicians and hospitals saying: How \ndo we keep the doors open with what Medicare is paying? As fewer and \nfewer physicians are willing to take care of patients on Medicare, \nlimiting their practice on Medicare and on Medicaid, and Congress now \nstymied with what is known as the doc fix, huge cuts in additional \nreimbursement to doctors who take care of our seniors, it is going to \nbe increasingly difficult for the American people to be able to find a \ndoctor.\n  That is why I come to the floor with my second opinion about this \nhealth care law, telling you it is time to repeal this legislation and \nreplace it with legislation that delivers more patient-\n\n[[Page S5285]]\n\ncentered solutions, delivers more personal responsibility, more \nopportunities for individuals to take control of their own health and \ntheir own care, which is what I tried to do as the medical director of \nthe Wyoming Health Fairs: give people information they could use to \nkeep healthy and drive down the cost of their care.\n  Half of all the money we spend on health care in this country is on \njust 5 percent of the people. There are patient-based solutions: \nallowing people to buy insurance across State lines, giving individuals \nwho buy their own health insurance personally the same tax relief the \nlarge companies get when they pay for health insurance, deal with \nlawsuit abuse, allow small businesses to join together to lower the \ncost of insurance, and provide individual incentives for people who do \ntake personal responsibility for their own health.\n  Those are the things that will actually help get down the cost of \ncare. Those are the things that will help Americans stay healthy. But \nthey are not in this health care law that has been passed by the House, \npassed by the Senate, and signed by the President. That is why I come \nto the floor this week, as I have week after week since the law has \nbeen signed, to offer my second opinion; and that opinion is, it is \ntime to repeal and replace this health care law with a law that will \nwork for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/23/senate-section/article/S5285-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5285-S5286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to say at the outset how \nmuch I appreciate the very thoughtful advice that has been given by Dr. \nBarrasso during this debate. He comes to the floor, he is carefully \nprepared, he has done his homework, he has done the analysis, but most \nimportantly as a doctor, he understands what the health care system is \nabout. We would all benefit if we listened to his advice.\n  The problems with this health care legislation just continue and \ncontinue. Each week this 2,000-plus page health care bill just produces \nmore bad news, and it produces more unwelcome revelations. Not \nsurprising.\n  Not that long ago, the President, at every opportunity he had, would \nallay public concerns by saying to people and promising them: If you \nlike your health insurance, you get to keep it. Those proponents wrote \na provision into the new health care law in an attempt to fulfill this \npromise by grandfathering existing plans.\n  Recently, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a new \nregulation on these ``grandfathered'' health plans. Lo and behold, what \ndid the new regulations show? It showed that 51 percent of American \nworkers will be in plans without ``grandfathered'' status by 2013, in \njust 3 short years.\n  In fact, under the worst case analysis, as many as four of five small \nbusiness employees and 69 percent of all American workers will lose \ntheir current coverage. Almost 70 percent of those who were comforted \nby the President's promises are going to be sorely disappointed very \nquickly. You do not have to believe me. All you have to do is look at \nthe Obama administration's own estimates. Yet instead of solving this \nproblem and fulfilling the promise, the administration has a different \napproach: ramping up the public relations strategy.\n  According to the Washington Post, the White House has hired ``a \nsenior official whose sole portfolio will be to sell the health care \noverhaul to the public in the months leading up to the November \nelections.''\n  The administration is spending millions of taxpayer dollars to sell \nthe law to the American public. But let's look at reality versus what \nwe are hearing. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that \nless than 12 percent of small businesses--less than 12 percent of small \nbusinesses--will benefit from the much touted small business tax \ncredit. Yet the small business tax credit is one of the main talking \npoints used to convince Americans that this law is actually good for \nthem. In fact, the Internal Revenue Service recently sent out 4.4 \nmillion postcards to let small businesses know they might be eligible \nfor small business tax credits.\n  The IRS spent $1 million in taxpayer dollars on those postcards \nalone. It does not stop there, though. The Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services recently mailed a brochure to senior citizens to \n``inform them'' about the new law. Well, who paid the bill for that? \nTaxpayers are footing the $18 million bill for marketing of a piece of \nlegislation to themselves that they did not want in the first place. \nThis classy brochure outlines provisions such as closing the doughnut \nhole and preventative health care services. However, there are some \nimportant details that are not in the brochure. CMS neglects to mention \nsome very key information. For example, less than 10 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries will actually receive the $250 rebate for \nentering the doughnut hole coverage gap. Yet the new health care law \nwill cause all prescription drug Part D premiums to rise, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office.\n  When our seniors heard the word ``reform,'' they never would have \nimagined it meant they all pay more while getting less than 10 percent \nbenefit.\n  Let me repeat that. Prescription drug premiums go up for all \nparticipants, and only 1 in 10 will see the $250 check. Over $\\1/2\\ \nbillion in Medicare savings will be redirected toward creating a new \nentitlement program. The brochure also claims the new law preserves \nMedicare.\n  Yet according to the Obama administration's own Medicare Actuary, \nMedicare Advantage enrollment will be cut in half. More than one in \nseven hospitals could become unprofitable as a result of the law \n``possibly jeopardizing access to care for Medicare beneficiaries.''\n  Before I came over here, I had a meeting with those in the oncologist \narea who were saying: This is a problem. What are they going to have to \ndo to solve it? They will have to pull in satellite facilities, and \nrural health care suffers. Rural beneficiaries feel the pain of this \nlegislation.\n  The New York Times recently published an article entitled ``White \nHouse and Allies Set Up to Build Up Health Law.'' The article stated:\n\n       President Obama and his allies, concerned about the deep \n     skepticism over his landmark health care overhaul, are \n     orchestrating an elaborate campaign to sell the public on the \n     new law, including a new tax exempt group that will spend \n     millions on advertising to beat back attacks on the measure \n     and Democrats who voted for it.\n\n  The article also highlights that many outside groups are now running \ncampaigns to try to sell the bill to the public, in some cases with \nvery direct help from the administration.\n  With all this going on, with all of this in mind, it is appropriate \nto ask a few questions--for example, should not the administration be \nconcerned more about implementing the law, especially considering they \nhave missed several deadlines? Is this taxpayer-funded marketing effort \ncrossing boundaries between policy and good politics? Why do we have to \nspend taxpayer dollars to win over the public if the merits of this law \nare so solid?\n  People in Nebraska are not fooled by glossy brochures and media \nblitzes, especially when the facts are so clear. Facts are stubborn \nthings. The administration's own regulation predicts many employees \nwill not be able to keep their insurance plan. Their own Actuary \nconfirms that Americans will still see health care costs rise because \nthis new law does not bend the health care cost curve down. And the \nmarketing campaign is not going to convince seniors that when they are \nlosing services, they somehow benefit from this new law, especially \nsince it makes it more difficult for them to access home health care \nservices which have a bull's-eye for cuts, hospice services which have \na bull's-eye for cuts, and home nursing services which have a bull's-\neye for cuts.\n  We will continue to try to talk about what this health care bill \nreally means to Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado).

Mr. President, I come to the floor to plead with \nour Republican colleagues to pass the extension of unemployment \nbenefits. I still am amazed, as are so many Ohioans and so many \nColoradans and people from all over the country, that all of a sudden \nmy colleagues care so much about the budget deficit, when if we go back \n10 years, we had a budget surplus. Then three things happened. One was \nthe war in Iraq. The Presiding Officer opposed it, as did I. But more \nthan that, we went to war and didn't pay for it. We put the cost of the \nwar on our children and grandchildren. There was not an outcry from \nanybody on the other side of the aisle saying we should pay for that \nwar, that we should not go to war and charge it to the children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Around the same time, President Bush came to the Congress and asked \nfor major tax cuts for the richest Americans. Again, the Presiding \nOfficer and I opposed these tax cuts and said, at a minimum, if we are \ngoing to give tax cuts to the richest Americans, we need to find a way \nto pay for them. There was no interest on that side of the aisle when \nthey were in the majority in paying for the tax cuts.\n  Then soon after that, President Bush came to this body and the House, \nwhere the Presiding Officer and I served in those days, and asked for a \nhuge subsidy for the drug companies and the insurance companies in the \nname of Medicare privatization. We both opposed that, but not only did \nwe oppose it because we thought it wasn't done right--it was not the \nway to provide a drug benefit to seniors--but it was not paid for \neither. There was nary an outcry on that side of the aisle.\n  So when it was a $1 trillion war, tax cuts for the richest Americans, \nand subsidies for the drug and insurance companies, there was no \ninterest in paying for it; just charge that to the grandchildren. But \nnow that it is workers who lose jobs, people who lose their insurance, \npeople who then lose their homes, there seems to be an outcry: We can't \ndo this.\n  Forget the statistics; forget that there are 900,000 Americans losing \ntheir unemployment; forget the numbers. Listen to what people say. I am \ngoing to read four letters from around my State. I know the Presiding \nOfficer gets them from Boulder and Colorado Springs and Denver. I know \nmy colleagues get them from Tallahassee and Omaha and New York, letters \nfrom people who played by the rules, worked hard, lost their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own, who keep fighting to find jobs, keep \nsending out resumes. You have to do that if you are going to receive \nunemployment. And then their unemployment insurance ran out.\n  I wonder sometimes if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwho are voting no every time we try to bring this up, if they know \nanybody who lost a job, if they know anybody who lost insurance, if \nthey know anybody who lost a home. I plead with them, I ask them, the \npeople who have voted no, to try some empathy. Try to imagine you are a \nfather or a mother and you have lost a job, lost your insurance. You \nhave a sick child. You are borrowing money. You are trying every week \nto find a job, and you are three payments behind on your home. You have \nto sit down at dinner one night--a pretty inadequate dinner because you \nare stretching every cent you have--and you have to explain to your son \nand daughter, 10- and 12-year-olds, that they will have to move out of \ntheir room, out of the house.\n  Where are we going to go?\n  I don't know yet, but we don't have much space. What you have \ncollected in your room, we will have to give some of that away.\n  What school will I go to?\n  We don't know that yet either.\n  I wish they would think of the human cost of what this means when \npeople can't get unemployment insurance or can't get assistance in \ncontinuing health care insurance, so-called COBRA, with the subsidy the \ngovernment paid for the last year and a half--something that had never \nbeen done before--so people can keep their health insurance.\n  Zoe from Columbiana, a county just south of Youngstown, writes:\n\n       I lost my job at the end of August. Until then I was \n     gainfully employed. I worked hard to support my 13 year old \n     twins at home. I am 50 years old. If [unemployment insurance] \n     is not extended, things don't look good for my family. We \n     have lived in a rural area for 12 years and chose this \n     community because it is great for the kids. My house is not \n     fancy or expensive. We don't waste money. We are falling \n     behind payments on our electric bill. Pretty soon our service \n     might be cut. We are just trying to hang on. Please make \n     opponents of the extension realize that most people who are \n     unemployed are not lazy. We lost our jobs, which can happen \n     to anyone. Please help me.\n\n  My colleagues don't understand, people voting against this don't \nunderstand that unemployment insurance is not welfare; it is insurance. \nYou pay into it when you are working. You get help when you lose your \njob. That is the whole point. Most people hope they never draw \nunemployment insurance, of course. But that is what insurance is. Just \nlike car insurance, you hope you don't have to use it. If you have \nhealth insurance, you hope you don't have to use it except for regular \ncheckups.\n\n  Monica from Hamilton County--Cincinnati, Norwood, that area, \nsouthwest Ohio--writes:\n\n       My son was laid off last year. He soon enrolled in college \n     at Cincinnati State to obtain an engineering degree because \n     he was hoping to be more marketable in the future. He works \n     hard. He is doing well. He is excited about a new life. But \n     soon his [unemployment insurance] will expire. With other \n     expenses, he is now afraid he may have to quit school and not \n     be able to support his son. Please continue to work to pass \n     an unemployment extension right away. This support is so \n     vital to so many people right now.\n\n  Joseph from Stark County writes:\n\n       My July 4th will be nothing to celebrate since I will be \n     out of unemployment benefits. Folks are not finding the jobs \n     or the income to supplant the cash that goes to pay their \n     mortgages and other expenses. Helping a whole lot of people \n     to prevent another failure--like massive foreclosures--will \n     save more in the long run. Please consider a vote to help us.\n\n  He is right. The thing about unemployment benefits, it doesn't just \nhelp the family who gets the benefits; it helps them pay insurance and \nhelps them stay in their home. Think of the ripple effect when they \ndon't get it. It means if your home is foreclosed on, your next door \nneighbor's home declines in value. And then two streets away, somebody \nelse is foreclosed on. Somebody else is foreclosed on across the \nstreet. The whole neighborhood begins to unravel. These are people's \npersonal stories, people's lives. It absolutely matters.\n  The other thing unemployment benefits do--John McCain, the Republican \nPresidential candidate, one of his top economic advisers said \nunemployment is the best stimulus to the economy because every dollar \nput in the pocket of Joseph from Stark County or Monica from Cincinnati \nor Zoe from Columbiana County, every dollar we give them in \nunemployment compensation gets spent.\n  It is spent. It is spent in Canton and Cincinnati and Lisbon and East \nLiverpool. The dollars are spent going into the economy, and they have \na multiplier effect that Senator McCain's economic adviser used to talk \nabout, that that multiplier effect means generating economic benefits \nfor everyone in the community--the hardware store, the local school, \nbecause you pay your property taxes, all the things that come with \nthat.\n  The last letter I will read is from Gerald from Wood County, south of \nToledo, Bowling Green. Wood County is the site of the terrible tornado \nin Millbury that happened a couple weeks ago, where we are working with \nPresident Obama to get help for people whose homes were destroyed, and \nthere were many. Gerald writes:\n\n       I know Republicans are holding an extension to unemployment \n     benefits. Quite frankly it makes me sick.\n       I'm unemployed and am looking for a job--but the jobs are \n     not out there.\n       Most people must not realize what will happen when \n     unemployment insurance runs out.\n       We will suddenly have millions of people without the \n     support they need to live on. Just think of what that will do \n     to the nation's economy.\n\n  Again, this is not a welfare program. It is an insurance program. It \nis not\n\n[[Page S5287]]\n\nsomething people want to stay on. They have to show they are working to \nfind a job. They have to continue to apply for jobs during this whole \nperiod. Most people in this country want to work. Most people want to \nprotect their family and provide for their family and be good citizens.\n  This is a bridge. Unemployment benefits--it is a bridge that has gone \non longer than we had hoped because of the terrible economy President \nObama inherited in January 2009, where three-quarters of a million jobs \nwere lost that month. There has been some good economic news. Ohio, my \nState, in April had more jobs created than any other State in the \ncountry--37,000. Not enough, not where we need to go, not sustained \nyet, but some good economic news.\n  But the unemployment benefits provide that bridge so people can get \nalong until they find that job where they can begin again to rebuild \ntheir lives and join the middle class, as most of these people have \nbeen a part of for most of their lives.\n  So I ask my colleagues, this time please vote to extend unemployment \nbenefits, please support the help for COBRA, health insurance so people \ncan stay insured and can get their lives in order until the economy \nimproves enough where they are actually able to find a job.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about \nthe Federal Government's unnecessary and unacceptable delay in deciding \nto approve the use and sale of E15 gasoline at all the gasoline \nstations in this country.\n  Last Friday, we were told by the Environmental Protection Agency and \nthe Department of Energy that they will not make a decision on E15, a \ngasoline blend that includes 15 percent ethanol, until sometime this \nfall. Quite frankly, this is an abdication of responsibility, and it \ncouldn't come at a worse time.\n  To give a little history for those who don't understand this, we have \nfor about 30 years now had approval of a blend of 10 percent ethanol \nwith gasoline. In the old days, it was called gasohol; now it is called \nE10. When you pull into your gasoline station, you will see E10 pumps \nall over. There used to be big signs. Now it is hardly noticed because \nit is so widely used. I will get into that more later.\n  There has been testing done over about the last 15 years or more as \nto how much ethanol you can actually use in a gasoline blend without \nhurting any of the engines or vehicles we use in America. A lot of \ntesting has gone on, and the results of those tests have shown there is \nabsolutely no problem if you increase from 10 percent to 15 percent. As \na matter of fact, a lot of the tests that have been done privately show \nthat maybe as much as 20 to 25 percent could be added without any \ndamage whatsoever.\n  This issue of approval of E15 has been at the EPA and the Department \nof Energy for a long time. Increasing the blend rate--that is what we \ncall it, the blend rate--from 10 percent to 15 percent is critical to \nreducing our addiction to oil and accelerating the transition to \nbiofuels. We all understand how important this is. It will strengthen \nour national security, create jobs, boost our economy, and help the \nenvironment.\n  What makes the dithering at EPA and the Department of Energy all the \nmore baffling and outrageous is that it is happening in the midst of \nthe appalling catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico. The blowout at the BP \nDeepwater Horizon well has cast a spotlight on the terrible price we \npay for our dependency on petroleum. But instead of spurring EPA and \nthe Department of Energy into action, they have hit the snooze button \nand given themselves 5 or 6 more months to try to reach a decision. We \ncan't wait until the fall. In the face of the BP disaster, we need a \ndecision on E15 with the utmost urgency.\n  We have decried our dependence on oil for decades. Going back to the \nmid-seventies, we have talked--and we have talked and we have talked--\nabout the national security risks associated with our ever-increasing \noil dependency. We have decried the fact that we are dependent on oil \nfrom nations that are unstable or unfriendly, or both, to the United \nStates. We have been embroiled in conflict after conflict, war after \nwar, in the Middle East because of oil. As we have talked, our total \noil usage and our oil imports have risen steadily.\n  In recent years, there have been some glimmers of hope. In 2007, we \npassed the Energy Independence and Security Act which mandates an \nincrease in the efficiency of our automobiles and light trucks as well \nas increasing levels of biofuels in our transportation sector. These \ntwo steps--increasing vehicle efficiencies and encouraging the use of \ndomestic alternative fuels--are the two fastest and most effective ways \nto reduce our dependency on petroleum-based fuels in transportation.\n  In particular, I wish to highlight what we have accomplished with \nbiofuels. In just the past decade, we have increased the contribution \nof biofuels for highway transportation from about 2 percent in the year \n2000 to almost 10 percent today. I want to repeat that because I don't \nthink most Americans grasp the significance of what our biofuels \nindustry has accomplished in just one decade. Current ethanol \nproduction exceeds 9 percent and is quickly approaching 10 percent of \ntotal gasoline demand in the United States. To put that in perspective, \nethanol now contributes more to our transportation fuel demand than all \nof our oil imports from Mexico, Venezuela, or Nigeria. I will repeat \nthat. Ethanol contributes more to our transportation fuel than our oil \nimports from Mexico, or Venezuela, or Nigeria. Only imports from Canada \nand Saudi Arabia provide more fuel for transport than our domestic \nethanol industry. So this is tremendously heartening news.\n  Congress recognized the potential of biofuels in the 2007 Energy \nbill. We called for increasing levels of biofuels that roughly match \nwhat the industry has accomplished to date. In that bill, we called for \nthat contribution to rise steadily over the next 12 years, reaching 36 \nbillion gallons by 2022. That would put us on a trajectory to get about \n25 percent of our transportation fuels from domestic biofuels by 2025. \nWe need to stay on that trajectory because biofuels offer one of our \nvery best alternatives for reducing dependence on petroleum.\n  However, while our biofuels industry has stepped up to the plate, our \nfuel markets are lagging behind. Today, nearly all ethanol is used in \nthe form, as I said earlier, of E10, a blend of 10 percent ethanol with \ngasoline, used in almost all of our cars and light trucks. Since \nethanol production is very close to 10 percent of total gasoline \ndemand, we are at what is commonly called the blend wall. In other \nwords, our ethanol production is close to the total amount we can use \nat that 10 percent blend rate, so we have this blend wall of 10 \npercent.\n  So we have to do three things. First and second, we must transition \nto a fleet of cars and light trucks capable of using higher blends, and \nwe must make higher blends available through the installation of \nblender pumps. Senator Lugar and I introduced a bill to accomplish both \nof these actions last fall. Our Consumer Fuels and Vehicles Choice Act \nof 2009, which is S. 1627, would mandate the manufacture of an \nincreasing number of flex-fuel vehicles as well as installation of \nincreasing numbers of blender pumps.\n  Again, this is not some pie-in-the-sky thing. I would point out that \nin the nation of Brazil, every single car produced in Brazil--by Ford, \nI might add, or by General Motors, I can also add, or by the Japanese \nmanufacturers that are manufacturing cars in Brazil--every single car \nis 100 percent flex-fuel, and the cost of doing that is--well, if you \ndid it to every car, it would be almost minuscule. So we need every car \nproduced in America to be totally flex-fuel, just as they are in \nBrazil. That is what our bill would mandate.\n  Then, we need to increase the number of blender pumps out there. This \nis\n\n[[Page S5288]]\n\nthe old chicken-and-egg argument I have heard for so many years. You go \nto the oil companies--which we have done; Senator Lugar and I both have \ndone this--you talk to the oil companies.\n  Why don't you put in more blender pumps?\n  They say: Well, we can't put in more blender pumps because there are \nnot that many flex-fuel cars out there to use the higher blends.\n  You go to the automobile manufacturers and say: Why don't you \nmanufacture flex-fuel cars?\n  They say: Well, we don't have the blender pumps to supply higher \nblends.\n  Back and forth we go. So our bill would do both of those things.\n  I also noticed that this flex-fuel vehicle mandate is a part of an \nenergy bill Senator Lugar introduced just a few weeks ago here in the \nSenate.\n  The third action we need is approval of E15 right now--right now--for \nuse in all gasoline-fueled vehicles. The EPA has the responsibility for \nmaking this decision.\n  A trade association called Growth Energy applied to the EPA for \napproval of E15 in March of 2009, more than a year ago. Under the Clean \nAir Act as amended in the 2007 Energy bill, the EPA is required to take \nfinal action to grant or deny such a request within 270 days. But at \nthe end of 270 days, in November of 2009, EPA simply reported that they \nwere going to wait for the results of more Department of Energy testing \nof vehicles running on E15 before making the mandated decision. \nHowever, last November, they also indicated they expected to approve \nE15 for all vehicles of model year 2001 or newer by mid-2010 provided \nthat the test results continued to be supportive. But now we are being \ntold their decision will be further delayed--further delayed.\n  First of all, the bill is clear. They were mandated to make this \ndecision within 270 days. That was last November. They said we need a \nlittle bit more time. The tests were all supportive. The tests all \nlooked very good. And they told us they expected to approve E15 for all \nmodel year cars 2001 and later by June of 2010.\n  Now what has happened? They're kicking the ball down the field again. \nThey said maybe this fall.\n  Again, what we are told--I do not know this is factual--what we are \ntold is this is a consequence of testing delays and additional test \nrequirements at the Department of Energy.\n  I have to ask the question: If this is so, why is the Department of \nEnergy dragging its feet? What is Secretary Chu doing about this? I \nthink Secretary Chu needs to explain these delays. Is it because there \nis a bias at the Department of Energy against biofuels? There is some \nindication there just might be that kind of a bias. I would like to \nknow the answer to that question. I hope, if anybody is watching at the \nDepartment of Energy, they will tell their boss that Senator Harkin \nintends to ask the Secretary in a more formal setting why they are \ndragging their feet on this in the midst of an oil crisis, the likes of \nwhich we have never seen.\n  If I sound upset, I am. There is absolutely no reason for this foot \ndragging--none whatsoever. This slow walking may be business as usual \nfor a bureaucracy in ordinary times, but these are not ordinary times, \nand bureaucratic business as usual is not acceptable. We are in the \nmidst of what many consider the worst environmental disaster in \nAmerican history, perhaps even world history.\n  The root cause of this situation is our addiction to oil. We have not \njust an environmental and national security imperative in that \naddiction, now we have a profound moral imperative as well. We cannot \ntolerate any further delay in accelerating our transition to clean, \ndomestically produced, renewable biofuels produced not in the Middle \nEast or in the middle of the fragile Gulf of Mexico but in the middle \nof our country wherever corn or sorghum or sugarcane or sugar beets or \nswitchgrass or any other feedstocks for ethanol are grown and renewed \nevery single year.\n  I have come to the floor of the Senate today not just to urge but to \ndemand that the EPA and the Department of Energy give this decision the \nhighest and the most urgent priority. We cannot wait until this fall. \nIt is time for the EPA and the Department of Energy to get off that \nstump and move ahead aggressively. They had their 270 days last year. \nWe have already gone over that. The law is clear. It is unacceptable \nthat they are dragging their feet.\n  Both the EPA and the Department of Energy owe us, the Congress, a \nbetter accounting for the current delay and the excuses we have been \ngiven. Most important, it is time for them to end the delay and the \ndithering around. We need a decision, and we need it now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly about the issue \nof unemployment insurance benefits. We, the Congress, allowed these \nbenefits to expire 21 days ago. I believe there is a major \nmisperception on the part of some about what the effect of this is.\n  This proposal to extend these benefits is talked about as a so-called \nextension of unemployment insurance. That suggests that the provision \nsimply provides additional weeks of unemployment compensation payments \nto people who have used up all their benefits. Understandably, there \nare people in my State and around the country who say: Wait a minute. \nAt some point you don't want to keep adding more and more weeks of \nunemployment benefits.\n  What we need to understand is that is not what we are proposing to do \nhere. What we have been trying to do is not to add more weeks but \nmerely to allow the unemployed to continue drawing the same number of \nweeks of benefits that they were able to draw prior to the expiration \nof the program we are trying to extend.\n  The provision does not provide additional payments to anyone who has \nexhausted his or her Federal and State benefits before the \nauthorization of this program expired on June 2. It does not extend the \nnumber of weeks of benefits under the programs. Rather, it simply \nallows the programs to continue operating for people who use up the \nweeks of State-provided unemployment benefits that are available to \nthem.\n  In plain language, what this provision will do is give a person who \nlost his or her job last month the same unemployment compensation \nbenefits as someone who lost his or her job a full year ago.\n  What are we talking about as far as the amount of these benefits? \nThere is an editorial in the New York Times this morning indicating \nthat the average unemployment check is $309 a week. It is not that high \nin my State. Mr. President, $295 a week is the average. We are not \ntalking about a vast amount of money, particularly if a person is \ntrying to support a family and trying to pay some portion of their \nbills while they seek another job. People need to understand also that \nyou cannot draw unemployment benefits under the State programs or the \nFederal programs unless you continue to be actively seeking employment.\n  In plain language, what this provision would do is give a person who \nlost his or her job just recently the same opportunity that people who \nlost their jobs some time ago have had.\n  The bill we are debating would allow what we call the Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation Program to continue operating. A person who \nloses his job is eligible to receive up to 26 weeks of benefits through \nthe State unemployment compensation program. When those benefits are \nexhausted, some States add additional benefits through what they call \nthe extended benefit program, and many do not. Once all the State \nbenefits have been exhausted, the person may be eligible to receive \nadditional benefits through this Emergency Unemployment Compensation \nProgram, which is the subject of our discussion. That program is what \nwe are debating today as part of this extenders package.\n\n[[Page S5289]]\n\n  Clearly, the date on which a person becomes eligible for the \nEmergency Unemployment Compensation Program depends on when that person \nlost his or her job.\n  Moreover, the number of payments for which that person is eligible \nalso depends on when he lost that job because the benefits are paid in \na series of four tiers, with each tier lasting a certain number of \nweeks.\n  Because this program has been forced to stop operating, people who \nlost their job recently will not receive as much unemployment \ncompensation or as many weeks of unemployment compensation as people \nwho lost their jobs months ago.\n  Continuing the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program is simply \na matter of fairness to those people if they continue to seek \nemployment.\n  From the week of June 2--21 days ago when this program expired--until \nthe end of last week, there were right at 4,000 people in my State who \nhad run out of State benefits. Those individuals then would find they \ndid not have the benefit they could have had had they run out of State \nbenefits and lost their jobs a few weeks earlier.\n  Until the Congress acts, none of these people will be eligible for \nthe Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program. An additional 4,600 \npeople who are in one of the lower tiers of the Emergency Unemployment \nCompensation Program will exhaust their tier of benefits and be unable \nto receive the next tier of benefit. That is roughly 8,000 New Mexicans \nwho will be affected by the expiration of this Federal program.\n  In my view, the obstruction that has forced this program to stop is \nnot fair to those New Mexicans. It is not fair to many Americans. These \nare people who worked for companies that were able to hang on to their \nemployees longer than other companies once the recession hit. Cutting \nthe benefits of these individuals is not fair. These individuals are \nones who primarily live in States such as my home State of New Mexico \nwhere the recession hit hardest a few months later than it had hit in \nother parts of the country. It is not fair that the people in these \nStates should be eligible for fewer weeks of benefits when they have \npaid into the unemployment insurance system just like everybody else.\n\n  It is easy to find maps on the Internet to show States that are \ndisadvantaged by what the Senate has failed to do. There are animated \nmaps that show how high unemployment spread across the country. It \nstarted on the east coast and the west coast. It crept toward the \nmiddle of the country. States such as New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, \nKansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Colorado, I say to the \nPresiding Officer, were among the last to be affected by the recession. \nIt is the people of these States who are being disadvantaged because \nthe Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program has been allowed to \nlapse.\n  I want to be clear that I do not believe this program needs to be \ncontinued indefinitely, not least because of the substantial cost \ninvolved. When the job market improves, we need to find a way to phase \nout these costs. In my view, the fair thing to do would be to choose a \ndate and say people who lose their job after that date and begin \ndrawing unemployment benefits after that date will not be eligible to \nreceive the extra weeks of benefits that the Federal Government is \nadding to what the States are providing.\n  The economy is much better than it was last year when the country was \nlosing 750,000 jobs every month. The free-fall has stopped. The private \nsector is once again creating jobs at a very modest level. But the \nunemployment rate is still at 8.7 percent in my State of New Mexico and \nat 9.7 nationally. Now is not the time to eliminate the assistance this \nprogram has been providing to the many people who have been forced to \nlose their jobs during this recession.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the continuation of this Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation Program until we can find a fairer way to \nphase it out and terminate these extra Federal benefits.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see a colleague seeking \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, the senior Senator from New Hampshire be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, America is facing a lot of challenges. We \nhave the issue of unemployment compensation that my colleague just \nmentioned and how to pay for that so we do not put this country into \nfurther debt. We have the two wars we are fighting in Afghanistan and \nIraq and a myriad of other challenges that are facing this country. But \na clear and present danger exists right now in the Gulf of Mexico, a \nclear and present danger to my home State of Florida.\n  I have come to the floor almost every day over the past week while we \nhave been in session to talk about the need for the Federal Government \nto have a more robust response in preventing this oil from coming \nashore.\n  Unfortunately, the situation has gotten worse. In a report this \nmorning on television that I saw by Mark Potter, the oil now is coming \nashore in Pensacola in a way that is profoundly worse than it has been. \nAs he described it: It is oil as far as the eye can see. Watching those \npristine white beaches covered in brown splotches of oil this morning--\nit breaks my heart. It breaks my heart for what it is going to mean for \nthe people of northwest Florida, what it will mean for the environment; \nbut it breaks my heart even more because I think a lot of this could \nhave been prevented. Many Members of this body, as well as the one down \nthe hall, have been asking for weeks, where is the Federal response? \nWhere are the skimmers off our coast to suck up this oil before it gets \non our beaches, into our waterways and into our estuaries?\n\n  Frankly, I have been extremely frustrated with the response from this \ngovernment. I believe--and there are many who believe this as well--\nthat the Federal Government should not be involved in all aspects of \nour lives. But what the government does, the government should do well. \nAnd one thing the Federal Government should do, and should be uniquely \nqualified to do, is to help in a time of disaster. In this \ncircumstance, however, the government has fallen far short.\n  One thing that has been very frustrating to me is trying to determine \nhow many skimmers are in fact off the coast of Florida. Skimmers are \nthese vessels which are equipped to suck the oil off the water, bring \nit on to a place where it can be contained and disposed of and get that \noil out of the ocean. As of yesterday, we found out that there were 20 \nskimmers off the coast of Florida, plus an additional 5 skimmers that \nthe State of Florida went out on its own and rented.\n  When I met with the President a week ago yesterday in Pensacola, I \nraised the issue with him: Why are there not more resources stopping \nthis oil from coming ashore? Admiral Allen, who was at that meeting, \nand who is the head of the response--the former Commandant of the Coast \nGuard--told us there are 2,000 skimmers in the United States. So why \nare there only 20 off of Florida? I have asked the Coast Guard and even \nthe Navy, why are there not more skimmers? I have come to find out that \nwe cannot even determine how many skimmers there are.\n  The State of Florida, as of yesterday, in their Deepwater Horizon \nincident report, shows 20. We know an additional five were rented. The \nFederal Government's report, the National Incident Command Report, says \nthere are 108 skimmers. We asked the Federal Government--the Coast \nGuard--why this number is different than the number in the State \nIncident Command Report. We can't get a good answer. And when we \ndrilled down on this 108 last week, we were told: Well, that number \nisn't correct.\n  In followup, and having met with the Navy yesterday, and the Coast \nGuard--and I thank Secretary Mabus for making the Navy and the Coast \nGuard available to us to talk to them about this issue--we got a more \ndetailed response about skimmers that the Coast Guard reports are off \nthe coast of Florida, and now the number appears to be 86. So we have \nthe State telling us 25, we have the incident report from the Federal \nGovernment saying 108, and\n\n[[Page S5290]]\n\nnow the Coast Guard says it is 86. We can't get a straight answer.\n  This gets to the base of the problem, which is that we don't know \nwhat we are doing down there in the Gulf of Mexico. The Federal \nGovernment is not putting the focus and attention on this issue that it \nshould be. When I met with Admiral Allen, I asked him about the 2,000 \nskimmers he had reported were available in this country and why those \nskimmers weren't in the Gulf of Mexico now, some 65 days after this \ndisaster first started. I got answers ranging from, well, some are \nobligated to be other places in case there is an oilspill--to me, that \nis like saying your house is burning down and we can't send a firetruck \nbecause we may need a firetruck for another house that might burn \ndown--to this answer: They are legally constrained. This is what I \nheard from the Navy yesterday when I met with them. Some 35 skimmers \nthey would like to bring down are legally constrained.\n  I asked this question yesterday: Why aren't we approaching this issue \nwith a sense of urgency? Why doesn't the President sign an Executive \norder waiving any legal constraints? Why aren't we doing everything \npossible to marshal those resources into the Gulf of Mexico?\n  I have received a new piece of information from the U.S. Coast Guard. \nIt is the National Response Resource Inventory of skimmers and \ncapabilities throughout the whole country.\n  This document shows the different districts in this country. I will \nget this blown up and, hopefully, come to the floor tomorrow and show \nthis in greater detail. It has the country broken up by area into \ndistricts. Florida is in a district with Georgia and South Carolina. \nThat is district 7. These are Coast Guard districts, for the most part. \nIt shows how many skimmers there are. These are not skimmers offshore, \nof foreign countries, which we will talk about in a moment. These are \nskimmers here in this country.\n  In district 7, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, there are 251 \nskimmers--251. In the Texas district, district 8, there are 599. So \nbetween the gulf coast of Texas to Florida there are 850 skimmers, and \nwe have somewhere between 25 to 86 to 108, depending on whose number is \nright. Perhaps they are all incorrect, but given the best accounting \npossible, there are 108. Where are the other 742 skimmers, and why \naren't they being deployed? And that is just in the gulf coast.\n  In the district that includes California, there are 227 skimmers. In \nthe district that includes Washington State, there are 158. In the \ndistrict that includes Michigan and other Great Lakes States, there are \n72. In the district that includes Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, \nthere are 160. In the district that includes the mid-Atlantic, there \nare still another 157. Why are these skimmers not headed to the Gulf of \nMexico? Why are they not there already?\n  It is not a good answer that they are needed for another oilspill, \nbecause we have an oilspill--the worst oilspill that we have ever seen \nin this country, and one that is washing sheets of oil this morning \nonto the beaches of Pensacola in my home State of Florida.\n  That is the national picture. Internationally, the State Department \ncame out with a report which I talked about yesterday--it came out last \nFriday--that talks about all the offers of assistance from foreign \ncountries, offers that were made by Belgium on June 15, the European \nMaritime Safety Agency on May 13, by the Republic of Korea on May 2, by \nthe United Arab Emirates on May 10 to give us skimmers, and all of them \nare still under consideration. Months have gone by and the U.S. \nGovernment hasn't returned a phone call to these offers of help.\n  It is amazing to me that we would not be accepting these offers of \nassistance to bring in these skimmers from foreign countries. When \nthere is a disaster around the world, whether it is a tsunami in the \nFar East or an earthquake in Haiti, the United States of America is the \nfirst to answer the call. We, because of the goodness of our people, go \nin and help these countries, as we should. Now they are offering to do \nfor us what we have done for the world and give us assistance, yet we \nare saying no. That is also beyond belief. The State Department, as of \nlast Friday, reported 56 offers of assistance from 28 countries or \ninternational groups. We have accepted 5--5 out of 56--BP has accepted \n3, and 46 remain under consideration.\n  I want to talk about one of these offers specifically. This ship is a \nDutch ship from a company called Dockwise. This ship is the Swan. This \nis a huge vessel that, when equipped with skimming equipment, can suck \nup 20,000 tons of water and oil--20,000 tons. It was offered to the \nUnited States on May 6--May 6--and we never answered the call. Instead, \na ship that has one-twentieth of its capability was accepted by the \nCoast Guard.\n\n  I received some followup information yesterday, and here is the \nresponse as to why the Coast Guard did not accept this superskimmer for \nuse in the Gulf of Mexico. The response was that it was going to be \nequipped with arms--sweeping arms, which are what skims the oil into \nthe boat--and BP was able to purchase two sets of these arms from \nanother company and, therefore, the ship wasn't needed. The arms sweep \nthe oil into a ship; the ship holds the oil. The arms are only half of \nthe equation. And if this ship holds 20,000 tons of oil and water \nmixture, it is certainly needed.\n  Saying that we didn't need it because we got the arms and we put them \non another ship makes no sense. The ship that was used instead has one-\ntwentieth of the capability. That is an American ship, and I am glad we \nare using it, but we should be using both of them. We should be using \nevery ship possible. And why should we be using every ship possible? \nBecause oil is washing up on the shore of my State and the Federal \nGovernment seems anemic, at best, in its response.\n  What is this doing to our oceans, our waterways? The Mote Marine \nLaboratory in Sarasota--which I had the privilege to visit a couple of \nweekends ago--does wonderful work with marine life and has these \nunique, almost torpedo-like automated vehicles that go out in the water \nto check to see whether the oil has spread. It is one of the vehicles \nthat helped us determine that this plume of oil, in fact, does exist \nbeyond what you see on the surface. They are reporting yesterday, in an \narticle that was published, that rare plankton-eating sharks are moving \ntoward the coast of Florida. Ten healthy whale sharks were found Friday \nabout 23 miles southwest of Sarasota. They are moving away from the \noil--this oil that is growing not just on the surface but underneath.\n  What will be the long-range implications of this disaster, not just \non our economy but on our environment? It is hard to tell. This \nmorning, Florida State's marine biologists are reporting that the fish \npopulation has been severely damaged in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I will continue to come to the floor every day we are \nhere to sound the siren, to ring the bell and call for more response \nand a better effort to protect my State of Florida, as well as the \nother States in the gulf. This response is anemic, and our failure to \nact is outrageous. This government must do a better job.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor to my friend and \ncolleague from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/23/senate-section/article/S5290-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5290-S5292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE NATIONAL DEBT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, all of us express our deepest \nconcern for what the Senator from Florida, the people of Florida, and \nthose along the gulf coast are going through. It is an unconscionable \nsituation going on down there. I think the Senator has correctly \nindicted the failure of the people responsible to bring the resources \nthat are available on site in order to try to address at least the \nskimming of as much of the oil as possible. I appreciate his doing this \non a daily basis until we can get something done. This is critical, \nobviously.\n  I want to speak today, however, about an issue that is equally \nthreatening to our Nation--although not as ominous, in many ways--and \nthat is our debt and the continued spending by this Congress in a way \nthat ignores the fact that we are on the path to passing on to our \nchildren a nation which they will not be able to afford as a result of \nthe massive debt which is being put on their backs.\n  We heard today from a number of Senators from the other side of the\n\n[[Page S5291]]\n\naisle how we have to pass this extender bill. There is some irony in \nthis, in that they are claiming that it is necessary in order to \naddress what are significant stresses on Americans who find themselves \nconfronted with this economic slowdown. What they do not address, of \ncourse, is the fact that in passing this bill in the way they have \nstructured it, they are going to put even greater stress on the next \ngeneration of Americans by creating even more debt for them to pay off.\n  There are some legitimate ideas and programs in this extenders bill, \nbut they should be paid for. They should all be paid for. They \nshouldn't simply be put on the credit card and passed on to the next \ngeneration. These are issues which address costs of today--unemployment \ninsurance, the tax extenders. They are issues which affect today's \nspending and they should be paid for with today's dollars. We shouldn't \nborrow from the next generation in order to pay for this problem--the \nproblems and the issues which this bill tries to address.\n  Yet that is the proposal that comes to us. Three times now they have \nbrought these extender programs forward. Once they were going to add \n$79 billion--$79 billion--to the deficit, and it failed on a point of \norder brought by myself on the issue of budget fiscal \nresponsibility. Then they brought forward a proposal to spend $50 \nbillion that was not paid for, and again it failed. Now we are going to \nget a third proposal today, and I suspect it will also be a deficit \nproposal where we add to the debt and pass the bill on to our kids for \nsomething we want to do today that is politically attractive.\n\n  But this is just a small tip of the iceberg for what has been \nhappening around here. Since we passed pay-go legislation and we heard \nall these grandiose statements by the President and by the Democratic \nleadership of the Senate and the House that they were going to use pay-\ngo to discipline spending around here so we would not be passing these \nbills on to our kids, since we passed that bill--now almost 2 months \nago--we have spent or put in the pipeline to spend $200 billion--$200 \nbillion of new spending that violates the pay-go rules, that adds to \nthe debt of this country.\n  But that, again, is only a small tip of the iceberg. When we look at \nwhat is happening to the Federal debt, this is the line. This is where \nFederal debt is going as a percentage of gross national product. \nHistorically, our Federal debts have been about 35 percent of gross \nnational product. But since the Obama administration came into office \nand this Democratic Congress took control of fiscal policy in this \ncountry, that debt has gone right through the ceiling, and there is no \nstop to it. It is going up and up, to the point now where total debt as \na percentage of GDP has passed the tipping point.\n  What is the tipping point? That is what Greece found. That is what \nIceland found. That is what, regrettably, maybe Spain may be finding. \nIt is when you get so much debt on the books that people stop believing \nyou can really pay it back in an effective and efficient way. People in \nthe world who are supposed to lend us this money--regrettably, it is \nother countries now: Saudi Arabia, China, Russia--they start asking \nthemselves: Can they really pay that debt back? Shouldn't I charge a \nlot more to lend them money because I am not too sure they can pay the \ndebt back? That tipping point is 60 percent of GDP. When your debt to \nthe gross national product exceeds 60 percent of GDP, it is generally \naccepted in the world community that you passed the tipping point. When \nit gets up to around 90 percent of GDP, you are in junk bond status. \nYou are on your way to bankruptcy. You are on your way to becoming \nGreece. We have an advantage over Greece. We can do something called \nmonetizing our debt. But we still have the same problem.\n  We passed 60 percent this year. Why are we doing that? Because we are \nspending a lot of money we don't have on the extender program and on \nthe other $200 billion of spending that has come to this floor on pay-\ngo, on the stimulus package, on the health care bill. The health care \nbill expanded the size of this government by $2.5 trillion. All of that \nis an expense which grows the government at a rate we cannot afford.\n  Under the President's own budget as he sent it up here--and where is \nthe budget, by the way? Did I miss something? Isn't the Congress of the \nUnited States supposed to do a budget? Isn't that what we are supposed \nto do as a responsible steward of our financial house and of the \nAmerican taxpayers' dollars? Where is the budget? Under the desk here? \nMaybe it is down where that paper was that just fell. Nobody can find \nit. Why is that? Because the other side of the aisle does not want to \nshow the American people what the deficits are, how much spending they \nare planning to do that they do not plan to pay for--not only in this \nyear but for the next 10 years.\n  The President at least had the integrity--I guess under law he had to \ndo it--to send up a budget. His own budget projects a $1.4 trillion \ndeficit this year. That is 4 times larger--3.5 times larger than the \nbiggest budget under the Bush administration--biggest budget deficit. \nIt is the largest budget deficit in our history, $1.4 trillion. But \nthat is not the end of it. For the next 10 years, the President's \nbudget projects a $1 trillion deficit on average every year for the \nnext 10 years. The practical effect of the President's own budget is \nthat the debt of this country doubles in 5 years and triples in 10 \nyears. These are staggering numbers. These are numbers that lead to \nbankruptcy of our Nation from the standpoint of fiscal policy. You \ndon't have to look too far to see what these types of numbers mean. \nJust look at what is happening in Greece and other countries that have \ngrossly overextended their debt. Doubling the debt in 5 years, tripling \nit in 10 years is an unacceptable action.\n  The numbers are so big, it is hard to put them in context. But to try \nto put them in some sort of context, if you take all the debt rung up \nby Presidents since the beginning of this country starting with George \nWashington through George W. Bush, that is $5.8 trillion. That is all \nthe debt of all the Presidents who came before President Obama and this \nDemocratic Congress. Under the budget sent up by the President, the \ndebt that will be added will be three times that, almost three times \nthat. The amount run up over all these 232 years we have been a \nnation--in 10 years, we will be adding more debt than occurred in the \nfirst 232 years by a factor of almost 2\\1/2\\--over 2\\1/2\\.\n  It is incredible. Yet nobody around here says anything or does \nanything about it on the other side of the aisle. What we hear from the \nother side of the aisle: Let's bring out another bill. Let's game the \nentitlements. Let's game the pay-go rules one more time, as the \nextender bill does--or tries to do--and let's spend some more money we \ndon't have and add it to the deficit and the debt. Bill after bill is \nbrought to this floor to do that--spend money we don't have and add it \nto the debt.\n  What does it mean in real terms? Children born at the beginning of \nPresident Obama's administration and this Democratic Congress, this \nliberal Congress--it should not even be called a democratic Congress \nbecause it is so liberal--had an $85,000 debt on their backs--think of \nthat--when they were born. However, as of today they have a $114,000 \ndebt on their backs. That means kids born just 4 years ago--not even 4 \nyears ago; 1\\1/2\\ years ago--have had added to their burden--and they \nare going to have to bear this burden. This is not theoretical. This \ndebt is owed. It is owed to China. It is owed to Russia. It is owed to \nSaudi Arabia. This debt has to be paid back by these people, our \nchildren. Just in the last 1\\1/2\\ years, it has gone up by almost \n$30,000. By the end of this Presidency, should the President be \nreelected--or even a little bit past that--by the end of the budget \nprojected by this President, that debt on these children will be \n$196,000. That is what they will have to pay. How are they supposed to \nbuy a home, buy a car, send their kids to college if they have to pay \noff this debt, which they will have to do through the tax burden? It is \ninexcusable what we are doing.\n  Then you have to couple it with the larger picture. Is anything being \ndone to improve this situation? Here are the President's own numbers. \nHistorically, taxes have been about 18 percent of GDP. You will hear a \nlot of people on the other side of the aisle say we just need to raise \ntaxes more. Under the President's own budget, they are projecting that \ntaxes are going to go up rather dramatically, to almost 20 percent of \nGDP. What they don't tell you\n\n[[Page S5292]]\n\nis that spending has historically been about 20 percent of GDP. If we \nhad the tax revenues they are projecting, we wouldn't have hardly a \ndeficit at all. We would be in pretty good shape.\n  But that is not what is happening here. As a result of the \nPresident's programs--note here how this line goes up sharply during \nthe depression. It is estimated to come back down because of the \nstimulus being taken out of the spending stream--a very badly flawed \ndecision, by the way, to pass the stimulus in the form it was passed--\nbut then it goes straight back up. If we were to extend this line, it \nis way up here. What is that caused by? That is caused by the health \ncare bill, $2.5 trillion of new spending, and by the aging of the \npopulation. There is no attempt to take this line and bring it down \nwhere it should be going, so we close that figure.\n  No, this area in here is a structural deficit that has been grossly--\nnot structural. It is a created deficit that has been grossly \naggravated by the policies of this administration and is being \naggravated by the policies of this Congress, as we have seen more and \nmore bills brought forward which are unpaid for and end up adding to \nthis red line going up. It is not a tax issue. It is not a revenue \nissue. The President's own budget--these are the President's own budget \nnumbers--shows that it is not a revenue issue. Revenues, they project, \nwill be very robust and will be well above the historic highs fairly \nsoon.\n\n  Why would they do this? Why would people be doing this to our Nation, \nrunning us into bankruptcy like this, putting this burden on the next \ngeneration that is so extraordinary? I think there is a philosophy \nhere. The philosophy is pretty simple: This administration is very \ncommitted to moving the American model. They want to take us down the \nroad of a European-style social welfare state democracy where you \nactually have cradle-to-grave coverage of all sorts of social concerns \nand you have an ever-expanding, dramatically expanding public sector. \nThe President is very honest about this. He said that the way you \ncreate prosperity is to grow the government. I don't think anybody ever \nbelieved he would grow it quite this much, but he was honest about it, \nat least. But the implications of it are that because of the fact that \nwe do not have the capacity to pay for this government, we are driving \nourselves right into a ditch as a nation. We are putting ourselves into \na totally unstable situation which will inevitably lead to some sort of \nfiscal crisis which will be cataclysmic for our country and will lead \nto a lower standard of living. That is what this inevitably leads to--a \nlower standard of living, not a higher standard of living for the next \ngeneration.\n  The European model is not a good model for us to pursue. It simply is \nnot. Look at what is happening in Europe--anemic growth, lack of \ncreativity in the area of economic growth, very little productivity, \nand basically countries wallowing in a debt structure they cannot get \nout from under because they are not willing to make the tough \ndecisions. Are we going to take that path also? It appears that way. \nUnder this administration, in this Congress, that appears to be the \nchoice. But it is the wrong choice.\n  There are ways to address this. To begin with, we could stop \nspending--very simple. Stop spending money we don't have. Stop bringing \nbills to the floor that have high deficits attached to them.\n  We need to address the entitlement programs and recognize that they \nare, in their present structure, not affordable.\n  We need to address our tax laws, which are not structured in order to \ncreate an incentive for productivity and capital formation but are \ninstead replete with special benefits to special interest groups. We \ncan reduce the rates on all Americans, and especially we can reduce the \nrates on the productive side of the ledger, on our corporate rates \nwhich are now the second highest in the world, and still generate \nsignificantly more revenues if we do a total tax reform along the lines \nof what Senator Wyden and I have actually proposed.\n  We need to change our energy policy. We have to stop shipping all \nthis money overseas and buying energy. We need American production of \nenergy. We need more nuclear; we need more natural gas; we obviously \nneed more conservation; we need better cars--hybrids, electric; and \nsure, we need renewables, but renewables are not going to solve the \nproblem. It is in production of American energy that we need to solve \nthe problem, primarily, and in conservation.\n  Most important, we need to abandon this idea that we should follow \nthe European model because it stifles productivity, entrepreneurship, \nrisk taking. We need a model that says to the American people: Be \ncreative. That has been at the essence of what has made us strong as a \nnation.\n  It has always been one of our unique advantages over the rest of the \nworld--willing to take a risk, willing to make an investment, willing \nto go out and push the envelope. As a result, they have created jobs in \nthe most prosperous Nation in the history of the world. But that is all \nat risk now because we decided to depart on this path of massive \ndeficit and debt in order to recreate the European form of government: \na social welfare state, which is, first, not sustainable, and, \nsecondly, is not a model for prosperity.\n  It is time to change, and let's begin the change right here right now \nby rejecting any extender bill that comes to this floor that is not \nfully paid for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to remind my colleagues that \nthe Recovery Act has worked and is still working. It has been almost a \nyear and a half since I took office and since President Obama was sworn \nin. Remember, we came into office in the midst of the worst economic \ncrisis since the Great Depression. Our financial system was collapsing. \nWe had already lost millions of jobs and were losing millions more at a \ntruly frightening pace.\n  We had roughly a $2 trillion hole in our economy, and instead of a \nsurplus of $710 billion that was projected in 2001 for 2009, we wound \nup with a $1.6 trillion deficit.\n  Remember back in 2001 when the Bush administration came in? One of \nthe problems was our surpluses were growing too fast. We had projected \na $5 trillion surplus through 2009.\n  What did we end up with? We ended up with $5 trillion in deficits \nduring that period, a $10 trillion turnaround. In 2009 where we had \nprojected a surplus of $710 billion, we ended up with a $1.6 trillion \ndeficit.\n  Fortunately, the Recovery Act brought us back from the precipice of \ndisaster. It saved us from another full-blown depression and allowed us \nto rebuild our economy and add jobs.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office just recently completed \nan analysis that demonstrated what a big impact the Recovery Act has \nhad. The CBO, nonpartisan CBO, indicated that in the first quarter of \nthis year, the Recovery Act accounted for anywhere between 1.8 million \nand 4.1 million more jobs, 2 to 4 million jobs. I would call that a \nsuccess.\n  The CBO also told us unemployment was .7 percent to 1\\1/2\\ percent \nlower because of the Recovery Act. Our gross domestic product was 1.7 \npercent to 4.2 percent higher. The CBO is not the only one telling us \nthis story. The Conference Board reported the latest version of its \nLeading Economic Index. The chart I have shows this index since last \nJanuary, since the President and I took office. This is when we passed \nthe Recovery Act.\n  As my colleagues can see, it bottomed out in March 2009, shortly \nafter passage of the Recovery Act, and has been steadily climbing ever \nsince. Other major economic indicators tell a similar story. Take the \nDow Jones Industrial Average. Now, take the Dow Jones Industrial \nAverage as a guide to the health of our financial markets.\n  This chart shows that shortly after passing the Recovery Act, the \nmarkets\n\n[[Page S5293]]\n\nhit bottom with the Dow at 6,547 on March 9, 2009. I wonder what \nhappened in March that caused the Dow Jones to go up like this? The Dow \nsince then has risen dramatically, rising above 11,000 a couple of \nmonths ago, and even remaining above 10,000 amidst recent market \nturmoil.\n  Take a look at this chart. Let's throw the last chart up here again. \nIn March 2009, we passed the Recovery Act, and guess what happened. The \nDow Jones average takes off. March 2009, guess what. We passed the \nRecovery Act and the major economic indicators take off. Let's look at \nanother one.\n  How about the Purchasing Managers Index, a leading indicator of \nbusiness confidence. Any score over 50 means the businesses around the \ncountry believe conditions are better than they were the previous \nmonth, and we are headed in the right direction.\n  Take a look at this chart. Oh, my goodness. Guess what. Early 2009, \nwe are crashing. Now we are up. I wonder what happened during March \n2009 to cause this Purchasing Managers Index to go up. Why all of a \nsudden did businesses around the country believe conditions were \ngetting better? I wonder what that was all about?\n  Let's look at another chart. Let's look at gross domestic product, \none of the very best indicators of our health. From 2007 to the first \nquarter of 2010 it tells the same story: Things started getting better \nafter the Recovery Act was passed.\n  Here is the first quarter of 2009. Oh, my goodness, look at this. \nGoing straight down. We get to the first quarter of 2009, straight up.\n  Either this is one of the truly great coincidences of our time, or \nthe Recovery Act turned this economy around. The key point, as we have \nsaid all along, is not the economy, but it is jobs. So let's take a \nlook at jobs.\n  The most recent unemployment report indicated that we added 431,000 \njobs last month. Unemployment is still too high, much too high. Without \nour efforts to help the economy, most notably the Recovery Act, it \nwould be even higher still.\n  Take a look at this chart. Here we are, folks. March 2009. What \nhappened in March? I wonder what happened in March 2009. I wonder why \njobs went from losing 753,000, which is what we lost in March of last \nyear, to gaining 431,000 in May. I wonder. What could have happened to \nthese charts?\n  We know the unfortunate thing about this is the economy is coming \nback, and the economy is coming back because of the Recovery Act. But \nwe know from past experience that job growth lags behind economic \nrecovery, and this chart shows how long that took from previous postwar \nrecessions.\n  The problem is not that the Recovery Act did not work. It worked and \nthe economy came back. The problem is, if you look back--and we knew \nthis at the time--if you go back to 1949 where the jobs lagged by 5 \nmonths, or you go back to more recent history, November 2001, where \njobs lagged 22 months, the problem is not that the Recovery Act did not \nwork, the problem is the time it takes from when the economy comes back \nuntil jobs come back. That is not hard to explain.\n  Businesses need to use up their existing capacity and they need to \nfeel confident in the economic climate before they start expanding \nagain. That just makes sense. The process can be especially painful \nduring a financial collapse where businesses and households are forced \nto pare down their savings and reduce their spending, thus tamping down \neconomic and employment growth.\n  Due to this lag, which was totally predictable, the jobs have been \nslower to return than anyone likes. But make no mistake, thanks to the \nRecovery Act, we have gotten our economy back on track and growing \nagain. We must not, however, take these results for granted. For those \nwho said at the time we could get by with less, my Republican friends--\nand they are my friends, and I hold them in high regard--but to those \nwho said the economy will come back without the Recovery Act, just look \nat the example of Japan in 1990.\n  Remember on this floor, and the vote against this was almost \ncomplete, against the Recovery Act. I think we ended up getting three \nRepublican votes. They were saying: We do not need to do anything. The \neconomy will come back.\n  Let me show you something. Japan tried that. Approximately 20 years \nago, Japan also experienced a serious economic downturn that was \nprecipitated by the bursting of speculative bubbles in real estate and \nfinancial assets. Sound familiar?\n  However, Japan was slow not only to address the crisis in the banking \nsector, but also to use fiscal stimulus to help jumpstart the economy. \nThis chart shows the results. They call it the ``lost decade'' in \nJapan. Literally no growth in gross domestic product. That is what \nhappens if you do nothing, if we had done nothing. We must not allow \nthat to happen here.\n  There are those who continue to present a false choice between \nbalancing the budget and fiscal stimulus necessary to get our economy \nback on track. This is a false choice. But we should know by now there \nare times in which fiscal stimulus and deficits are necessary--\nnecessary. Good deficits to spur growth and get our economy on track. \nThere are other times when deficits are unnecessary and short-sighted. \nDeficits are sometimes necessary, looking back through history, to \nallow fiscal stimulus to jumpstart an economy that is contracting due \nto a precipitous decline in private sector investment and consumer \nspending.\n  There is a hole in the economy because private sector investment and \nconsumer spending stopped. The economy is frozen. That is the time you \nhave to get the economy going. If you have a $2 trillion hole in the \neconomy, you can't let it sit there, as Japan did, and fester. You have \nto do something. That is what the Recovery Act did. It put money into \nthe economy.\n  However, my friends on the other side of the aisle are absolutely \nright when they say deficits are inappropriate during good economic \ntimes, which is what we had for the 8 years previous to this. At those \ntimes, they are typically the result of irresponsible decisions to cut \ntaxes and put in place unfunded spending programs--tax cuts that were \nnot paid for; the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, not paid for; Medicare \nprescription drugs, not paid for. So during a period when the \nCongressional Budget Office said: In 2001, we are going to run a $5 \nbillion surplus, we ran a $5.6 trillion deficit because we went out and \nspent and spent and spent with no provision for paying for it.\n  I cannot believe it when I am presiding here and colleagues come to \nthe floor and talk about the unemployment extension like, man, this is \na bad situation. These folks are going to spend money and not pay for \nit, because we have these incredible deficits.\n  These deficits didn't just show up in the last year. The deficit in \nthe last year was to get the economy moving again. It was a good idea. \nWhere did the $10 trillion turnaround come from between 2001 and 2008, \nwhen time after time, on big programs such as tax cuts and going to \nwar, the decision was made not to pay for it? That is where we got the \ndeficits. That is where the deficits came from. Those are the bad \ndeficits. We were irresponsible. We had good times. That is when we \nshould have built up the deficits. That is when the bipartisan CBO said \nwe would have surpluses, remember? In fact, the rationale for the first \ntax cut was: It is better in their pockets than in our pocket. We \nshould not have been giving out these tax cuts. But let's just give \nthem to the American people because of the surplus. And we ran up a $5 \ntrillion deficit.\n  While we have serious structural and budgetary problems--and we do--\nthat need to be resolved for the long term, getting our economy growing \nagain has to be our first priority, and had to be. President Obama has \nestablished a bipartisan commission to address those long-term \nproblems. In the short-term, we need to grow ourselves out of \ndeficits--a phrase my colleagues across the aisle have invoked many \ntimes in the past. They are absolutely right. We have to grow out of \nthis.\n  One of the ways we grow out of this is to get the economy moving. One \nof the ways to get the economy moving is by the Recovery Act. I \nremember February 2009 all too well. No one in the Senate should ever \nforget what it was actually like in February 2009. We were looking into \nthe abyss before we passed the Recovery Act. The American economy was \nin free fall, and another Great\n\n[[Page S5294]]\n\nDepression was imminent. Those were truly scary days. The Recovery Act \nhelped divert another Great Depression. It has our economy growing \nagain. It has improved our fiscal situation. Imagine the size of our \nbudget deficits if we had another Great Depression, which was an all-\ntoo-real possibility just over a year ago. Do you think these deficits \nare bad? Suppose we had the Great Depression.\n  We are now on the path to recovery, but it is a narrow ridge, not a \nbroad field. If we do not keep our eyes forward, we will too easily \nlose our way. We have a fragile economic recovery that has been made \neven more so by the massive oilspill in the gulf and by serious fiscal \nand financial strains in Europe. We could have a double-dip. We could \nturn this around. This is a very fragile time for the economy. Given \nthese perilous circumstances, we need to be vigilant to avoid another \ndouble-dip recession.\n  To conclude, the Recovery Act has done its job and will continue to \ndo so. Now, as we get through this crisis, as this recession passes, we \nneed to create new jobs. That is the key. It isn't enough to try to win \nback the jobs we lost. We have to do that. To keep pace with our \npopulation and keep a sacred promise to our children and grandchildren, \nwe need to create a whole new generation of jobs.\n  As former President Clinton said in recent years: In the last 10 \nyears, we were creating jobs in three areas--housing, finance, and \nconsumer economy. Unfortunately, all three of these have suffered in \nthis economy. All three of these have benefited from loose credit and \neasy money to build up a bubble. I am sorry to say that many of these \njobs are not coming back, especially in the short term. We cannot look \nforward to the day or depend on the day where carpenters were scarce \nbecause we built more housing than people could afford to buy. We do \nnot need a revitalized legion of clever bankers any more than we need \nanother Starbucks one block closer.\n  Going forward, we need to transform our economy by revolutionizing \nhow we produce and consume energy. To do this, we will need more \nscientists and engineers. It is in this area where future job and \neconomic growth will happen. The Recovery Act, thank goodness, began \nthis process, not only by turning our economy around but also by \npromoting green jobs and investment in clean energy initiatives. Our \nchallenge in the future will be to build upon its foundation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PISTOLE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of John S. Pistole to be Administrator of the Transportation \nSecurity Administration and talk about collective bargaining for TSA \nemployees.\n  The TSA has been without a Senate-confirmed leader for a year and a \nhalf. During the last 5 months, we have experienced two major \ntransportation security incidents: the unsuccessful December 25 bombing \nof Northwest flight 253 and the near escape of the failed Times Square \nbomber. I welcome the President's nomination of a career FBI official \nwith extensive counterterrorism experience, FBI Deputy Director John S. \nPistole, to head the TSA. I look forward to the Senate's swift \nconfirmation of Mr. Pistole for this critical position.\n  During the confirmation hearings for Mr. Pistole, the issue of \ncollective bargaining for TSA employees was raised. Mr. Pistole stated \nthat he is going to study the issue, gather all the information he can \nfrom stakeholders, and make a recommendation to Secretary Napolitano.\n  Some Members of Congress, however, are strongly opposed to collective \nbargaining for TSA employees. Their opposition is grounded in the \nconcern that we need to adapt quickly and effectively to specific \naviation threats. The underlying premise of this argument is that we \nmust choose between protecting the Nation from threats to aviation and \ncollective bargaining. This choice, however, is a false choice because \nnational security and what I call smart collective bargaining are not \nmutually exclusive. Under smart collective bargaining agreements, if \ncircumstances and true emergencies were to exist, TSA would be fully \ncapable to deploy assets without there being any negative impact from \nthe collective bargaining agreement.\n\n  At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Pistole stated that ``we have to be \nable to surge resources at any time . . . not only nationwide but \nworldwide.'' I certainly agree. A smart collective bargaining agreement \nwould enable us to do exactly that.\n  Moreover, a smart collective bargaining agreement would enhance \nnational security because it would enable TSA to recruit and retain \nveteran employees. Our Nation's history with labor unions teaches us \nthat collective bargaining boosts morale and allows employees to have a \nvoice in their workplace and increases stability and professionalism. \nOn the other hand, poor workforce management can lead directly to high \nattrition, job dissatisfaction, and increased costs, which lead to gaps \nin aviation security. There have been reports that TSA has low worker \nmorale, which can undermine the Agency's mission and our national \nsecurity.\n  The fact is, DHS, Customs and Border Patrol officers, some of whom \nwork at the same airports as TSA employees, as well as employees of \nDHS's Federal Protection Services, and the Capitol Police all operate \nunder collective bargaining agreements. Are members of the flying \npublic less safe because the CPB officers, who work side-by-side with \nTSA employees, work under a collective bargaining agreement? I don't \nbelieve so, nor do I think my colleagues believe that. Are Members of \nCongress less safe because the Capitol Police work under a collective \nbargaining agreement? I have heard all my colleagues compliment the \nefficiency of our Capitol Police.\n  As the late Senator Kennedy noted in August 2009 when he cosponsored \na collective bargaining rights bill for public safety officers, \ntomorrow morning, thousands of State and local public safety officers, \npolice officers, and firefighters will wake up and go to work to \nprotect us. We should be there to help them. They will put their lives \non the line responding to emergencies, policing neighborhoods, and \nprotecting us in Maryland and communities all across the Nation. These \ndedicated public servants will patrol our streets and run into burning \nbuildings to keep us safe. No one believes for a moment that we are \nless safe because they have secured collective bargaining rights.\n  If opponents of collective bargaining for TSA employees want to \ninvoke 9/11 to support their views, they will soon discover that the \nlegacy of 9/11 shows clearly that national security will not be \ncompromised by collective bargaining. It shows just the reverse. Those \nwho helped us save lives during 9/11 were covered under collective \nbargaining rights. Before 9/11, the New York Port Authority police \nworked 8-hour days, 4 days on and 2 days off. By the end of the day on \n9/11, however, vacations and personal time were canceled and workers \nwere switched to 12-hour tours, 7 days a week. Indeed, schedules did \nnot return to normal for 3 years. The union did not file a grievance, \nand everyone recognized it was a real crisis.\n  If there is any doubt about whether collective bargaining will \nenhance our ability to recruit and retain the best TSA employees to \nprotect us, all we need to do is think about Donnie McIntyre, a Port \nAuthority police officer, one of the many selfless heroes killed on 9/\n11, and these memorable words written in the third stanza of ``America \nthe Beautiful'' by Katherine Lee Bates:\n\n       O beautiful for heroes proved, in liberating strife. Who \n     more than self, their country loved, and mercy more than \n     life.\n\n  We learned about the story of Donnie McIntyre from his partner, Paul \nNunziato, vice president of the New York Port Authority Police \nBenevolent Association. He testified before Congress in June of 2007 \nregarding the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2007, \na bill almost identical to the amendment offered by Senator Reid.\n  Donnie was one of the 37 port authority police officers who lost \ntheir lives on 9/11 at the World Trade Center evacuation effort. He was \nmarried with two children, and his wife Jeannie was pregnant with their \nthird child when he died on September 11. While nothing will make up \nfor the loss of Donnie to his family, Jeannie does not have to\n\n[[Page S5295]]\n\nworry about paying bills or providing health care for her children, \nlargely because of the benefits the union negotiated for its members.\n  Collective bargaining for TSA employees will not endanger national \nsecurity. It will make us more safe. I urge colleagues to support \ncollective bargaining for TSA employees. It will improve our ability to \nrecruit and retain the best employees, like Donnie McIntyre and the \ncountless other American heroes who work every day to protect us and \nkeep us safe under collective bargaining agreements. Moreover, smart \ncollective bargaining for TSA employees will increase stability and \nprofessionalism in the workplace and will dramatically reduce attrition \nrates, job dissatisfaction, and increased costs, which will enhance \ntransportation security.\n  I urge my colleagues to swiftly confirm John S. Pistole to be the TSA \nDirector and to understand the importance of protecting all of our \nworkers, particularly those who put their lives on the line for us, by \ngiving them basic collective bargaining rights.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, near the end of May, we learned that the \nunemployment rate in my home State of Illinois had fallen to about 10.8 \npercent, down from 11.2 percent in March. That is the first time the \nunemployment rate has gone down since 2006, when it stood at only 4.4 \npercent.\n  I am the first to celebrate the creation of even a single well-paying \njob. I am happy for each and every Illinoisan we can put back to work \nbecause one job will help someone put food on the table, and it will \nhelp one family stand just a little taller. It will give people the \nopportunity to participate in the economy again, buying the goods and \nservices they need.\n  That, in turn, means more jobs. One by one, these folks will turn our \neconomy around from the bottom up. So I do not dismiss this recent jobs \nreport. This is a step in the right direction. It is welcome news. But \nit is only a drop in the bucket. For every person we have put back to \nwork, many others are still hurting--and hurting badly.\n  Our landmark stimulus law, which we enacted more than a year ago, has \ndone a great deal to stop the economy from collapsing and set Americans \nback on the road to recovery. The economy is growing again. Many key \nindicators have turned around. I am proud to say the American Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act has been instrumental in preventing a second Great \nDepression.\n  But job creation continues to lag behind. We have made progress in \nsome areas, but we still have a long way to go. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to come together and support job creation measures so we can \nkeep putting people back to work.\n  At the same time, I urge them to support further extensions of \nunemployment and COBRA benefits so we can help people keep their heads \nabove water until the recovery is complete.\n  These are difficult times. Through no fault of their own, millions of \npeople have suddenly found themselves without a job. These folks are \nthe victims of reckless behavior on Wall Street, but they, rather than \nWall Street, have been forced to pay the price.\n  More Americans are classified as ``long-term unemployed'' and \n``disadvantaged workers'' than ever before. Many have exhausted their \nunemployment benefits or they are dangerously close to doing so.\n  I believe we must pass this extenders package and restore stability \nby helping States cover the rising cost of unemployment insurance.\n  We need to increase access to COBRA so that people can remain on \ntheir old health insurance for a period of time after they lose their \njobs.\n  We need to extend these benefits to more hard-working Americans who \nare struggling to find work during this time of uncertainty.\n  Just last month, after a long partisan battle, we passed a temporary \nextension of these programs. But that extension expired on June 2, \nalmost a month ago. So it is time to take up a new measure that will \ncarry unemployment benefits and COBRA through at least another 6 \nmonths--I would love to see more time--as our friends in the House of \nRepresentatives have discussed. This proposal would make more Americans \neligible for existing benefits. It would not increase the current 99-\nweek limit on these programs, but it would offer a helping hand to \nthose who have lost their jobs recently and make sure they have access \nto the same resources.\n  This extension would not be a comprehensive fix, but it would help \nease the situation and the strain on the victims of this financial \ncrisis until the full effects of our stimulus law have taken hold and \nthe unemployment rate begins to decline at a steady rate.\n  This extenders package will provide needed relief to those who need \nit most. That is why I am deeply disappointed that some of my \ncolleagues have proposed cuts to this legislation. Some say we should \ncut $25 a week in extra unemployment compensation.\n  Relative to the overall legislation, these cuts would be minimal. But \nto a family who has been hit hard by this crisis, $25 a week could make \na tremendous difference. Some will say we cannot afford to provide \nthese benefits in light of our continued recovery. But what do I say? I \nsay we cannot afford not to.\n  We cannot afford to nickel and dime these people who are barely \nscraping by as it is. We need to give them the support they deserve. \nLet's dispense with this hollow rhetoric about fiscal responsibility \nfrom those who have lost their credibility on this issue.\n  Over the last decade, Republicans squandered our surplus by spending \nwildly on massive tax breaks for the wealthy and the special interests, \na war not paid for, and a medical program not paid for. During the \nyears when they were in control, Senate Republicans voted seven times \nto increase the debt limit. They refused to pay for major initiatives, \nthey cut revenue, and they increased spending.\n  It doesn't take a financial expert to recognize that this is just \nplain irresponsible. It is easy to say their record simply does not \nmatch their rhetoric.\n  Let's be honest with the American people. Let's work together to \nsolve this problem rather than hiding behind the same irresponsible \npolicies that got us here in the first place.\n  I recognize that job creation must remain our top priority, and I am \nconfident that Democrats and Republicans can agree we need to help \npeople get back to work. In the meantime, let's pass this extension so \nthat folks can get food on the table and get access to the medical care \nthey need. Let's stand up for those who have been hit hardest by this \ncrisis and send them a message loud and clear: We haven't forgotten you \nand, hopefully, help is on the way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe range of questions for Solicitor General Kagan on her forthcoming \nhearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Solicitor General Kagan has issued a fairly broad invitation, in \neffect, on questioning. In an article that she published in the Chicago \nLaw Review back in 1995, her comment at that time was, in part, as \nfollows:\n\n       When the Senate ceases to engage nominees in meaningful \n     discussion of legal issues, the confirmation process takes on \n     an air of vacuity . . . and the Senate becomes incapable of \n     either properly evaluating nominees or appropriately \n     educating the public. For nominees, the safest and surest \n     route to the prize lay in alternating platitudinous \n     statements and judicial silence. Who would have done anything \n     different in the absence of pressure from Members of \n     Congress?\n\n  That is a fair-sized invitation for a little pressure from Members of \nthe Senate. I think she is right in her pronouncements, and it is \nsomething we ought to do. She goes on to write in the law review \narticle:\n\n       Chairman Biden and Senator Specter, in particular, \n     expressed impatience with the game as played. Specter warned \n     that the Judiciary Committee one day would ``rear up on its \n     hind legs'' and reject a nominee who refused to answer \n     questions. Senators do not insist that any nominee reveal \n     what kind of a Justice she would make by disclosing her views \n     on important legal issues. Senators have not done so since \n     the hearings on the nomination of Judge Bork.\n\n  Solicitor General Kagan goes on to write:\n\n       A nominee lacking a public record would have an advantage \n     over a highly prolific author.\n\n  There has been some questioning as to whether this nominee has such a \nsmall paper trail that it will be doubly difficult, or significantly \nmore difficult, to find out her views. But in her law review article, \nnoting the difference with that kind of a paper trail is, again, \nanother invitation.\n  The author of the law review article, Solicitor General Kagan, goes \non to write:\n\n       The Senators' consideration of a nominee, and particularly \n     the Senate's confirmation hearing, ought to focus on \n     substantive issues.\n\n  Well, that, then, raises the question about how do you get answers on \nsubstantive issues, and what is the value of the substantive issues \nwhen the nominee, after being confirmed, is on the bench?\n  Earlier this week, I made an extensive statement reviewing the \nrecords of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito in their \nconfirmation hearings. Although both professed to give great deference \nto Congress on findings of the facts of the record, when it came to \nmaking a decision--for example, in Citizens United--their judicial \nviews were much different.\n  Both Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito talked at length about \nhow it was the legislative function to have hearings, compile the \nrecord and find the facts; that it was not a judicial function, and \nthat when judges engaged in that, they were engaging in legislation. \nBut when it came to the case of Citizens United, overturning a century \nof a prohibition on corporations engaging in paying for political \nadvertising, both Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito found the \n100,000-page record insufficient. Both of them talked about stare \ndecisis and the value of precedent and the factors that led to the \nstrengthening of stare decisis. Chief Justice Roberts spoke \nemphatically about not giving the legal system a ``jolt.'' Well, that \nis hardly what has happened during their tenure on the bench.\n  So the question which we will put to Solicitor General Kagan, among \nothers, is, How does Congress get those promises translated into actual \npractice? And in making the comments about Chief Justice Roberts and \nJustice Alito, I do so without challenging their good faith. There is a \nbig difference between answering questions in a Judiciary Committee \nhearing and deciding a case in controversy. But the question remains as \nto how we handle that.\n  As expressed in my statement earlier this week, I am very much \nconcerned about the fact that there has been a denigration of the \nstrong constitutional doctrine of separation of power and that we have \nmoved to a concentration of power. That has happened by the Supreme \nCourt taking on the proportionality and congruence test, which, as \nJustice Scalia noted in a dissent, is a ``flabby'' test designed for \njudicial legislation.\n  The Court has also ceded enormous powers to the executive by refusing \nto decide cases where there are conflicts between the executive and \nlegislative branches. I spoke at length earlier this week about the \nfailure of the Supreme Court to deal with the conflict between \nCongress's Article I powers in enacting the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act versus the President's authority as Commander in \nChief. I did that in the context of noting that the Supreme Court has \ntime for deciding many more cases.\n  These are, I think, impressive statistics. In 1886, the Supreme Court \nhad 1,396 cases on its docket and decided 451 cases. In 1987, a century \nlater, the Supreme Court issued 146 opinions. By 2006, the Supreme \nCourt heard argument on 78 cases, wrote opinions in 68. In 2007, they \nheard argument in 75 cases, wrote opinions in 67 cases. In 2008, they \nheard arguments in 78 cases, wrote opinions in 75 cases.\n  In addition to not deciding cases such as the terrorist surveillance \nprogram and the sovereign immunities case, which I talked about \nextensively earlier this week, the Supreme Court has allowed many \ncircuit splits to remain unchecked. There is an informative article in \nthe July/August 2006 edition of the Atlantic entitled ``Of Clerks and \nPerks,'' written by Stuart Taylor, Jr. and Benjamin Wittes. In that \narticle, the authors point out about how much time the Supreme Court \nJustices have, noting that one Justice produced four popular books on \nlegal themes while on the bench, another is working on a $1.5 million \nmemoir, and another Justice took 28 trips in 2004 alone and published \nbooks in 2002, 2003, and 2005.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the full article to which I just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Atlantic, July/August 2006]\n\n                          Of Clerks and Perks\n\n\n why supreme court justices have more free time than ever--and why it \n                          should be taken away\n\n               (By Stuart Taylor Jr. and Benjamin Wittes)\n\n       There are few jobs as powerful as that of Supreme Court \n     justice--and few jobs as cushy. Many powerful people don't \n     have time for extracurricular traveling, speaking, and \n     writing, let alone for three-month summer recesses. Yet the \n     late Chief Justice William Rehnquist produced four popular \n     books on legal themes while serving on the bench. Clarence \n     Thomas has been working on a $1.5 million memoir. And Sandra \n     Day O'Connor, who retired to general adulation, took twenty-\n     eight paid trips in 2004 alone, and published books in 2002, \n     2003, and 2005.\n       All this freelancing time breeds high-handedness. Ruth \n     Bader Ginsburg tars those who disagree with her enthusiasm \n     for foreign law with the taint of apartheid and Dred Scott; \n     Antonin Scalia calls believers in an evolving Constitution \n     ``idiots,'' and carries on a public feud with a newspaper \n     over whether a dismissive gesture he made after Sunday Mass--\n     flicking fingers out from under his chin--was obscene. \n     Meanwhile, on the bench the justices behave like a continuing \n     constitutional convention, second-guessing elected officials \n     on issues from school discipline to the outcome of the 2000 \n     election, while leaving unresolved important, if dust-dry, \n     legal questions that are largely invisible to the public.\n       Many lawmakers are keen to push back against a self-\n     regarding Supreme Court, but all of the obvious levers at \n     their disposal involve serious assaults on judicial \n     independence--a cure that's worse than the disease of \n     judicial unaccountability. The Senate has already politicized \n     the confirmation process beyond redemption, and attacking the \n     federal courts' jurisdiction, impeaching judges, and \n     squeezing judicial budgets are all bludgeons that legislators \n     have historically avoided, and for good reason.\n       So what's an exasperated Congress to do? We have a modest \n     proposal: let's fire their clerks.\n       Eliminating the law clerks would force the justices to \n     focus more on legal analysis and, we can hope, less on their \n     own policy agendas. It would leave them little time for silly \n     speeches. It would make them more ``independent'' than they \n     really want to be, by ending their debilitating reliance on \n     twentysomething law-school graduates. Perhaps best of all, it \n     would effectively shorten their tenure by forcing them to do \n     their own work, making their jobs harder and inducing them to \n     retire before power corrupts absolutely or decrepitude sets \n     in.\n\n[[Page S5297]]\n\n       No justice worth his or her salt should need a bunch of \n     kids who have never (or barely) practiced law to draft \n     opinions for him or her. Yet that is exactly what the Court \n     now has--four clerks in each chamber to handle the lightest \n     caseload in modern history. The justices--who, unlike lower-\n     court judges, don't have to hear any case they don't wish \n     to--have cut their number of full decisions by more than \n     half, from over 160 in 1945 to about 80 today. During the \n     same period they have quadrupled their retinue of clerks.\n       Because Supreme Court clerks generally follow a strict code \n     of omerta, the individual justices' dependence on them is \n     hard to document. But some have reportedly delegated a \n     shocking amount of the actual opinion writing to their \n     clerks.\n       Justice Harry Blackman's papers show that, especially in \n     his later years, clerks did most of the opinion writing and \n     the justice often did little more than minor editing, as well \n     as checking the accuracy of spelling and citations. Ginsburg, \n     Thomas, and Anthony Kennedy reportedly have clerks write most \n     or all of their first drafts--according to more or less \n     detailed instructions--and often make few substantial \n     changes. Some of O'Connor's clerks have suggested that she \n     rarely touched clerk drafts; others say she sometimes did \n     substantial rewrites, depending on the opinion.\n       There's no reason why seats on the highest court in the \n     land, which will always offer their occupants great power and \n     prestige, should also allow them to delegate the detailed \n     writing to smart but unseasoned underlings. Any competent \n     justice should be able to handle more than the current \n     average of about nine majority opinions a year. And those who \n     don't want to work hard ought to resign in favor of people \n     who do.\n       Cutting the clerks out of the writing will also improve the \n     justices' decision- making, by forcing them to think issues \n     through. As the eighty-six-year-old John Paul Stevens, the \n     only justice who habitually writes his own first drafts, once \n     told the journalist Tony Mauro: ``Part of the reason [I write \n     my own drafts] is for self-discipline . . . I don't really \n     understand a case until I write it out.''\n       This is not to suggest that the justices should have to \n     spend their time on scut work--reading all 8,000 petitions \n     for review filed in a typical year, or hitting the library to \n     dig up obscure precedents. These are the tasks that law \n     clerks used to do. And this sort of thing is all they will \n     have time to do if Congress cuts each justice's clerk \n     complement from four back to one, as legal historian David \n     Garrow has suggested.\n       For much of American history, the life of a justice was \n     something of a grind. Watching the strutting pomposity of \n     modern justices, this ``original understanding'' of the job--\n     as a grueling immersion in cases, briefs, and scholarship--\n     seems increasingly attractive.\n       Justice Louis Brandeis once said that the reason for the \n     Supreme Court justices' relatively high prestige was that \n     ``they are almost the only people in Washington who do their \n     own work.'' That was true then. It should be true again.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, this raises the issue about deciding \nthese cases where the workload is not very high, where there is a \nrecess of some 3 months, extensive travels, and extensive lectures. Now \nthey may do what they please, and they will, but there is a balance \nhere. The question is: How do you get more cases decided? How do you \ndeal with the question of having the Justices put into practice, once \nthey are on the bench, what they are talking about in the confirmation \nhearings? That is hard to determine.\n  The best way, in my view, and I have spoken about this in some \nlength, is by publicizing their failures. I think when we take up their \nbudget, for example, it is fair to consider how many clerks they need, \ngiven their workload. The number started at one, went to two and three, \nand is now at four. Is it fair to consider the recess period? In \nevaluating their budget, we have to be very careful not to intrude upon \njudicial independence, which is the hallmark of our Republic. But on \nthe issue of publicizing what the Court does, I think it is fair game; \npreeminently reasonable.\n  For decades now, I have been pressing to have the Supreme Court \nproceedings televised. Only a very limited number of people can fit \ninside the chamber--a couple of hundred; less than 300. People are \npermitted to stay there for only 3 or 4 minutes. Twice the Judiciary \nCommittee has passed out legislation by substantial margins--12-6, and \nin the current term 13-6--calling on the Supreme Court to be televised.\n  When the case of Bush v. Gore was argued, Senator Biden and I wrote \nto the Chief Justice asking that the television cameras be permitted to \ncome in. The Chief Justice declined, but did--in a rather unusual way--\nauthorize a simultaneous audio.\n  There have been continuing efforts by C-SPAN to have more access to \nthe Court, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \ndocument entitled ``C-SPAN Timeline: Cameras in the Court'' at the \nconclusion of this presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I don't have time to go into it now, \nwith the limited time available, but the reader of the Congressional \nRecord can see how frequently the Court has denied access to even the \naudio.\n  It is a matter of general knowledge that the Supreme Court Justices \nengage in television interviews with some frequency. Justice Scalia, \nfor example, appeared on the CBS News program ``60 Minutes'' on April \n27 of 2008; Justice Thomas was on ``60 Minutes'' on September 30, 2007; \nJustices Breyer and Scalia have engaged in several televised debates, \nincluding a debate on December 5, 2006. All Justices have sat for \ntelevision interviews conducted by C-SPAN.\n  A point I have made with some frequency on the floor of the Senate is \nthe great importance of the Supreme Court in our government. The \nSupreme Court has the final word. There is nothing in the Constitution \nwhich gives the Supreme Court the final word, but they took it in the \ncelebrated case of Marbury v. Madison, and I believe it has been for \nthe betterment of the country. You find the inability of the Congress \nto act. The most noteworthy illustration of that was segregation, for \nyears the practice in this country. The executive branch did not handle \nit, but the Court was able to integrate our schools in a recognition of \nthe changing values and the flexible interpretation of a living \nConstitution.\n  It is often said that the Court is not final because they are right, \nbut they are right because they are final. Somebody has to make these \nfinal decisions, and I think the Court should do it. But I do believe \nit is of great value if the people in this country understood what the \nCourt is deciding.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a statement of some 11 cases entitled ``List of Cutting-Edge \nDecisions of the Roberts' Court.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          List of Cutting-Edge Decisions of the Roberts Court\n\n       Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010). A \n     five-four majority of the Court struck down as facially \n     unconstitutional section 203 of the McCain-Feingold Act, \n     despite an extensive body of Congressional findings, two \n     Supreme Court precedents explicitly uphold section 203 \n     (Austin (1990) and McConnell (2003)), and prohibition on \n     corporation money in federal elections stretching back to \n     1907.\n       Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School \n     District No. 1 (2007). In a 5-4 opinion by Chief Justice \n     Roberts, the Court struck down narrowly tailored race-\n     conscious remedial plans adopted by two local boards designed \n     to maintain racially integrated school districts, contrary to \n     a ``longstanding and unbroken line of legal authority tells \n     us that the Equal Protection Clause [of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment] permits local school boards to use race-conscious \n     criteria to achieve positive race-related goals, even when \n     the Constitution does not compel it.''\n       Hein v. Freedom from Religion Foundation, Inc. (2007). In a \n     5-4 opinion by Justice Alito, the Court held that an \n     individual taxpayer did not have standing to challenge the \n     constitutionality of government expenditures to religious \n     organizations under the Bush administration's ``faith-based \n     initiatives'' program. That conclusion ran counter to a four-\n     decade-old precedent holding that taxpayers have standing to \n     challenge federal expenditures as violative of the \n     Establishment Clause (Flast v. Cohen (1968)).\n       Morse v. Frederick, (2007). In a 5-4 opinion by Chief \n     Justice Roberts, the Court held that the suspension of high \n     school students for displaying a banner across the street \n     from their school that read ``BONG Hits 4 JESUS'' did not \n     violate the First Amendment. That holding ran counter to a \n     long-standing precedent, Tinker (1969), which held \n     unconstitutional the discipline of a public-school student \n     for engaging in First Amendment-protected speech unless it \n     disrupts school activities.\n       Penn Plaza, LLC v. Pyett (2009). In a 5-4 opinion by \n     Justice Thomas, the Court upended the Court's unanimous 1974 \n     decision in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co. (1974), which \n     held that an employee cannot be compelled to arbitrate a \n     statutory discrimination claim under a collectively \n     bargained-for arbitration clause to which he did not consent. \n     The Court held otherwise in Pyett, thereby depriving many \n     employees of their right to bring statutory discrimination \n     claims in federal court.\n\n[[Page S5298]]\n\n       Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS (2007). In a \n     5-4 opinion by Justice Kennedy, the Court overturned a \n     century-old precedent holding that vertical price-fixing \n     agreements per-se violate the federal antitrust laws.\n       Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Lift \n     (2007). In a 5-4 opinion by Justice Roberts, the Court ruled \n     that the McCain-Feingold Act's limitations on political \n     advertising were unconstitutional as they applied to issue \n     ads like WRTL's (which in this case encouraged viewers to \n     contact two U.S. Senators and tell them to oppose filibusters \n     of judicial nominees). Justice Scalia went so far as to \n     accuse Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito of practicing \n     what he called ``faux judicial restraining'' by effectively \n     overruling McConnell (2003) ``without expressly saying so.''\n       Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District v. Holder \n     (2009). An opinion by Chief Justice Roberts discussed whether \n     the 2006 extension of 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was \n     supported by an adequate legislative record. Although the \n     court ultimately decided the case on a narrow statutory \n     ground, Roberts made clear that he was disinclined to accept \n     Congress's legislative finding as to the need for Sec. 5, \n     despite an extensive record amassed over ten months in 21 \n     hearings.\n       Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (2007). In a \n     5-4 opinion by Justice Alito, the Court ruled that \n     Ledbetter's employment discrimination claim was time-barred \n     by Title VII's limitations period, despite the fact that she \n     had only recently found out that the discrimination was \n     occurring.\n       Ashcroft v. Iqbal (2009) and Bell Atlantic v. Twombly \n     (2007). In these decisions, the Court fundamentally changed \n     the long-standing rules of pleadings under the Federal Rules \n     of Civil Procedure while refusing to acknowledge that a \n     change had been made. These decisions created a heightened \n     pleading standard that may impair the ability of American to \n     access the courts.\n       District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), In a 5-4 decision, \n     the Court held that the Second Amendment guarantees an \n     individual right to bear arms unconnected with service in a \n     state militia, and, in doing, struck down a District of \n     Columbia gun control law that had been in place for over \n     three decades. The majority and minority opinion diverged \n     sharply on the framer's original understanding of the Second \n     Amendment.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. There is insufficient time to go over them now, but most \nof them are 5-4 decisions. The Supreme Court decides everything from \nlife to death, Roe vs. Wade to the death penalty cases and double \njeopardy. These cases involve the integration issue, religious freedom, \nfreedom of speech, collective bargaining, the antitrust laws, and all \nof the cutting-edge questions are decided.\n  It is my hope that we will find time on the Senate's agenda--with as \nmany quorum calls as we have had we ought to find some time--to take up \nthe issue of televising the Supreme Court. And as we approach next \nMonday's hearings on Solicitor General Kagan, we will be pursuing these \nvery important issues.\n  In the remaining time available, one other matter which I wish to \ncomment about--and I have sent Solicitor General Kagan three letters \nsetting forth the areas of questioning which I intend to make--is a \nremarkable, perhaps unprecedented, action by the Supreme Court \ninvalidating the Arizona clean elections law.\n  Arizona set up a law to provide matching funds. The District Court in \nArizona declared it unconstitutional, but the Ninth Circuit overturned \nthe district court. The district court had issued an injunction--that \nis, to prevent the law from being carried out--on matching funds. The \nNinth Circuit reversed that. The Supreme Court--in an unusual decision, \nto put it mildly--earlier this month, on June 8, put the injunction \nback into effect.\n  This is in the context where there hasn't even been a petition for \ncertiorari filed. The regular practice--the regular order--is a \npetition for cert, briefs, argument. That is the way cases are decided. \nBut here, in the wake of Citizens United, invalidating a key part of \nMcCain-Feingold, we have the Supreme Court invalidating the Arizona law \nwithout even the customary procedures.\n  All of this is in the face of congressional action and action by \nstates to try to respond to public opinion. A recent Hart poll showed \nthat some 95 percent of the American people think that corporations \nmake contributions to exert political influence, and 85 percent of the \npeople feel that corporations ought not to be able to contribute to \npolitical campaigns.\n  These are among the questions which we will be considering with the \nconfirmation proceeding on Solicitor General Kagan. I cited at some \nlength her law review article where she is inviting us to do so, \ncommitting at least in her law review article in 1995 to provide \nsubstantive answers and acknowledging that someone with a thin paper \ntrail, as she has, is under more of an obligation to respond.\n  I note the time has expired.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 C-SPAN Timeline: Cameras in the Court\n\n       C-SPAN has sought to provide its audience with coverage of \n     the Judiciary, just as it has covered the Legislative and \n     Executive branches of government. The prohibition of \n     televised coverage of the Supreme Court's oral arguments has \n     been an obstacle to fulfilling that goal.

Mr. President, in my at least weekly report to \nthe Senate about what is happening down on the Gulf Coast, I am sad to \nreport to you that as of this moment, one of the remote operating \nvehicles has bumped into that top hat process that was funneling the \noil off of the big structure, the blowout preventer from the pipe, the \nriser pipe, with the result that all of that oil now is not being \nsiphoned off. The estimates now are upwards and probably pretty close \nto 60,000 barrels a day of oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Remember, when it started off, oh, it was only 1,000 barrels a day. \nThen it was only 5,000 barrels a day. Then it was maybe 12,000 barrels \na day but max 20,000 barrels a day. Senator Boxer and I were able to \nget the streaming video out so the scientists could look and they could \nmake their estimates, their calculations. Anyway, it has gone on and \non. It is now up to 60,000 barrels of oil a day.\n  The oil industry had said they had started siphoning off--first it \nwas 10,000, then it was 15,000. They were trying to get it up to \n25,000. Now, since this accident, that is being shut down--let's hope \njust very temporarily, but we are now back to the point that most of \nthe oil is gushing back into the gulf. We know the result.\n  If this continues for another 2 months, to the end of the summer, it \nis going to fill up the gulf with oil and it is going to do just what \nit is doing now. When the wind comes this way, it brings the oil from \nthe South to the North; it brings it in onshore. The oil\n\n[[Page S5300]]\n\nis now all the way from the wellhead off Louisiana, all the way across \nthe gulf coast of northwest Florida. The blessing we had is that the \nwind has kept most of it off the coast. But, inevitably, when the wind \nrises up in the South, it brings the tar balls up. It has brought some \nof that terrible-looking orange mousse. That is one of the most \nrepulsive-looking things. When I saw that in Pensacola Bay, to think of \nthat in a pristine bay such as that and that the tides and wind were \ncarrying it right to downtown Pensacola--that is what we are having to \ndeal with.\n  Tomorrow, the Energy Committee is having a hearing on legislation \nSenator Menendez and I have sponsored. This is to rectify the situation \nthat brought us to this situation in the first place; that is, the \nsafety checks were not made, the attention to detail on the application \nwas not paid, and the checks were not made to see that the backup \ndevices on the blowout preventer were, in fact, going to be there. In \nother words, the oil regulator--the part of the U.S. Government that is \nsupposed to do all of these safety checks--was not functioning.\n  Why was it not functioning? Because for better than a decade, there \nhas been a cozy relationship between the oil industry and the \nregulator, called the Minerals Management Service in the Department of \nthe Interior, and that regulator was so compromised by gifts, by trips, \nby jobs. Indeed, I am sad to report that the 2008 inspector general's \nreport talked about there were parties, there was booze, there were \ndrugs, there were illicit sexual relationships going on between the \nindustry and the government regulators. How can you have government \nregulation under these conditions?\n  Of course, there was the revolving door. The revolving door happens \nin other regulated industries as well, but this one was particularly \nrevolving and revolving. What that is, somebody would come out of the \noil industry, they would go through the revolving door, they would go \nright into the government regulator shop, they would stay there for a \nwhile and they would supposedly be an independent regulator, but, no, \nthe door would revolve again and they would then go right back out of \nthe government job, back into the oil industry--the very industry they \nwere supposed to be regulating before. Is that a conflict of interest? \nYou bet it is. Can you have an independent regulator? Of course you \ncan't under those circumstances.\n  So Senator Menendez and I have filed a bill. As a matter of fact, we \nhad this back in 2008 when that inspector general's report came out. We \ncould not get anybody to pay any attention to it back then. What is the \nresult of lax regulation? It is exactly what has been visited upon us--\nthis trauma so many people in that region of the Gulf of Mexico are \nsuffering.\n  As the administration goes about the process of cleaning up the \nMinerals Management Service, reorganizing it, getting new personnel, \nthen it is up to us to change the law to make sure there are \npenalties--indeed, even criminal penalties--for gifts and trips by the \nvery industry you are supposedly regulating, which in this case claimed \n11 lives and countless jobs and livelihoods and a whole way of life in \na culture along the gulf coast.\n  The bill that will be heard tomorrow, which we are grateful for, sets \nnew penalties. It sets a limit--a mere 2 years--so that when someone \ncomes out of the government regulator's office, they can't be employed \nin that oil industry they have just regulated until a period of time of \n2 years has lapsed. It also provides penalties for the gifts, the \ntrips, the favors we have seen chronicled, not in my words but in the \nwords of the 2008 inspector general's report; the report 2 months ago, \nthe inspector general's report; and the report a month ago, the \ninspector general's report. In this last report, he particularly talked \nabout the revolving door. It is something we have to change. Sadly, it \nhas taken the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history, but \nbecause of this tragic condition, this Congress ought to be poised now \nto crack down on the government's buddy-buddy relationships with the \noil industry.\n  Tomorrow, the Senate Energy Committee is set to begin debating \nlegislation aimed at cutting the oil drillers' close ties to the \nindustry and aimed at stopping that revolving door. It is going to \nprohibit the employees of the Minerals Management Service or its \nsuccessor--since the Secretary of Interior, Ken Salazar, is now busting \nit up--they are going to have to wait around for 2 years before they \nget a job back in the industry. The goal is obvious: to limit the \ndegree of influence big oil has on those who are hired to keep the \ndrillers in line. It is the least we can do for those folks down home \nwho are suffering so much right now. They expect us to update laws to \nmeet the times. This is such a time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes on the \nmotion that relates to the coming increases in capital gains tax and \ndividend tax. Very few Americans are aware and I think even some people \nin the Senate are not aware that in about 6 months, there is going to \nbe a tax explosion in this country--taxes on everyone from the 10-\npercent bracket all the way up to major corporations. Taxes are going \nup at a time when we know raising taxes will kill jobs in America.\n  The Heritage Foundation estimates that if we allow taxes to expire \nthis year, the current rate of taxes to expire, and taxes go up in our \neconomy, in the first year we could lose 270,000 jobs. This is really \nunacceptable when unemployment is already nearly 10 percent, the \neconomy is waning, and we just got a bad housing report. As all of \nthese companies plan for their future, they are certainly not going to \nrisk capital to expand their companies and add people if they know \ntheir taxes are going to go up.\n  What I proposed as part of this debate on a tax bill is to focus on \njust one area that we know has a lot to do with investment, with growth \nof companies; that is, the capital gains tax and the dividends tax. My \nmotion would refer the underlying bill back to committee to add the \nprovisions that cap gains tax and dividend taxes will both stay at 15 \npercent. If we do not act, in 6 months the capital gains taxes will go \nfrom 15 to 20 percent and the dividend taxes, which affect a lot of \nsenior citizens on fixed incomes, will go from 15 all the way up to \nnearly 40 percent. That makes absolutely no sense in a recession and \nwith the joblessness we have across this country. Surely, as a Senate, \nas a Congress, we could recognize that raising taxes on investment--\nthose who are going to risk their capital--does not make sense when we \nare trying to do everything we can to stimulate the economy.\n\n  We tried it the other way. We tried the government spending approach. \nWe all know this government spending plan we call the stimulus, where \nwe spent nearly $1 trillion, has failed. The President promised that if \nwe rushed that through and got stimulus immediately into the economy, \nover a year ago, that we could keep unemployment below 8 percent and \nput Americans back to work. But since then, we have lost millions of \nreal jobs. We have added some government jobs because this is basically \na government spending plan, but we certainly have not put the real \neconomy most Americans depend on back to work.\n  We are continuing to lose ground. Yet we stick to this failed \nstimulus plan. Even when we try to pay for extending unemployment \nbenefits with unspent stimulus money, my colleagues on the other side \nare holding so tightly to this that they will not even use that money \nto pay for it. Instead, they want to raise taxes and add to our debt--\nagain, at a time when we really cannot afford this as a nation, when \nall of the so-called economic experts are warning us that this debt we \nhave today is unsustainable. But almost every week in this body, the \nDemocrats are proposing programs that add to the debt, that increase \ntaxes--everything that is counter to improving our economy and adding \nto jobs and helping to build a brighter future in this country. Even \nsome of those who were strong supporters of the stimulus bill have come \nout publicly and said: We guessed wrong. I am afraid we should not \ncontinue to guess.\n  One thing we know from history is--if we look back over several \ndecades--\n\n[[Page S5301]]\n\nwhen we lower capital gains and dividends we improve the economy and we \nincrease job creation in the economy. It makes no sense for us to move \nahead, sending the signal to all of the investors in this country that \nwe are going to punish their investment at a time when we need them to \nstep up to the plate.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider this. What we are asking is that \nthe bill be sent back to the Finance Committee so they can work on ways \nto keep capital gains and dividend taxes the same rather than let them \nexplode, along with all of the other taxes that are going to go up in \nthe next 6 months.\n  I hope we will have a chance to vote on this bill. I understand the \nmajority is trying to table this motion. I strongly urge my colleagues \nto take up this matter, to send it back to the Finance Committee where \nthey can figure out how to make sure we do not kill more jobs in the \neconomy like we have done with the other failed stimulus plan.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are working to complete work on the so-\ncalled extenders bill. We thought we would be ready to do the \nprocedural votes to get to that a couple of hours ago. But as things \nhappen around here, there has been changes requested by a number of \nSenators. As a result of that, we are going to have to go back to the \nJoint Committee on Taxation and get some more numbers. That is probably \ngoing to take about an hour.\n  So we are not jammed for time, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to a period of morning business until 4:30 p.m. today, \nand that during that period of time Senators be allowed to speak for up \nto 10 minutes each. We are not going to divide the time Democrat and \nRepublican. What we will do is, if there is a Democrat who wants to \ntalk, talk for 10 minutes. If there is a Republican here, then it would \nbe their turn.\n  We will try to work this out by a gentlemen-and-ladies agreement to \ngo back and forth, if in fact there are people who want to talk, with \n10-minute limitations alternating time, if in fact there are the \nSenators.

Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate will begin the \nconfirmation hearings on Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan. And I think \nit is safe to say most American do not know all that much about her.\n  But a fuller picture of this nominee is beginning to emerge.\n  The recent release of documents relating to Ms. Kagan's work in the \nClinton White House reveals a woman who was committed to advancing a \npolitical agenda, a woman who was less concerned about objectively \nanalyzing the law than the ways in which the law could be used to \nadvance a political goal.\n  In other words, these memos and notes reveal a woman whose approach \nto the law was as a political advocate, the very opposite of what the \nAmerican people expect in a judge.\n  This is the kind of thinking behind the current Democratic effort to \npass the so-called DISCLOSE Act, a bill designed to respond to the \nSupreme Court's decision in Citizens United that they think puts them \nat a political disadvantage in the fall. That is why the bill was \nwritten by the chairman of their campaign committee.\n  And this is also the kind of thinking that seems to have motivated \nthe Clinton White House to seek a similar legislative response the last \ntime the Supreme Court issued a decision in this area that Democrats \nthought put them at a political disadvantage.\n  I am referring here to the case of Colorado Republican Federal \nCampaign Committee v. FEC, a case in which the Supreme Court \nessentially said that the Federal Government could not limit political \nparties from spending money on campaign ads called ``independent \nexpenditures'' that said things like, ``Vote against Smith,'' or ``Vote \nfor Jones.''\n  This was not an especially controversial decision, as evidenced by \nthe fact that it was written by Justice Breyer, one of the Court's most \nprominent liberals. But the decision put Democrats at a political \ndisadvantage. So the Clinton administration did the same thing then \nthat the Obama administration is trying to do today. They considered \nproposals to lessen its impact and to benefit Democrats over \nRepublicans. And Elena Kagan worked to advance that goal as part of \nPresident Clinton's campaign finance task force.\n  Ms. Kagan's notes reveal that finding ways to help Democrats over \nRepublicans was very much on her mind. According to one of her notes, \nshe wrote:\n\n       ``Free TV as balance to independent expenditures? Clearly, \n     on mind of Dems--need a way to balance this.''\n\n  The ``balance'' Ms. Kagan is referring to was a way for Democrats to \nbalance what they viewed as the Republicans' advantage in helping their \ncandidates with independent expenditures. And ``free TV,'' well, that \nis a reference to Democrats wanting free television to help them out in \ntheir campaigns. Providing free TV would be a ``significant benefit,'' \nMs. Kagan wrote. It was also something the Clinton administration could \nbring about, she suggested, by simply having the FCC issue a new \nregulation, or by adding such a provision to legislation the White \nHouse was helping to craft.\n  But this was not the only way in which Ms. Kagan thought about \nstacking the deck to help Democrats over Republicans at the time. \nAnother note reveals her approach to the issue of soft money, the money \npolitical parties used to spend outside of Federal elections. Ms. \nKagan's notes show that she thought banning it would hurt Republicans \nand help Democrats. She even seemed to delight in the prospect of \nfinding ways to disadvantage Republicans. Here is what she wrote in her \nnotes:\n  ``Soft [money] ban--affects Repubs, not Dems!''\n  And if I had this quote up on a chart, you would see that she \npunctuated this sentence with an exclamation point.\n  So let me repeat that quote one more time:\n  ``Soft [money] ban--affects Repubs, not Dems''--punctuated with an \nexclamation point.\n  We already knew that Ms. Kagan and her office argued to the Supreme \nCourt at different points in the Citizens United case that the Federal \nGovernment had the power to ban political speech in videos, books and \npamphlets if it did not like the speaker.\n  Then we learned she went out of her way to prevent lawyers at the \nJustice Department from officially noting their serious legal concerns \nwith campaign finance legislation in order to help the Clinton \nadministration achieve its political goals.\n  Now we learn that she thought about drafting such legislation in ways \nto help Democrats and hurt Republicans. And her advocacy and apparent \nglee at identifying some political harm to Republicans is, to my mind, \nanother piece of her record that calls into question her ability to \nimpartially apply the law to all who would come before her as a Justice \non our Nation's highest Court.\n  The more we learn about Ms. Kagan's work as a political adviser and \npolitical operative, the more questions arise about her ability to make \nthe necessary transition from politics to neutral arbiter. As Ms. Kagan \nherself once noted, during her years in the Clinton\n\n[[Page S5302]]\n\nadministration, she spent ``most'' of her time not serving ``as an \nattorney'' but as a policy adviser. And her notes and memoranda reveal \nthat all too often her policy advice and actions were based, first and \nforemost, on what was good for Democrats.\n  This kind of thinking might be okay for a political adviser. But \nthere is a place for politics and for advocating for one's party, and \nthat place is not on the Supreme Court. A political adviser may be \nexpected to seek political advantage, but judges have a different task.\n  We do not know how Elena Kagan will apply the law because she has no \njudicial record, little experience as a private practitioner, and no \nsignificant writings for the last several years. So the question before \nthe Senate is whether, given Ms. Kagan's background as a political \nadviser and academic, we believe she could impartially apply the law to \ngroups with which she does not agree and for which she and the Obama \nadministration might not empathize. So far, I do not have that \nconfidence.\n  As the hearings progress, we will know better whether Ms. Kagan could \n``administer justice without respect to persons,'' as the judicial oath \nrequires.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I understand we are in a period of \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/23/senate-section/article/S5302-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5302-S5303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the health care \ndebate that has gone on in the Congress throughout the past year. \nPresident Obama promised that the Democrats' health care bill would \nreduce the spiraling cost of health care. The promise was made that if \none likes their health care plan, they can keep it. Not necessarily \nevery day but just about every other day there is yet another report \nreleased that confirms what many of us who opposed a Federal takeover \nof the health care system feared all along--higher costs, less access, \nand unsustainable spending. The President and this Democratically \ncontrolled Congress need to repeal this bill and put in place \nmeaningful health care reform measures that will allow individuals to \nexercise more control over their health benefits and see their premiums \nactually go down instead of up.\n  I wish to speak to some of the reports that have been coming out. \nLet's start with a government report that came out 4 weeks after the \nhealth care bill was signed into law. It was from the President's own \nChief Actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, a \ngentleman by the name of Rick Foster. He released his report saying \nthat President Obama's new health care reform law will actually \nincrease national health care spending by $311 billion over the next 10 \nyears. Foster's report also said about 14 million people would lose \ntheir employer coverage by the year 2019, largely as a result of small \nemployers terminating coverage and workers who currently have employer \ncoverage enrolling in Medicaid.\n\n  Mr. Foster also reports that the $530 billion in Medicare cuts may \nnot be what he calls ``realistic and sustainable,'' potentially driving \n15 percent of all hospitals, nursing homes, and similar providers into \nthe red within 10 years. This would cause providers who depend on \nMedicare for a substantial part of their business to be forced to drop \nout of the program, ``possibly jeopardizing access to care''--those are \nMr. Foster's words: ``jeopardizing access to care''--for our senior \ncitizens.\n  The situation in my home State of Alaska is particularly dire. I have \nstood on this floor and I have discussed and certainly spoke to the \nstatistics. Back in March of 2009, the Institute for Social and \nEconomic Research at the University of Alaska reported that just 13--\n13--out of 75 primary care physicians in Anchorage were accepting new \nMedicare patients. Anchorage is our State's largest community, and we \nhad 13 out of 75 primary care physicians who were accepting new \nMedicare patients. Just 15 months after this report was done by ISER, \nthat number has dropped to the single digits.\n  Further cuts to Medicare will only worsen this situation for the most \nvulnerable Alaskans--our senior and disabled citizens. This is one of \nthe main reasons I simply could not support the health care bill that \ncame forward. The issue, as it relates to access for those who are \nMedicare eligible, has been a crisis in our State that only continues \nto worsen. But there are some other reasons for my objections.\n  In May--so last month--the neutral government scorekeeper, the \nCongressional Budget Office, or CBO, revised its initial cost estimate \nof the bill to say that the law will likely cost $115 billion more in \ndiscretionary spending over 10 years than the original projection. So 2 \nmonths after the law was enacted, the American people learn from yet \nanother new government report that their Congress has passed a bill \nthat would increase their health care costs and reduce their benefits. \nAgain, this was something Republicans warned about over and over again \nduring the last year as we discussed health care.\n  The small businesses in this country stand to lose the most under \nthis health care bill. They were promised a pipedream, filled with tax \ncredits to save small businesses money, but the bill is simply not \nhaving that effect. In fact, it is having the opposite effect. The \nAssociated Press released a ``fact-check'' article last month that \nstated point blank: The small business tax credit included in the \nhealth care reform falls short.\n  The story interviews a gentleman by the name of Zach Hoffman. I know \nthis story has been repeated on the Senate floor, but it is worth \nrepeating.\n  Mr. Hoffman is the owner of an Illinois furniture company. He has 24 \nemployees. They earn an average of $35,000 a year--clearly, a very \nmodest wage by any standard. Yet the amount of the credit Mr. Hoffman \ncalculated he would receive under this new law as a small business \nwould be zero to him.\n  The AP article points out, the ``fine print''--which many small \nbusinesses will not qualify for the credit--was left out of the \nadministration's press releases that touted the credit's ``broad \neligibility.'' But you really just need to go back to the individuals \nwho are being impacted by this or had hoped they would be impacted \npositively. Go back to the Illinois small business owner and look at \nhis comment. He says:\n\n       It leaves you with this feeling of bait-and-switch.\n\n  But thinking of how Mr. Hoffman could be eligible for the tax credit, \nhe learned that all he needed to do was to cut his workforce to 10 \nemployees and cut their wages. To this, the small business owner says: \nThis does not make sense. He says:\n\n       That seems like a strange outcome, given we've got 10 \n     percent unemployment.\n\n  I think we would all agree it is a strange outcome. An unacceptable \noutcome is what it is.\n  This Illinois employer's situation is no different than any other \nemployer regardless of what State they are in. In States such as Alaska \nand other particularly high-cost localities--whether it is New York \nCity, San Francisco--where wages are higher because of the cost of \nliving, the employers stand to lose because they will not be able to be \neligible for these tax credits simply because they pay their employees \nhigher wages than are allowed for in the health care bill.\n  Since enactment of the health care law, we have also heard from well-\nrespected health care consulting firms that have released information \nshowing that businesses fear the law's new employer mandate penalties. \nAccording to a report, more than one in four employers--about 26 \npercent--and nearly two in five retailers may not be in compliance with \nprovisions requiring coverage of all employees working over 30 hours \nper week. Of those, a majority--54 percent--said they would consider \nchanging their business practices ``so that fewer employees work 30 \nhours or more per week.'' This would be a devastating blow--a \ndevastating blow--to an already ravaged economy.\n  We have another well-known consulting firm, Mercer. They released a\n\n[[Page S5303]]\n\nsurvey of the impact of the new health care law on employers just last \nmonth. The survey shows there is near unanimous belief by employers \nthat the new law will raise employees' premiums. Only 3 percent of \nemployers that responded said they believed the legislative changes \nwould not cause their premiums to rise. This does not demonstrate very \nmuch faith in how this is going to benefit them.\n  One-quarter of respondents believed the bill would raise premiums by \nat least 3 percent over and above this year's normal rise in costs due \nto medical inflation.\n  Last week, there was a PricewaterhouseCoopers report that stated the \ncost for businesses providing health care coverage to employees will \njump by 9 percent next year, in 2011, which analysts predict employers \nwill shift more of the cost to workers next year. For the first time, \nmost of the American workforce is expected to have health insurance \ndeductibles of $400 or more.\n  Also, last week, the administration's new regulations on \ngrandfathered health plans were released, outlining the various ways in \nwhich existing employer health plans will be forced to change under the \nnew law. According to the Obama administration report, these \nregulations could result in nearly 7 out of 10 workers--and 80 percent \nof workers at small businesses; so 80 percent of the workers in our \nsmall businesses--would see changes in their plans.\n  In other words, under the new health care bill, more than half of \nthose who get insurance through their jobs may be forced to change \ntheir plans whether they want to or not. Internal administration \ndocuments reveal that up to 51 percent of employers may have to \nrelinquish their current health care coverage because of the health \ncare bill--which takes me back again to the statement the President \ninitially made: If you like your health care plan, you can keep it. \nThat simply is not what we are seeing. It is not translating in the \nreal world.\n  Then, of course, we have the CBO letter that just came out. This is \ndated June 21--just the day before yesterday. This letter comes from \nMr. Elmendorf, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, in \nresponding to the ranking member on the HELP Committee about the high-\nrisk pools. That letter confirms that an additional $5 billion to $10 \nbillion would be needed to fully fund all eligible enrollees in the \nhigh-risk pool expansion, and, further, that the new high-risk pool \nprogram, which was supposed to be providing health insurance coverage \nto Americans--but to date the government has failed to provide any \nfunding for these new high-risk programs and those with preexisting \ncoverage have not been able to enroll in these new high-risk pools--\nbut, again, coming from the Congressional Budget Office, with these new \nestimates, in fact, the funding available for the subsidies is simply \nnot sufficient to cover the costs of all applicants and then the \nadditional cost that is anticipated, an additional $5 billion to $10 \nbillion to cover all eligible enrollees.\n\n  With new government reports telling us this bill will not reduce the \npremiums, and with employer groups looking at how they can minimize the \nhits they are taking under this new law, we have put American \nbusinesses, particularly our small businesses, in peril of dropping \nemployees to avoid the $2,000-per-employee penalty, called the employer \nmandate. We have put these small businesses in peril of reducing \nemployee wages in order to qualify for small business credits. We have \npassed a bill that hurts our small businesses during one of the worst \neconomic downturns in the history of our Nation.\n  Last week, Investor's Business Daily stated that small firms will be \neven more likely to lose existing plans. In fact--this is their \nstatement--the ``midrange estimate is that 66% of small employer plans \nand 45 percent of large employer plans will relinquish their \ngrandfathered status by the end of 2013.''\n  So in the worst-case scenario, 69 percent of employers--again, 80 \npercent of smaller firms--would lose that status, exposing them to far \nmore provisions under the new health care law.\n  Again, it makes you ask the question: Was this what the President \nenvisioned in health care reform when he said: ``If you like what you \nhave, you can keep it''? I think this new law has failed--has clearly \nfailed--to keep the President's promise to the people.\n  It was for these reasons I objected at the time this bill was moving \nthrough the process. I have stood up and strongly supported the efforts \nof the State of Alaska and other States to strike the most egregious \nprovisions of the law through a multistate lawsuit. Again, it is why I \nvoted to repeal the entire law when we had that opportunity this past \nMarch.\n  This law is not what the American people wanted, and it is not what \nour President promised. I believe the legislation has to be repealed. \nIt has to be replaced with sensible alternatives that are widely \nsupported. We know what so many of those are: buying across State \nlines; implementing medical malpractice reform; reimbursing for quality \nof service, not quantity of service. This is what the people wanted. \nThis is what the American people expected. Yet this is not what was \ndelivered.\n  It is time to help our economy rather than to kill it with this \nlegislation that was passed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize another of our \nNation's great Federal employees. Americans continue to watch closely \nthe efforts in the Gulf of Mexico to clean up the worst oilspill in our \nNation's history. That oilspill has been a reminder to all of us just \nhow important clean water is for wildlife, businesses, and our food \nsupply.\n  The Federal employee I have chosen to honor today designed innovative \nsoftware to identify risks and solutions to possible attacks against \nour Nation's water supply.\n  Dr. Regan Murray is a native of Cincinnati, OH. She holds a \nbachelor's degree from Kalamazoo College and a Ph.D. in applied \nmathematics from the University of Arizona. After completing her \ndoctorate, she worked in the private sector but soon realized she \nwanted to make a difference by serving her country.\n  Then came the attacks of September 11. Shortly after that tragic day, \nRegan started working at the Environmental Protection Agency as a \nmathematical statistician.\n  Looking back at her decision to pursue public service, Regan said:\n\n       I wanted to do more meaningful work that directly impacted \n     people's lives.\n\n  Regan was instrumental in leading the development team for new \nsoftware that identifies security vulnerabilities in our water supply \nand helps devise solutions to make it safer. One of these programs, \nTEVA-SPOT, helps find the best locations in water utility distribution \nsystems in which to install sensors. Another, called CANARY, is a real-\ntime data analysis program to monitor the sensors and identify \ncontaminants.\n  Regan attributes her success to a strong background in mathematics. \nShe has said:\n\n       Math is the language of science, which is perfect when \n     leading an interdisciplinary group of researchers.\n\n  I have spoken often on this floor about the desirability of more of \nour students, especially women, to consider careers in the fields of \nscience, technology, engineering, and math, or STEM. Regan is a \nwonderful example of how someone who studies mathematics can make a \nreal and important difference.\n  Her story, though, does not end with her success in developing these \nsoftware programs. Regan also worked hard to build and maintain \nimportant relationships with water utilities in order to ensure that \nthese programs would be put to use.\n\n[[Page S5304]]\n\n  Furthermore, despite her long hours of work for the agency, Regan \ncofounded a nonprofit that focuses on improving the lives of children \naffected by HIV-AIDS and poverty in Africa. She visits Zambia annually \nand has raised thousands of dollars to benefit the schools there.\n  Outstanding government employees such as Dr. Regan Murray are making \na difference each and every day. So many of them also serve as \nvolunteers in their communities and around the world.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Dr. Regan Murray and \nall those working at the Environmental Protection Agency for their hard \nwork and dedicated service on behalf of the American people. They are \nall truly great Federal employees.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this past weekend, 12 Turkish soldiers \nwere killed by PKK terrorists. Yesterday, another four Turkish soldiers \nwere killed, as well as the innocent daughter of an officer, and \naccording to the Turkish government, the PKK is responsible for this \nmassacre as well.\n  Our condolences go out to these families and all the people of \nTurkey. Terrorist assaults are unacceptable wherever they occur in the \nworld, and we all have to fight together against them.\n  We are reminded of our common bond with Turkey, and our common fight \nagainst terrorists and terror wherever we see it. Turkey has been an \nimportant ally, a democracy in a troubled region and a force for \nstability.\n  We must keep in mind that Turkey has been a member of NATO since \n1952. They established a strategic and military alliance with Israel in \nthe 1990s, and now have boots on the ground in Afghanistan helping us \nthere.\n  For many years, the bond between the United States and Turkey has \nbeen strong and unchallengeable. Despite this progress, Turkey's \ncurrent prime minister is jeopardizing and risking much of what his \ncountry and the Turkish people have accomplished over recent decades. \nMoving Turkey away from the middle and toward a dangerous extremist \npath cannot possibly be a good course of action for that country.\n  Prime Minister Erdogan used his vote on the U.N. Security Council to \noppose sanctions on Iran. He calls Iranian President Ahmadinejad a \nfriend, while turning away from those in Iran who would promote peace. \nHe has normalized relations with Syria, despite its support for \nterrorist groups Hezbollah and Hamas.\n  In fact, I was on a visit recently--last year--to Turkey with two \nother Senators. We joined the prime minister in his conference room. \nUpon sitting down, he forcefully declared that ``Hamas is not a \nterrorist organization.'' That is a deeply troubling statement from a \nmember of NATO.\n  Hamas has refused to accept the existence of Israel, a country of \nmore than 7 million people, while declaring threats to destroy the \ncountry. It has unleashed more than 10,000 rockets on Israeli \nneighborhoods and threatens to send thousands more.\n  This group has sent suicide bombers into Israel, who have killed not \nonly Israelis, but Americans also, including people from my State of \nNew Jersey.\n  What puzzles me most of all is how Prime Minister Erdogan refuses to \ncondemn Hamas for a terrorist organization for engaging in the same \nmurderous activity as the PKK. It doesn't add up. It challenges \nTurkey's standing across the world.\n  The PKK is so dangerous to the Turkish people, their economy, and \ntheir national well-being for the very same reasons that Hamas is \ndangerous to Israel.\n  The prime minister's alignment with the most radical forces in the \nMiddle East is a serious concern for all of us. But the situation is \nnot irreversible.\n  I hope that Prime Minister Erdogan changes course, rejects his drift \ntoward extremism, and embraces the moderate forces within Turkey and \nacross the Middle East. If Turkey wants the standing and respect that a \nbalanced democratic nation earns, it has to treat all peaceful nations \nthe same and terrorists with disdain.\n  I was in Turkey some years ago when the PKK--primarily of Kurdish \npopulation--was thought to be a concern, but not particularly active in \nthe terrorism that I saw, anyway, in my visit there. But we saw them \nthen putting people in prison because they differed in opinion with the \ngovernment. I thought that was a sign of censorship that didn't fit the \npicture, but they knew that in the Kurdish community, there was a lot \nof resistance to what the Turkish Government was doing.\n  Now we see that Turkey has 30,000 troops chasing the PKK on the \nborder near Iraq. So it is hard to understand how a nation that has the \npower that Turkey could have in the Middle East--and in the world \ngenerally--is falling prey to identifying one group as friendly and \nanother group--or one group as terrorists in one place and a good-\nmeaning organization in another. Hamas is a terrorist organization, and \neverybody knows it. They have overtaken the Gaza, and they control all \nthe flow of everything there--arms, et cetera--and maintain an arsenal \nwith which to attack Israel.\n  We have to let Turkey know this is not a good way for us to continue \nan alliance. We have an interest in balance and respect for the \ncountries in the Middle East. So I hope we can continue a long-time, \nclose relationship with this great country and long-time friend.\n  I close with a wish that in Turkey they will take a second look at \nthe policies they are currently condoning and join with us in the fight \nagainst terrorism.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today with a very urgent and \ncritical situation from my home State and the home State of the \nPresiding Officer and for our Great Lakes in general.\n  We are just finding out today that a commercial fisherman, contracted \nby the government to do routine sampling of areas leading into the \nGreat Lakes and Lake Michigan, caught a 34-inch, 20-pound Asian carp in \nLake Calumet, approximately 6 miles downstream from Lake Michigan, past \nthe barriers, and on its way to Lake Michigan. This is the first Asian \ncarp found past the electric barriers. It represents a very serious \nrisk to the Great Lakes' ecosystem and, frankly, to our way of life in \nthe Great Lakes region. These fish are huge, and they are able to \ninvade the Great Lakes. They could easily destroy our $7 billion \nfishing industry and our $16 billion recreational boating industry. \nInvasive species in the Great Lakes have already contributed to \nsignificant declines in fish populations. The Asian carp could \ncompletely unwind the food chain, with devastating effects for our \nexisting fish populations. We heard in testimony before my Subcommittee \non Water and Power that these fish, which can get up to 90 or 100 \npounds, effectively have no stomach. They eat all the time. They eat up \neverything in the food chain, leaving other fish to die throughout the \nGreat Lakes. It is extremely serious.\n  We have been working on this issue for a number of years with \nelectric fencing and most recently poisoning a part of the waters in \nthe Chicago channels to determine whether there are any of these Asian \ncarp that have come up the Mississippi River and into the Illinois \nRiver. At the time, they didn't find anything. Unfortunately, today \nthey did, and it was well past the electric barriers and fences for the \nfirst time.\n  Let me share with you one story from a few years ago that reflects \nwhat\n\n[[Page S5305]]\n\nhappens if these huge fish get into our precious Great Lakes. In 2003, \na woman named Mary Poplett, from Peoria, IL, decided to enjoy some warm \nOctober weather with a little jet skiing on the Illinois River. As she \ncruised the waves, the sound of her ski's motor excited a 30-pound \nAsian carp swimming under the water, which then leapt up and crashed \ninto her. Imagine being hit in the face by a bowling ball. That is how \nshe referred to it. She was knocked unconscious. She broke her nose, \nfractured a vertebrae, and she would have drowned if other boaters in \nthe area had not gotten to her in time. Imagine that. Imagine that \nhappening over and over again in Lake Michigan, in Lake Superior, and \naround our Great Lakes. I can't imagine it. I don't want to imagine it.\n  Mary is not alone. Since Asian carp were introduced to control algae \nin catfish ponds down South in the 1970s, the carp have spread at a \nvery rapid pace, causing injuries, destroying ecosystems, and \nthreatening entire industries. Now that an Asian carp has been found so \nclose to Lake Michigan, it better be a huge wake-up call that we have \nto act swiftly to contain this threat.\n  Despite everyone's best efforts, this situation we find ourselves in \nis calling for very decisive action. I have introduced legislation to \nclose the locks until we have a permanent solution. This has also been \nintroduced in the House by my colleague, Congressman Camp, and others, \nand I today urge in the strongest possible terms that the Army Corps \nclose the locks between the rivers and Lake Michigan now--now, today--\nwhile they continue to determine the best way to permanently separate \nthe Chicago area waterway system from the Great Lakes.\n  We know we need additional monitoring and sampling of resources \napplied to the area. I appreciate that last December, when there was \nfish DNA found above the locks, the administration worked with us very \nquickly to redirect resources to the Army Corps to take some immediate \nactions at that time. But now it is not just DNA from a dead fish. Now \nit is a live fish, and it is beyond the electric barrier. It is on its \nway in open waters into our Great Lakes, and we have to act decisively \nand immediately to protect our waters while a long-term solution is \nfound.\n  Again, I urge the Army Corps of Engineers and the other agencies \ninvolved to take this finding very seriously and to act with the same \ntremendous urgency that all of us who represent Great Lakes States feel \nto prevent further encroachment by these Asian carp into our Great \nLakes. This isn't just the economy, it is not just boating, and it is \nnot just fishing; it really is our way of life in the Great Lakes. \nDespite efforts that have gone on for years to stop the fish, that \nhasn't happened, and now we have to take very decisive action to close \nthe locks immediately so we can determine how best, in the long term, \nto solve this problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to inform the Senate of the \naccomplishments of Mississippi's Sumrall High School varsity baseball \nteam. Earlier this year, the Bobcats set a Mississippi record by \nwinning 67 consecutive games and winning their third straight State \nchampionship, an impressive achievement worthy of recognition.\n  The team fell just eight wins shy of breaking the national record for \nconsecutive wins and secured their spot as the team with the Nation's \nfourth longest winning streak. Some teams might have been discouraged \nafter a loss ended such an impressive streak, but the Bobcats regrouped \nand went on to win their final 11 games and their third consecutive \nClass 3-A State Championship.

The plan would be to complete tabling the Baucus \namendment, and then the plan would be to recess subject to the call of \nthe Chair. At that time, Senator Baucus would lay down the amendment. \nIt is not ready. That is why we are not doing it now.

Mr. President, the State of West Virginia and the Nation's \ncoal industry lost a very good man last week, and I lost a good friend. \nMr. Stephen Young, a native of Buckhannon, WV, who had been the vice \npresident of government affairs at Consol Energy for more than three \ndecades, passed away on June 15th.\n  Steve and I worked together to protect and promote the best interests \nof coal, a vital form of energy which has helped make our country \nstrong, and on which our Nation depends. I always, I repeat, always, \nfound Steve Young to be a friendly and cooperative person with whom to \nwork, as well as a decent and considerate man. Steve was a gentleman. \nHe was soft spoken, effective in everything he did, and respected and \nliked by all.\n  Steve was the director of State operations for Consol Energy. He had \nalso been president of the West Virginia Coal Association and had \nserved on the Board of Directors of a number of other State coal \nassociations. He also served on the board of directors of the West \nVirginia Chamber of Commerce and was a member of its executive \ncommittee. As a tribute to his talents, a few years ago, Steve was \nelected to the West Virginia Coal Hall of Fame.\n  Mr. Young was simply devoted to the coal industry, to the progress of \nWest Virginia, his home State which he loved dearly, and to his family. \nI will certainly miss him and his vast experience and expertise.\n  I extend my heart felt condolences to his wife Maureen, his children \nand grandchildren, and his sister.\n\n                           Scent of the Roses\n\n     Let fate do her worst, there are relics of joy,\n     Bright dreams of the past that she cannot destroy,\n     That come in the night-time of sorrow and care,\n     And bring back the features that joy used to wear.\n\n     Long, long be my heart with such memories filled,\n     Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled,\n     You may break, you may shatter the vase if you will,\n     But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.--Thomas \n           Moore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/23/senate-section/article/S5311-4", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5311-S5312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION AGAINST IMPUNITY IN GUATEMALA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on June 7, the head of the International \nCommission against Impunity in Guatemala, CICIG, a U.N. supported body \nset up to investigate organized crime and clandestine groups in \nGuatemala, resigned. In a press conference, he highlighted problems \nwith Guatemala's newly selected attorney general, who he accused of \ntrying to undermine the Commission's investigations. He also described \na general lack of cooperation from the Guatemalan Government in CICIG's \nmission.\n  Not long ago, on April 5, I spoke in this Chamber of Guatemala's need \nfor an attorney general with the integrity, experience, courage and \ndetermination to show that justice can be a reality for all the people \nof Guatemala regardless of race, ethnicity, gender or economic status. \nUnfortunately, President Colom's choice fell short on all counts.\n  This concerns me greatly. The Commission was created three years ago, \nat the request of the Guatemalan Government and with the approval of \nthe legislature. It was intended to support Guatemala in investigating \nand dismantling powerful criminal networks deeply entrenched in state \ninstitutions and to help strengthen the capacity of the country's \ndysfunctional judicial system. Since its creation, CICIG has received \nsubstantial political and financial backing from the international \ncommunity, including the United States. I have been a strong supporter \nof the Commission, and I was encouraged that the Guatemalan Government \nand the legislature had the political courage to back a serious effort \nto challenge the organized criminal structures that threaten \nGuatemala's fragile democracy.\n  Under the leadership of internationally respected Spanish jurist and \nprosecutor Carlos Castresana, the CICIG, with dedicated Guatemalan \npersonnel from the Public Ministry, the police, and the support of the \ncourts, has made significant, indeed historic, progress in combating \norganized crime and ending impunity. Its work has led to the successful \ninvestigation of high-profile cases, the arrest of dozens of government \nofficials and ex-military officers, and the purge of thousands of \npolice officers linked to illegal groups.\n  Having seen that progress, I was saddened to learn of Director \nCastresana's resignation. I commend him, the Commission's staff, and \nthe many Guatemalans who have supported the CICIG for their courage and \nresolve.\n  The CICIG is a ground-breaking effort and one of the few successful \nstrategies in the fight against organized crime and rampant \ninstitutional corruption in Guatemala. Its efforts must continue. Both \nthe U.N. and the Guatemalan Government need to act swiftly\n\n[[Page S5312]]\n\nand decisively if the CICIG is to continue as a meaningful body. I urge \nU.N. Secretary General Ban Ki Moon to appoint a new CICIG Commissioner \nwith demonstrated expertise in investigating and prosecuting organized \ncriminal networks so the advances of the CICIG continue under new \nleadership. Equally important is the integrity and continuity of \nCICIG's professional staff.\n  In Guatemala, the government needs to address the problems that so \nfrustrated Director Castresana. Fortunately, Guatemala's Constitutional \nCourt annulled the selection of the attorney general, who subsequently \nresigned. This is a positive step, but it needs to be followed up. \nGuatemala's next attorney general should have a strong commitment to \nworking closely with and supporting the efforts of the CICIG, as well \nas reform of the National Police, the establishment of a high impact \ncourt for cases of organized crime with heightened security for judges, \nwitnesses and prosecutors, a maximum security jail, and other \ninitiatives by the Guatemalan Legislature that would facilitate the \ninvestigation and prosecution of organized crime.\n  It is not just the attorney general, however. Implementation of many \nof the CICIG's recommendations has been repeatedly delayed. The entire \nGuatemalan Government--the executive, legislature and the courts--must \nact decisively to demonstrate that it can implement urgent anti-\nimpunity reforms, strengthen and professionalize its law enforcement \nand judicial institutions, and prove that it can be a partner in the \nfight against organized crime.

Mr. President, today, the Obama administration took \nanother step toward ensuring equal treatment for all Americans by \nextending family leave to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender--\nLGBT--employees. Earlier this year, I praised President Obama for \ndirecting the Department of Health and Human Services to issue \nregulations ensuring hospital visitation rights for same-sex couples. \nNow these same couples will be treated fairly when their children are \nsick, injured, or in need of care. Both of these measures promote the \nvalue of strong families and enduring relationships.\n  There is a tragic history of discrimination in the workplace, but \nfortunately, we are making progress to end it. In 1993, Congress passed \nthe Family Medical Leave Act, FMLA, allowing employees to take \nreasonable unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons. The \nFMLA sought to promote equal employment opportunities for men and \nwomen. Unfortunately, the benefits of that law were not extended to \nLGBT families. Under the Department of Labor's new interpretation of \n``son or daughter'' under the FMLA, a gay or lesbian employee may now \ntake family and medical leave to care for a newly born, newly adopted, \nor sick child of the employee's same-sex partner, even if the employee \ndoes not have a biological or legal relationship with the child.\n  The fight for equal rights protections continues in Congress. I am a \nproud cosponsor of the bipartisan Domestic Partnership Benefits and \nObligations Act of 2009, which would provide domestic partners of \nFederal employees all of the protections and benefits afforded to \nspouses of Federal employees, including participation in applicable \nretirement programs, compensation for work injuries, and health \ninsurance benefits. I also support the Tax Equity for Health Plan \nBeneficiaries Act of 2009, which would end the taxation of health \nbenefits provided to domestic partners in workplaces that provide \ndomestic partner health benefits to their employees.\n  Respecting the rights of all hardworking Americans to care for their \nchildren in times of crisis is something every American should support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/23/senate-section/article/S5312-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

True to their \nreputation as a team of great resolve and determination, the Lakers \novercame a deficit in the last quarter of the deciding game in order to \nensure that the NBA championship trophy will reside in Los Angeles for \nat least another year.\n  It is my pleasure to congratulate the members of the Lakers \norganization who worked tirelessly to bring the championship to Los \nAngeles and Southern California.\n  As the Los Angeles Lakers and their fans celebrate the 2009-2010 \nchampionship campaign, I congratulate them on another remarkable and \nmemorable season and wish them continued success in future seasons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/23/senate-section/article/S5312-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS ATHLETES AND COACHES\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, the Senate Rules Committee \nheld another important hearing today to review yet another example of \nhow the Senate rules are abused. I want to thank Chairman Schumer again \nfor holding these hearings--they have been\n\n[[Page S5313]]\n\ninvaluable in exploring ways to make the Senate work better for our \ncountry.\n  Over the past few months during this series of hearings, we have \ndiscussed and debated example after example of how the filibuster in \nparticular--and the Senate's incapacitating rules in general--too often \nstand in the way of achieving real progress for the American people.\n  Today's hearing topic--secret holds and the confirmation process--was \njust one more example of how manipulation of the rules continues to \nfoster a level of gridlock and obstruction unlike any we have seen \nbefore.\n  Senators Wyden, Grassley, and McCaskill testified at the hearing \nabout their efforts to end the practice of secret holds. I applaud \ntheir work and dedication to transparency in government. Their fight to \nend the practice of secret holds is a worthy one that I wholeheartedly \nsupport.\n  Earlier this year I was proud to sign on to Senator McCaskill's \nletter to the majority and minority leaders, in which we pledged to no \nlonger place anonymous holds and asked for Senate leadership to end the \npractice altogether.\n  At today's hearing, Senator McCaskill said that she has gathered \nenough support to surpass the 67-vote threshold required to consider \nand amend the Senate rules. That is no small task, as everyone in the \nSenate would attest. She should be congratulated for her work, as \nshould all of our colleagues--Democrat and Republican--who have signed \non to this effort. This bipartisan effort is proof that we are capable \nof working together.\n  But the mere fact that we have to have this conversation, that \nSenator McCaskill had to work for months for 67 votes to change rules \nthat the Constitution clearly authorizes us to do with a simple \nmajority vote, illustrates that secret holds are just another symptom \nof a much larger problem.\n  That problem is the Senate rules themselves.\n  The current rules--specifically rules V and XXII--effectively deny a \nmajority of the Senate the opportunity to ever change its rules. This \nis something the drafters of the Constitution never intended.\n  As I have explained numerous times in committee hearings and here on \nthe floor, a simple majority of the Senate can adopt or amend its rules \nat the beginning of a new Congress because it is not bound by the rules \nof the previous Congress.\n  Many colleagues, as well as constitutional scholars, agree with me. \nAs my esteemed colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, stated in a National \nReview article in 2005:\n\n       The Senate has been called a `continuing body.' Yet \n     language reflecting this observation was included in Senate \n     rules only in 1959. The more important, and much older, sense \n     in which the Senate is a continuing body is its ongoing \n     constitutional authority to determine its rules. Rulings by \n     vice presidents of both parties, sitting as the President of \n     the Senate, confirm that each Senate may make that decision \n     for itself, either implicitly by acquiescence or explicitly \n     by amendment. Both conservative and liberal legal scholars, \n     including those who see no constitutional problems with the \n     current filibuster campaign, agree that a simple majority can \n     change Senate rules at the beginning of a new Congress.\n\n  It is through this path--by a majority vote at the beginning of the \nnext Congress--that we can reform the abuse of holds, secret \nfilibusters, and the broken confirmation process. We can end the need \nfor multiple cloture votes on the same matter, and we can instead begin \nto focus on the important business at hand.\n  Now, critics will argue that the two-thirds vote requirement for \ncloture on a rules change is reasonable. They'll say that Senator \nMcCaskill managed to gather 67 Senators, so it must be an achievable \nthreshold.\n  As I said at today's hearing, I commend Senator McCaskill for her \ndiligence in building support to end secret holds. But I think it is \nalso important to understand that other crucial reform efforts have \nfailed because, inexplicably, it takes the same number of Senators to \namend our rules as it takes to amend the U.S. Constitution.\n  As Senators Wyden and Grassley said in their testimony today, their \nefforts to end secret holds goes back more than a decade. Indeed, the \neffect of holds, on both legislation and the confirmation of nominees, \nis hardly a new problem.\n  In January 1979, Senator Byrd--then majority leader--proposed \nchanging the Senate rules to limit debate to 30 minutes on a motion to \nproceed. Doing so would have significantly weakened the power of \nholds--and thus curbed their abuse.\n  At the time, Leader Byrd took to the Senate Floor and said that \nunlimited debate on a motion to proceed, ``makes the majority leader \nand the majority party the subject of the control and the will of the \nminority. If I move to take up a matter, then one senator can hold up \nthe Senate for as long as he can stand on his feet.'' Despite the \nmoderate change that Senator Byrd proposed, it did not have the \nnecessary 67 votes to overcome a filibuster.\n  Efforts to reform the motion to proceed have continued since.\n  In 1984, a bipartisan study group recommended placing a 2-hour limit \non debate of a motion to proceed. That recommendation was ignored.\n  And in 1993, Congress convened the Joint Committee on the \nOrganization of Congress to determine how it can be a better \ninstitution. Senator Pete Domenici, my immediate predecessor, was the \nco-vice chairman of the committee. At a hearing before the committee, \nhe said, ``If we abolish [the debatable motion to proceed], we have \ngone a long way to diffusing the validity of holds, because a hold is \npredicated on the fact that you can't get [a bill] up without a \nfilibuster.''\n  The final report of that joint committee stated: ``There was \nsignificant agreement that the motion to proceed to a bill should not \nbe debatable, or that debate on the motion should be limited to 2 \nhours.'' Despite the recommendation, nothing came of it.\n  And here we are again today--31 years after Senator Byrd tried to \ninstitute a reform that members of both parties have agreed is \nnecessary.\n  Talking about change, and reform, does not solve the problem. We can \nhold hearings, convene bipartisan committees, and study the problem to \ndeath. But until we agree that the Constitution provides the right for \neach Senate to adopt its rules of proceedings by a simple majority \nvote, there will be no real reform.\n  Recognizing our constitutional right to change Senate rules by a \nmajority will not only allow reform, but it will help prevent abuse. \nMembers are less likely to abuse a rule if they know that it can be \nchanged by a majority in the next Congress. Conversely, if they think \nit takes 67 votes to change the rule, there is no disincentive against \nabuse.\n  I look forward to future hearings in the Rules Committee and \nexploring ways that we can bring needed reform to the Senate at the \nbeginning of the 112th Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an April 19 Roll Call article titled, \n``In Senate, Motion to Proceed' Should be Non-Debatable'' and Senator \nHatch's 2005 article from the National Review Online be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Roll Call, Apr. 19, 2010]\n\n   Stevenson: In Senate,``Motion To Proceed'' Should Be Non-Debatable\n\n                       (By Charles A. Stevenson)\n\n       There's a simple step the Senate could take that would \n     prevent a lot of the current delay and obstruction, while \n     still permitting lawmakers to debate some controversial \n     matters at length.\n       The ``motion to proceed'' should be made non-debatable and \n     subject to an immediate majority-rule vote.\n       This may seem like an arcane parliamentary matter, but in \n     practice the chance to kill a bill or nomination before it is \n     open to debate and amendment is a key weapon in the hands of \n     obstructionists. They don't even have to oppose the measure; \n     they just argue that ``now is not the time'' to take it up. \n     In fact, in the past 20 years, more than one-fourth of the \n     cloture petitions to end debate have been on motions to \n     proceed.\n       Maybe the Senate, under pressure from voters and stymied by \n     the recent surge in filibusters, will change or repeal the \n     current rule that requires a 60-vote supermajority to cut off \n     debate. But that isn't likely, since it takes 67 votes to \n     change the rules and since all Senators can envision \n     circumstances when they might want to fight even though \n     outnumbered.\n       Even if lawmakers eliminated the 60-vote rule, \n     obstructionists would retain numerous tools to block or delay \n     action.\n       A compromise might be found on the motion to proceed, which \n     would have substantial additional benefits while still \n     preserving\n\n[[Page S5314]]\n\n     the right of extended debate on substantive matters.\n       Right now, the motion to take up legislation is non-\n     debatable only in very special circumstances: if the Senate \n     has adjourned rather than recessing at the end of the \n     previous day, if it has a period of morning business the next \n     day and if it is in the second hour of the session. Even \n     then, the bill goes back to the calendar if debate continues \n     at the end of morning business.\n       The biggest problem in the Senate's current rules isn't \n     that the majority can't work its will, but that a handful of \n     Senators can clog the legislative stream, preventing action \n     even on broadly supported measures.\n       Cutting off debate requires a day's wait after the first \n     cloture petition is filed, and then 30 more hours of debate \n     even if cloture is invoked. This means that the leadership \n     needs at least four days just to end debate on the motion to \n     proceed, plus many more on controversial amendments.\n       Four days on one measure is four days that can't be devoted \n     to other matters--and the Senate has averaged only 167 days \n     in session each year this decade.\n       Making the motion to proceed non-debatable would not only \n     reduce the opportunities for filibusters but would also end \n     the practice of individual ``holds'' on bills and \n     nominations.\n       Those holds aren't in the rules, but they are the result of \n     rules that require, for example, the Senate to take up bills \n     and nominations in the order they were added to the \n     calendar--that is, oldest first, with more urgent matters or \n     more recent versions delayed until all previous matters have \n     been disposed of.\n       A non-debatable motion to proceed could still be rejected \n     by majority vote, and a matter being debated could still be \n     filibustered, but the opponents would have to muster their \n     troops, whereas now a single Member can hold the whole Senate \n     hostage.\n       There are other rules changes that the Senate might adopt \n     to have a more orderly and businesslike legislative process.\n       It could change the rule (XIX) that requires that ``all \n     debate shall be germane and confined to the specific question \n     then pending before the Senate'' for only the first three \n     hours and it could enforce more rigorously the section of \n     that rule that ``no Senator shall speak more than twice upon \n     any one question in debate on the same legislative day.''\n       Senators could also drop the provision saying that the \n     rules continue from one Congress to another unless changed by \n     a two-thirds vote. That was added in 1959 under pressure from \n     Senators fighting civil rights bills in order to overturn a \n     ruling that would have allowed each new Congress to adopt \n     rules by majority vote--as the House of Representatives does \n     every two years.\n       But if Senators are unwilling to change the basic rule on \n     filibusters, they should at least make the motion to proceed \n     non-debatable so that the Senate can get to work without \n     petty delays.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the National Review Online, Jan. 12, 2005]\n\n Crisis Mode: A Fair and Constitutional Option To Beat the Filibuster \n                                  Game\n\n                      (By Senator Orrin G. Hatch)\n\n       Judicial nominations will be one of the most important \n     issues facing the Senate in the 109th Congress and the \n     question is whether we will return to the tradition of giving \n     nominations reaching the Senate floor an up or down vote. The \n     filibusters used to block such votes have mired the judicial-\n     confirmation process in a political and constitutional crisis \n     that undermines democracy, the judiciary, the Senate, and the \n     Constitution. The Senate has in the past changed its \n     procedures to rebalance the minority's right to debate and \n     the majority's right to decide and it must do so again.\n       Newspaper editorials condemning the filibusters outnumber \n     supporting ones by more than six-to-one. Last November, South \n     Dakotans retired former Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, \n     in no small part, because he led the filibuster forces. Yet \n     within hours of his election to succeed Senator Daschle as \n     Minority Leader, Senator Harry Reid took to the Senate floor \n     to defend them. Hope is fading that the shrinking Democratic \n     minority will abandon its destructive course of using \n     filibusters to defeat majority supported judicial \n     nominations. Their failure to do so will require a deliberate \n     solution.\n\n\n                         DIAGNOSING THE CRISIS\n\n       If these filibusters were part of the Senate's historical \n     practice or, as a recent NRO editorial put it, merely made \n     confirming nominees more difficult, a deliberate solution \n     might not be warranted. But this is a crisis, not a problem \n     of inconvenience.\n       Senate rules reflect an emphasis on deliberation and \n     debate. Either by unanimous agreement or at least 60 votes on \n     a motion to invoke cloture under Rule 22, the Senate must end \n     debate before it can vote on anything. From the Spanish \n     filibustero, a filibuster was a mercenary who tries to \n     destabilize a government. A filibuster occurs most plainly on \n     the Senate floor when efforts to end debate fail, either by \n     objection to unanimous consent or defeat of a cloture motion. \n     During the 108th Congress, Senate Democrats defeated ten \n     majority-supported nominations to the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     by objecting to every unanimous consent request and defeating \n     every cloture motion. This tactic made good on then-\n     Democratic Leader Tom Daschle's February 2001 vow to use \n     ``whatever means necessary'' to defeat judicial nominations. \n     These filibusters are unprecedented, unfair, dangerous, \n     partisan, and unconstitutional.\n\n\n                           A POLITICAL CRISIS\n\n       These are the first filibusters in American history to \n     defeat majority supported judicial nominations. Before the \n     108th Congress, 13 of the 14 judicial nominations on which \n     the Senate took a cloture vote were confirmed. President \n     Johnson withdrew the 1968 nomination of Abe Fortas to be \n     Supreme Court chief justice the day after a failed cloture \n     vote showed the nomination did not have clear majority \n     support. In contrast, Democrats have now crossed the \n     confirmation Rubicon by using the filibuster to defeat \n     judicial nominations which enjoy clear majority support.\n       Focusing on President Clinton's judicial nominations in \n     1999, I described what has been the Senate's historical \n     standard for judicial nominations: ``Let's make our case if \n     we have disagreement, and then vote.'' Democrats' new \n     filibusters abandons this tradition and is unfair to senators \n     who must provide the ``advice and consent'' the Constitution \n     requires of them through a final up or down vote. It is also \n     unfair to nominees who have agreed, often at personal and \n     financial sacrifice, to judicial service only to face \n     scurrilous attacks, trumped up charges, character \n     assassination, and smear campaigns. They should not also be \n     held in permanent filibuster limbo. Senators can vote for or \n     against any judicial nominee for any reason, but senators \n     should vote.\n       These unprecedented and unfair filibusters are distorting \n     the way the Senate does business. Before the 108th Congress, \n     cloture votes were used overwhelmingly for legislation rather \n     than nominations. The percentage of cloture votes used for \n     judicial nominations jumped a whopping 900 percent during \n     President Bush's first term from the previous 25 years since \n     adoption of the current cloture rule. And before the 108th \n     Congress, the few cloture votes on judicial nominations were \n     sometimes used to ensure up or down votes. Even on \n     controversial nominees such as Richard Paez and Marsha \n     Berzon, we invoked cloture to ensure that we would vote on \n     confirmation. We did, and both are today sitting federal \n     judges. In contrast, these new Democratic filibusters are \n     designed to prevent, rather than secure, an up or down vote \n     and to ensure that targeted judicial nominations are defeated \n     rather than debated.\n       These filibusters are also completely partisan. The average \n     tally on cloture votes during the 108th Congress was 53-43, \n     enough to confirm but not enough to invoke cloture and end \n     debate. Democrats provided every single vote against \n     permitting an up or down vote. In fact, Democrats have cast \n     more than 92 percent of all votes against cloture on judicial \n     nominations in American history.\n\n\n                        A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS\n\n       Unprecedented, unfair, and partisan filibusters that \n     distort Senate procedures constitute a political crisis. By \n     trying to use Rule 22's cloture requirement to change the \n     Constitution's confirmation requirement, these Democratic \n     filibusters also constitute a constitutional crisis.\n       The Constitution gives the Senate authority to determine \n     its procedural rules. More than a century ago, however, the \n     Supreme Court unanimously recognized the obvious maxim that \n     those rules may not ``ignore constitutional restraints.'' The \n     Constitution explicitly requires a supermajority vote for \n     such things as trying impeachments or overriding a \n     presidential veto; it does not do so for confirming \n     nominations. Article II, Section 2, even mentions ratifying \n     treaties and confirming nominees in the very same sentence, \n     requiring a supermajority for the first but not for the \n     second. Twisting Senate rules to create a confirmation \n     supermajority undermines the Constitution. As Senator Joseph \n     Lieberman once argued, it amounts to ``an amendment of the \n     Constitution by rule of the U.S. Senate.''\n       But don't take my word for it. The same senators leading \n     the current filibuster campaign once argued that all \n     filibusters are unconstitutional. Senator Lieberman argued in \n     1995 that a supermajority requirement for cloture has ``no \n     constitutional basis.'' Senator Tom Harkin insisted that \n     ``the filibuster rules are unconstitutional'' because ``the \n     Constitution sets out . . . when you need majority or \n     supermajority votes in the Senate.'' And former Senator \n     Daschle said that because the Constitution ``is \n     straightforward about the few instances in which more than a \n     majority of the Congress must vote. . . . Democracy means \n     majority rule, not minority gridlock.'' He later applied this \n     to judicial nomination filibusters: ``I find it simply \n     baffling that a Senator would vote against even voting on a \n     judicial nomination.'' That each of these senators voted for \n     every judicial-nomination filibuster during the 108th \n     Congress is baffling indeed.\n       These senators argued that legislative as well as \n     nomination filibusters are unconstitutional. Filibusters of \n     legislation, however, are different and solving the current \n     crisis does not require throwing the entire filibuster baby \n     out with the judicial nomination bathwater. The Senate's \n     authority to determine its own rules is greatest regarding \n     what is most completely within its jurisdiction, namely, \n     legislation. And legislative filibusters have a long history. \n     Rule 22 itself did not even potentially apply to nominations \n     until decades after its adoption. Neither America's founders, \n     nor the Senate that\n\n[[Page S5315]]\n\n     adopted Rule 22 to address legislative gridlock, ever \n     imagined that filibusters would be used to highjack the \n     judicial appointment process.\n\n\n                      TRYING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT\n\n       Liberal interest groups, and many in the mainstream media, \n     eagerly repeat Democratic talking points trying to change, \n     rather than address, the subject. For example, they claim \n     that, without the filibuster, the Senate would be nothing \n     more than a ``rubberstamp'' for the president's judicial \n     nominations. Losing a fair fight, however, does not \n     rubberstamp the winner; giving up without a fight does. \n     Active opposition to a judicial nomination, especially \n     expressed through a negative vote, is the best remedy against \n     being a rubberstamp.\n       They also try to change the definition of a filibuster. On \n     March 11, 2003, for example, Senator Patrick Leahy, ranking \n     Judiciary Committee Democrat, used a chart titled \n     ``Republican Filibusters of Nominees.'' Many individuals on \n     the list, however, are today sitting federal judges, some \n     confirmed after invoking cloture and others without taking a \n     cloture vote at all. Invoking cloture and confirming \n     nominations is no precedent for not invoking cloture and \n     refusing to confirm nominations.\n       Many senators once opposed the very judicial nomination \n     filibusters they now embrace. Senator Leahy, for example, \n     said in 1998: ``I have stated over and over again. . .that I \n     would object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, \n     whether it is somebody I opposed or supported.'' Since then, \n     he has voted against cloture on judicial nominations 21 out \n     of 26 times. Senator Ted Kennedy, a former chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee, said in 1995 that ``Senators who believe \n     in fairness will not let a minority of the Senate deny [the \n     nominee] his vote by the entire Senate.'' Since then, he has \n     voted to let a minority of the Senate deny judicial nominees \n     a vote 18 out of 23 times.\n       Let me put my own record on the table. I have never voted \n     against cloture on a judicial nomination. I opposed \n     filibusters of Carter and Clinton judicial nominees, Reagan \n     and Bush judicial nominees, all judicial nominees. Along with \n     then-Majority Leader Trent Lott, I repeatedly warned that \n     filibustering Clinton judicial nominees would be a \n     ``travesty'' and helped make sure that every Clinton judicial \n     nomination reaching the full Senate received a final \n     confirmation decision. That should be the permanent standard, \n     no matter which party controls the Senate or occupies the \n     White House.\n\n\n                           SOLVING THE CRISIS\n\n       The Senate has periodically faced the situation where the \n     minority's right to debate has improperly overwhelmed the \n     majority's right to decide. And we have changed our \n     procedures in a way that preserves the minority's right to \n     debate, and even to filibuster legislation, while solving the \n     crisis at hand.\n       The Senate's first legislative rules, adopted in 1789, \n     directly reflected majority rule. Rule 8 allowed a simple \n     majority to ``move the previous question'' and proceed to \n     vote on a pending matter. Invoked only three times in 17 \n     years, however, Rule 8 was dropped in the Senate rules \n     revision of 1806, meaning unanimous consent was then \n     necessary to end debate. Dozens of reform efforts during the \n     19th century tried to rein in the minority's abuse of the \n     right to debate. In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson described \n     what had become of majority rule: ``The Senate of the United \n     States is the only legislative body in the world which cannot \n     act when its majority is ready for action. . . . The only \n     remedy is that the rules of the Senate shall be altered.'' \n     Leadership turned gridlock into reform, and that year the \n     Senate adopted Rule 22, by which \\2/3\\ of Senators present \n     and voting could invoke cloture, or end debate, on a pending \n     measure.\n       Just as the minority abused the unanimous consent threshold \n     in the 19th century, the minority abused the \\2/3\\ threshold \n     in the 20th century. A resolution to reinstate the previous \n     question rule was introduced, and only narrowly defeated, \n     within a year of Rule 22's adoption. A steady stream of \n     reform attempts followed, and a series of modifications made \n     until the current 60-vote threshold was adopted in 1975. The \n     point is that the Senate has periodically rebalanced the \n     minority's right to debate and the majority's right to \n     decide. Today's crisis, with constitutional as well as \n     political dimensions and affecting all three branches of \n     government, presents an even more compelling case to do so.\n       These filibusters are an unprecedented shift in the kind, \n     not just the degree, of the minority's tactics. After a full, \n     fair, and vigorous debate on judicial nominations, a simple \n     majority must at some point be able to proceed to a vote. A \n     simple majority can achieve this goal either by actually \n     amending Rule 22 or by sustaining an appropriate \n     parliamentary ruling.\n\n\n                 A SIMPLE MAJORITY CAN CHANGE THE RULES\n\n       The Senate exercises its constitutional authority to \n     determine its procedural rules either implicitly or \n     explicitly. Once a new Congress begins, operating under \n     existing rules implicitly adopts them ``by acquiescence.'' \n     The Senate explicitly determines its rules by formally \n     amending them, and the procedure depends on its timing. After \n     Rule 22 has been adopted by acquiescence, it requires 67 \n     votes for cloture on a rules change. Before the Senate adopts \n     Rule 22 by acquiescence, however, ordinary parliamentary \n     rules apply and a simple majority can invoke cloture and \n     change Senate rules.\n       Some object to this conclusion by observing that, because \n     only a portion of its membership changes with each election, \n     the Senate has been called a ``continuing body.'' Yet \n     language reflecting this observation was included in Senate \n     rules only in 1959. The more important, and much older, sense \n     in which the Senate is a continuing body is its ongoing \n     constitutional authority to determine its rules. Rulings by \n     vice presidents of both parties, sitting as the President of \n     the Senate, confirm that each Senate may make that decision \n     for itself, either implicitly by acquiescence or explicitly \n     by amendment. Both conservative and liberal legal scholars, \n     including those who see no constitutional problems with the \n     current filibuster campaign, agree that a simple majority can \n     change Senate rules at the beginning of a new Congress.\n\n\n          A SIMPLE MAJORITY CAN UPHOLD A PARLIAMENTARY RULING\n\n       An alternative strategy involves a parliamentary ruling in \n     the context of considering an individual nomination. This \n     approach can be pursued at any time, and would not actually \n     amend Rule 22. The precedent it would set depends on the \n     specific ruling it produces and the facts of the situation in \n     which it arises.\n       Speculation, often inaccurate, abounds about how this \n     strategy would work. One newspaper, for example, offered a \n     common description that this approach would seek ``a ruling \n     from the Senate parliamentarian that the filibuster of \n     executive nominations is unconstitutional.'' Under long-\n     standing Senate parliamentary precedent, however, the \n     presiding officer does not decide such constitutional \n     questions but submits them to the full Senate, where they are \n     debatable and subject to Rule 22's 60-vote requirement. A \n     filibuster would then prevent solving this filibuster crisis. \n     Should the chair rule in favor of a properly framed non-\n     debatable point of order, Democrats would certainly appeal, \n     but the majority could still sustain the ruling by voting for \n     a non-debatable motion to table the appeal.\n       Democrats have threatened that, if the majority pursues a \n     deliberate solution to this political and constitutional \n     crisis, they will bring the entire Senate to a screeching \n     halt. Perhaps they see this as way to further escalate the \n     confirmation crisis, as the Senate cannot confirm judicial \n     nominations if it can do nothing at all. No one, however, \n     seriously believes that, if the partisan roles were reversed, \n     Democrats--the ones who once proposed abolishing even \n     legislative filibusters--would hesitate for a moment before \n     changing Senate procedures to facilitate consideration of \n     judicial nominations they favored.\n\n\n                      A FAMILIAR FORK IN THE ROAD\n\n       The United States Senate is a unique institution. Our rules \n     allowing for extended debate protect the minority's role in \n     the legislative process. We must preserve that role. The \n     current filibuster campaign against judicial nominations, \n     however, is the real attack on Senate tradition and an \n     unprecedented example of placing short-term advantage above \n     longstanding fundamental principles. It is not simply \n     annoying or frustrating, but a new and dangerous kind of \n     obstruction which threatens democracy, the Senate, the \n     judiciary, and even the Constitution itself. As such, it \n     requires a more serious and deliberate solution.\n       While judicial appointments can be politically contentious \n     and ideologically divisive, the confirmation process must \n     still be handled through a fair process that honors the \n     Constitution and Senate tradition. If the fight is fair and \n     constitutional, let the chips fall where they may. As it has \n     before, the Senate must change its procedures to properly \n     balance majority rule and extended debate. That way, we can \n     vigorously debate judicial nominations and still conduct the \n     people's business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/23/senate-section/article/S5315-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5315-S5316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        REMEMBERING REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS LUDLOW ``LUD'' ASHLEY\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, as we search for solutions to our \ntwin challenges in the housing and energy sectors, we should pause to \ncelebrate, remember, and learn from the life of a legislator who \nbrokered solutions to these very same problems more than 30 years ago \n``Lud'' Ashley, the distinguished gentlemen who represented the 9th \nCongressional District of Ohio.\n  Thomas Ludlow Ashley represented the Toledo area from 1955 until \n1981. He was a pragmatic progressive who knew how to broker a deal to \nmove the Nation forward.\n  He was tapped by the late Speaker Tip O'Neill to lead the effort to \ndevelop a bipartisan set of proposals to address the Nation's energy \ncrisis. His work laid the foundation for the passage of a series of \nbills that aimed to reduce our dependence on oil and spur the research \nand development of new, clean energy sources.\n  We could use his advice and counsel today.\n  Congressman Ashley made a profound difference in the well-being of \neveryday Americans. He was known as\n\n[[Page S5316]]\n\n``Mr. Housing'' for his leadership of the House Subcommittee on Housing \nand Community Development. In this role, he authored landmark pieces of \nlegislation in the Housing and Community Development Acts of 1974 and \n1977.\n  ``Americans sleep in better homes today because of Lud Ashley,'' \nSenator Ted Kennedy once said of Congressman Ashley.\n  As a legislator, Congressman Ashley continued the family legacy of \nfighting for equality. His great-grandfather, who represented Toledo in \nCongress during the Civil War era, co-authored the 13th amendment \nabolishing slavery. A century later, Lud Ashley worked tirelessly to \nsecure the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n  An Army veteran, who served in the Pacific during World War II, Lud \nAshley returned home to pursue his education. He earned degrees from \nYale University and the Ohio State University College of Law.\n  Hearing the call to public service, Lud Ashley ran and won the \nprivilege of representing the 9th Congressional District of Ohio in \n1954. His service was defined by a passionate but collegial devotion to \nliberal causes, one that earned him the respect and friendship of his \npeers on both sides of the aisle.\n  I hope that my colleagues will take a moment to honor the life and \nlegacy of Congressman Lud Ashley a great Ohioan and a great American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/23/senate-section/article/S5316-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ELGIN, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I recognize a community in \nNorth Dakota that will be celebrating its 100th anniversary. On July \n17-20, the residents of Elgin will gather to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Elgin, a Northern Pacific Railroad town site, was first named \nShanley, but became Elgin in 1910. The residents were having difficulty \nagreeing on a new name, and Isadore Gintzler is said to have looked at \nhis pocket watch to check the time at a very late hour, and suggested \nits brand name, Elgin, as a compromise name for the town site. Elgin \nwatches are made in Elgin, IL, which was named by founder James T. \nGifford for Elgin, Scotland. The post office was established August 11, \n1910. Elgin was incorporated as a village in 1911.\n  Some of the present day businesses and accommodations that continue \nto thrive within the city of Elgin include the Jacobson Memorial \nHospital Care Center and Clinics, Dakota Hill Housing, a dentist, an \neye clinic, a cafe and bowling alley, a grocery store, a hardware \nstore, gas stations, a bank, accounting offices, a drug store, \ninsurance agencies, a newspaper, the post office, a lumber yard, a \nmotel, a new public library, and grain elevators.\n  Citizens of Elgin have organized numerous activities to celebrate \ntheir centennial. Some of the activities include an opening ceremony, \nhistorical power point presentation, historical bus tour, musical \nentertainment, an alumni football game, a magician show, and an antique \nparade.\n  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Elgin, ND, and its \nresidents on the first 100 years and in wishing them well through the \nnext century. By honoring Elgin and all the other historic small towns \nof North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for \nfuture generations. It is places such as Elgin that have helped to \nshape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine \ncommunity is deserving of our recognition.\n  Elgin has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/23/senate-section/article/S5316-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ARKANSAS'S FARM BUREAU SCHOLARSHIP WINNERS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I congratulate eight \nArkansas college students who were recently selected as recipients of \nthis year's Arkansas Farm Bureau Foundation Scholarship Program. The \nstudents will receive $1,000 per semester for their agriculture studies \nin the 2010-2011 school year.\n  These young Arkansans represent the best of our State, and I am \npleased to see them receive this funding to advance their education and \nprepare them for their future agriculture careers. Agriculture is the \nbackbone of Arkansas's economy, creating more than 270,000 jobs in the \nState and providing $9.1 billion in wages and salaries. In total, \nagriculture contributes roughly $15.9 billion to the Arkansas economy \neach year.\n  To be eligible for the Farm Bureau scholarship, students must be \nArkansas residents, members of a Farm Bureau family, and enrolled as \njuniors or seniors in a State-accredited university. They must also \nmaintain a 2.5 grade-point-average and pursue an agriculture-related \ndegree. As a seventh generation Arkansan and farmer's daughter and as \nchairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I understand firsthand \nand appreciate the hard work and contributions of our farm families, \nand these students are quite deserving of this honor.\n  This year's scholarship recipients are:\n\n       Anna Elizabeth Buck, 21, of Delight, Pike County, daughter \n     of Ricky and Rebecca Buck. She is an agricultural business \n     major with a marketing minor at Southern Arkansas University \n     in Magnolia.\n       Laura Jones, 29, of Clinton, Washington County, daughter of \n     Rosemary and Willie Jones. She is an animal science/pre-vet \n     major at Arkansas State University in Jonesboro.\n       Mia Hand, 21, of Magnolia, Columbia County, daughter of \n     Rosanne Hand. She is an agricultural education major at \n     Southern Arkansas University in Magnolia.\n       Jaimie McMeechan, 23, of Gamaliel, Baxter County, daughter \n     of William and Shirley McMeechan. She is an agriculture \n     education major at Southern Arkansas University in Magnolia.\n       Jared McMillan, 20, of Pine Bluff, Jefferson County, son of \n     Dale and Teresa McMillan. He is an animal science major at \n     the University of Arkansas at Monticello.\n       Kevin Dale Morrison, 21, of Onyx, Yell County, son of \n     Vernon and Elise Morrison. He is an agriculture business \n     major with an emphasis in animal science at Arkansas Tech \n     University in Russelville.\n       Daniel Wade Walters, 20, of Fayetteville, Washington \n     County, son of Danny and Bonita Walters. He is an agriculture \n     business major at Arkansas Tech University in Russelville.\n       Fines ``Levi'' Hudson, 22, of Mt. Judea, Newton County, son \n     Richard and Anita Hudson.

MANGUN\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge \nReverend Gerald Archie ``G.A'' Mangun of Alexandria, LA, and to honor \nhis memory as an important spiritual leader to the citizens of central \nLouisiana. I would like to take some time to make a few remarks about \nhis legacy.\n  Reverend Mangun passed away Thursday, June 17, 2010, at the age of \n91. Reverend Mangun was born March 11, 1919, in LaPaz, IN. He was \nordained a minister in 1942 and spent the years before coming to \nAlexandria preaching across the country. He then came to Alexandria and \nwas elected pastor of the then-First United Pentecostal Church in 1950.\n  Reverend Mangun relentlessly dedicated himself to reaching out to his \ncommunity through his church. His church began small, with only 35 \nmembers, but with his unyielding dedication and inspiration it \ncontinued to grow. Today, the Pentecostal Church of Alexandria has a \ncongregation numbering more than 3,000. This growth in itself shows his \nspiritual leadership and positive influence in the State of Louisiana.\n  Through his leadership, the church grew to be an integral part of the \ncity of Alexandria and the State of Louisiana. His leadership, however, \nreached far beyond his own State. For example, Reverend Mangun raised \n1.13 million for mission work in 2009 alone. His impact in and outside \nof his own State and community have been remarkable.\n  Reverend Mangun suffered a stroke on May 28, 2010, and passed away on \nJune 17, 2010. His passing is a great loss to the State of Louisiana. \nHowever, his legacy will continue through the hearts and minds of \npeople he touched and influenced through his ministry. His impact \ncontinues to be felt today throughout the country and around the world \nthrough his ministry and mission work. Thus today, I am proud to honor \nReverend Gerald Archie Mangun for his service and leadership in his \ncommunity and in the State of Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S5317]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/23/senate-section/article/S5317-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:44 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution:\n\n       H.

A bill to reauthorize the Hollings Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program. I want to \nthank my cosponsors, Senators Snowe and Lieberman for their support of \nthis legislation and for their long-time support of this program.\n  For the last few years, there have been too many jobs lost, and the \nmanufacturing sector has been particularly\n\n[[Page S5321]]\n\nhard-hit. My home State of Wisconsin has been particularly hard hit--in \nthe last 10 years we have lost 168,000 manufacturing jobs, nearly a 30 \npercent drop in the manufacturing workforce.\n  Despite these struggles, our Nation remains the world's largest \nmanufacturing economy, and still employs a sizable percentage of our \nworkforce. We must continue to do better, and work harder for our \nmanufacturers. To put it simply, a strong manufacturing sector means a \nstrong economy. Retaining and creating manufacturing jobs grows our \nprosperity.\n  That is why the MEP remains a good investment for our country. The \nMEP is the only public-private program dedicated to providing technical \nsupport and services to small and medium-sized manufacturers, helping \nthem provide quality jobs for American workers. The MEP is a nationwide \nnetwork of proven resources that enables manufacturers to compete \nglobally, supports greater supply chain integration, and provides \naccess to information, training, and technologies that improve \nefficiency, productivity, and profitability.\n  MEP's results are undeniable. In fiscal year 2009 alone, based on \nservices provided in 2008, MEP projects with small and medium-sized \nmanufacturers created or retained 52,948 jobs nationwide, generated \nmore than $9.1 billion in sales, and provided cost savings of more than \n$1.4 billion.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, the results are just as impressive. \nWisconsin is home to two MEP Centers, and in the last year, Wisconsin \ncompanies that worked with the two centers were able to save or create \nmore than 1,200 jobs, generate $118.6 million in sales, make $54 \nmillion in new investments, and generate $19.3 million in cost savings.\n  Our small- and medium-sized manufacturers face different challenges \nthan larger companies, especially in this tough economy. The \nimprovements that come to a business from working with an MEP Center \ncan mean the difference between profitability and growth or shutting \ntheir doors. It is vital that we support our manufacturers, and so it \nis equally vital that we continue strong support for MEP.\n  The bill I have introduced today reauthorizes the MEP program for 5 \nyears, through fiscal year 2015, and authorizes $825 million for the \nbase program over those 5 years. This increase is in line with what \nPresident Obama called for in his budget and is a reasonable amount of \ngrowth at a time when we must scrutinize all Federal investments.\n  The bill also includes Senator Snowe's legislation to change the \ncost-share percentage for MEP Centers to fully-access Federal funding. \nAt a time of tight State budgets, and at a time when manufacturers have \nless funding to pay for MEP services, MEP Centers are finding it harder \nand harder to meet the current 2/3 cost-share requirement. The time \nthey must take to meet this requirement takes away from their time with \nmanufacturers. The bill changes the cost share to 50/50--in line with \nmost other programs at the Commerce Department--and calls for a study \nto determine if this level is reasonable for the long-term.\n  As I mentioned, state funding is one key component of a MEP Center's \nbudget, and one area where funding has been constrained as of late. In \nresponse, this legislation authorizes a $5 million State incentive \nprogram. We should encourage State participation to grow this program, \nand make it a true partnership between the State, Federal Government \nand private sector.\n  Finally, the bill creates a separate funding authorization for the \nCompetitive Grant Program created in the 2007 America COMPETES Bill. \nThis will ensure that funding for the base MEP program goes to the \nexisting MEP centers and allows Congress and the Commerce Department to \nseparately fund new, innovative services for our manufacturers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3523\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter \ninto a cooperative agreement for a park headquarters at San Antonio \nMissions National Historical Park, to expand the boundary of the Park, \nto conduct a study of potential land acquisitions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I rise to speak on the San \nAntonio Missions National Historical Park Boundary Expansion Act of \n2010. This legislation will preserve and enhance one of Texas' most \nhistoric regions. Additionally, it will provide for a new education \ncenter so folks from around the nation can learn more about one of the \nmany historic gems Texas has to offer.\n  I would like to commend Congressman Ciro Rodriguez for his leadership\n\n[[Page S5322]]\n\nand dedication to the San Antonio Missions. The legislation I have \nintroduced today is a Senate companion to legislation that Congressman \nRodriguez introduced earlier this year.\n  During the 1700s, Spain greatly influenced the San Antonio area. As \nSpanish explorers travelled through modern-day Texas, Catholic \nmissionaries and soldiers accompanied the group and established the \nmissions and forts we now benefit from in the San Antonio Missions \nNational Historical Park. The missions and forts were originally \nestablished to protect Spanish land claims from the French in \nLouisiana. The missions and forts were also important to Spain in order \nto spread their influence and recruit new citizens for Spain's \nexpanding empire. The San Antonio Missions National Historical Park \npreserves the 18th century missions on site and offers visitors an \nopportunity to learn about the historical importance that the area \nplayed in vocational and educational training during the 1700s.\n  Furthermore, the park exemplifies the diverse cultural influences we \nenjoy in Texas. The park's cultural influences can be seen through the \nformation of San Antonio Missions National Historical Park, the largest \nconcentration of historical Catholic missions in North America. The \npark also has some of the most effectively maintained Spanish colonial \narchitecture in the United States. The rich history of the San Antonio \nMissions Historic Park must be preserved for future generations to \nenjoy. I am pleased to join Congressman Rodriguez in supporting the San \nAntonio Missions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Risch):\n  S. 3525. A bill to repeal the Jones Act restrictions on coastwise \ntrade and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that would fully repeal the Jones Act, a 1920s law that \nhinders free trade and favors labor unions over consumers. \nSpecifically, the Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between \nwaterborne ports of the United States be carried by vessels built in \nthe United States and owned and operated by Americans. This restriction \nonly serves to raise shipping costs, thereby making U.S. farmers less \ncompetitive and increasing costs for American consumers.\n  This was highlighted by a 1999 U.S. International Trade Commission \neconomic study, which suggested that a repeal of the Jones Act would \nlower shipping costs by approximately 22 percent. Also, a 2002 economic \nstudy from the same Commission found that repealing the Jones Act would \nhave an annual positive welfare effect of $656 million on the overall \nU.S. economy. Since these studies are the most recent statistics \navailable, imagine the impact a repeal of the Jones Act would have \ntoday: far more than a $656 million annual positive welfare impact--\nmaybe closer to $1 billion. These statistics demonstrate that a repeal \nof the Jones Act could prove to be a true stimulus to our economy in \nthe midst of such difficult economic times.\n  The Jones Act also adds a real, direct cost to consumers--\nparticularly consumers in Hawaii and Alaska. A 1988 GAO report found \nthat the Jones Act was costing Alaskan families between $1,921 and \n$4,821 annually for increased prices paid on goods shipped from the \nmainland. In 1997, a Hawaii government official asserted that ``Hawaii \nresidents pay an additional $1 billion per year in higher prices \nbecause of the Jones Act. This amounts to approximately $3,000 for \nevery household in Hawaii.''\n  This antiquated and protectionist law has been predominantly featured \nin the news as of late due to the Gulf Coast oil spill. Within a week \nof the explosion, 13 countries, including several European nations, \noffered assistance from vessels and crews with experience in removing \noil spill debris, and as of June 2l, the State Department has \nacknowledged that overall ``it has had 21 aid offers from 17 \ncountries.'' However, due to the Jones Act, these vessels are not \npermitted in U.S. waters.\n  The Administration has the ability to grant a waiver of the Jones Act \nto any vessel--just as the previous Administration did during Hurricane \nKatrina--to allow the international community to assist in recovery \nefforts. Unfortunately, this Administration has not done so.\n  Therefore, some Senators have put forward legislation to waive the \nJones Act during emergency situations, and I am proud to cosponsor this \nlegislation. However, the best course of action is to permanently \nrepeal the Jones Act in order to boost the economy, saving consumers \nhundreds of millions of dollars. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nthis effort to repeal this unnecessary, antiquated legislation in order \nto spur job creation and promote free trade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/23/senate-section/article/S5322-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5322-S5323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 562--TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING SENATE \n    AMENDMENTS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC IN A TIMELY MANNER\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

AVAILABILITY TO THE PUBLIC.\n\n       Not later than 6 months after the date of adoption of this \n     resolution, the Secretary of the Senate shall make the Senate \n     amendment database (ats.senate.gov or a similar amendment \n     database) available to the public on a public website in a \n     manner that will allow the public to view amendments as soon \n     as they are made widely available to Members of Congress and \n     staff.\n\n     SEC. 2.

FUNDING.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that appropriations should be \n     made available through the appropriations process to carry \n     out this resolution.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I address my colleagues for the purpose \nof submitting a resolution that will bring about greater transparency \nin government. I think my colleagues know I have a long history in \npromoting this sort of transparency. I believe the more people are \naware of what we are doing in the Senate and the Congress, or in \nWashington generally, the more accountable we are. The more accountable \nwe are, the better job we will do. I hope everybody agrees that is a \npretty simple concept.\n  Today, the purpose I come to the Senate floor is to submit a \nresolution that will improve transparency in this body and hold us all \nmore accountable to the people we serve; in other words, reminding the \npeople that we work for them; they do not work for us.\n  This resolution requires the Secretary of the Senate to make filed \namendments publicly available as soon as they are made available to \nMembers and staff. I will show, in just a minute, that they are almost \nimmediately made available to Members and staff. So why not the public?\n  In this day and age you would think this was already happening. We \nlive in a world of 24-hour news. We live in a world of instant coverage \nover the Internet of just about everything. Yet we have not been \nallowing the general public to get this information real time. My \nproposal would add more transparency to how the Senate works and what \nwe are debating on the Senate floor.\n  Some might question whether this is necessary. Under the current \nsystem, the public is usually able to see an amendment the next day in \nthe Congressional Record. So I want to say why that is not good enough. \nIn many cases, that may simply be too late.\n  Under the current system, the public may not be able to see the \namendment until after debate has begun or even\n\n[[Page S5323]]\n\nafter the Senate has already voted. This would be even more common \nduring some of the controversial debates that stretch late into the \nevening. You might remember the late evening votes we had on health \ncare reform last December and again in March where hundreds of \namendments were filed and votes were cast well past midnight.\n  In fact, today we make the vote count public on the Internet within \nan hour of when a vote takes place. But we might not be able to make \nthe substance of what we voted on available until the next day. So we \nlet the public see how we voted, but we do not always let them see what \nwe voted on. Of course, that does not make sense.\n  Just last night, Members tried to call up and pass various \namendments. But only the most experienced Washington insider would have \nbeen able to actually find copies of those amendments. Shouldn't we \nhave some kind of searchable system for amendments to allow our \nconstituents the same access to information that some seasoned lobbyist \nor some seasoned congressional staffer has?\n  Don't we want to give our constituents a chance to see the amendments \nbefore we vote on them, if they are interested in reading them? Don't \nwe want to know what our constituents think about amendments before we \nvote on them?\n  In order for that to happen, they have to know what those amendments \nare that have been filed. Of course, I am not talking about an \namendment that might change a word here or a word there--although those \nshould be publicly available as well. Some amendments I am talking \nabout are hundreds of pages long and even constitute a complete rewrite \nof an underlying bill.\n  Today, we will likely see our fifth version of the extenders bill \nthat is now the pending business on the floor of the Senate, and that \nfifth version would be in the form of an amendment. But our \nconstituents may not be able to see that until tomorrow.\n  Shouldn't the public be able to see that amendment as soon as we \nMembers or our staffs can read that amendment? This is a representative \nsystem of government, and it is impossible to represent the American \npeople if they do not have access to the same information we have.\n  In addition to those who will question whether this is necessary, \nothers might wonder whether it is even possible, like technically \npossible.\n  In fact, we are already doing it. That is right. The amendments are \nalready available electronically to Senate offices almost immediately \nafter they are filed, but they are not available to the public--not \nnecessarily intentionally hidden from the public, but the public cannot \nget them like everybody in the Senate and in our offices can get them.\n  I have a chart in the Chamber that shows there is already an \nAmendment Tracking System Web site that is only available to Members of \nCongress and staff. It provides a copy of the amendment, the purpose of \nthe amendment, the sponsor of the amendment, and the status of that \namendment.\n  My resolution is this simple: It would simply make this or a similar \nWeb site available to the public, much like already is done with the \nLegislative Information System site or the Thomas site at the Library \nof Congress.\n  That way, the public gets to see exactly what we Members and our \nstaffs are seeing almost immediately after filing. They get the same \ninformation and can provide their input prior to a vote.\n  There is a lot of distrust of government these days. People believe \nCongress is ignoring what the public thinks and what the public wants. \nSome of this is the result of the policies that are being considered \naround here. But it also has to do with the lack of transparency and \naccountability in government.\n  I am not saying this resolution is going to fix all that is wrong \nwith that distrust that is expressed--because it will not--but this \nresolution is one more step toward letting a little more sunshine into \nthis Chamber. This straightforward resolution will increase \ntransparency, it will promote accountability, and it will make us all \nbetter representatives of the people we serve.\n  I hope the Senate will consider this resolution at some point in the \nnear future, and I also urge my colleagues to support it.

Res. 564\n\n       Whereas Japan became a treaty ally of the United States \n     with the signing of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and \n     Security on January 19, 1960;\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\n       Whereas the treaty entered into force on June 19, 1960, \n     after its ratification by the Japanese Diet and the United \n     States Senate;\n       Whereas, in furtherance of the treaty, Japan hosts \n     approximately 36,000 members of the United States Armed \n     Forces, 43,000 dependents, and 5,000 civilian employees of \n     the Department of Defense, with a majority located on the \n     island of Okinawa;\n       Whereas the United States and Japan signed the Roadmap for \n     Realignment Implementation on May 1, 2006, to strengthen the \n     alliance by maintaining defense capabilities while reducing \n     burdens on local communities;\n       Whereas the United States and Japan signed the Guam \n     Agreement on February 17, 2009, on the relocation of \n     approximately 8,000 Marines assigned to the III Marine \n     Expeditionary Force (MEF) personnel and their approximately \n     9,000 dependents from Okinawa to Guam, which would reduce the \n     presence of the Marine Corps on Okinawa by nearly half;\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Japan \n     maintain a strong security partnership through joint \n     exercises between the United States Armed Forces and Japan's \n     Self-Defense Forces;\n       Whereas Japan's Self-Defense Forces have contributed \n     broadly to global security missions, including relief \n     operations following the tsunami in Indonesia in 2005, \n     reconstruction in Iraq from 2004 to 2006, relief assistance \n     following the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, and maritime \n     security operations in the Gulf of Aden;\n       Whereas Japan assists in the United States-led effort in \n     Afghanistan where it ranks as the second-largest donor after \n     the United States, pledging $5,000,000,000 over five years to \n     improve infrastructure, education, and health, in addition to \n     underwriting, with the United Kingdom, a reintegration trust \n     fund for former Taliban fighters;\n       Whereas Japan's Self-Defense Forces have played a vital \n     role in United Nations peacekeeping operations around the \n     world, beginning in 1992 when Japan dispatched two 600-member \n     engineering battalions to the United Nations Transitional \n     Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC);\n       Whereas the sinking of the Republic of Korea's Cheonan \n     naval ship by North Korea was a direct provocation intended \n     to destabilize Northeast Asia and demonstrates the importance \n     of cooperation between the United States and Japan on \n     regional security issues;\n       Whereas recent maritime activities by China's People's \n     Liberation Army Navy to challenge Japan's sovereignty claims \n     in waters contested by Japan and China underscore the vital \n     nature of the United States-Japan alliance to maintaining a \n     balance of security in the region;\n       Whereas, on May 28, 2010, members of the United States-\n     Japan Security Consultative Committee reconfirmed that, in \n     this 50th anniversary year of the signing of the Treaty of \n     Mutual Cooperation and Security, the United States-Japan \n     alliance remains ``indispensable not only to the defense of \n     Japan, but also to the peace, security, and prosperity of the \n     Asia-Pacific region'';\n       Whereas the security alliance has served as the foundation \n     for deep cultural, political, and economic ties between the \n     people of the United States and the people of Japan; and\n       Whereas Japan remains a steadfast global partner with \n     shared values of freedom, democracy, and liberty: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) affirms its commitment to the United States-Japan \n     security alliance and the deep friendship of both countries \n     that is based on shared values;\n       (2) recognizes the benefits of the alliance to the national \n     security of the United States and Japan, as well as to \n     regional peace and security;\n       (3) recognizes the contributions of and expresses \n     appreciation for the people of Japan, and in particular the \n     people of Okinawa, in hosting members of the United States \n     Armed Forces and their families in Japan;\n       (4) values the involvement of Japan's Self-Defense Forces \n     in regional and global security operations;\n       (5) promotes the implementation of the Roadmap for \n     Realignment to reduce the burden on local communities while \n     maintaining the United States strategic posture in Asia; and\n       (6) anticipates the continuation of the steadfast alliance \n     with its invaluable contribution to global peace, democracy, \n     and security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/23/senate-section/article/S5324-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4386.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has distinct legal, treaty, and trust \n     obligations to provide for the public safety of Indian \n     country;\n       (2) Congress and the President have acknowledged that--\n       (A) tribal law enforcement officers are often the first \n     responders to crimes on Indian reservations; and\n       (B) tribal justice systems are often the most appropriate \n     institutions for maintaining law and order in Indian country;\n       (3) less than 3,000 tribal and Federal law enforcement \n     officers patrol more than 56,000,000 acres of Indian country, \n     which reflects less than \\1/2\\ of the law enforcement \n     presence in comparable rural communities nationwide;\n       (4) the complicated jurisdictional scheme that exists in \n     Indian country--\n       (A) has a significant negative impact on the ability to \n     provide public safety to Indian communities;\n       (B) has been increasingly exploited by criminals; and\n       (C) requires a high degree of commitment and cooperation \n     among tribal, Federal, and State law enforcement officials;\n\n[[Page S5366]]\n\n       (5)(A) domestic and sexual violence against American Indian \n     and Alaska Native women has reached epidemic proportions;\n       (B) 34 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women \n     will be raped in their lifetimes; and\n       (C) 39 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women \n     will be subject to domestic violence;\n       (6) Indian tribes have faced significant increases in \n     instances of domestic violence, burglary, assault, and child \n     abuse as a direct result of increased methamphetamine use on \n     Indian reservations; and\n       (7) crime data is a fundamental tool of law enforcement, \n     but for decades the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the \n     Department of Justice have not been able to coordinate or \n     consistently report crime and prosecution rates in tribal \n     communities.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this division are--\n       (1) to clarify the responsibilities of Federal, State, \n     tribal, and local governments with respect to crimes \n     committed in Indian country;\n       (2) to increase coordination and communication among \n     Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies;\n       (3) to empower tribal governments with the authority, \n     resources, and information necessary to safely and \n     effectively provide public safety in Indian country;\n       (4) to reduce the prevalence of violent crime in Indian \n     country and to combat sexual and domestic violence against \n     American Indian and Alaska Native women;\n       (5) to prevent drug trafficking and reduce rates of alcohol \n     and drug addiction in Indian country; and\n       (6) to increase and standardize the collection of criminal \n     data and the sharing of criminal history information among \n     Federal, State, and tribal officials responsible for \n     responding to and investigating crimes in Indian country.\n\n     SEC. 3.
