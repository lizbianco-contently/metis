Madam President, Americans certainly want health care \nreform. There is no dispute about that. People are frustrated with the \nhigh cost of care, and many are worried about losing the health care \ncoverage they already have. Some can't afford care or have to choose \nbetween basic necessities and the treatments they need. These are some \nof the things that are wrong with the current system, and they need to \nbe fixed.\n  But while all of us recognize that serious reform is needed, we \nshould also recognize the necessity of getting it right. Before we rush \nto pass just anything in the name of reform, such as the bill \nintroduced in the HELP Committee this week, Americans have a right to \nask some very basic questions: How much will it cost? How will we pay \nfor it? What will this mean for me and for my family?\n  As to the first question, Americans have good reason to be concerned \nabout what the bill would cost. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that just a portion--just a portion--of the HELP Committee \nbill would spend $1.3 trillion over 10 years. That doesn't even include \nmajor portions of the final proposal, including a massive expansion of \nMedicaid, which will cost untold billions of dollars. These are \nstaggering amounts of money for taxpayers to contemplate, which is why \nit\n\n[[Page S6752]]\n\nis troubling to a lot of people when we see committee members in such a \nrush to pass this legislation before the Congressional Budget Office \neven has a chance to fully estimate its cost. On something as important \nto the American people as health care reform, cost and effectiveness \nshould be a higher priority than speed.\n  But even if we decided this bill was the right reform, another \nquestion arises: How would we pay for it? Most people don't walk onto a \ncar lot, pick out the most expensive model, buy it, and then figure out \nhow they are going to pay for it. Even if they wanted to, the car \nsalesman wouldn't let them. We need to take the same approach here.\n  The proposal we have seen is full of creative new ways to spend \ntaxpayer dollars, but it offers little in the way of offsetting the \ncost of the overall bill. We will have to either charge the money to \nthe national credit card or, more likely, raise taxes on working \nfamilies--in other words, more spending, higher taxes, and even more \ndebt. So far, some of the taxes under discussion include a tax on soft \ndrinks and juice boxes, the creation of a new tax on jobs, and new \nlimits on charitable donations. But this would just be the beginning. \nThe HELP Committee bill would be hugely expensive by any reckoning, and \nno one has a plan to pay for it. This isn't a very good start as far as \nhealth reform is concerned.\n  Americans are also right to wonder how these changes would affect the \nfamily budget. Will the HELP Committee's so-called reforms raise the \nhealth insurance costs for millions of families and businesses at a \ntime when they are already struggling? This isn't a scare tactic or a \ntheoretical question. Not only does the CBO estimate suggest the final \nbill is far too expensive, but we also have the example of States that \nhave tried some of the proposals it suggests. Shouldn't we look at the \nexperience of these States to determine whether we want to replicate \nthese proposals nationwide?\n\n  Take Kentucky, for example. Many of the same concepts embraced by the \nHELP Committee bill were tried 15 years ago in my State--with \ndisastrous results. Instead of reforms that were promised, Kentuckians \nwere left with higher expenses and fewer choices for health coverage. \nInstead of more affordable care, one report estimates that 850,000 \nKentuckians faced dramatically higher premiums. Instead of increased \ncompetition, about 50 insurance companies stopped offering individual \ninsurance, leaving only a handful of private insurers and a government-\nrun plan that wasn't affordable for taxpayers. After years of failure, \nmany of these so-called reforms were repealed but not without \nsignificant damage to the Commonwealth. While the market has rebounded \nsome, Kentucky's small businesses and families tell me that a lack of \ncompetition in the health care market continues to keep prices high. \nShouldn't this experience figure into our consideration?\n  When it comes to our approach on legislation as costly as health \ncare, we should learn from our experience with the stimulus. Democrats \nrushed that bill on the grounds that we needed it to jump-start the \nailing economy. Yet a few months later we are already hearing \noutrageous stories of abuse and the unemployment rate actually \ncontinues to rise.\n  When it comes to specific proposals within any so-called health care \nreform bill, we should learn from the experience of Kentucky. We should \nnot be rushed into enacting so-called reforms that cost taxpayers \ntrillions and could increase premiums to consumers.\n  Americans indeed want reform, but they want us to do it right. They \ndo not want a blind rush to spend trillions of dollars they and their \ngrandchildren will have to pay for through higher taxes and even more \ndebt.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6752-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6752-S6753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if you will indulge me, it appears \nappropriate and necessary to briefly summarize the sorry state of \nhealth care in America today.\n  Nearly 50 million people in the greatest country and the largest \neconomy the world has ever seen lack the fundamental ability to stay \nhealthy or care for a loved one. Nine million of those people are \nchildren. Eight million fewer people who in 2003 had health insurance \nthrough their jobs can say the same today. Among those between 18 and \n64, the State of Nevada has the second highest rate of uninsured \ncitizens. Health care costs an average family more than twice what it \ndid at the start of this decade. Half of all Americans who file for \nforeclosure do so because they can't afford both a house and their \nhealth care. More than half of all Americans who file for bankruptcy do \nso because health care is too expensive. More than half of all \nAmericans skip doctor visits or treatments they need to stay healthy \nbecause it is too expensive.\n  Those fortunate enough to have health care pay a hidden tax just to \ncover those who don't. If your family has insurance, you pay at least \n$1,000 more for it than you would need to if other families had their \ninsurance. If you are like about everybody I know and not in absolutely \nperfect health--if you have a history of anything from heart disease, \nto high cholesterol, to hay fever--your insurance company can force you \nto pay exorbitant rates or deny you coverage altogether. Insurance \ncompanies call these preexisting conditions. Everyone else calls them \ntragedies.\n  I know I am not telling the American people anything they do not \nalready know. They know it better than any statistics can say. They \nstruggle with these challenges every morning when they wake up and when \nthey go to bed at night, second-guessing the agonizing decisions they \nmade that day about what to sacrifice to stay healthy.\n  I said I thought it would be appropriate to go back to the basics for \nthe benefit of our Republican colleagues. Their lack of interest in an \nopen and candid debate, their lack of interest in coming to the \nnegotiating table with productive proposals makes it painfully evident \nthey need to be reminded of the reality of this crisis.\n  By any measure, these are serious problems, and serious problems \ndeserve serious efforts by serious legislators to develop serious \nsolutions. Our Republican colleagues think things are just fine the way \nthey are. Why shouldn't they? They like the status quo. They are the \nones who created the status quo. In fact, this is hard to comprehend. \nJust yesterday, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives \nsaid the following: ``I think we all understand that we've got the best \nhealth care system in the world.'' When we have 50 million people with \nno health insurance, is that the best health care system in the world? \nWhen we have 9 million children with no health insurance, is that the \nbest health care system in the world? Is it the best health care system \nin the world when today there are 8 million people fewer than in 2003 \nwho have health insurance through their jobs? Is it the best health \ncare system in the world when people between 18 and 64 in the State of \nNevada have the second highest rate of uninsured citizens? I don't \nthink so. Is it the best health care system in the world when the \nhealth care cost for the average family is more than twice what it was \nat the beginning of this decade? Is it the best health care in the \nworld when more than half of all Americans skip the doctor visits they \nneed or the treatments they need because they cannot afford them?\n  The Republican leader in the House of Representatives is saying, ``I \nthink we all understand that we've got the best health care system in \nthe world.'' I think he better go back and check that out. He said that \nto a room of reporters. I doubt he would say the same with a straight \nface to the millions of Americans who have to skip routine medical \ncheckups or live just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy or \nwonder if they will live long enough to fight through the redtape. We \nhave heard President Obama talk about the death of his mother and how \nshe fought as strongly as she could to get the health care she needed. \nShe lost that battle.\n  What about the Republicans in the Senate? We talked about the \nRepublican leader in the House. How have they approached the crisis? I \nam sorry to say they have only subscribed to more of the same stalling \nstrategy that the American people are tired of. Republicans have \nintroduced 400 amendments to the health care bill that is in\n\n[[Page S6753]]\n\nthe HELP Committee, 400 amendments, and they say they have more to \ncome. Here is a sample of some of their serious amendments: two \namendments would force doctors to spy on each other, multiple \namendments just to change the names of sections in the bill, and many \namendments that simply would give greedy insurance companies the \nability to deny coverage whenever they feel like it. Each of the 400 \namendments says something different, but in truth they all say the same \nthing--no. They are designed to slow the process to a halt.\n  I am not making this up. Look at this newspaper today, Rollcall: \n``Senate GOP Still Saying `No.' '' Listen to what the story says. This \nis more than just a headline.\n\n       Though Senate Democrats have handed them defeat after \n     legislative defeat this year, Republicans say they plan to \n     continue trying to slow down the Democratic agenda on the \n     Senate floor as much as possible. ``Democrats need to know \n     when they bring [bills] up, we're going to extend the debate \n     as long as we can--even if we can't win it--so that their \n     people back home know that they're voting for this junk, \n     [said one Republican Senator]. And we're going to see it on \n     everything.''\n\n  The stalling on everything. How is that for moving this country out \nof the problems we have? ``They plan to continue trying to slow down \nthe Democratic agenda on the Senate floor as much as possible.''\n  Republicans waste the time of the American people in the morning and \nin the afternoon complain that government is inefficient. What do I \nmean? We have wasted the whole week with 60 hours of wasted time on two \npostcloture time blocks. It is just as they said, they are just \nstalling for time. During that period of time, we could have moved to \nappropriations bills, we could have moved to many things.\n  I have Senators come to me. There is a bipartisan bill--Senator Kerry \nhas worked with Senator Kyl--dealing with Pakistan. It is essential \nthat we do that. But because of what is going on here on the Senate \nfloor with Republicans stalling, we can't get to that. I have been \nasked by Democrats and Republicans to do something about drug \nimportation. We don't have time to go to it because of the stalling. \nThe Senate GOP is still just saying no. They complain about the \ngovernment being inefficient? The only inefficiency I see in Washington \ntoday is the Republican caucus in the House and the Senate.\n  Again, our health care system is in serious distress, and serious \nproblems deserve serious efforts by serious legislators to develop \nserious solutions. That is why we are committed to lowering the high \ncost of health care, ensuring every American has access to quality, \naffordable care, and letting people choose their own doctors, \nhospitals, and health plans. We are committed to protecting existing \ncoverage when it is good, improving it when it is not, and guaranteeing \nhealth care for the millions who have none. I don't think doing nothing \nis an option because the cost of doing nothing is far too great. We \nmust pass health care reform this year.\n  As we said at the start of this Congress, the start of the work \nperiod, and the start of this debate, we will continue doing the best \nwork with Republicans--we will work with them. They have a place at the \nnegotiating table, and they should take it. We will work hard to do a \nbipartisan bill. But in order for this bipartisan process to work, \nRepublicans must demonstrate an interest in legislating, not this:\n\n       Though Senate Democrats have handed them defeat after \n     legislative defeat this year, Republicans say they plan to \n     continue trying to slow down the Democratic agenda on the \n     Senate floor as much as possible. ``Democrats need to know \n     when they bring [bills] up, we're going to extend the debate\n     as long as we can--even if we can't win\n     it . . .''\n\n  I hope the American people who are watching talk to their Republican \nRepresentatives in the House and their Senators and say this isn't \nright.\n  Despite what we have seen in recent days, such cooperation is not out \nof the realm of possibility. Here is an example of what it looks like \nwhen Republicans and Democrats work together with each other instead of \nagainst each other and against the interests of the American people. \nYesterday, Wednesday, a group called the Bipartisan Policy Center \nproposed a thoughtful and thorough plan for stemming this country's \nhealth care crisis. The group is led by three former Senate majority \nleaders--I have worked with all of them--Bob Dole from Kansas, Howard \nBaker from Tennessee, and Tom Daschle from South Dakota. I would \nmention about Tom Daschle, I think most people recognize he is a man \nwho knows more about health care than just about anybody in America \ntoday. He has written a book, among other things. Together, Tom \nDaschle, a Democrat, and Senators Dole and Baker, Republicans, served a \ncombined 80 years in the Congress. They know a thing or two about \nworking across the aisle and getting things done. They know our job is \npublic service, not lipservice. I may not agree with every part of \ntheir plan, but that is not the point. The point is, they have a good-\nfaith effort. They have avoided the temptation to distract each other \nwith misrepresentations and misinformation about the real problem. They \nhave put people ahead of partisanship and were able to find common \nground.\n  I encourage Republicans in Congress to read the Bipartisan Policy \nCenter's report. Even if they do not support its conclusions, I hope \nthey take to heart its authors' motivations. Baker, Dole, and Daschle--\nserious problems deserve serious efforts by serious legislators to \ndevelop serious solutions. The time for partisan games is long over. It \nis time to get serious about fixing our health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6753-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, this February, Congress passed and the \nPresident signed a historic recovery package, setting the stage for the \ncreation of 3\\1/2\\ million jobs and making critical investments to \nstrengthen the 21st-century economy. We all agree that legislation has \nnot ended the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression. \nAmericans know what this administration inherited and the time it will \ntake to get out of it. Hundreds of thousands of Americans continue to \nlose their jobs every month, quality health care is still far from \naffordable for far too many, and we still have a dangerous dependence \non foreign oil that threatens our safety, our wallets, and our planet \nat the same time.\n  But the optimism we feel is real. Quick action on our part has \ncontributed to bringing the economy back from the brink of absolute \ncollapse. There are green shoots in this economy, and the Recovery Act \nhas fertilized them. It has cut taxes for working Americans; it has \nmade education more affordable; it has jump-started urgent investments \nthat will make our commutes faster and our air cleaner, investments \nsuch as repairing crumbling bridges and highways and building high-\nspeed transit and light rail, investments that will pay off over the \ncourse of generations. The hundreds of thousands of Americans who are \ngoing to work this morning because of the Recovery Act can tell us in \nno uncertain terms that the legislation is working. It is creating \njobs, making responsible investments, helping workers damaged by this \ncrisis.\n  But in the face of these tremendous efforts, some are questioning the \neffectiveness of these investments. They have decided to attack the \nentire recovery process by jumping to conclusions, distorting the \nfacts, and spreading outright falsehoods--all because of their failed \nGeorge Bush-style ideology that created this crisis in the first place.\n  There have been some who have commissioned their own report, a report \nwhich picked a conclusion first and\n\n[[Page S6754]]\n\nthen attempted to seek out facts later. The old saying goes, if the \nonly tool you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail. \nThat is the case here. The radical conservative ideology that led to \nthis report is like a steam hammer that its operators would like to use \nat all times, even if it means bashing away at the foundation of \neconomic growth we are trying to build.\n  I notice this report did not mention any projects from my home State \nof New Jersey, and I guess, because the conclusion they wanted to draw \nwas failure, that would make sense not to include projects in New \nJersey because, in fact, if you look at the issue of how New Jersey is \nhandling this among many other States in the Nation, you would have to \ntake issue with the thousands of New Jerseyans who will owe their jobs \nto this act.\n  The report would have to take issue with an immediate tax cut for the \naverage working family of up to $800, money that helped New Jerseyans \npay their bills and support their families, or the over 1.5 million New \nJerseyans who avoided the alternative minimum tax as a result of that \nlaw as well--more money in their pockets, less money going to the \ngovernment.\n  You would have to take issue with the college students and parents of \ncollege students in New Jersey who are finding their term bills just a \nlittle easier to pay because of the increased Pell grants in the \nRecovery Act. In addition to higher education, it would have to take \nissue with all the ways public elementary and secondary schools are \nbeing improved with $957 million in funding that they would not \notherwise have for critical needs ranging from up-to-date textbooks to \nbetter technology in the classroom.\n  It would have to take on all the teachers, police, and firefighters \nwho have been able to keep their jobs and the individuals with \ndisabilities who are now getting the support they need at school--made \npossible by the Recovery Act.\n  The Recovery Act was intended to create jobs fast, pump money into \nthe economy quickly. How well has it done that in New Jersey? I saw \nfirsthand how the funding created 250 construction and engineering jobs \nimproving Route 46 in Lodi. It is a project that is going to reduce \ntraffic congestion, cut down on the time it takes to commute, make it \neasier to do business, and protect the roadway against flooding so \nparents can feel just a little safer as they drive their kids in heavy \nrain.\n  I saw firsthand that the Recovery Act finally let us break ground on \nthe Mass Transit Tunnel under the Hudson River that will ultimately \ncreate 6,000 jobs for several years and, at the end of the day, when \nthat project is finished, over 50,000 permanent jobs. I met children \nwho will be the future riders of that train and whose parents and \nneighbors are employed in its design, planning, and construction as we \nspeak. In terms of infrastructure, you can see these results statewide.\n  The Recovery Act required our State Department of Transportation to \nget enough projects ready for bidding so that 50 percent of that \nfunding could be set aside within 120 days to get people to work. New \nJersey met that requirement and plans to allocate the funding for all \nof its projects by the end of this month. The Recovery Act has been a \nlifeline for New Jersey and, for that matter, for millions of people \nacross the country.\n  I could not agree more that accountability is crucial. We understand \nthat every dollar in the Recovery Act belongs to the American taxpayer. \nThey deserve assurances that their money is being invested wisely. We \nhave to ensure unprecedented transparency, oversight, and \naccountability so Americans can see not only how their money is being \nspent but also the results of their investments.\n  That is why this act is being personally overseen by the Vice \nPresident of the United States. And it is why the Act provides for so \nmuch transparency, such as a Web site with all of the information about \nit readily available to the public. Ironically, the fact that there is \nso much transparency is the reason an individual Senator can issue a \nreport about it at all, and it is the reason we can figure out so \neasily that many of the assertions in that report are wrong.\n  Accountability means making sure our investments are smart and making \ncorrections as need be. What accountability does not mean is attacking \nthe job that hard-working men and women are doing, that the legislation \nmade possible, because your ideology does not square with the facts.\n  That is not accounting, that is undermining. Frankly, after 8 years \nof undermining, the American people are ready to build up this country \nagain. And with the Recovery Act, with health care reform, so not only \nthose nearly 50 million Americans who have no health care coverage in \nthe greatest Nation in all of the world, but at the same time millions \nmore who are one paycheck away from losing it, and so many who have \nhealth insurance, but have told me that, in fact, after listening to \ntheir insurance company and following all of the rules, they still get \ndenied for claims of coverage they need.\n  That is part of the reform we seek. With additional steps to make us \nenergy independent, we are going to, in essence, rebuild this country. \nThat is the process of saying ``yes'' to America, not ``no'' to \nAmerica.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Madam President, I just finished reading an excellent \naddress by the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan. Secretary Duncan \nmade this to the National Governors Association. He said this:\n\n       I am continually struck by the profound wisdom underlying \n     the American political system. The genius of our system is \n     that much of our power that shapes our future was wisely \n     distributed to the States instead of being confined in \n     Washington.\n\n  Continuing, he says:\n\n       Our best ideas have always come from State and local \n     governments, which are the real hothouses of innovation in \n     America.\n\n  Secretary Duncan says:\n\n       On so many issues: energy efficiency, mass transit, public \n     safety, housing, economic development, [and then he goes on \n     to say] education, it is the States that are often leading \n     the way, sometimes with Federal help and sometimes without.\n\n  That is indeed the American way. That is my comment. The American way \nwas recognized by President Lincoln who honored the importance of \nStates. He argued for a limited Federal Government. He used the limited \nFederal Government to confer opportunities through the Transcontinental \nRailway, the Land Grant Colleges, the Homestead Act, instead of a \n``Washington knows best'' command and control sort of Federal \nGovernment.\n  It has been our tradition to rely on decentralism of government and a \nfree market to build our country, and it has given us the best colleges \nand universities, and a standard of living that produces 25 percent of \nall of the money in the world for just 5 percent of the people in the \nworld, the Americans who live here.\n  Unfortunately, the wisdom that Secretary Duncan expressed seems to \nlie almost exclusively in the Department of Education in this \nadministration. It is an oasis of common sense, because at an \nastonishing rate, almost everything else in Washington seems to think \nthat Washington knows best.\n  I was visited by a European auto executive the other day who said to \nme jokingly: Well, I am glad to be in the new American automotive \ncapital: Washington, DC. It is not only America's automotive \nheadquarters, it is becoming America's banking center and it is \nbecoming America's insurance center.\n  Unfortunately, even in education, Washington, DC is now about to \nbecome America's student loan center for 15 million students, because \nthe administration believes Washington knows\n\n[[Page S6755]]\n\nbest. Instead of having 2,000 banks make 15 million loans, we are going \nto have the U.S. Department of Education make the Secretary the banker \nof the year.\n  And now, we are discussing in the HELP Committee and in the Finance \nCommittee a brazen takeover representing 16 percent of our economy \nwhich would say: Washington knows best about our health care system. \nWashington will become America's health care center as well.\n  The health care bill we are discussing in the HELP Committee, of \nwhich I am a member, would expand one failed government program, \nMedicaid, and create a new one, a new government insurance program, a \nso-called public option.\n  Those who support the public option--this includes our President--\nfeel very strongly about it, and they speak eloquently about it. They \nsay things such as one Senator said yesterday at our hearing, we need \nto ``keep the insurance companies honest.'' That is why we need a \ngovernment-run insurance program. We need some ``good old-fashioned \ncompetition,'' so they said, and, ``we need to keep prices in check.'' \nThey say that is why we need a government-run health insurance program.\n  Well, if that is the argument, perhaps we ought to start doing that \nwith every sector of the economy, starting with automobiles. Why not \nbuy the rest of General Motors--we already own 60 percent of it--and \nlet's create a government car, and let's keep what is left of the \nAmerican automobile industry honest by doing that. Let's have some good \nold-fashioned competition to keep prices in check.\n  We could own the car company, we could regulate the car company, we \ncould subsidize the car company. And we could create a car that we knew \nis exactly the right size, the right color, that got 50 miles a gallon, \nthat ran on ethanol, that had a solar panel, and that had a windmill \non top. That would be the government car.\n\n  To be fair to the American communities across the country, because we \nwould want to be, we could mandate that equal numbers of parts for the \ngovernment car could be made in every congressional district and no one \ncould buy an electric battery made in South Korea, even if it was the \nbest battery in the world and would make the Chevy Volt an instant \nsuccess.\n  We could have a board of directors on our government car company of \n120 Members of the Congress or Senate. All of us, great car experts, \nright? We know how to build cars and trucks, how to design them, how to \nbuild them, how to sell them. And there are 120 of us who are the \nchairman or ranking member of some committee or subcommittee that has \nthe authority to call the head of the car company into Washington, \npresumably driving his or her congressionally approved hybrid car, to \ncome testify for 3 or 4 hours, and then drive back to Detroit having \nnot a minute that day to design, build, or make a car.\n  That is what we could do. And we know what the result would be. The \nresult would be a car a lot like the Soviet cars we all used to laugh \nabout years ago. They were clunkers. They were the butt of jokes. They \nbarely worked. No one wanted to buy them. And, of course, they kept \nlowering the price, so that people would want them. Pretty soon they \npriced everybody else out of business. There was only one car, the \ngovernment car, and people either drove the government car or they \nwalked, or they took the Metro, or they found some other way, maybe a \nbicycle.\n  That is what we are talking about here when we talk about a \ngovernment-run health insurance program to keep the health insurance \ncompanies honest. It is the same idea as having a government-run car \nprogram to keep the American automobile companies honest.\n  We already have one government-run health care program. We call it \nMedicaid. It is a terrible example. The Government Accountability \nOffice says we literally waste 10 percent of every dollar of all of the \ndollars that we give to Medicaid. That is $32 billion a year. It is \nfilled with lawsuits, bureaucracies, inefficiencies. It is a tremendous \nexpense to States. It is ruining higher education because Governors and \nlegislatures are putting every available dollar into Medicaid, and they \nhave nothing left for the community colleges.\n  The worst of it is it does not provide service. It is like giving you \na Metro pass and there is no subway. Approximately 40 percent of the \ndoctors will not serve Medicaid patients--low-income Americans--because \nof the low reimbursement rates.\n  So what do we have with our great government program called Medicaid? \nTwice as many Medicaid patients go to the emergency room to get their \ncare as do uninsured Americans going to the emergency room. That is \nwhat we have with that government program.\n  Yet the Kennedy bill which we are considering in the Senate HELP \nCommittee, the only bill we are considering even though there are other \nalternatives on the table, would expand that government-run program by \n150 percent, increase its costs both to the Federal Government and to \nStates, all in the name of keeping insurance companies honest.\n  There is a better way to give subsidies or grants to low-income \nAmericans so they may buy their own health insurance.\n  There is a better way with autos as well. Instead of having a \ngovernment car for the next 4 or 5 years, with politicians meddling in \nhow GM and Chrysler operate their business, let's give the stock we own \nback to the American people. Give the 60 percent of General Motors \nstock and the 8 percent of Chrysler stock to the 120 million Americans \nwho paid taxes on April 15 of this year. The reason would be they paid \nfor it, they should own it. Some might say: Well, let's sell the stock. \nI would favor selling the stock. I would like to get the stock out of \nWashington and end this incestuous relationship of Congressmen calling \nup the President of General Motors and saying: Do not close the \nwarehouse in my district. But it might take several years, according to \nthe President of GM, to sell that block of stock. So the faster way to \ndo it is a stock distribution, a corporate spinoff.\n  Proctor & Gamble did this with Clorox in 1969. Time Warner did it \nwith Time Warner Cable in March of 2009. All of the stockholders of \nTime Warner simply received shares in Time Warner Cable. PepsiCo did it \nwith its restaurant businesses--KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. If you \nowned shares of PepsiCo, suddenly you had some of Colonel Sander's \nstock. PepsiCo shareholders received one share in the new restaurant \ncompany.\n  Madam President, would you let me know when I have 1 minute \nremaining, please?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. These companies did all of this when the main company \ndecided that the subsidiary was not consistent with the core business. \nThat is what we should do with General Motors--give taxpayers its \nshares and get General Motors back in the marketplace where it belongs. \nThis idea is fast, it is simple, and it creates a market for the \nshares.\n  The United States is not like the Soviet Union where people are not \nused to handling shares. Half of American families own shares of stock. \nDistributing government owned shares in General Motors to taxpayers \nwould create a fan base for the next Chevy, like the fan base for the \nGreen Bay Packers, where the people in the community own the football \nteam.\n  I have been giving ``Car Czar'' awards to political meddlers to put a \nspotlight on this incestuous relationship in Washington. American \nmanufacturing of autos will not succeed if Washington is America's new \nautomotive headquarters. Neither will American insurance succeed, \nneither will American banking succeed, neither will students be happy \nwaiting outside the Department of Education for their student loans, \nand neither will health care help low-income Americans if Washington is \nthe headquarters.\n  Later today or tomorrow I hope to be able to offer my amendment, \ncosponsored by Senators Bennett, Kyl, and others, to give all of the \nGeneral Motors stock and all of the Chrysler stock our federal \ngovernment owns back to\n\n[[Page S6756]]\n\nthe people who paid for it. They paid for it; they should own it. Let's \nget the Washington meddlers out of the automobile business and auto \nmanufacturing back on its feet.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record newspaper \narticles supporting the Auto Stock for Every Taxpayer Act I have \nintroduced and plan to offer as soon as I am able.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [From Newsweek]\n\n                         Barney Frank, Car Guy\n\n\n                   And green guy. So he pressures GM.\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       General Motors changed its mind. Or maybe not. It is \n     unclear that GM still has a mind of its own, so let us just \n     say that GM changed its decision. The company first announced \n     that it was going to close a parts-distribution center in \n     Norton, Mass. Then it heard from the congressman who \n     represents that community, Barney Frank.\n       That Democrat chairs the Financial Services Committee, \n     which is mightily important to GM now that it is an appendage \n     of the federal government, which soon will own 60 percent of \n     it. Frank talked to GM's CEO, Fritz Henderson. So the \n     distribution center will not be closed for at least another \n     14 months.\n       Is this a glimpse of what life is going to be like under \n     the political economy of state capitalism? Heaven forfend, \n     says Frank. To The Hill newspaper he said, ``I don't think \n     this will lead to a pattern,'' because, well, because the \n     distribution facility was not a dealership or an assembly \n     plant. If that strikes you as a non sequitur, this will, too: \n     Frank stressed that what he did was not improper because he \n     talked to Henderson rather than to someone in the Obama \n     administration. Which is significant because . . . never \n     mind.\n       Frank's motive for intervening in GM's decision making was \n     not political but altruistic. Really. He wanted to save the \n     planet. If the Norton facility were closed, he says, GM parts \n     for New England would be trucked from Philadelphia, and that \n     would complicate the task of turning down Earth's thermostat.\n       Nowadays, green reasoning is the first refuge of \n     scoundrels. Global warming has become like God: It is an \n     explanation for everything and an all-purpose excuse for the \n     political class to do whatever it wants to do. What a large \n     portion of it wants to do--what it has a metabolic urge to \n     do--is boss people around. It can maximize its opportunities \n     for doing that if it maximizes the number of people dependent \n     on government, and the number of ways in which they are \n     dependent.\n       Sometimes bribing is a substitute for bossing, as with the \n     ``cash for clunkers'' idea: Give vouchers worth up to $4,500 \n     to people who trade in their vehicles for more fuel-efficient \n     ones. One rationale for this is, of course, green: It would \n     put a cool compress on Mother Earth's supposedly fevered \n     brow. But the plan also is yet another bailout for the \n     bottomless money pit called Detroit. The plan would entice \n     customers into showrooms.\n       But in a cri de coeur published last week in The Wall \n     Street Journal, two of the senators who dreamed this up \n     lamented that something has gone horribly wrong. Dianne \n     Feinstein, the California Democrat, and Susan Collins, the \n     Maine Republican, are surprised and scandalized that their \n     proposal for manipulating the market has been hijacked by \n     industry lobbyists, who have a different manipulation agenda.\n       Feinstein and Collins tied their vouchers to purchases of \n     vehicles meeting high fuel-efficiency standards. But the bill \n     passed by the House, and a companion bill lurking in the \n     Senate, would make vouchers available for vehicles meeting \n     less exacting standards. This would help dealers move their \n     unsold inventories of SUVs, pickups and other large vehicles. \n     Feinstein and Collins denounce this as ``handouts for \n     Hummers'' and say it is evidence of ``how quickly a good idea \n     can go bad in Washington.''\n       Actually, it is evidence of what a bad idea they had--\n     getting the government into the business of fine-tuning \n     customers' choices. Once such market manipulations are given \n     a seal of progressive approval, it is not a jaw-dropping \n     shock that things will become messy, with factions competing \n     to get the government to do their bidding.\n       Two other senators have three better ideas pertaining to \n     the government's wallow in the auto industry. A bill written \n     by Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander and Utah Republican \n     Bob Bennett would prohibit using any more TARP funds for GM \n     or Chrysler. And it would require that as long as the \n     government owns stock in the companies, the Treasury would \n     have a fiduciary duty to see that the government's investment \n     is managed with the single objective of maximizing the return \n     to taxpayers--not to advance any environmental (hi, Barney), \n     trade, energy, labor or other policy. And it would require \n     the Treasury to distribute, within a year, all its GM and \n     Chrysler stock evenly to the approximately 120 million \n     persons who paid 2008 income taxes.\n       Although two years ago a share of GM's stock was worth $40, \n     last Friday it was worth $1.22, and now GM has a new \n     government--chosen chairman of its board of directors, Edward \n     Whitacre Jr., who says, ``I don't know anything about cars,'' \n     which means he is like those who appointed him. So the stock \n     distribution will not soon be a bonanza to taxpayers. But \n     unwinding the government's entanglement with GM might be.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 12, 2009]\n\n                Auto Dealers at Risk Turn to Washington\n\n                   (By Carl Hulse and Bernie Becker)\n\n       Washington.--Auto dealers accustomed to negotiating sales \n     on their car lots clustered in the Capitol instead this week, \n     looking to their trusty, neighborhood lawmakers to do some \n     hard bargaining for them.\n       With about 2,000 Chrysler and General Motors dealers losing \n     their franchises as the companies retrench, the dealers are \n     pressing Congress to reverse what they see as an unfair \n     process forcing some profitable businesses to close or stop \n     selling new autos, with no explanation from the manufacturers \n     of why they were singled out.\n       ``We have never gotten one,'' said Rick Shaub, the owner of \n     Montrose Dodge in Germantown, Md. He was with fellow dealers \n     outside the office of the House majority leader, Steny H. \n     Hoyer, on Wednesday, the day after his family's three-\n     generation relationship with Chrysler came to an end.\n       As they lobby Congress, angry dealers are finding an \n     increasingly receptive audience in the House and Senate, \n     where lawmakers say the mass termination of franchises by the \n     bankrupt car companies is threatening tens of thousands of \n     jobs, not to mention the civic fabric of communities where \n     car dealerships are often a chief local institution.\n       ``The dealers in these small towns are kind of the heart of \n     the town,'' said Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, \n     who estimated that 12 G.M. dealers and six Chrysler dealers \n     were affected in his state. ``They sponsor the Little League; \n     the big guy in town is usually the car dealer. I am worried \n     about it.''\n       But the campaign on behalf of the dealers is also providing \n     a test of one of the central criticisms of the government's \n     intrusion into the operations of many companies, from banks \n     to insurers to auto giants. Even as they talk tough about the \n     mismanagement of car companies, can members of Congress \n     withstand political pressure and allow Chrysler and G.M. to \n     make tough economic decisions that might hurt their own \n     constituents?\n       For instance, Representative Barney Frank, the \n     Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House Financial Services \n     Committee, came under fire for intervening with G.M. to keep \n     a parts distribution center open in his district, preserving \n     about 90 jobs for another year. Critics said Mr. Frank used \n     his sway as an overseer of federal bailout money to intervene \n     in the company's decision-making.\n       Mr. Frank said that he made a common-sense argument to keep \n     the center open, and that he was only standing up for his \n     constituents. ``I will bear up under the criticism that I \n     have been doing too much for my district,'' he said.\n       Other lawmakers said the growing number of calls for \n     intervention showed the dangers of large-scale government \n     involvement in the auto companies, saying the result would be \n     lawmakers trying to serve as top executives of auto \n     companies.\n       ``It is incestuous for members of Congress to be saying, \n     `Close this plant; use this model; don't buy the Volt battery \n     in South Korea but make it in my district,' '' said Senator \n     Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, referring to the \n     G.M. hybrid car now in development.\n       Senator Alexander has instituted a ``car czar of the day'' \n     award in recognition of Congressional meddling. ``What do \n     people in Washington know about building cars?'' he said. ``I \n     don't think very much.''\n       Even lawmakers backing the dealers expressed mixed emotions \n     about dipping into the workings of the auto companies. But \n     the dealer closings are striking a nerve in Congress. The \n     federal government has been coming to the aid of the auto \n     manufacturers, which lawmakers see as then turning around and \n     abandoning the element of the industry closest to home for \n     most of them.\n       Representative Frank M. Kratovil, a Maryland Democrat who \n     has introduced a measure that would restore the franchise \n     agreements, portrayed the situation as a ``bailout for the \n     big guys, but a force-out for the little guys.''\n       In the Senate, lawmakers have not gone as far as the House \n     in pushing a bill to block the move by the manufacturers. But \n     members of the Senate commerce committee this week urged \n     Chrysler to allow dealers a chance to appeal the closures and \n     for both carmakers to give preference to existing, profitable \n     operations when the automakers try to set up new franchises \n     in areas where dealers were shut off. G.M. already has an \n     appeals process for dealers scheduled for closure.\n       ``We think--in the interest of fairness--that profitable \n     dealers in this situation should have a right of first \n     refusal for the new dealership when Chrysler returns to that \n     particular market,'' read a letter signed by Senator John D. \n     Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the \n     committee, along with other members. A similar letter was \n     sent to G.M.\n       The car companies say that they need to scale back to be \n     able to return to profitability and that cutting the number \n     of dealers is crucial to that effort.\n       At a hearing last week of the commerce committee, Fritz \n     Henderson, the chief executive of G.M., said that much of the \n     growth in\n\n[[Page S6757]]\n\n     his company's dealer network occurred decades ago. Since \n     then, he said, ``our market share has shrunk, leaving us with \n     too many dealerships.''\n       ``Everyone agrees--even the dealers themselves--that a \n     restructuring of G.M.'s dealer network must take place,'' Mr. \n     Henderson said.\n       Some point to the millions of dollars in campaign \n     contributions that politically active car dealers have given \n     to Congressional candidates over the years in explaining the \n     intense interest in going to bat for the dealers. But \n     lawmakers say that they are only trying to protect local jobs \n     at companies that have persevered in difficult times and that \n     donations have nothing to do with it.\n       Representative Dan Maffei, a freshman Democrat from New \n     York who helped write the measure to protect the dealers, \n     said that in his case, local car dealers strongly supported \n     the opposition. ``The vast majority are either nonpolitical \n     or support the other party pretty strongly,'' Mr. Maffei \n     said.\n       Mr. Maffei said he hoped his legislation, which has already \n     attracted about 70 co-sponsors, would spur new negotiations \n     between the car companies and the dealers.\n       The Obama administration has so far shown no inclination to \n     push back against the closures, noting that its efforts on \n     behalf of the manufacturers have kept most dealers in \n     business. And with Chrysler already cutting its ties with \n     dealers, undoing those decisions might be difficult. But \n     lawmakers say they intend to try.\n       ``We are sure that if we do nothing, nothing will happen,'' \n     said Representative Hoyer, the House majority leader and a \n     Maryland Democrat, who is backing the effort to restore the \n     franchise contracts.\n       But it may be too late to help Mr. Shaub. Workers on \n     Thursday were answering the phone at his business as Montrose \n     Automotive rather than Montrose Dodge. ``I am not sure this \n     is going to do any good,'' he said of the Congressional \n     effort.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From Politico, June 10, 2009]\n\n                 Members Take Auto Closings Personally\n\n                            (By Lisa Lerer)\n\n       On Monday, Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander excoriated House \n     Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank for \n     privately urging the CEO of GM to keep a plant open in his \n     Massachusetts district, jokingly calling Frank the ``car \n     czar.''\n       But on Tuesday, Alexander admitted he's not above taking \n     similar actions to protect a GM plant in his home state of \n     Tennessee.\n       ``I, of course, will urge that the Spring Hill plant be a \n     contender for a GM product in the future,'' Alexander said. \n     ``I'll be doing what every congressman would be doing.''\n       Alexander's two-sided approach captures the complicated web \n     of interests lawmakers weave as they call for greater \n     transparency from troubled U.S. automakers while lobbying \n     behind the scenes to protect the dealerships, distribution \n     plants and parts manufacturers in their own backyards.\n       ``Members have treated a potential dealership closure just \n     like a potential plant closing,'' said David Regan, National \n     Automobile Dealers Association vice president for, \n     legislative affairs. ``There's been a significant amount of \n     congressional interest.''\n       Legislation that would effectively halt plans by GM and \n     Chrysler to close dealerships is expected to move through the \n     House Financial Services Committee, chaired by the powerful \n     Frank.\n       ``We in Congress have put ourselves into an incestuous \n     position,'' said Alexander. ``We shouldn't be putting \n     ourselves a position of making calls like that.''\n       Yet they can't help themselves.\n       On Tuesday, Sen. John Rockefeller (D-W. Va.) and 19 other \n     members of the Senate Commerce Committee sent letters to the \n     CEOs of GM and Chrysler asking the companies to address \n     several issues related to the dealership closings by Friday. \n     The committee has questions about how rural consumers will \n     get service and about the termination of profitable \n     dealerships, among other issues. Several of the signers are \n     also aiding individual appeals from dealerships in their \n     districts.\n       Good-governance watchdogs see abuse in the double-edged \n     effort.\n       ``You have Barney Frank at the table making decisions that \n     affect the auto industry across the board and then he's \n     playing favorites,'' said Melanie Sloan, executive director \n     of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics. ``You don't get to \n     both be at the table and demanding the auto industry make \n     concessions which includes closing dealerships, and then say, \n     `But not mine.' ''\n       But Democrats insist the individual lobbying doesn't \n     undermine their efforts to force the auto companies to become \n     more transparent about how they targeted dealerships for \n     closure.\n       ``Mostly it's going to be based on the facts and the \n     money,'' said Minnesota Democrat Amy Klobuchar, who said \n     she's written letters on behalf of dealers who are appealing \n     their decisions.\n       ``It's normal that members are going to urge for decisions \n     to be made that benefit their constituents,'' said Sen. Carl \n     Levin (D-Mich.). ``I don't expect that there will be a lot of \n     changes.''\n       The White House auto task force wants GM to close 2,600 of \n     its 6,000 dealerships by 2010. Chrysler told nearly 800 \n     dealerships that they have less than a month to close. The \n     closures could affect 100,000 workers, according to the \n     National Automobile Dealers Association.\n       The companies have faced a backlash from members of \n     Congress who argue that the market, not the automakers, \n     should determine which dealerships stay in business. They \n     question whether manufactures are closing profitable \n     dealership to circumvent expensive contracts or targeting \n     dealerships that had previously clashed with the companies.\n       On Wednesday, the CEOs of General Motors and Chrysler will \n     testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The \n     Senate Banking Committee plans to question administration \n     officials overseeing the auto rescue efforts.\n       ``The White House needs to be fully apprised of this and \n     [needs] to review this process,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-\n     Maine). ``There's just no rhyme or reason to this process.''\n       And Snowe added that she hopes ``to have some personal \n     calls'' with the White House about the dealership closures.\n       House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on Tuesday that he \n     supports legislation that would force General Motors and \n     Chrysler to honor existing contracts with dealers.\n       ``The dealers are being affected in a way that will \n     adversely affect many, many communities around this country \n     without an economic benefit to the manufacturers,'' said \n     Hoyer.\n       His comments followed on a Monday letter more than 120 \n     lawmakers sent to President Barack Obama, urging the White \n     House to delay further action until there is more review of \n     how GM and Chrysler selected the dealerships.\n       ``It is our view that the market should make these \n     decisions rather than leaving it up to the manufacturers \n     whose poor leadership contributed to their demise,'' the \n     lawmakers wrote.\n       ``While we understand the desire to reduce the number of \n     unprofitable dealerships, no one has yet sufficiently \n     explained the need to close profitable dealerships.''\n       Auto companies argue that the closures are necessary for \n     their survival. The manufacturers are making fewer cars and \n     can't support the same number of dealers.\n       ``Ideally, automakers would love to have the sales to \n     support the current dealer network; however, with roughly 7 \n     million fewer units being sold this year compared to just two \n     years ago, there are economic realties that manufacturers and \n     dealers need to face,'' said Charles Territo, spokesman for \n     the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    Breaking Down Government Motors\n\n                           (By Brian Darling)\n\n       During a recent speech denouncing capitalism, Venezuelan \n     strong man Hugo Chavez said, ``Obama has just nationalized \n     nothing more and nothing less than General Motors. Comrade \n     Obama! Fidel, careful or we are going to end up to his \n     right.'' The conversion of General Motors to Government \n     Motors should be of grave concern to all Americans. It \n     appears that President Bush's bailout of Wall Street merely \n     set the table for an all-out assault by the Obama \n     administration on capitalism.\n       Thankfully, freedom still has a voice in Congress. Sen. \n     Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) introduced legislation that would \n     require Congressional approval before the government takes \n     ownership of a private enterprise. This bill would allow \n     Congress to stop the current shift away from free-market \n     principles.\n       Johanns is not the only free-marketer. Sen. Lamar Alexander \n     (R-Tenn.) has introduced legislation to require the federal \n     government to distribute its ownership shares in General \n     Motors and Chrysler to taxpayers when those companies emerge \n     from bankruptcy proceedings. Alexander argues, ``instead of \n     the Treasury owning 6o percent of shares in the new GM and 8 \n     percent of Chrysler, you would own them, if you were one of \n     about 120 million individuals who paid taxes on April 15. \n     This is the fastest way to get the stock out of the hands of \n     Washington and back into the hands of the American people in \n     the marketplace where it belongs.''\n       Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) also joined the fray last weekend, \n     introducing legislation that would restore private ownership \n     to companies that have been effectively nationalized. The \n     Thune proposal would make July 1, 2010 a new day of \n     independence. By that date, the government would have to sell \n     any ownership stake acquired over the past year-and-a-half. \n     There's no better way to fight the ever-expanding power of \n     the federal government's ownership in private enterprises \n     than to legislate it out of existence.\n       Speaking of debt, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke \n     told the House Budget Committee earlier this month ``we \n     cannot allow ourselves to be in a situation where the debt \n     continues to rise.'' Sen. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) responded, \n     ``Bernanke helped open up the floodgates of government \n     spending for the last year. Did he finally have an epiphany \n     this morning before the House Budget Committee or is he just \n     trying to cover-up his mistakes? America is looking at \n     mounting debt because of Chairman Bernanke's support of \n     policies that will put the American taxpayer an estimated \n     $2.8 trillion more in the red.'' The recent explosion of \n     government spending and expansion of the money supply by the \n     Fed are poor decisions by the Obama administration that will \n     further lead America down the pothole-filled road to \n     socialism.\n\n\n                    The Supreme Court of Health Care\n\n       The recently released health reform legislation drafted by \n     Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-\n\n[[Page S6758]]\n\n     Mass.) contains numerous provisions that propose fundamental \n     changes to our health care system. Many are deeply troubling. \n     One is the call for a Medical Advisory Council that would be \n     comprised of Washington bureaucrats with the power to make \n     significant decisions on health policy for all Americans. \n     This Council would become the Supreme Court of health care, \n     and these unelected bureaucrats would make final decisions \n     about your treatment options.\n       The Kennedy bill includes an individual mandate requiring \n     all Americans to purchase a health insurance plan approved by \n     the federal government. The Medical Advisory Council would \n     decide what constitutes a ``qualified health insurance \n     plan.'' It would also determine the ``essential health care \n     benefits'' that would be included in the much-discussed and \n     debated public-run government plan that would compete against \n     private health insurance plans if it's created.\n       To recap: a faceless group of Washington bureaucrats could \n     be making life-and-death decisions about private health care \n     for individuals.\n       Rather than propose reforms that truly offer Americans \n     better and more affordable health care, Senate Democrats and \n     the Obama administration seem eager to expand the role of \n     government in the lives of individual Americans and their \n     families. By pushing legislation that contains things like \n     the Medical Advisory Board these politicians are endangering \n     our freedoms and seek to come between individuals and their \n     health care choices.\n\n\n                   ``Save'' the Climate--Hurt Farmers\n\n       The national energy tax snaking its way through the House \n     of Representatives has a new potential victim--farmers. The \n     cap-and-trade scheme would increase energy prices, building \n     costs and a slow the economy. My colleagues at The Heritage \n     Foundation calculate that farm income, which is the pre-tax \n     amount that farmers live on after all their expenses, would \n     drop 28% in the bill's first year. In 2035, the last year \n     analyzed, farm income drops a whopping 98%. These numbers \n     should raise a red flag for Midwesteners, and cause concern \n     among all Americans who eat.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Athens Banner-Herald, June 9, 2009]\n\n           Editorial: Gimmicky Auto Bill Frames Serious Issue\n\n       The name betrays it for the political stunt that, in part, \n     it is. But that's not to say having Georgia Republican U.S. \n     Sen. Johnny Isakson sign on to something called the Auto \n     Stock for Every Taxpayer Act is anywhere near as embarrassing \n     as having another Georgia Republican in Washington, our own \n     Congressman Paul Broun, dubbing energy legislation sponsored \n     by Democratic legislators dward Markey and Henry Waxman the \n     ``Wacky-Marxist bill.''\n       The stunt in the proposed Auto Stock for Every Taxpayer \n     Act, sponsored by Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander \n     and appended to a piece of tobacco regulation legislation, is \n     its call for the U.S. Treasury to distribute an equal share \n     of stock in General Motors and Chrysler to the 120 million \n     Americans who filed tax returns on April 15.\n       The distribution would be undertaken a year after the \n     companies emerge from bankruptcy, on the argument that \n     American taxpayers who are funding the federal bailouts of \n     the two companies hold, through the U.S. Treasury, 60 percent \n     and 8 percent ownership stakes, respectively, in the \n     enterprises.\n       Of course, the flaw in this proposal is that it's far from \n     clear what General Motors and Chrysler will look like, and \n     what their stock will be worth, even a year after they emerge \n     from bankruptcy. For a reality check, take a look at GM \n     stock. Delisted from the New York Stock Exchange as its stock \n     hit 75 cents per share, GM was trading Tuesday afternoon \n     around $1.50 per share on the over-the-counter market.\n       And, of course, the fact that the federal government now \n     has a hand in running the auto companies isn't necessarily \n     cause for optimism. As Alexander noted in a news release on \n     his proposal last week, ``there are at least 60 congressional \n     committees and subcommittees authorized to hold hearings on \n     auto companies and most of them will, probably many times. \n     You can just imagine the questions. About what the next model \n     should look like. About which plant should be closed. . . . \n     What the work rules and salaries should be?''\n       So maybe the Auto Stock for Every Taxpayer Act isn't the \n     key to boosting millions of American families' college or \n     retirement funds. But that--except for the fact that it \n     allows a catchy title to be assigned to the legislation--\n     isn't necessarily the point here.\n       The real meat of the proposal is its call to prohibit the \n     U.S. Treasury from using any more federal Troubled Asset \n     Relief Program fund--read American taxpayer dollars--to bail \n     out GM or Chrysler. As Isakson correctly notes in his own \n     news release announcing his support for Sen. Alexander's \n     bill, ``I believe it was obvious back in December 2008 that a \n     structured bankruptcy was the correct path for GM and \n     Chrysler to restructure their debt and contracts. By giving \n     these companies taxpayer funds from TARP, the administration \n     only delayed the inevitable . . . .''\n       Outside its somewhat gimmicky approach, the Auto Stock for \n     Every Taxpayer Act does serve to highlight the serious \n     philosophical issues surrounding the question of whether the \n     free market should be allowed to operate unfettered with \n     regard to major segments of the American automobile industry.\n       It's a question that deserves some serious consideration in \n     Congress.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Tennessee is a great gentleman. He is a pleasure to work with.\n  The legislation that is on the Senate floor is the Travel Promotion \nAct. This is an important piece of legislation that will help our \neconomy because it promotes travel to the United States, and it \npromotes travel to areas not traditionally visited which will highlight \nthe United States as a premier travel destination. The bill initiates a \nnationally coordinated travel promotion campaign established in a \npublic-private partnership to increase international travel to the \nUnited States. It also creates a corporation for travel promotion, an \nindependent, nonprofit corporation, to run the travel promotion \ncampaign. The program will be funded equally by a small fee paid by \nforeign travelers coming into the United States and by matching \ncontributions from the travel industry.\n  It is interesting that the Department of Commerce announced that 3.8 \nmillion international visitors traveled to this country in March 2009, \nwhich was a decrease of 20 percent compared to March of 2008. Total \nvisitation in the first quarter of 2009 was down 14 percent from the \nfirst quarter of 2008. International visitors spent almost $10 billion \nduring the month of March, 16 percent less than they had a year ago. \nThis March of 2009 marks the fifth consecutive month of decreases in \ninternational visitor spending. So the bill is going to go a long way \nto help reverse the declining trend.\n  I remember back in the 1980s, when I, as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, chaired the U.S. Congressional Travel and Tourism \nCaucus. We had this little agency in the Department of Commerce that \nleveraged so much of the taxpayers' dollars by advertising overseas to \nget visitors to come here which brought spending to our shores. That is \nwhat we are trying to recreate here in the meantime and have been shut \ndown. We are certainly cutting off our noses to spite our faces. This \nlegislation clearly is something that is important to the country.\n  It is important to Florida because, of course, my State is one of the \nfirst destinations of foreign travelers coming to the United States. \nDespite obvious attractions such as Disney World, Florida beaches are \nranked 1, 2, and 3, and No. 9 in a recent ranking of all beaches as the \nbest beaches in the United States. Clearly, this is good for Florida. \nIt is good for the United States. I hope we will get on with it and \npass this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6758-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6758-S6759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RISING GAS PRICES\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, while we debate the Tourism \nPromotion Act, we are remiss to not mention the fact that as we are \ngoing into this travel and tourism season of summer, what is happening \nwith gas prices. Gas prices have risen for the last 50 days. It has \nbeen the longest record streak of rises, dating back to 1996. The \nnational average of gas has gone from $1.61 a year ago to more than \n$2.67 a gallon today. Crude oil is now over $70 a barrel. It has \ndoubled in the last 4 months. How soon we forget the lessons we learned \na year ago during last summer. In the runup of the oil and gas prices, \nit wasn't the result of the fundamental concepts of supply and demand. \nIt is largely runup due to excessive and unchecked speculators on \nunregulated commodities futures markets, running up the price of oil as \nthey speculate buying and selling.\n  It is a fact that across America, we are using less gas. According to \nthe Energy Information Administration, demand for petroleum products in \nthis country is lower today than it was 10 years ago. According to the \nEIA, the supply of petroleum products is higher than it was in 1982. So \nwe wonder why. If this isn't being caused by supply and demand, which \nit isn't, but gas prices keep going up, what is happening?\n  There is going to be an amendment on this bill offered by Senator \nSanders. I ask unanimous consent to be\n\n[[Page S6759]]\n\nadded as a cosponsor of amendment No. 1330.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That amendment is identical to legislation \npassed in the House of Representatives by a whopping vote of 402 to 19. \nIt will put the brakes on excessive speculation in the oil markets. The \nbill directs the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to use its \nexisting authority, including its emergency powers, to immediately curb \nthe role of excessive speculation in any market it regulates and to \neliminate excessive speculation, price distortion, sudden or \nunreasonable fluctuations, or unwarranted changes in prices.\n  We wonder how does this occur. It occurs because as people get into \nthe marketplace wanting to protect against the future rise of the price \nof a barrel of oil, they buy a contract to lock in a certain price for \nthat oil to be delivered in the future. Naturally, a business that \nwould want to do that would be, for example, the airlines. If they \nthink the price of oil is going up, they want to get in and buy a \nsupply of that petroleum at the price now before it goes up. What \nhappens is, when these commodities exchanges were unregulated by the \nEnron loophole in December of 2000, there is no regulatory authority by \nthese exchanges.\n  So, for example, they could not require a certain amount to pay down, \nif you are going to buy that futures contract. And if you don't have to \npay anything down, then there is no skin in the game of just continuing \nto buy and bid up the price. Or, for example, they could require that \nyou had to buy those contracts because you had a reasonable expectation \nyou were going to use that in the future, like an airline company. But, \nno, what happens is, if you don't have to have that reasonable \nexpectation, the people who want to get in and ride that price up--in \nother words, the speculators, such as the condo flippers who buy a \ncondo because the rise in price is going to occur and will flip the \ncontract for the purchase of the condominium without ever having to \nclose. It is the same concept of speculation.\n  We should note this does not apply only to the markets the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission does regulate. There are still \ndark markets beyond the regulators' control. There is respectful debate \namongst some in the Senate over the reach of the provision we passed in \nthe farm bill last year that gave the Commodities Futures Trading \nCommission the oversight over unregulated trading of large oil \ncontracts.\n  We have to go further. I recently learned that the commission, the \nCFTC, is now utilizing its new authority for the first time. I believe \nwhat we have to do is to give them additional tools to go further than \njust discretionary oversight and that they should be able to regulate \nall energy trades.\n  In addition to the Sanders amendment, ultimately, I wish the Senate \nwould consider a bill I have filed that would simply turn the clock \nback to December of 2000 when the Enron loophole was passed, before \nthese sweeping changes were made that allowed rampant and excessive \nspeculation in the energy markets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6759-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LEADERSHIP AT THE CPSC\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I wish to speak to the \nnomination of Inez Tenenbaum to be Chair of the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. Over the past few years, the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission has faced a number of serious challenges: inadequate \nstaffing, insufficient funding, a product testing facility that was a \njoke. As a matter of fact, we saw a picture of it--it was a couple of \ncardboard tables with all of the imported toys dumped on it--when we \nwere having that trouble with the defective imported Chinese toys. Most \nsignificantly, it lacked leadership at the top.\n  We took action last year, and we gave the CPSC new authority, new \nfunding, and a new lab facility. Today we have to deal with the final \nissue, and that is leadership. I commend to the Senate that I think \nInez Tenenbaum is going to be that leader. She had her nomination \nhearing earlier this week in the Commerce Committee. Throughout her \ncareer in the South Carolina Legislature, Inez Tenenbaum showed \ncompassion and leadership on environmental and children's issues. Then \nshe was South Carolina's superintendent of education. It was an elected \nposition. She took charge and reinvigorated an agency with over 1,000 \nemployees. By the time she stepped down from that post in 2007, she was \nrecognized for her efforts to improve the accountability, standards, \nand performance in South Carolina's public schools. I think this is \nexactly the kind of leadership the CPSC needs at this time. I met with \nher personally, and I know her personally, and I strongly support her \nnomination.\n\n  So my concluding comment is, we are not only having problems in \nFlorida with Chinese drywall--Chinese drywall that is completely \nruining the lives of people in their homes because of the smell and the \ncorrosion and the sickness that it is bringing on to people--lo and \nbehold, they are finding that Chinese drywall now in daycare centers, \nin commercial buildings, and it is even reported in Virginia that they \nare finding it in a hospital.\n  This is going to be a big issue in front of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission. They have the authority under the law to do \nsomething about it. They have lacked the leadership. Now, with Inez \nTenenbaum, they ought to be able to start doing the regulatory \noversight that the U.S. Government should have been doing in the first \nplace with these defective imported products into our country.\n  That is why I think we need to go ahead and get Ms. Tenenbaum \nconfirmed as quickly as possible.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, for just a minute, I want to talk about \nhealth care. I am a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee. We began yesterday the opening statements on the bill that \nis pervasive in its coverage around the country as to the future of \nhealth care in America.\n  I rise as one not to be a critic but to lay out the challenge this \nlegislation portends for all of us and maybe to raise some points that \nthoughtfully will be considered before we make a serious mistake on the \nfunding side, the expense side, and the borrowing side.\n  A few weeks ago, in Georgia, at a Rotary speech, I referred to ``a \ntrillion-dollars in debt.'' A gentleman stood up in the Q and A section \nof that time, and he said: Senator Isakson, I only got a high school \neducation. Can you explain to me what a trillion is?\n  I do not know how many of you have thought about that, but if you had \nto do it right now, could you explain what it is? I could not. So I \ndecided to go home that night and figure out some easy way to \ndemonstrate how much a\n\n[[Page S6760]]\n\ntrillion is. I thought maybe it would be good to determine how many \nseconds it takes for a trillion seconds to go by. So I did the math on \nthe calculator. I thought I made a mistake and did it again. I had it \nchecked.\n  It takes 317,097 years, 11 months, and 2 days for a trillion seconds \nto go by. That is almost incomprehensible, but it does give you some \nidea of the issues we have to be concerned about in terms of spending \nand cost and savings.\n  The CBO has scored the parts of the health bill that have actually \nbeen drafted--which is about two-thirds of it--at a potential cost of \n$1 trillion over 10 years. Obviously, we are going to have to pay for \nthat. There have been some discussions in the last few days of \nsuggested pay-fors. But I want to discuss for a minute how we have to \nbe very careful not to use words such as ``a pay-for'' that in fact \nonly move obligations around.\n  For example, President Obama, for whom I have great respect, said to \nthe medical association on Monday that one of the pay-fors, by having \npublic coverage for everybody, would mean there would be no indigent \npatients; therefore, everybody would be getting paid for their services \nand that would save us $11 billion a year in DSH payments, which is the \ndisproportionate share of treatments which charity hospitals in New \nYork and Atlanta get through Medicaid because they take a \ndisproportionate number of indigent patients.\n  There is only one flaw in that analysis. Yes, we might not \nappropriate $11 billion a year for disproportionate share anymore, but \nwe are not doing it because we are raising Medicaid coverage to 150 \npercent of poverty and providing health insurance through a public \nplan. So the cost remains the same. It just moves from a cost to pay \ncharity hospitals for disproportionate share to a cost of providing the \ncoverage through Medicaid or through the private plan.\n  The unintended consequence of removing disproportionate share would \nbe taking the economic model through which charity hospitals are \nfinanced and turning it upside down. Because in my city of Atlanta, for \nexample, where Grady Hospital exists--and Grady has gone through a \nreformation; we have created a foundation, and we have done everything \nwe can to save the hospital--it gets a tremendous part of the DSH \npayment from Medicaid for disproportionate share because it takes a \ndisproportionate number of the indigent patients because private for-\nprofit hospitals will not. But if private for-profit hospitals have \nindigent patients who now have coverage, and they are closer to the \npatient than Grady is, the patient will then go to the private \nhospital, so the DSH payment goes down or evaporates for the public \nhospital, and so does the funding mechanism upon which their public \nbonds and their public debt were financed. So we have to be careful \nabout the unintended consequences.\n  Secondly, on Medicaid, I am a product of the Georgia State \nlegislature, and I know the distinguished Acting President pro tempore \ntoday is a product of the New York Assembly. We all dealt with \nMedicaid. Medicaid is a program where the Federal Government pays about \ntwo-thirds of it. The States pay about a third of it. And the States \nrun it.\n  When we got into this business of expanding Medicaid under this \nlegislation to 150 percent of poverty--which is a 50-percent increase \nin eligibility--I thought back to my days in the legislature about how \nmuch money that was that my State then was going to have to come up \nwith under the one-third match.\n  In Georgia, in 1968--the first year we had Medicaid--the State's \nshare of Medicaid for the year was $7,791,000. In 2008, the State's \nshare was $2,468,376,258, which would go up by $1 billion if we raised \nthe eligibility to 150 percent.\n  I know the President has said that for 4 years the Federal Government \nwill take over the entire obligation of that increase to 150 percent. \nBut that is only putting off the inevitable for the States, which will \nbe a percent of their budget they cannot afford.\n  Medicaid, in Georgia, in 40 years has gone from 1 percent of our \nbudget to 12 percent of our budget. With this proposal, it would go to \n18 percent.\n  We must remember, in the economic stimulus bill, a significant amount \nof that money was Medicaid money to go to the States to fund what is \nalready an existing shortfall.\n  So I come to the floor to say this: I am for every goal of the \npreamble of the health care bill that has been introduced in the HELP \nCommittee. I want to make policies more affordable, coverage more \npervasive, access easier, and I want to lower costs. But as Acting \nChairman Dodd said yesterday in the committee, history will not look \nfavorably on you if you do not do something because it is hard. He is \nright. But neither will history look favorably upon you if you do \nsomething easy when it is hard. This is hard work, and we cannot take \nthe easy way out to pile debt on the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Hopefully we will thoughtfully consider these ramifications I have \ndiscussed and others and move forward with a health proposal we can pay \nfor and that accomplishes its goals rather than an easy answer that \nputs us in a desperate situation as a country and ultimately takes us \nto an economic demise in this country.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the time and I yield to my colleague \nfrom the great State of Arizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I appreciate very much the wise words of \nthe Senator from Georgia, who has been heavily involved in health care \nissues dating back to his time in the Georgia legislature and brings a \nunique perspective to the issue, that of a person who has had to, as an \nelected representative, wrestle with these issues from not only the \nFederal level but also the State. So I appreciate his words.\n  As the Senator from Georgia pointed out, this is probably the single \nmost important domestic issue that will be taken up by the Congress of \nthe United States, at least this year, and maybe in the next couple \nyears, and maybe in a long time when you look at the fact that we are \naddressing an issue that basically consumes one-fifth of our gross \nnational product, not to mention the fact that the system is broken, \nthat the inflationary pressures are unsustainable, and there are \nmillions of Americans who do not have access to quality, affordable \nhealth care.\n  So where are we now in the Senate? I think it is time for a little \nstatus report.\n  The Finance Committee--remember, there are two committees that are on \nparallel tracks taking up this health care legislation, the Finance \nCommittee and the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee--the \nFinance Committee yesterday announced they will delay their \nconsideration until after the Fourth of July recess.\n  The day before, the Congressional Budget Office came out with a \nreport that was nothing less than stunning. It indicated that the \nproposal the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is \nconsidering would have a cost of $1 trillion and only insure \napproximately one-third of the 47 million who are uninsured, which \nwould lead one to the conclusion--doing the most elementary math--that \nif we were able to insure all of the uninsured in America, that would \nbe a cost of $3 trillion. And we still have no proposal as to how we \nwould pay for this dramatic expansion of the role of government in \nAmerica's health care system.\n  Never before in the years I have been here have I seen a ``markup,'' \nwhich means we begin the amending process of a bill through the \nlegislature, as we teach our children in school, and yet three major \npolicy pages are still completely blank--completely blank.\n  We are told we will see these new policies at some point tomorrow. \nThat is after we were told we would see them today. And then the \nmajority, the Democrats, who are coming up with this language \nthemselves--without any consultation with this side of the aisle--will \ngive us a chance to review it. Those three areas are the most difficult \naspects of reforming health care in America.\n  Those policies, as we all know, concern the way we pay for the new \nlanguage on employer mandates, the government plan, and the biologic \ndrug regulation.\n  There is a government option that will be part of this legislation, \ni.e., a government takeover eventually, in\n\n[[Page S6761]]\n\nmy view, of the health care system in America, something a majority of \nAmericans have voiced their deep concern about--employer mandates, and \nbiologic drug regulation.\n  So here we are supposedly moving forward, and the administration \nspokesperson in the last couple of days said the bill that is being \nconsidered by the HELP Committee is not, ``the administration's bill.'' \nWhat is the administration's bill? Where is the administration's bill? \nWe have no idea what the provisions I just mentioned will cost or \nwhether they will create jobs and whether the American people will be \ncalled upon to pay an increase in taxes and, if so, who will pay them. \nI do not know how you move forward with legislation that, frankly, you \ndo not know how you are going to pay for.\n  How can the President and the majority expect the American people to \ntake them seriously when they talk of wanting a bipartisan product that \naddresses their needs when, at the same time, majority members and \ntheir staff have written the entire bill without any input from this \nside of the aisle? I assure you, the American people would have much \nmore confidence in this effort if both Republicans and Democrats were \nworking together on health care reform. Instead of changing Washington, \nit sounds an awful lot like a one-sided effort to jam a bill through \nbefore the American people understand what is in it.\n  This morning, there is some very interesting data. According to a \nCBS/New York Times survey, the President holds a 57-percent approval \nrating, which is very good. On health care, his approval rating is 44 \npercent. That is way down, and it is down because the American people \nare beginning to figure out that we are going to have a proposal that \nwill end in government control of American's health care, it will \nsqueeze out competition, and it will be incredibly expensive. As I \nmentioned, the CBO preliminary estimate is $1 trillion, but insures \nonly one-third of the American people, and it leaves 32 million people \nwithout health insurance.\n\n  So we hear that the Finance Committee, as I mentioned, is in such \ndisarray over the costs and policies in their bill that they have \npostponed their consideration until after the Fourth of July break. \nThey obviously don't have their policies together enough to move \nforward. It appears to me, from my service on the Health Committee, \nthat it does not either.\n  I think the only reasonable thing to do is to go back to the drawing \nboard. Let's go back to the beginning. Let's sit down together and work \nout a reasonable proposal that we can go to the American people with \nthat says we will provide them with affordable and available health \ncare. Every American knows the costs are out of control, everybody \nknows it needs to be reformed. But we will do so without a government \ntakeover of America's health care system.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the clerk \nread the entire text of the resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 26), apologizing for \n     the enslavement and racial segregation of African Americans.\n       Whereas, during the history of the Nation, the United \n     States has grown into a symbol of democracy and freedom \n     around the world;\n       Whereas the legacy of African Americans is interwoven with \n     the very fabric of the democracy and freedom of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas millions of Africans and their descendants were \n     enslaved in the United States and the 13 American colonies \n     from 1619 through 1865;\n       Whereas Africans forced into slavery were brutalized, \n     humiliated, dehumanized, and subjected to the indignity of \n     being stripped of their names and heritage;\n       Whereas many enslaved families were torn apart after family \n     members were sold separately;\n       Whereas the system of slavery and the visceral racism \n     against people of African descent upon which it depended \n     became enmeshed in the social fabric of the United States;\n       Whereas slavery was not officially abolished until the \n     ratification of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States in 1865, after the end of the Civil War;\n       Whereas after emancipation from 246 years of slavery, \n     African Americans soon saw the fleeting political, social, \n     and economic gains they made during Reconstruction \n     eviscerated by virulent racism, lynchings, \n     disenfranchisement, Black Codes, and racial segregation laws \n     that imposed a rigid system of officially sanctioned racial \n     segregation in virtually all areas of life;\n       Whereas the system of de jure racial segregation known as \n     ``Jim Crow'', which arose in certain parts of the United \n     States after the Civil War to create separate and unequal \n     societies for Whites and African Americans, was a direct \n     result of the racism against people of African descent that \n     was engendered by slavery;\n       Whereas the system of Jim Crow laws officially existed \n     until the 1960's--a century after the official end of slavery \n     in the United States--until Congress took action to end it, \n     but the vestiges of Jim Crow continue to this day;\n       Whereas African Americans continue to suffer from the \n     consequences of slavery and Jim Crow laws--long after both \n     systems were formally abolished--through enormous damage and \n     loss, both tangible and intangible, including the loss of \n     human dignity and liberty;\n       Whereas the story of the enslavement and de jure \n     segregation of African Americans and the dehumanizing \n     atrocities committed against them should not be purged from \n     or minimized in the telling of the history of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas those African Americans who suffered under slavery \n     and Jim Crow laws, and their descendants, exemplify the \n     strength of the human character and provide a model of \n     courage, commitment, and perseverance;\n       Whereas, on July 8, 2003, during a trip to Goree Island, \n     Senegal, a former slave port, President George W. Bush \n     acknowledged the continuing legacy of slavery in life in the \n     United States and the need to confront that legacy, when he \n     stated that slavery ``was . . . one of the greatest crimes of \n     history . . . The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not end \n     with slavery or with segregation. And many of the issues that \n     still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience of \n     other times. But however long the journey, our destiny is \n     set: liberty and justice for all.'';\n       Whereas President Bill Clinton also acknowledged the deep-\n     seated problems caused by the continuing legacy of racism \n     against African Americans that began with slavery, when he \n     initiated a national dialogue about race;\n       Whereas an apology for centuries of brutal dehumanization \n     and injustices cannot erase the past, but confession of the \n     wrongs committed and a formal apology to African Americans \n     will help bind the wounds of the Nation that are rooted in \n     slavery and can speed racial healing and reconciliation and \n     help the people of the United States understand the past and \n     honor the history of all people of the United States;\n       Whereas the legislatures of the Commonwealth of Virginia \n     and the States of Alabama, Florida, Maryland, and North \n     Carolina have taken the lead in adopting resolutions \n     officially expressing appropriate remorse for slavery, and \n     other State legislatures are considering similar resolutions; \n     and\n       Whereas it is important for the people of the United \n     States, who legally recognized slavery through the \n     Constitution and the laws of the United States, to make a \n     formal apology for slavery and for its successor, Jim Crow, \n     so they can move forward and seek reconciliation, justice, \n     and harmony for all people of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the sense of the Congress is the following:\n       (1) Apology for the enslavement and segregation of african-\n     americans.--The Congress--\n\n[[Page S6762]]\n\n       (A) acknowledges the fundamental injustice, cruelty, \n     brutality, and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow laws;\n       (B) apologizes to African Americans on behalf of the people \n     of the United States, for the wrongs committed against them \n     and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow \n     laws; and\n       (C) expresses its recommitment to the principle that all \n     people are created equal and endowed with inalienable rights \n     to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and calls on \n     all people of the United States to work toward eliminating \n     racial prejudices, injustices, and discrimination from our \n     society.\n       (2) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this resolution--\n       (A) authorizes or supports any claim against the United \n     States; or\n       (B) serves as a settlement of any claim against the United \n     States.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 60 minutes of debate with respect to the concurrent \nresolution, with the time equally divided and controlled between the \ntwo leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the clerk read, for the first time ever \nin this body, what we should have done a long time ago: an apology for \nslavery and the Jim Crow laws which, for a century after emancipation, \ndeprived millions of Americans their basic human rights, equal justice \nunder law, and equal opportunities. Today, in the Senate, we \nunanimously make that apology.\n  First of all, I wish to thank my friend, Senator Sam Brownback, for \nall his hard work over the last couple years working together to get \nthis finally to this point. I can't thank him enough. He wouldn't give \nup, and he stuck in there with us all the time, working to make sure \nthat this day would come. I thank him profusely for his help in this \neffort.\n  I also wish to publicly thank Congressman Steve Cohen, on the House \nside, who is the leader of this resolution that they will pass soon \nover there.\n  John Quincy Adams once remarked that:\n\n       Our country began its existence by the universal \n     emancipation of man from the thralldom of man.\n\n  Indeed, America's purpose and enduring ideal can be summed up in one \nsimple, but powerful, sentence:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are \n     created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain \n     inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and \n     the pursuit of happiness.\n\n  Yet, as we all know, for too long, many in this country were not \nfree. Many lived in bondage. Many Americans were denied their basic \nhuman rights and liberty. From 1619 to 1865, over 4 million Africans \nand their descendants were enslaved in the United States. Millions were \nkidnapped from their homeland and suffered unimaginable hardships, \nincluding death, during the Middle Passage voyage to America--a crime \nagainst humanity. In Elmina Castle, on the coast of Ghana, a place I \nrecently visited, there is a chillingly named ``Door of No Return''--an \ninfamous open portal which, as one looks over the horizon across the \nAtlantic, makes all too clear the excruciating inhumanity and horror \nfaced by the men and women shackled inside this Castle as they were led \nthrough that door and put on the slave ships bound for America; led \nthrough that door, enslaved, never to return to their families, their \ntribe or their native land.\n  On American soil, these individuals were treated as property. These \nhuman beings were denied basic rights, including the right to their own \nname and heritage; any rights to education; even the right to maintain \na family were denied to them. As Chief Justice Taney sadly made all too \nclear in the infamous Dred Scott case, he said of African Americans--\nand I quote from his decision--African Americans:\n\n       [Were] not included, and were not intended to be included, \n     under the word ``citizens'' in the Constitution, and [could] \n     therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that \n     instrument provides for and secures to the citizens of the \n     United States. On the contrary, they were at that time \n     considered as a subordinate and inferior class of beings, who \n     had been subjugated by the dominant race, and, whether \n     emancipated or not, yet remained subject to their authority, \n     and had no rights or privileges but such as those who held \n     the power and the Government might choose to grant them.\n\n  That is one of the saddest decisions ever made by the Supreme Court \nof the United States.\n  While the Reconstruction amendments--the 13th amendment banning \nslavery, the 14th amendment granting full citizenship to all Americans, \nand the 15th amendment guaranteeing the right to vote--espoused the \nprinciples of equality for all, widespread oppression continued. Under \nslavery's harsh replacement, Jim Crow, African Americans were denied \nvoting rights, denied employment opportunities, denied access to public \naccommodations, denied entry into military service, denied criminal \njustice protections, denied housing, education, police protection, and \ndue process. In short, they were denied their very humanity. Not until \npassage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, \nand other Federal protections, did legal segregation officially cease \nin this country.\n  The destructive effects of both slavery and Jim Crow remain, however. \nAs President Bush noted, ``The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not \nend with slavery or with segregation.'' President Clinton likewise \nstated that the racial divide is ``America's constant curse.'' Today, \nmany African Americans remain mired in poverty, and average incomes \nremain below that of White Americans. There remains an achievement gap \nin education, and for many health conditions, African Americans bear a \ndisproportionate burden of disease, injury, death, and disability. \nAfrican Americans are, moreover, disproportionately involved with the \ncriminal justice system.\n  Recently, States--Alabama, Connecticut, Maryland, Florida, New \nJersey, North Carolina, and Virginia--enacted resolutions apologizing \nfor the role their States played in sanctioning and promoting slavery \nand segregation.\n  Corporations such as J.P. Morgan, Aetna, and Wachovia have also \nacknowledged and apologized for their role in, and profit from, \nslavery.\n  Slavery, Jim Crow laws, and their lasting consequences, however, are \nan enduring national shame. It was the United States that enshrined \nslavery in the Constitution and protected it for nearly a century. It \nis Congress that passed the shameful laws, such as the Missouri \nCompromise of 1820 and Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which protected and \nfurthered slavery. It was our Nation's Supreme Court which bolstered \nslavery and legally sanctioned segregation, as I said, in the Dred \nScott case of 1857, and Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. The Court said we \ncould be separate but equal. It was the Federal Government which was \nofficially segregated. By 1913, all Federal departments were \nsegregated. It was the United States which kept African Americans who \nwanted nothing more than to serve their country segregated in the \nmilitary. It was not until 1948 that President Truman issued the \nexecutive order desegregating the military.\n  Presidents as far back as John Adams have acknowledged the injustice \nof slavery. In 1998, President Clinton spoke of the evils of slavery \nand expressed regret for America's role in the slave trade. In 2004, \nPresident Bush visited Goree Island, a holding place for captured \nslaves in Africa, and spoke of the wrongs and injustices of slavery, \ncalling it ``one of the great crimes of history.''\n  Moreover, in 1988, Congress rightly apologized for the internment of \nJapanese Americans held during World War II. In 1993, Congress justly \napologized to native Hawaiians for overthrowing their king. The Senate \nhas correctly apologized for its failure to enact antilynching \nlegislation. Last year, as part of the Indian health bill, the Senate \npassed an amendment apologizing, rightfully, to Native Americans.\n  Yet this Congress has never offered a formal apology for slavery and \nJim Crow, and it is long past due. A national apology by the \nrepresentative body of the people is a necessary, collective response \nto a past collective injustice. It is both appropriate and imperative \nthat Congress fulfill its moral obligations and officially apologize \nfor slavery and Jim Crow laws.\n  As we acknowledge and apologize for this great injustice, we would be \nremiss, however, to fail to recognize those Americans who, with great \ncourage, fought to ensure that this country lived up to its founding \nideals. Hundreds of thousands served their country\n\n[[Page S6763]]\n\nand risked their lives so others could be free, and many gave, in the \nwords of Abraham Lincoln, ``the last full measure of their devotion.''\n  From the beginning of the Republic to the present, individuals of all \nraces, nationalities, genders, creeds, and religions have risked much, \nincluding their lives, striving for a better and more just America. It \nis these often nameless individuals who registered voters in the \nMississippi Delta, marched over the bridge at Selma, fought for better \njobs and housing in northern cities, and desegregated lunch counters.\n  I point to people such as Edna Griffen, John Bibbs, and Leonard \nHudson. In 1948, they entered Katz Drugstore in Des Moines, IA, on a \nhot summer day and ordered Cokes and ice cream at a segregated lunch \ncounter. When the manager refused to serve them because the store did \nnot ``serve coloreds,'' Ms. Griffen refused to leave, and outraged \nIowans responded with sit-ins and picketed Katz and other restaurants \nthat refused to serve people because of their race. And they won. The \nlunch counters were desegregated. Who but a handful knows of Edna \nGriffen, John Bibbs, or Leonard Hudson? It is only because of the \nextraordinary acts of bravery by ordinary Americans like these in all \ncorners of this country that the mighty walls of oppression have been \ntorn down. As this Nation formally apologizes and acknowledges slavery \nand Jim Crow, we must also recognize that this Nation owes these \nindividuals, most known only to their friends and families, an enormous \ndebt of gratitude.\n  As we make this formal apology, moreover, we must acknowledge and \ncelebrate the deep, lasting contributions that slaves, former slaves, \nand their descendents have made to this country in every field of human \nendeavor--law, literature, science, medicine, art, business, education, \nsports, and politics. Indeed, the list goes on and on. Six months ago, \nan African American took the oath of office as President of the United \nStates for the first time in our Nation's history.\n  In conclusion, I want to read from the resolution, so all those in \nthe gallery and the American people hear the long overdue words \nemanating from this body:\n\n       Congress acknowledges the fundamental injustice, cruelty, \n     brutality, and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow law; \n     apologizes to African Americans on behalf of the people of \n     the United States, for the wrongs committed against them and \n     their ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow law; \n     and expresses its recommitment to the principle that all \n     people are created equal and endowed with inalienable rights \n     to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and calls on \n     all people of the United States to work toward eliminating \n     racial prejudices, injustices and discrimination from our \n     society.\n\n  In closing, I think it is important to note that this resolution will \nsoon pass by unanimous consent, which means every Senator supports it \nwithout objection.\n  Finally, let us make no mistake, this resolution will not fix \nlingering injustices. While we are proud of this resolution and believe \nit is long overdue, the real work lies ahead. Let us continue to work \ntogether to create better opportunities for all Americans. That is \ntruly the best way to address the lasting legacy of slavery and Jim \nCrow.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, first, I start with acknowledging a \ncouple of individuals. First and foremost, the Senator from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, has orchestrated and navigated this matter to bring it \nforward. I think everybody owes a deep debt of gratitude to him and his \nstaff for getting this done.\n  This is a significant day and a significant event. It doesn't happen \nwithout a lot of effort. It is going to be one of those days and places \nand times that goes down in history in this body. It is important. It \nis important to us. It is important to the Nation, and it is important \nthat it be clearly acknowledged, and it is going to get done. I thank \nmy colleague from Iowa for getting this organized and moving it \nforward. I also thank, obviously, the majority leader for setting this \ntime up, the Republican leader, and our colleagues, particularly \nSenator Levin, who is a sponsor, and on our side, Senator Cochran, \nSenator Bond, and many others.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this time that Senator Corker be added as \na cosponsor to the resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Also, our staffs worked very hard on this. I have to \nthank LaRochelle Young on my staff, who has worked hard on this issue. \nShe has been dedicated to get this through and forward. I thank her for \nher great work.\n  It is my experience that apologies are tough to do. They are tough as \nindividuals, tough as groups, and tough as nations. When this issue \nwould come up, a lot of people would say: Yes, I acknowledge that \nhappened, but I didn't do it or that happened a long time ago, so can't \nwe move past it? Yet my experience has been that until you actually \nacknowledge the wrong that has been done and say, ``I did this and it \nwas wrong and I apologize,'' there remains a barrier there--something \nyou cannot get over, no matter how many words you put around it, no \nmatter how much feeling may be there, until you actually say it. That \nis why apologies are tough, because they are hard to do when they get \nright at the core of the issue. They get at the core that a wrong was \ndone. What we are saying in the Senate today is that a wrong was done--\na wrong of slavery was done by the Federal Government of the United \nStates, a wrong of segregation was done by the Federal Government of \nthe United States. We acknowledge that. We say it was wrong and we ask \nfor forgiveness for that.\n  It doesn't fix everything, as Senator Harkin pointed out but it does \ngo a long way toward acknowledging it and it gives us the ability to \nmove to the next step in building a more perfect union, and do the \nthings that Martin Luther King would talk about, where you can have a \ncolorblind society. It is significant and important that we do it.\n  I think in my own personal experiences in this category, learning \nabout William Wilberforce, from the British Parliament, who worked on \nending the slave trade in Great Britain. It was a key issue for them to \nget over that hurdle. It took years and they got it done. I also \nacknowledge friends of mine, in current iterations, who traveled across \nAmerica with a kettle. This kettle was a kettle that former slaves used \nto cook in. They would do the evening cooking for their meals in it. \nThis was kind of the gathering place for the slaves--this gentleman's \nancestors' kettle. He took it around the country and he would talk \nabout them getting together and using it for a meal. After the meal was \ndone, they would clean the kettle, and it was big enough that they \nwould actually huddle under the kettle and pray. They would pray for \ntheir freedom. That was the kettle tour. Their aspiration and hope for \nso many years was to be free. They were taking the kettle around the \ncountry as a physical symbol of the yearning for freedom that the \npeople had. The slaveowners would get mad about it, but they could not \nhear them as they would mutter their silent and soft prayers under the \nkettle. I have seen many different physical representations of what has \ntaken place.\n  I grew up in eastern Kansas, where the fight started about whether my \nState would be a free State or a slave State. In the Nebraska-Kansas \ncompromise that this body crafted, Nebraska was supposed to be a free \nState and Kansas a slave State because Iowans would come across to \nNebraska and populate that. Missourians were closer to Kansas and they \nwould populate Kansas and be a slave State and maintain that balance of \npower. That is also something we should apologize for. John Quincy \nAdams called slavery the ``original sin of the United States,'' for \nwhich we are asking forgiveness today. And in that situation developed \nmy part of eastern Kansas--known as Bleeding Kansas because while \npeople did come across who were proslavery, other individuals organized \nfrom the Northeast to populate Kansas, and they were abolitionists and \nthey came with a desire to fight for freedom. There were many irregular \nbattles that took place, guerilla warfare, the Battle of Osawatomie, \nwhere my mother grew up, the burning and sacking of Lawrence, and all \nthis back and forth about slavery taking place.\n\n[[Page S6764]]\n\n  Just before the Battle of Osawatomie, John Brown said--and he was in \nthat fight, and one of his sons was killed in it--there will not be \npeace in this land until the issue of slavery is resolved. He was \nright. Less than 10 years later, the Civil War broke out over the issue \nof slavery.\n  Today in the Senate, we pledge to move beyond this shameful period, \nand we officially acknowledge and apologize for the institution of \nslavery in this country--what many refer to as the original sin of \nAmerica--which was once woven into the fabric of our Nation, and for \nthe Federal laws we passed in this Chamber and upheld by the highest \nCourt in our land, the Supreme Court. My colleague has already referred \nto some of those laws, but I want to refer passingly to several as \nwell, laws such as the Fugitive Slave Law, first approved on February \n12, 1793, and subsequently amended in 1850 and 1864, which sought to \npunish those persons who dared to escape the brutality of slavery and \nthose who helped to free individuals in bondage. Not only would a \nsuspected runaway slave be dragged into court, but they would be unable \nto say a word on his or her behalf, not one word. They weren't allowed \nto say a single word.\n  My colleague mentioned the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which was \ncrafted as a solution to the ever-increasing and volatile dispute over \nthe question of slavery in the United States. In 1819, when Missouri \nsought statehood, the question was whether Missouri would be admitted \nto the Union as a slave State or a free State. This set off an intense \ndebate between northern and southern legislators. Missouri's \nratification would upset this delicate balance between slave States and \nfree States in the Senate.\n  In order to keep the already tenuous balance, Henry Clay worked out a \ncompromise consisting of three parts: Maine would separate from \nMassachusetts and be admitted as a free State, Missouri would enter the \nUnion as a slave State, and the remaining territories of the Louisiana \nPurchase would be closed off to slavery.\n  However, unrest around the brutal practice of slavery continued until \nfurther compromises came forward. Additionally, a compromise to outlaw \nthe slave trade, but not slavery, in the District of Columbia--where we \nare today--was enacted to facilitate the retrieval of slaves who had \nrun away to the North. While this compromise did little to satisfy the \nantislavery movement, it did temporarily preserve the Union, and many \nhistorians refer to this period as the ``calm before the storm.'' And \nthen my State enters--Bleeding Kansas.\n  As the United States continued to expand, the very fabric of our \nNation was about to be torn in two regarding a people's right to be \nfree. In the midst of this debate was my great State of Kansas.\n  On May 30, 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act became law. Frederick \nDouglass deemed the new law ``an open invitation to a fierce and bitter \nstrife,'' and those words proved to be very prophetic. Shortly after \nthe Kansas-Nebraska Act became law, there was a rush to settle Kansas. \nAs I mentioned, both proslavery and abolitionists alike were determined \nto settle Kansas for their cause. The turmoil continued. We had bloody \nballoting, we had stolen elections taking place, until we did finally \nenter the Union as a free State.\n  There were passions surrounding that which ignited even on the Senate \nfloor, passions that abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner delivered a \nrousing speech on the Senate floor called ``The Crime Against Kansas,'' \naccusing proslavery Senators of siding with slavery. In apparent \nretaliation, Congressman Preston S. Brooks attacked and beat Charles \nSumner senseless with a cane--an issue of some high memory on this \nfloor even today.\n  Following on June 2, 1856, there was retaliation. The Battle of Black \nJack, in my State, ensued, which is widely believed to be the first \nconflict between free State supporters led by John Brown and the \nproslavery supporters, as well as one of the first battles of the Civil \nWar.\n  These things continued until my State came into the Union.\n  I do wish to conclude at this point in time with noting just the \nimportance of apologies. As I mentioned at the outset, they are \ndifficult and they are important and they are hard to do and they are \nsignificant. Today, we right that wrong of not offering an apology \npreviously. Today, we move forward in a spirit of unity. Today, we move \ntoward a true cleansing of our Nation's past sins rooted in racism.\n  There may be those who consider an apology insignificant or purely \nfor symbolic means. I completely disagree. In 1988, Congress apologized \nfor the internment of Japanese Americans held during World War II. When \nasked in an interview 20 years after the apology was signed to give \nthoughts on the matter, Aiko Yamamoto, who at the time of the interview \nwas 72, said: ``It was the apology that mattered.'' Similarly, Norman \nMineta, former Congressman and U.S. Secretary of Commerce and of \nTransportation, who was also interned during World War II, said of the \napology: ``It will always mean more to me than I can ever adequately \nexpress.''\n  However, the cleansing effects of an apology are not only limited to \nthose who are owed an apology but to those giving the apology as well. \nIt is the acknowledgment that a terrible wrong was committed--never to \nbe committed again--and a willingness to now, through the process of \nreconciliation, work toward a brighter future for all people unburdened \nby the difficulties of the past but uplifted by the promises of the \nfuture--a future where our destinies are inextricably linked together.\n  Although this anthem is correctly titled ``The Negro National \nAnthem,'' the final stanza of its words so eloquently written by James \nWeldon Johnson not only rings true for the African-American community \nbut for all America.\n\n       God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, thou who \n     hast brought us thus far on the way; thou who hast by thy \n     might, led us into the light, keep us forever in the path, we \n     pray. Lest our feet stray from the places, our God where we \n     meet thee, lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, \n     we forget thee; shadowed beneath thy hand may we forever \n     stand, true to our God, true to our native land.\n\n  May we, with this apology, move forward into the light of unity, \nunited under a common purpose, linked together in a singular humanity. \nI am delighted that we are doing this today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first, at this point, I wish to thank \nSenators Harkin and Brownback for the initiative they have taken, for \ntheir leadership in bringing before the Senate this healing resolution, \nthis formal apology for slavery and racial segregation.\n  The resolution before us presents us with the opportunity to address \nface-to-face the unconscionable and the abhorrent acts of slavery and \nits aftermath perpetrated against fellow human beings. The apology \nresolution describes some of the gravest injustices of slavery: \nfamilies enslaved, then torn further apart after family members were \nsold separately, stripped of their names and heritage; a system of \nforced labor that persisted for 250 years; brutal and unspeakable acts \nof violence against slaves. The injustices continued well after the \n13th amendment to the Constitution ended slavery in our Nation because \nJim Crow laws disenfranchised former slaves and subjugated them as \nsecond-class citizens.\n  After presenting detailed findings regarding slavery and the system \nof de jure segregation known as Jim Crow, the resolution reads, in \npart, that the Senate:\n\n       Acknowledges the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, \n     and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow laws; Apologizes to \n     African Americans on behalf of the people of the United \n     States for the wrongs committed against them and their \n     ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow laws; and, \n     Expresses its recommitment to the principle that all people \n     are created equal and endowed with inalienable rights to \n     life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and calls on all \n     people of the United States to work toward eliminating racial \n     prejudices, injustices and discrimination from our society.\n\n  In 2005, the Senate passed a resolution formally apologizing for \nanother tragic legacy of historic racial inequalities in our Nation: \nlynching. From 1880 to as recently as the 1960s, an estimated 5,000 \nAmericans, predominantly African Americans, were killed by public \nhangings, burnings, and mutilation. Members of the Armed Forces were \nlynched in the country they had defended. Following both World War I \nand World War II, returning soldiers\n\n[[Page S6765]]\n\nwere lynched, many while still wearing their military uniforms. There \nwould be no new respect for these brave African Americans who had \nfought for our country, only the old order of injustice.\n  The Senate passed the resolution apologizing for lynching in an \nattempt to acknowledge the Senate's past failure to address the \nprevalence of those despicable acts and to allow for some national \nhealing. It is my hope that the slavery apology resolution before us \ncan serve a similar purpose.\n  We are fortunate to live in a time that is not blighted by slavery in \nthis country or segregation under the law. But we live with the legacy \nof the practice of slavery, and it is our responsibility and our duty \nto continue to examine that history in order to improve the present and \nthe future.\n  This apology is part of carrying out that responsibility. And doing \nso in the presence of visitors who are descendants of slaves adds to \nthe meaning of our action.\n  Madam President, I again thank the cosponsors of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, more than 200 years ago at the height of \na humid summer in Philadelphia, 56 men affixed their signatures to a \ndocument that contained these words:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal.\n\n  These words expressed a sentiment that could not be realized for all \nAmericans until more than a century later. At that moment, when the \nUnited States of America was born and the Declaration signed, a great \ninjustice was woven into the fabric of our Nation. Slavery and the \nracial segregation that followed have left a tragic legacy that divided \nthis country in the bloodiest war we have yet known. It is a legacy \nthat still affects each and every one of us this day.\n  My colleagues, Senators Harkin and Brownback, have introduced a \nresolution apologizing for slavery, Jim Crow laws, and policies of \nsegregation and hate. This is often an uncomfortable subject so I \napplaud my colleagues for their willingness to confront the difficult \nhistory we all share. I thank them for their leadership on the issue \nand rise in support of the resolution which just passed.\n  Several State governments have issued similar apologies. But the fact \nthat the plight of slavery was a national concern demands a national \nresponse.\n  Some in the Black community will dismiss this resolution. Some will \nsay that words don't matter, that the actions of our forefathers cannot \nbe undone. It is true that those who toiled in the fields, those who \nwere deprived of their freedom, will gain no peace from this \nresolution. Their story is inescapably in our history. It is a story we \nmust confront and try to overcome on a daily basis. But words do \nmatter; they matter a great deal--the words in the Declaration of \nIndependence acknowledging the equality of all men, even if the flawed \npolicies of the time failed to embrace it; the words of a President who \nheld the Union together and promised ``a new birth of freedom,'' even \nif his words required the forces of an army to achieve liberty for all; \nthe words of a Supreme Court opinion which declared ``separate but \nequal'' was not justice, even if the Nation was not quite ready to \nlisten; the words of a King who dared to dream of a promised land, even \nif he knew he might not live long enough to see it; the words of a \ntroubled nation searching for hope in time of fear, which seized upon \nthe rallying cry of a young Black man from Illinois whose words \ninspired a people to cry ``yes, we can'' with one voice--all of these \nwords reinforced the fundamental truth we have uttered to ourselves and \nour children since the birth of this Nation: In America, anything is \npossible.\n  As I look around this Senate floor today, I think of my parents who \nnever saw this Chamber. I think of my grandparents who never saw this \ncity. I think of my ancestors who could dream only of their freedom. I \nthink of my great-great-grandfather who was given that freedom. Freed \nfrom bondage as a slave in 1865, near Columbus, GA, without a name of \nhis own, he adopted the Army rank as his first name, Major, and he \nadopted the name of his county, Green, as his last name. He named \nhimself Major Green. In a span of those few generations, I stand here \nin the Senate Chamber as the great-great-grandson of Major Green on \nthat uniquely American arc of history that has taken my family from \nslavery to the Senate.\n  As a nation, we have come a long way. But we cannot turn our backs on \nthe shame of slavery, just as we cannot turn our backs on the rest of \nthe Constitution that at one time embraced it. The greatness of this \nNation comes from our ability to chart a new course, to shape and \nreshape the destiny that we share, choosing to reject injustice and \ncruelty, choosing to overcome the tragic legacy of past mistakes and \nlook ahead to a bright future. This resolution cannot erase the \nterrible legacy, but it can help to heal the wounds of centuries gone \nby. It can pave the way for future progress.\n  This journey, however, is far from over. We have not yet reached the \nequality promised in our founding documents--equality that transcends \nrace, gender, sexual orientation, and religion, equality upon which our \never perfecting Union is founded. This story is still being written. As \nwe confront the enduring legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, this \nresolution is an important part of moving forward.\n  I would like the Record to show that this resolution has a different \nending from a resolution passed by the 110th Congress. This resolution \ncarries a disclaimer. I want to go on record making sure that that \ndisclaimer in no way would eliminate future actions that may be brought \nbefore this body that may deal with reparations.\n  I thank Senator Harkin and Senator Brownback for their leadership on \nthis issue. I urge my colleagues to join us as we seek to write the \nnext chapter in our history, to move forward, not only saying we \napologize for slavery but moving forward to make sure all remnants of \ndiscrimination of any kind are removed from this great Nation of ours.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 4 years ago the Senate took an important \nstep in recognizing and apologizing for Congress's historic failure to \npass an antilynching law. Today, we are considering a resolution to \napologize for America's original sin--the sin of slavery.\n  By apologizing for the enslavement and racial segregation of African \nAmericans, we take another important step toward racial healing and \nreconciliation. This measure follows similar apologies issued by the \nStates of Alabama, Florida, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia, \nwhich have all recognized their role in sanctioning the evils of \nslavery and Jim Crow. While we cannot correct the brutality and \ndehumanization caused by these evils, we can acknowledge the vestiges \nof harm caused by that dark chapter in our history. We can accept \nresponsibility.\n  I am proud that when my home State of Illinois entered the Union in \n1818, the Illinois State Constitution contained the following \nprovision: ``Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall hereafter \nbe introduced into this state otherwise than for the punishment of \ncrimes.''\n  Soon after the granting of statehood, proponents of slavery in \nIllinois moved for a constitutional convention to amend the Illinois \nConstitution to allow slavery. The citizens of Illinois went to the \npolls in 1824 and voted against the convention by a margin of 57 \npercent to 43 percent and chose to keep Illinois a free State.\n  A few years later, in 1856, a little known former Congressman from \nSpringfield, IL, named Abraham Lincoln delivered a speech in \nBloomington, IL, and said: ``Those who deny freedom to others deserve \nit not themselves, and under the rule of a just God cannot long retain \nit.''\n  But it took a Civil War, and the death of over 600,000 Americans, \nbefore slavery was finally abolished in this Nation.\n  Another American hero who put his life on the line for civil rights \nis John Lewis, who was nearly beaten to death while marching for the \nright to vote in Selma, AL, during the 1960s. Today he is a member of \nCongress. Last year, after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a \nresolution apologizing for slavery, John Lewis said the following:\n\n       The systematic dehumanization of African Americans for \n     hundreds of years was a horrible crime, and the legacy of \n     these atrocities still lingers with us today. For centuries, \n     African Americans were denied\n\n[[Page S6766]]\n\n     wages, decent housing, food, clothing, and all the basic \n     necessities of life. They were disenfranchised in the \n     Constitution, barred from voting, from gaining an education, \n     and any protection or right a citizen should expect in a \n     civilized society. Our culture was destroyed, our lives were \n     always in jeopardy, and our very humanity was in question. \n     Any nation which perpetrates these kinds of atrocities on any \n     of its citizens should at least apologize for its actions. \n     And an apology is a very important step toward laying down \n     the legacy of this tragedy once and for all.\n\n  I commend Senator Harkin and Senator Brownback for introducing this \nimportant resolution in the Senate, and I urge its immediate passage.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today in strong support for S. \nCon. Res. 26, apologizing for the enslavement and racial segregation of \nAfrican Americans. I thank Senators Harkin and Brownback for \nintroducing this resolution and note that the Senate's approval of this \nresolution will occur on the eve of Juneteenth. Also known as Freedom \nor Emancipation Day, Juneteenth commemorates the announcement of the \nabolition of slavery in Texas and marks the day when Union troops \nstarted to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation throughout the United \nStates.\n  In 2007, Maryland became the second State after Virginia to adopt a \nresolution officially expressing profound regret for its role in \ninstituting and maintaining slavery and for the insidious \ndiscrimination that followed, which became slavery's legacy. I am proud \nthat my home State's elected officials publicly acknowledged and showed \nremorse for its part in that sad and enduring chapter in our Nation's \nhistory. And now we have an opportunity to do the same as an entire \ncountry.\n  From 1700 to 1770, thousands of West Africans who survived the middle \npassage slave trade route ended up in the Chesapeake Bay region. \nAnnapolis, our capital, was the main port of entry for slaves in the \nmid-Atlantic region. Millions of Africans were forcibly uprooted from \ntheir families in their native lands and shipped across the Atlantic in \nchains. Most died. Only one in four African-born slaves survived his or \nher first year in the Chesapeake area. By 1790, more than 100,000 \nslaves, a third of the State's total population, lived in Maryland.\n  True patriots with Maryland roots fought to end the institution of \nslavery, and they merit our gratitude and honor. Frederick Douglass, \nborn into slavery in 1818 on Maryland's Eastern Shore, escaped in 1836 \nand became a free man in Massachusetts. Upon gaining his freedom he \nmade it his life's work to advocate for the abolition of slavery and \nfor racial equality. Harriet Ross Tubman spent nearly 30 years as slave \nin Maryland's Dorchester County, also on the Eastern Shore. She escaped \nin 1849, and returned many times over the next decade to Dorchester and \nCaroline counties to lead hundreds of slaves north to freedom. Known as \n``Moses'' by abolitionists, she reportedly never lost a ``passenger'' \non the Underground Railroad.\n  The abolitionists eventually succeeded, but only after a monumental \nstruggle that culminated in the Civil War and the executive orders \nPresident Abraham Lincoln issued which comprised the Emancipation \nProclamation. In 1864, with the adoption of a new State Constitution, \nslavery officially ended in Maryland. A year later, in 1865, the 13th \nAmendment to the United States Constitution was ratified, officially \nabolishing slavery throughout the United States. Yet following \nReconstruction, the period in which newly freed men and women made \nsignificant social, economic and political gains, a new era of ``Jim \nCrow,'' the pernicious system of de jure racial segregation, dawned.\n  Maryland was among the border and southern States that perpetuated \nsegregation, passing 15 Jim Crow laws between 1870 and 1957. It was \nduring these years that numerous organizations were founded to be \ncatalysts for change. One such organization, the National Association \nfor the Advancement of Colored People--NAACP--was founded on February \n12, 1909, in response to the horrific practice of lynching. I am a \nlifetime member of the NAACP and am proud that its tradition continues \nto this day, and that my city of Baltimore is home to its national \nheadquarters.\n  Maryland might be considered a microcosm of the Nation as a whole. \nWhile Maryland instituted and perpetuated the institutions of slavery \nand ``Jim Crow,'' there arose some truly inspiring heroes who \ncourageously fought against the system and succeeded. Baltimore's own \nThurgood Marshall, for instance, developed into one of the most \ninfluential and inspiring legal minds of the 20th Century. He was a \ntrue leader of the civil rights revolution in the 1950s and 1960s, \nworking through the courts to eradicate the legacy of slavery and \ndestroy the racist segregation system of Jim Crow. And he succeeded. He \nwon multiple Supreme Court rulings, including the landmark Brown v. the \nBoard of Education of Topeka case, effectively ending legal segregation \nin schooling, housing, public transportation, and voting. He went on to \nbecome the Nation's first African-American Supreme Court Justice.\n  We have made substantial progress but it has been shamefully slow. As \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., remarked, ``Change does not roll in on the \nwheels of inevitability, but comes through continuous struggle.'' At \nlong last, we have elected an African-American President. We still have \nmore to do. The harmful legacies of slavery and ``Jim Crow'' persist in \nAmerica today, with glaring racial disparities in our criminal justice \nsystem, health care, home-ownership rates, and wealth. We need to do \nmore as a Nation to confront and eliminate these gaps. And although we \nhave truly come a long way since those days, America must acknowledge \nthe atrocities of our past, so that we can fulfill the ideals on which \nour nation was founded. This resolution is that acknowledgement.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, Harriet Ann Jacobs, a writer, \nabolitionist, and former slave wrote, ``No pen can give an adequate \ndescription of the all-pervading corruption produced by slavery.'' Just \nas no pen can describe how horrible the effects of slavery are, no \nwords will be able to express adequately our apology. But it is long \npast time we tried the impossible task of apologizing for this terrible \nperiod in our history.\n  Slavery was a deeply shameful period in our history, and the effects \non our country and our people can still be seen today. African \nAmericans still suffer from the years of slavery and institutional \nracism of the Jim Crow years. This resolution will not erase the damage \nof those years, but it is a necessary step if we are ever to heal the \nwounds that remain.\n  The early growth of our country--including the building of this very \nCapitol Building--would have been impossible without the labor and \nskills of African-American slaves. Our success as a nation was built on \ntheir backs, and at an awful price. Today, finally, with the passage of \nS. Con. Res. 26, we recognize their sacrifice and apologize for what \nthey suffered.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I know other speakers are coming down to \nspeak on this resolution. Before the time runs out and since no one is \nhere right now to speak, I wish to acknowledge several people who have \nbeen very instrumental in getting us to this point.\n  First, I thank the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights for all they \nhave done to not only bring us to this point--to this apology--but for \nall they have done to enhance and promote civil rights for Americans. I \nalso recognize the longtime president, Wade Henderson, who has devoted \nhis entire life to the cause of racial injustice and ensuring this \nNation lives up to its founding ideals.\n  Second, I acknowledge and thank the NAACP. February marked the end of \nthe NAACP's 100th birthday, founded on the 100th birthday of Abraham \nLincoln by a multiracial group of men and women committed to equality. \nFor 100 years, the NAACP has fought for justice for all Americans, and \nI thank\n\n[[Page S6767]]\n\ntheir president, Benjamin Todd Jealous, and through him all the members \nof the NAACP.\n  Third, I wish to acknowledge several staff members whose assistance \nmade this resolution possible. Senator Brownback already recognized \nLaRochelle Young, but I also thank her for helping to shepherd this \nthrough and working to get us to this point. Jackie Parker, a senior \nadviser to Senator Levin and cofounder of the Senate Black Legislative \nStaff Caucus, has been instrumental in planning the upcoming ceremony \nwith civil rights leaders and other luminaries to recognize the apology \nand injustices of slavery and Jim Crow.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize the tireless work that my counsel, \nDaniel Goldberg, has dedicated to seeing this historic resolution \nbecome a reality. The countless hours he has committed to make this \noccasion happen are almost uncountable. I thank him publicly for making \nthis possible.\n  Last, I would like to add Senators Leahy, Dodd, Murray, and Kerry as \ncosponsors of the resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I, too, wish to acknowledge some \nindividuals who have really helped to make this historic day take \nplace. One for me is Congressman John Lewis, with whom I have been \nworking for some period of time to get the Museum of African American \nHistory and Culture to be a reality on The Mall. The design has now \nbeen picked and the location has been picked. It is going to be at the \nbase area of the Washington Monument. It is going to be a fabulous \nentity. What I like about it is it is going to show the difficulty, the \ntragedy, and is also going to show the promise in the future. It moves \nthrough the whole piece of it, and this resolution will be a part of \nit, of how a nation deals with such an enormous problem as this.\n  John has been a very courageous, longstanding advocate in the mode of \nwhat John Quincy Adams was for years in fighting against slavery. He \nhas been dedicated to this. I remember first going over to his office \nand him showing me a book of pictures that were of lynchings that had \ntaken place, such a tragic set of pictures that you look at that \nhappened in the early part of the 1900s in my State and many other \nStates around the country. I am very appreciative of him.\n  There are people who recently passed away, like Rosa Parks, who gave \nus these defining moments of the ending of segregation or in my State, \nlike Cheryl Brown Henderson of the Brown family, Brown v. Board of \nEducation, the landmark desegregation case where we said even if a \nschool is equal, segregation is inherently wrong, and they stood for \nit, and stood tall, to bring us to a better point in time.\n  It has not been all that long ago. I started out in a professional \nperiod in broadcasting. One of the guys next to me was a sports \nbroadcaster, and he would tell the story about--and this is even in the \nBig 8, where Senator Harkin and I shared some territory--he talked \nabout African Americans coming on the basketball court, being cheered \nwildly by everybody at the school but then not able to eat at the lunch \ncounter in the community. While everybody is cheering for them on the \nbasketball court, they cannot eat at the lunch counter. The \nsportscaster was talking to me about that.\n  My old friend Jack Kemp, who recently passed away, was a strong \nadvocate for African Americans and for doing things like this--what he \nsaw in the sports field, for years, people in the Negro Baseball League \nHall of Fame in Kansas City. We have a wonderful museum showing what it \ntook to break through the racial barriers in sports and how positive \nthat was but also how difficult that was during that period of time.\n  All of these I am mentioning simply because it is part of how \ndifficult it is to get to the point we get to today as a society. These \nthings do take time, they are difficult, and there is a lot of pain and \nsuffering that goes along the way.\n  What Senator Harkin and I and all the cosponsors hope--it will be \nunanimously approved on this Senate floor--is that for all those \nindividuals who have had these personal experiences themselves and felt \nit themselves, they will be able to see in this some acknowledgment of \nwhat happened to them, an acknowledgment that it was wrong and an \napology for it. It doesn't fix it, but hopefully it does address it and \nstarts to dig out the wound. There is a great book on this, ``Healing \nAmerica's Wounds.'' The last name of the author is Dawson. He pointed \nout that these are very significant for society to be able to pull \ntogether around and that they have to be done for a society to be able \nto move forward. There is just no way around it, you have to actually \naddress the problem and the topic.\n  For those reasons and for the many millions of people who have \nsuffered the legacies of slavery and segregation or suffered personally \nthemselves under segregation in this country, we apologize as a United \nStates Senate.\n  I read the final words because they express it so well, that there is \na sense of Congress of the following:\n\n       Apology for the enslavement and segregation of African-\n     Americans--The Congress--\n\n     acknowledges the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, \n     and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow laws;\n\n     apologizes to African-Americans on behalf of the people of \n     the United States, for the wrongs committed against them and \n     their ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow laws; \n     and . . .\n\n  Nothing in this resolution:\n\n     authorizes or supports any claim against the United States; \n     or\n\n     serves as a settlement of any claim against the United States\n\n     expresses its recommitment to the principle that all people \n     are created equal and endowed with inalienable rights to \n     life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and calls on all \n     people of the United States to work toward eliminating racial \n     prejudices, injustices, and discrimination from our society.\n\n  It specifically does the apology but deals with nothing else. It \nsays, ``Nothing in this resolution authorizes or supports any claim \nagainst the United States; or serves as a settlement of any claim \nagainst the United States,'' to leave that issue aside.\n  I am very appreciative that a number of States have led the way \nmoving forward with the apology. Virginia, Alabama, Florida, Maryland, \nNorth Carolina led in adopting resolutions officially expressing that \nremorse for slavery and for Jim Crow laws.\n  I look forward to this unanimous consent. I am glad we are doing it \nnow. We will have a recognition of this in a Rotunda ceremony. I think \nthat will be important. I hope many Members will join us at that, and I \nthink it will be a historic point in time.\n  Madam President, I believe we are ready to call for the passage of \nthe resolution? I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will just yield, I thank my friend for his \nwonderful statement this morning and, again, for the many months and \nyears we have worked together on this to get here, I thank him very \nmuch.\n  In closing, Madam President, again I say a fitting ceremony is being \nplanned for sometime early in July that will take place in the main \nRotunda of the Capitol to mark this occasion. As I understand, we don't \nhave a firm date yet, but that date will be coming about shortly in \nconsultation with the Speaker and the minority leader in the House and \nthe majority leader and minority leader here in the Senate. We are \nlooking forward to that occasion, and I think it is one that will be \npoignant and one that will again bring home to all of us and to the \nAmerican people the enormity of what we have done in terms of finally \nacknowledging the official role of the U.S. Government in promoting and \nsanctioning slavery and Jim Crow laws.\n  I say to my friend from Kansas, we look forward to that ceremony, and \nI am sure the American people are looking forward to it also.\n  I might ask, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. On the majority side, almost 8 \nminutes, and on the Republican side, just over 9 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nMenendez, Feingold, and Bennet be added as cosponsors.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, on behalf of the majority leader, I \nyield the remainder of our time.\n\n[[Page S6768]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. On behalf of the Republicans, I yield the remainder of \nour time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on the adoption of \nthe resolution.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Cons. Res. 26) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6768-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Madam President, I would like to turn to another \nimportant topic; that is, the pending confirmation of Judge Sotomayor \nto be Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Like many Senators, \nI have had the opportunity to visit with Judge Sotomayor in my office \nand, of course, congratulated her on this great honor. I further \npledged to her that she would receive a fair and dignified confirmation \nproceeding. Unfortunately, that has not always been the case in the \nSenate, but I did tell her that as far as I was concerned, I would do \neverything I could to make sure she was treated with respect.\n  Over the last few weeks, my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and \nI have begun a thorough review of her record. Judge Sotomayor comes \nwith one of the longest tenures of any judge nominated to the U.S. \nSupreme Court on the Federal bench--for about 17 years, so there is a \nrather lengthy record to review. In addition, she has given, as you \nmight expect, many speeches and written law review articles and made \nother statements that deserve our attention. She has responded to the \nquestionnaire sent by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and there are \nother followup questions which I anticipate she will be answering in \nthe coming weeks.\n  So our review is ongoing in anticipation of a confirmation hearing \nbeginning July 13 in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  But so far it is fair to say that there are a number of issues that \nhave come up which I would like to talk about briefly that I anticipate \nshe will have an opportunity to clarify or otherwise respond to and \nmake her position clear for the American people and for the Senate as \nwe perform our constitutional obligation under article II, section 2 of \nthe Constitution.\n  Most of the focus, during a judicial confirmation hearing, is on the \nPresident's authority under the Constitution to nominate individuals to \nserve as judges. But, in fact, the very same provision of the \nConstitution, the very same section of the Constitution, section 2 of \narticle II, also imposes an obligation on the Senate. In other words, \nwe have a constitutional duty ourselves in the Senate to provide advice \nand consent and then to vote on the nomination once voted out of the \ncommittee.\n  The concerns I wish to raise at this point do not suggest that these \nare disqualifying, by any means, for Judge Sotomayor. I believe that, \nas I have indicated, she deserves the opportunity to explain her \napproach to these issues and particularly her judicial philosophy more \nclearly and to put the opinions and statements we have come across \nduring our review in proper context.\n  I believe it is not appropriate for any of us to prejudge or to \npreconfirm Judge Sotomayor. Our job as Senators is to ask how she would \napproach the duties of an Associate Justice of the United States \nSupreme Court. And the areas, as I said, I would like to focus on are \nnumbered three.\n  The first issue has to do with her approach to the second amendment. \nOf course, the second amendment to the U.S. Constitution, part of our \nBill of Rights, incorporates the right to keep and bear arms.\n  The second amendment says:\n\n       A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of \n     a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms \n     shall not be infringed.\n\n  The American people understand that the second amendment limits \ngovernment and protects individual liberty. As Justice Joseph Story \nwrote nearly 200 years ago, the second amendment acts as a ``strong \nmoral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers.''\n  As the U.S. Supreme Court itself held last year in the District of \nColumbia v. Heller: ``There seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both \ntext and history, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual \nright to keep and bear arms.''\n  I agree strongly with the Supreme Court's reasoning in the Heller \ndecision, and I think most Americans accept that as the law of the \nland. Judge Sotomayor, on the other hand, as a member of the Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals, was one of the judges that first was given an \nopportunity to apply that Supreme Court precedent in Heller to the \nStates.\n  She concluded in that decision that the right to keep and bear arms \nwas not a fundamental right, and, therefore, was not enforceable \nagainst the States via the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. Her decision in that case was troubling in light of the \nHeller decision, especially because her opinion included very little \nsignificant legal analysis.\n  I would expect and hope Judge Sotomayor would elaborate on her \nthinking about this case, as well as the scope of the second amendment, \nduring the course of the confirmation hearings. Americans need to know \nwhether we can count on Judge Sotomayor to uphold all of the Bill of \nRights, including the second amendment.\n  The next subject that I think will bear some discussion during the \nconfirmation hearings is Judge Sotomayor's views of private property \nrights, another fundamental right protected by our Bill of Rights, that \nis simply stated in the fifth amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the \nright not to have property taken for public use without just \ncompensation.\n  The fifth amendment provides an absolute guarantee of liberty against \nthe power of eminent domain, by permitting government to seize private \nproperty only for public use.\n  Our colleagues will recall the controversial decision of the U.S. \nSupreme Court in 2005 in Kelo v. City of New London, a decision where \nthe Supreme Court greatly broadened the definition of public use and, \nthereby doing, greatly limited the property rights protected by the \nBill of Rights for more than two centuries.\n  The Court held that government can take property from one person and \ngive it to another person if the government decided that by so doing it \nwould promote economic development. The Kelo decision represents a vast \nexpansion of government power of eminent domain. And that is why I \nintroduced legislation that same year to limit that power and to \nrestore the basic protections of our homes, small businesses, and other \nprivate property rights that the Founders intended in the fifth \namendment to the Constitution.\n  I believe the Kelo decision went too far. Yet by her decision in the \ncase of Didden v. Village of Port Chester, it appears Judge Sotomayor \ndid not feel like it went far enough. Judge Sotomayor was part of a \npanel that upheld an even more egregious overreach by government when \nit came to private property rights.\n  In that case, two private property owners wanted to build a pharmacy \non their land but in an area the government had essentially handed over \nto another private developer. The developer offered the owners a \nchoice: Give me a piece of the action or we will proceed to condemn \nyour property. The property owners, as you would think would be their \nright, refused. Yet the government, the local government, delivered on \nthe developer's threat the very next day.\n  I believe this decision represents an outrageous abuse of the power \nof eminent domain for a nonpublic purpose and a tremendous extension of \nan already flawed decision in the Kelo case by the U.S. Supreme Court. \nSo I think it is only fair and right that we ask Judge Sotomayor how \nshe can square that decision in the Didden case with the plain meaning \nof the fifth amendment to the Constitution and, indeed, even the Kelo \ncase itself.\n\n[[Page S6769]]\n\n  The third area we need to understand Judge Sotomayor's approach to \ndeciding cases involving employment discrimination. We need to \nunderstand how Judge Sotomayor interprets and applies the Equal \nProtection Clause of the fourteenth amendment, which reads in part:\n\n       No State shall . . . deny to any person within its \n     jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n  For most Americans, the ``equal protection of the laws'' means just \nwhat it says. It means that government cannot treat you differently \nbased on your race or your sex or your ethnicity. It simply means that \ngovernment cannot legally practice discrimination, including reverse \ndiscrimination.\n  But in a case recently argued to the U.S. Supreme Court called Ricci \nv. DiStefano, Judge Sotomayor participated in a Court of Appeal's \ndecision which raises legitimate questions about her commitment to the \nprovisions of equal protection of the laws in the Constitution. At \nleast I think it raises questions that we need to ask her to respond to \nand to hopefully clarify her views on whether government can lawfully \ndiscriminate based on skin color.\n  The facts of that case--the case involves firefighters in New Haven, \nCT. The fire department established a testing program to ensure a fair \nprocess in deciding who would be promoted to captain and lieutenant. \nThe testing was rigorous, and it was not racially biased. It was \nracially neutral to give everyone a fair chance to succeed in taking \nthe test.\n  But the government, as it turned out, did not get the results it \nwanted. The mayor and five commissioners of New Haven felt that not \nenough African Americans had passed the test, so they threw out the \ntest and refused to promote anyone.\n  This was unfair to the firefighters who had qualified for promotion. \nMany of the firefighters were of Italian or Hispanic descent and felt \nthey themselves had fallen victim to racial discrimination by the city \ngovernment.\n  In fact, one of the fire commissioners was quoted as saying the \ndepartment should stop hiring people with too many vowels in their \nname.\n\n  So the firefighters sued in Federal court. The case came before a \nthree-judge panel, including Judge Sotomayor. Judge Sotomayor voted to \ndismiss the case even before these firefighters had a chance to go to \ntrial. The panel of three judges that she participated in issued a one-\npage opinion that was unpublished and did not even address these claims \nfor the merits of the case or the constitutional issues brought by \nthese petitioners.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The firefighters were disappointed in Judge Sotomayor's \ndecision, and, indeed, some of her colleagues on the bench were shocked \nby the refusal to even acknowledge, much less address, the claims by \nthese firefighters.\n  One colleague, Judge Jose Cabranes, appointed by President Clinton, \nworked to get the case reconsidered by the entire Second Circuit. He \nwrote that the case might involve ``an unconstitutional racial quota or \nsetaside.'' He said, ``At its core, this case presents a \nstraightforward question: May a municipal employer disregard the \nresults of a qualifying examination which was carefully constructed to \nensure race-neutrality, on the ground that the results of the \nexamination yielded too many qualified applicants of one race and not \nenough of another?''\n  Judge Sotomayor apparently was not persuaded to answer that question. \nBut thankfully the U.S. Supreme Court will. In a matter of days, we \nwill know the U.S. Supreme Court's decision, which will help the \nAmerican people understand whether Judge Sotomayor's philosophy is \nwithin the judicial mainframe or well outside it.\n  There are other statements that the judge has made in the course of \nher long career, including one at Berkeley in 2001, which has received \nquite a bit of press coverage where she said:\n\n       I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of \n     her experiences would more often than not reach a better \n     conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.\n\n  President Obama has said she misspoke. But it is clear that is not \nthe case. Congressional Quarterly reported that she used this language, \nor something very similar to it, in multiple speeches in 1994 to 2003.\n  It would be one thing if Judge Sotomayor was simply celebrating her \nown journey as a successful Latino woman in our country. Every American \nwould understand that, every American would embrace that, because her \nstory is an American success story. And all of us can justly take pride \nthat someone of a humble origin who worked hard and sacrificed has \nachieved so much in this country.\n  In particular, the Hispanic community is justly proud of her \nachievements. She is, indeed, a role model for young people and is a \nsymbol of success.\n  All Americans can be proud that Hispanics are assuming more and more \npositions of authority in our society. Indeed, the Bush administration \nnominated more Hispanic Federal judges than any previous \nadministration. Unfortunately, they have not always received the sort \nof fair and dignified consideration that Judge Sotomayor will.\n  Miguel Estrada, who was nominated for the Second Circuit, was not \ntreated respectfully during his confirmation proceedings. He was \nfilibustered seven times, and denied an up-or-down vote on his \nconfirmation.\n  So I wish to make clear that there is no problem if Judge Sotomayor \nwas simply showing pride in her heritage as we all should as a nation \nof immigrants. But if it suggests a judicial philosophy that says that \nbecause of sex or race or ethnicity, a judge is better qualified and \nmore likely to reach correct legal decisions, I simply do not \nunderstand that contention, and I would like the opportunity to ask her \nabout it.\n  One of her fellow judges contrasted their views by saying:\n\n     . . . judges must transcend their personal sympathies and \n     prejudices and aspire to achieve a greater degree of fairness \n     and integrity based on the reason of law.\n\n  I think that is exactly right. So we need to know whether Judge \nSotomayor embraces this notion of colorblind justice that most \nAmericans expect from the highest Court in the land. I hope she will be \ngiven an opportunity--indeed she will be given an opportunity--to \nclarify her comments and let us know whether she intends to be a \nSupreme Court Justice for all of us or just for some of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, yesterday, along with Senators Boxer, \nKlobuchar, and 43 other Senators, I submitted S. Res. 187, a resolution \ncondemning the use of violence against providers of reproductive health \ncare services to women and expressing sympathy for the family, friends, \nand patients of Dr. George Tiller.\n  Unfortunately, the murder of Dr. Tiller was not an isolated incident. \nOur country has a history of violence against reproductive health care \nproviders. Since 1993, eight clinic workers have been murdered, and \nthere have been hundreds of additional attempted murders, bombings, \ndeath threats, and kidnappings. Since 1977, there have been more than \n5,800 reported acts of violence against providers and clinics.\n  My own State has been touched by such acts of violence. In December \n1994, a man from New Hampshire killed two workers at clinics in \nMassachusetts, including a nurse from Salem, NH. Almost 9 years ago, \nthe Feminist Health Center in Concord, NH was burned in an arson \nattack. These acts of violence are not acceptable. Not only do they \nviolate our laws and lead to human tragedy, but they dissuade medical \nprofessionals from entering a field of medicine that is critically \nimportant to women across the country.\n  I realize that the issue of reproductive choice is divisive. I know \nthere are many heartfelt feelings on both sides of this issue and on \nboth sides of the aisle, even within my own caucus. However, I was \nhopeful that regardless of our differences of opinion on this sensitive \nissue, the Senate could come together and quickly pass a resolution \nthat rejects the use of violence against reproductive health care \nproviders. Sadly, this is not the case.\n  My cosponsors and I have tried to pass this resolution by unanimous \nconsent. Unfortunately, some on the other side of the aisle have \nobjected. How disappointing it is that in this country and in this \nbody, we can't come together to unanimously condemn the use of \nviolence. My cosponsors and I were urged to eliminate references to \nwomen's reproductive health care to get this resolution passed through \nthe Senate. We are not going to back down. This country should be able \nto come together to condemn violence against reproductive health care \nproviders. It is a very sad day when the elected leaders of the \ngreatest democracy on Earth cannot agree to protect those exercising \ntheir constitutional rights.\n  I am pleased to be joined by 45 of my colleagues on this important \nresolution. We are saddened that we are not able to pass it without \nobjection.\n  I wish to now read this simple resolution, a resolution condemning \nthe use of violence against providers of health care services to women.\n\n       Whereas Dr. George Tiller of Wichita, Kansas was shot to \n     death at church on Sunday, May 31;\n       Whereas there is a history of violence against providers of \n     reproductive health care, as health care employees have \n     suffered threats, hostility, and attacks in order to provide \n     crucial services to patients;\n       Whereas the threat or use of force or physical obstruction \n     has been used to injure, intimidate, or interfere with \n     individuals seeking to obtain or provide health care \n     services; and\n       Whereas acts of violence are never an acceptable means of \n     expression and always shall be condemned. Now, therefore, be \n     it Resolved, That the Senate expresses great sympathy for the \n     family, friends, and patients of Dr. George Tiller; \n     recognizes that acts of violence should never be used to \n     prevent women from receiving reproductive health care; and \n     condemns the use of violence as a means of resolving \n     differences of opinion.\n\n  I find it hard to believe that this language condemning the murder of \na health care provider and expressing sympathy to a family in mourning \ncould be objectionable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  Madam President, I want to say to my friend, Senator Shaheen, that \nher words were eloquent here today and that her voice adds so much \ntexture to the Senate. In a very plainspoken way, as is her way, \nSenator Shaheen has told us that regardless of where we stand on this \nissue, this contentious issue of a woman's right to choose, we should \nbe able to come together when there is violence of any sort from any \nquarter, right, left, or center. There is no place for violence in any \nof our debates. That is what makes this such a great country. We debate \nhere. We have had difficult debates here on the issue of a woman's \nright to choose. Yes, we have. But we decide those issues in this \nChamber, in the House, at the White House, and across the street at the \nSupreme Court. And the Supreme Court has ruled very clearly, in 1973, \nin Roe v. Wade, that it is legal--legal--for a woman in the early \nstages of her pregnancy to make this tough choice and get the health \ncare she needs. And, yes, later in the pregnancy, if her health is \nthreatened, if her life is threatened, yes, a doctor can help her in \nthat type of a circumstance.\n  Here we have many cases where violence is being used, where Web sites \nare being put up with pictures of doctors and nurses, trying to incite \ntrouble, trying to incite violence, and that is not what the law \nallows.\n  With the case of Dr. Tiller, he was a doctor. After this tragedy \nwhere he was shot and killed in church--and before that, he had his arm \nshot, but he continued his work--many, many women came forward to \nattest to how kind he was to them in their great need.\n  Dr. Tiller operated within the law. There were those who tried to run \nhim out of town with lawsuits, and he won all of those.\n  So when a procedure is legal and a doctor is following the rules, to \nhave a murder of a doctor in that circumstance is a tragedy to his \nfamily, to his friends, to his patients, and, yes, frankly, to America \nbecause it diminishes us as a society.\n  I want to tell it like it is around here. Every Democrat cleared this \nresolution and said, yes, we ought to have a chance to bring it to the \nfloor and be voted upon. That is all my colleague wants. She wrote a \nsimple resolution. She read it to you. She wants a vote. Every Democrat \nsaid, yes, let's bring it to the floor. If you do not like it, you do \nnot have to vote for it. If you want to change it, make an amendment to \nchange it.\n  But the Republicans will not clear this resolution. Now, I have to \nsay to the people who may be listening to this debate, hear what I am \nsaying. The Republicans will not allow a vote, will not clear a \nresolution that simply says, in the resolve clause--and I quote from \nit--we express ``great sympathy for the family, friends and patients of \nDr. George Tiller.'' We recognize ``that acts of violence should never \nbe used to prevent women from receiving reproductive health care,'' and \nwe condemn ``the use of violence as a means of resolving differences of \nopinion.''\n  I think my colleague, in her eloquence here, has said it all. I urge \nthose people who are anonymously holding up this resolution, come to \nthe floor, have the courage and the guts to look out at this Chamber \nand explain why you do not believe we should condemn acts of violence \nto prevent women from receiving their health care, and come to the \nfloor and explain why you are not ready to condemn the use of violence \nas a means of resolving differences.\n  This is the greatest democracy in the world. We will not be the \ngreatest democracy in the world if we decide we are going to take the \nlaw into our own hands and kill people with whom we disagree.\n  So I beg my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to rethink \ntheir position because, I can tell you, anyone who does not know \nSenator Shaheen--she was the Governor of a State, she is a great \nSenator already--she is not going to give up on this. We are going to \nbe here day after day. We are going to ask that this be brought before \nthe body. And we are going to make those who are stopping us from \nvoting on this come to the floor and explain why they cannot join with \nus.\n  We know abortion is a contentious issue. We appreciate that. We \nrespect our colleagues' views. Frankly, I totally respect their views \non the issue. But I do not respect someone who is anonymously holding \nup a resolution that condemns violence.\n  So I am going to work with my colleague. I am very proud of her work \non\n\n[[Page S6771]]\n\nthis. I am proud of Senator Klobuchar's work on this. And I want to \nthank every Democrat in this Senate who said, yes, this resolution is \nworthy of debate and worthy of a vote.\n  Madam President, I thank you very much and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6771-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I take the floor for a few minutes to \ndraw the attention of my colleagues to the fact that there is a \nbirthday this year, a 75th birthday--not the birthday of a Member of \nthe Senate, not a birthday of a Member of the House, but actually it is \nthe 75th birthday of the National Archives and Records Administration. \nIt is 75 years old this year.\n  My colleague who is presiding today may recall the reception that was \nheld at the National Archives during our orientation for new Senators \nand their spouses back in November. As it turns out, it was a small \ngroup of people who were able to witness and to visually see and read \nsome of the most famous short documents in our Nation's history.\n  But as it turns out, millions of Americans come every year and \nvisitors from all over the world come each year to visit the National \nArchives. The National Archives serves as the custodian of some of our \ncounty's most precious and historic records and documents, and they \nhave been doing this for something like three-quarters of a century.\n  I wish to take a moment on behalf of all of my colleagues, Democratic \nand Republican, and an Independent or two, to thank the men and women \nwho work at the National Archives now--and who have done that for the \nlast three-quarters of a century--who work diligently to preserve our \nNation's history, not just for us but for future generations of \nAmericans and others who will come to our shores to visit here.\n  Established by Congress to be our Nation's record keeper, the \nNational Archives has the critical mission of storing and protecting \nour most valuable and our most important documents. In fact, the main \nArchives facility, which is located not far from where we are gathered \nhere today, is the permanent home of--get this--the Declaration of \nIndependence, our Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said that an educated citizenry will ensure a \nfree society. He was right then. That is right now. Unhindered access \nto information about our government and leaders is truly critical to \nthe continued health and vibrancy of our democracy.\n  That is why I am pleased to hear that more than 1 million visitors \ntravel to the National Archives each year to see thousands of \ndocuments--the ones I mentioned and others as well--records, and \nspecial exhibits. It is no stretch to say the National Archives is one \nof the most popular agencies in the U.S. Government. That probably \ncomes as a surprise to a lot of us.\n  But the Archives is not just a tourist attraction. Over the years, \nthe Archives has become an international leader in developing an \nelectrical records archiving system that will preserve digital \ninformation in any format--not just for a few years but forever.\n  Information technology has forever altered our ability to create, \naccess, and search information from any location in the world. Every \nyear, billions--not millions, billions--of documents that shape and \ninform government decisions are never written down with pen and paper. \nInstead, these records are ``born digital.'' That means they are \ncreated electronically and stored not in a filing cabinet but on \ncomputers and on the Internet.\n\n  Each year, the Archives preserves more and more information that is \nessential to understanding our democracy, our history, and our culture. \nTo put it into some kind of perspective, it took eight C-5 military \ncargo planes to transport all of the paper materials created by the \nClinton administration. Imagine that: eight C-5 military cargo \naircraft. Following the most recent Presidential transition, it took 20 \ntractor trailers, 2 Boeing 747s, and a DC-8 aircraft to transport all \nof President George W. Bush's records. At the same time, the National \nArchives continues to maintain records from 1775, including the \nmilitary record of every single veteran in the 20th and 21st centuries. \nThat is no small task.\n  So I stand here today to give my thanks--really, to give our thanks--\nto the hard-working folks who work and volunteer their time at our \nNational Archives.\n  Winston Churchill once said:\n\n       A nation that forgets its past is doomed to repeat it.\n\n  I think that quote truly sums up the important role of the Archives, \nnot just for our history but for our future.\n  Madam President, tomorrow I will submit, with a number of my \ncolleagues, a resolution to commend the National Archives and its \nemployees for excellent service over the past 75 years and to wish them \nmany years of additional service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6771-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6771-S6772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I know my colleague from Wisconsin is \nstanding to speak, so I will be very brief. I just want to take a \nmoment.\n  While Senator Shaheen and Senator Boxer were speaking, I went over \nand chatted a little bit with one of our colleagues from Texas who was \non the floor. We talked a little bit about the debate on health care. \nAs we approach, in a week or two, marking up a health care reform bill \nin the Finance Committee, he mentioned to me something I very much \nagree with, the 80-20 rule.\n  Mike Enzi, the Senator from Wyoming, likes to talk about the 80-20 \nrule and why he has been so productive over the years with Senator Ted \nKennedy. Senator Kennedy, obviously, is a liberal Member of the Senate. \nSenator Enzi is a very conservative Member of the Senate. They get a \nlot done in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. It is \nbecause they follow what Senator Enzi calls the 80-20 rule. They focus \non the 80 percent of the stuff they agree on. They set aside the 20 \npercent they do not agree on, and they really focus on where the most \nagreement is.\n  We need to do a similar kind of approach as we prepare to mark up in \nthe Finance Committee the health reform bill, to go along with the \nareas of work going on in the HELP Committee.\n  I strongly agree with Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley. We need a \nbipartisan bill. I know many Democrats and Republicans feel we need a \nbipartisan bill. My fear is, if we do not have a bipartisan bill, we \nwill not be successful ultimately.\n  While most of the media coverage of the health care debate focuses on \nthe conflict--should we have a public plan or not; tax exclusions; what \nportion of our benefits should be excluded from taxation; should there \nbe an employer mandate or individual mandate or should there not be--\nsetting all of those things aside, not that they are unimportant, there \nis huge agreement on a bunch of things that are important that are \ngoing to save money, save lives, reduce costs, and provide better \nhealth care for people. Part of it is in information technology; make \nit possible for businesses--large and small but especially small \nbusinesses--to get into a purchasing pool to be able to take advantage \nof much lower rates and have better choices of benefits for their \nfolks; moving toward chronic care to make sure for people who have \ndiabetes that we do not just wait until they get really sick and they \nhave to have arms and legs and feet amputated, but make sure we take \ncare of them early on as we go along.\n  As to these purchasing pools we are going to create under health care \nreform, if people have a preexisting condition, they do not get \nexcluded. They can participate as well. We are going to be covering \nmore people for pharmaceuticals. We are going to do a much better job \nof making sure people who will benefit from a particular \npharmaceutical--whether it is a large molecule or a small molecule--\nwill have access to something that is going to help them. We will be \nsmart enough to figure out the pharmaceuticals out there that will not \nhelp somebody, so then they will not be taking those.\n  We are going to be focusing more on primary care, less on fee for \nservice, which drives up the cost of health care.\n\n[[Page S6772]]\n\nWe are going to do a better job of coordinating care and providing \nmedical homes for people as we go forward.\n  We are going to take examples like that in the neighboring State \nrepresented by Senator Feingold. Over in Minnesota, they have this Mayo \nClinic, and they figured out how to make the Mayo Clinic provide better \nhealth care, with better outcomes, at lower cost than most other places \nin this country. They took their model and they went down to Florida, \nwhere costs were very high for health care. They took the Mayo model to \nFlorida, and they ended up with better outcomes and lower costs in \nFlorida compared to other folks who had been doing business in Florida \nproviding health care for years.\n  But it is not just the Mayos, it is the Intermountain folks, a \nnonprofit out in Utah, the Geisinger operation in Pennsylvania. There \nare a number of good examples out there. Part of what we are going to \ndo through this debate, as we move toward health care reform, is to \nlearn from those examples, go to school on those examples, and be able \nto put them to work for all of us.\n  With that having been said, my friend said some people say we are not \ngoing to get health care reform done. We have to get it done. We spend \nmore money for health care in this country than any other developed \nnation on Earth. We do not get better results. If we spend more money, \nwe don't get better results. We can do better than this. Democrats \nworking together with Republicans, we can get there, and let's just not \ngive up.\n\n  Thank you, Madam President.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, every year I hold a constituent \nlistening session, or townhall meeting, in every county in Wisconsin. \nAfter 1,188 of those sessions, I have heard a lot from my constituents \non pretty much every issue you can imagine. But one issue in particular \nstands out, as it has consistently been one of the top issues raised \nthroughout the past 17 years. That issue is, of course, health care.\n  Again and again--not just in listening sessions but in conversations \nand phone calls and letters and e-mails--Wisconsinites have talked to \nme about their struggles to obtain and afford health insurance \ncoverage. Their stories have stayed with me and have been the \nfoundation of my work to push for comprehensive health reform \nthroughout my career in the Senate.\n  As a freshman Senator, I worked to increase access to long-term care \nand home and community-based services in the Wisconsin tradition during \nthe 1994 attempt at health reform because I knew how valuable these \nprograms were to my constituents. I continued to fight for real and \nfair access to affordable prescription drugs by speaking up for seniors \nduring the debate on creating Medicare Part D. I ended up not voting \nfor Part D because I knew it would help pharmaceutical companies before \nit helped seniors. For years I have tried to get the Senate to address \nthe issue that was foremost in the minds of my constituents.\n  Frustrated by the inaction, I teamed up with Senator Lindsey Graham \nto introduce legislation that sought to break the logjam blocking \nhealth care reform legislation. While Senator Graham and I have had \nvery different ideas about how reform should look, we agreed further \ndelay was unacceptable. I know some of my colleagues are now arguing \nthat health care is being rushed through the Senate.\n  Well, that is not my experience, and I think the Wisconsinites who \nhave been talking about the need for reform for years would agree. That \nis why I am so excited that the Senate is preparing to consider health \nreform legislation, and I look forward to reviewing the bills the HELP \nand Finance Committees are expected to report shortly.\n  As this debate goes forward, I remain committed to reforming our \nhealth care system so every single American is guaranteed good, \naffordable health care coverage.\n  Today, I wish to talk about one of the most important elements of any \nreform, and that is a strong public health insurance option. Frankly, I \nam disappointed this has become a topic of so much controversy because \nit is such a fundamental part of making sure we provide the reform my \nconstituents and all Americans deserve. Some have even suggested \nscrapping a public option in the interests of passing a bill with \nbipartisan support. Well, I want to pass health care reform, and I hope \nvery much we can do it with bipartisan support, but I am not that \ninterested in passing health care reform in name only. I am not \ninterested in a bill that allows us to somehow tell our constituents we \nhave done something but doesn't address their concerns they have had \nfor so very long. We need real reform, and real reform means a strong \npublic option.\n  Americans want a health insurance option. According to a recent poll \nby NBC and the Wall Street Journal, over three-fourths of those polled \nsaid they would like the ability to choose between public and private \nhealth insurance plans. Providing a public health insurance option does \nnot discriminate against those with preexisting conditions and \nillnesses, and it will significantly improve the ability of people to \naccess health care.\n  There are millions of Americans who will tell us their current so-\ncalled ``competitive'' market didn't work so well for them because they \nwere denied coverage from the outset, or they were given a benefit plan \nthat covers everything but the diseases they actually have. Health \ninsurance should not be a privilege, but in today's insurance market \nthat is actually what it is. Those who are healthy enough to be \napproved for coverage, or wealthy enough to afford it, are too often \nthe privileged ones who receive health care. We must shift the \ncompetition back to where it should be--on the health insurers \ncompeting to provide better coverage at a more affordable rate.\n  A public health insurance option, if done right, will help shift the \ninsurance market so plans focus on what is best for the patient to \nthrive instead of plans simply focused on the bottom line.\n  Just a few weeks ago, Geri Weitzel from Durand, WI, shared her story \nwith me. Geri's husband suffers from renal\n\n[[Page S6773]]\n\nfailure. His medicine costs hundreds of dollars each month, and the \nfamily has thousands in medical debt. Geri is doing her best to make \nends meet for her family but sometimes has to choose between paying the \nmortgage on their home or her husband's medical care, without which he \nwill die. Geri told me she came to Washington to share her story \nbecause her husband ``is choosing death over debt.'' She worries that \nthey will lose their home, and they have already lost their savings, \nbut above all, she worries she will lose her husband.\n  With a strong public health insurance option, we can help ensure that \nGeri and her husband can afford policies that cover their medical bills \nand can focus instead on getting well.\n\n  A strong public health insurance option is one the public can depend \non to be available, regardless of preexisting conditions, place of \nresidence, income, age, sex, health status, or job status. It is an \ninsurance option that will be focused on helping the sick get the \ntreatment they need instead of just turning the biggest profit for \nshareholders. It is also an insurance option that will help the public \ninvest in wellness, disease prevention, primary care, and chronic \ndisease management. A public option will help ensure no matter what, \npeople have access to a health insurance plan that actually meets their \nneeds.\n  One of my priorities in the health care reform debate--and one of my \npriorities throughout my whole time in the Senate--has been fiscal \nresponsibility. It is not enough to pass a bill that expands coverage; \nwe need to do so in a way that reins in runaway health care spending \nand ensures taxpayer dollars are not wasted. That is another reason we \nneed a strong public health insurance option: because it will help keep \ncosts down for individuals, for employers, and for the government.\n  Citizen Action Wisconsin estimates that a strong public health \ninsurance option operating in a health exchange could save Wisconsin \nemployers--both private and government--over $1.1 billion each year. \nFor the average Wisconsin family, currently paying around $13,500 a \nyear in health care premiums, this translates to a 33-percent savings, \nlowering their premiums to just over $9,000 a year.\n  Now this is real savings. It would have made a big difference to \nDanine Spencer of Rhinelander, WI. Danine has had a tough 4 years, \nrecovering from multiple conditions which doctors expected to leave her \na quadriplegic for life. Danine credits the medical professionals at \nFroedert Hospital in Milwaukee with helping her reclaim her mobility \nand, in many ways, her life. While Danine has already made incredible \nprogress, she still has a long way to go.\n  Fortunately, Danine qualified for disability and Medicaid benefits to \ncover her medical costs, but she wants to be independent. She wrote me \na letter in which she said she ``wants to get off disability very, very \nbadly. I am horribly ashamed that I collect a government check every \nmonth. But as it stands, I simply cannot afford private health \ninsurance.''\n  Danine writes that she has ``heard a public option health insurance \nplan would sharply lower costs for people like me. Please put \neverything you have into making sure it is part of the health care \nreform bill.''\n  Danine has already overcome incredible challenges. She wants to \npurchase health insurance but is denied that benefit by the existing \nsystem. So a public health insurance option would help ensure that \nDanine is guaranteed--guaranteed--affordable, high quality health care.\n  Too often Americans are at the mercy of the insurance companies when \nit comes to paying premiums and out-of-pocket costs and deductibles. \nWhile I commend the growing efforts of select insurers to increase \ntransparency, for the most part consumers have little idea how much \nprocedures cost, where premium dollars go, and whether they are truly \ngetting the best value for their dollar. A public health insurance \noption would serve as a benchmark competitor for premiums, \nadministrative costs, and benefits packages.\n  A strong public health insurance option is consistent with a healthy \nprivate market and effective private insurance plans. We have several \ninsurers that operate in my home State of Wisconsin that provide great \nhealth coverage for their beneficiaries. Responsible insurers should \nhave no trouble competing with a public insurance option on the merits \nof their plans, but a strong public health insurance option will \nprovide a powerful incentive for less responsible insurers to \nreevaluate their own cost sharing and benefit plans to ensure that they \nare actually an attractive option for consumers.\n  There is another benefit of a public health insurance option which \nhits particularly close to home. My hometown of Janesville, WI, has one \nof the highest unemployment rates in the State. Recently, our GM \nassembly plant ceased production, and other related businesses \nthroughout the community are struggling to stay afloat during these \ntough economic times. Of course, these challenges are shared by many \nother communities across the State of Wisconsin. A public health \ninsurance option would be invaluable to families in Janesville and \nother parts of the State who have recently been laid off because it is \na guaranteed, affordable option that can travel with an individual from \njob to job.\n  A public health insurance option would also make a tremendous \ndifference to our small business owners who face crippling health care \ncosts while trying to keep their business open.\n  Health care reform cannot wait. The President has said he wants a \nhealth reform bill on his desk by this fall, and I will work hard with \nmy colleagues to make sure we send him a good bill that guarantees \nevery American high-quality, affordable health insurance, and that \nincludes a strong public health insurance option. After so many years \nof delay and inaction, now is the time to act.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I withhold.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to speak on the supplemental. Did \nthe chairman wish to speak?\n  Mr. INOUYE. No, go ahead.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am happy to yield to the chairman if he wishes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Please proceed.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, first off, this is a very important piece \nof legislation. I congratulate the chairman and the ranking member, \nSenator Cochran and Senator Inouye, for bringing it forward. It is \ncritical that we adequately fund our troops in the field. This is our \nfirst responsibility as a government when we have troops in the field \nin harm's way--to give them the resources they need in order to protect \nthemselves and defend our liberties. So this is a very important piece \nof legislation, and it must pass. It simply must pass.\n  However, ironically, as occasionally occurs around here--but in a \npiece of legislation that is this important to our troops shouldn't \noccur--this legislation had air dropped into it by the House of \nRepresentatives something that has nothing to do with our troops \nfighting in the field, and that is a bill called the cash for clunker \nbill.\n  I have no personal or philosophical disagreement with the concept of \npurchasing automobiles that are high-mileage vehicles, and they use a \nlot less gas, and exchanging them for lower mileage vehicles as an \nattempt to revive the economy and the auto industry and at the same \ntime, hopefully, accomplish some environmental protections. I would \nsimply note, however, that this bill that was air dropped into this \nlegislation doesn't accomplish that.\n  Basically, this is a bill that was drafted in the House without the \ninput of the Senate. There was a much better bill in the Senate--\nSenator Feinstein and Senator Collins had it--which would have actually \nmeant some mileage differential would have occurred, but it was not \nallowed to be put in because the bill, as it was put into the \nconference report, was unamendable.\n  So the bill itself is flawed because it basically only allows--it \nallows you to exchange your car and get money for your car, but the \nincreased mileage on the new car you buy only has to be a mile or two a \ngallon, which is virtually nothing. It has virtually no impact.\n  So the philosophy of the bill itself is flawed. But the real problem \nwith this bill, besides the fact it is in a piece of legislation it \nshouldn't be in, is the\n\n[[Page S6774]]\n\nfact that it is totally unpaid for. It is $1 billion of new costs put \non our children's shoulders. It is $1 billion of new spending put on \nthe Federal debt. We already know the Federal debt isn't sustainable. \nAlmost every day we are hearing international purchasers of our debt--\nwhether it be China or whether it be Russia or whether it be \ninternational economists or economists in the United States--saying the \nAmerican debt situation has gotten out of control, and that we are at \nrisk as a nation of having a situation where the cost of our debt will \ngo up dramatically because we are putting so much debt on the books.\n\n  Under the President's budget, the deficit of the government will be a \ntrillion dollars a year, on average, for the next 10 years. We will be \nrunning deficits of 4 to 5 percent of gross national product. The \ndeficits will equal 80 percent, and we will have a debt that will equal \n80 percent of the GDP. Just within the next 3 years, it will be 60 \npercent of the GDP. At the end of 10 years, it will be 80 percent.\n  What does that mean? It means we will have a debt and a deficit \nsituation that will lead us down the road to having a government we \ncannot afford and our children cannot afford. Ironically, as I said \nbefore, our debt is getting so out of control and our deficits are \ngetting so high and out of control that if we as a nation tried to \nenter the European Union, which is a group of industrialized countries \nthat has rules as to what a country can do in the area of debt and \ndeficit for solvency reasons, we could not get in because their rules \nsay you cannot have a debt or deficit of more than 3 percent, and your \ndebt-to-GDP ratio cannot exceed 60 percent. Latvia or Lithuania or some \nother nation might be able to get into the European Union, but we could \nnot.\n  Our debt is an incredibly serious problem for us as a nation and for \nour children. The irony is, the bill that was airdropped into the \ndefense bill, designed to pay for the troops in the field, came on the \nexact same day that the President of the United States and the \nDemocratic leadership of the Congress met down at the White House to \nannounce they were going to reinstitute the pay-go rules. What are the \npay-go rules? The pay-go rules require that when you spend a dollar, \nyou pay for it; when you create a new program, you pay for it. The \nPresident, with great fanfare, said the Democratic leadership of this \ngovernment--the President and leadership of the Congress are going to \nput into place the pay-go rules. All future spending will be subject to \npay-go rules, with a few exceptions he listed, which were pretty big \nexceptions.\n  He didn't list this bill, which spends a billion dollars and is not \npaid for.\n  After that press conference, which occurred around 12:30 in the \nafternoon, the House of Representatives passed the cash for clunkers \nbill, which spent $4 billion dollars, and it wasn't paid for. That bill \nadded $4 billion of new debt to our national debt--debt which will be \npaid by these young people up here, who are pages today, when they get \njobs. What excuse do we have as a government for passing a bill to \npurchase cars today and sending that bill to our children and \ngrandchildren as part of the debt we are passing onto them? It is \ninexcusable. It would be easy enough to pay for this bill. There are \ninnumerable places in the government, which is spending trillions of \ndollars a year, to find a billion dollars to pay for this bill if it \nwas a priority.\n  Clearly, if the President and the Democratic leadership are going to \ncall on us to follow pay-go rules, we should follow them--at least for \na day. They couldn't even get through a day without violating the rules \nthey said they were going to follow--a billion dollars of new spending, \nwhich is unpaid for. Whether you agree with the policy of the bill or \nnot--this cash for clunkers bill--the issue is it spends a billion \ndollars and doesn't pay for it and adds it to the national debt, which \nis out of control. The American people know it is out of control, and \nit is inexcusable that this Congress cannot discipline itself.\n  I have made a point of order that doesn't bring down the bill and \ndoesn't harm our ability to fund the troops in the field. I made a \npoint of order under a new point of order that was put into place at \nthe beginning of this Congress by the Democratic leadership of this \nCongress in the Democratic body. This was a good rule. It was put into \nplace by a bill entitled the ``Honest Leadership and Open Government \nAct.'' Again, it is the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. Its \nprimary sponsor was Senator Reid, and its second sponsor was Senator \nDurbin, along with Senator Schumer and Senator Stabenow.\n  The bill was structured for the purpose of not allowing what happened \nwith this defense bill, which is that people airdropped it into special \ninterest legislation--unpaid for in this case. It is called rule XLIV, \nand I believe it is section 8. It says, essentially, that in a \nconference you cannot put in new language that was not part of that \nconference and which is targeting direct spending for the purpose of \nbenefitting some defined group--in this case, for the purpose of \npassing the cash for clunkers bill. You cannot put it in. The rule says \nthat. Why was it created? Because too often around here, this type of \nmismanagement of our finances occurs. People go into a conference and \nthey know they have a train that is going to leave the station and, in \nthis case, everybody wants to support the troops in the field and we \nare going to fund them. So they put in the conference all sorts of \nextraneous things that are inappropriate to that bill. It has become a \npandemic. The Democratic leadership, much to their credit, passed the \nHonest Leadership and Open Government Act. They put in rule XLIV, \nsection 8, which says that exactly what happened with this language \nshould not happen.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the committee, Senator Inouye, because \nhe has resisted, aggressively, allowing this type of action to occur. \nBut in this case, the House of Representatives gave him no option. They \nput the language in over, I presume, some debate.\n  So this motion will knock out this language. It doesn't defeat the \nbill. The bill can be sent back to the House and it can pass. It would \ntake another couple hours, at the most, to pass it. If people want to \nbring back the cash for clunkers bill, they can do it as a freestanding \nbill and, hopefully, they can do it by paying for it. That is the way \nit should be done. It violates another rule, which is the pay-go rule.\n  So this motion to waive is going to be the first test of this \nCongress on three critical issues. First, are we going to do something \nabout the debt of this Nation? Are we going to start paying for new \nprograms that we know are politically attractive? Every auto dealer in \nAmerica wants this language included in the bill. Are we going to pay \nfor it? Second, are we going to live by the rules that were put into \nplace by the Democratic leadership in the Honest Leadership and Open \nGovernment Act? Third, are we going to live by the statement made by \nthe President, surrounded by the Democratic leadership of the Congress, \nthat pay-go would be the new way we will enforce fiscal discipline? \nThose are three major issues that will be addressed by this vote.\n  Members who vote to waive this rule will be voting to pass a billion \ndollars of debt on to our children, on top of the trillions we are \nalready putting on their backs. They will be voting to waive a rule \nthat was put in by the Democratic leadership for the purpose of \navoiding this type of action--this exact type of action. They will be \nvoting to override the pay-go rules, which many Members have so wrapped \nthemselves in as the way they are going to fiscally discipline this \nplace.\n  I hope people will not vote to waive this point of order, sustain \nthis point of order, move forward on the supplemental, fund the troops; \nand let's not add a billion dollars of unnecessary debt on an \nextraneous program to the troop funding.\n  I yield the floor, and at the appropriate time, I will yield to \nSenator Grassley such time as he may desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise in support of the conference \nagreement on H.R. 2346, the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  The compromise agreement, which has been worked out in a full and \nopen conference between the two Houses, represents the hard work of our \nconferees.\n  As has long been the tradition of the Appropriations Committee the \ncompromise package before the Senate reflects the deliberations of our \ntwelve\n\n[[Page S6775]]\n\nsubcommittees. Each subcommittee has items in this measure and I am \npleased to note that all of our subcommittees were able to reach \nagreement with their House counterparts.\n  As such, the bill before us represents a balanced compromise between \nthe issues and funding recommended by the House and by the Senate.\n  As in any compromise neither body, nor individual Member, received \neverything he or she sought.\n  The House has agreed to support funding for the International \nMonetary Fund and the Senate has agreed to compromise language on how \nwe deal with the detainees at Guantanamo. But, it is a fair compromise \nwhich I believe all Members should support.\n  At $105.9 billion, the conference agreement is $14.6 billion above \nthe amount recommended by the Senate. However, it is important to point \nout to my Senate colleagues that nearly half of this increase \nrepresents additional funding for swine flu. This funding was included \nin response to a budget amendment submitted by the administration \nfollowing Senate passage of this bill.\n  The managers of our Labor HHS subcommittees have responded to the \npotential need for additional swine flu resources by providing more \nthan $7 billion in funding, of which nearly $6 billion is contingent \nupon the administration submitting additional requests for funds. We \nhave been advised that funding may be required this summer to prepare \nfor an outbreak next fall in the United States if the virus mutates \nover the next few months.\n  If that occurs, the American public can be assured that we will be \nready. I can also promise my colleagues that our Labor-HHS subcommittee \nwill be monitoring the flu virus and closely watching the \nadministration's efforts to respond to this potential crisis.\n  Regarding the remaining increase above the Senate bill, the \nconference agreement funding levels are between the amounts recommended \nby the two bodies.\n  The bill includes the funding level sought by the House for the \nDepartment of State and ``splits the difference'' in the amount \nrecommended by both bodies for defense and military construction.\n  One provision of note that was deleted from the measure relates to \nthe public release of photographs of detainees. The Senate agreed to \ndrop this provision only after the President sent a letter to Chairman \nObey and myself assuring us that he would not release the photographs \nin question.\n  While many of us support the intent of this amendment, it was clear \nthat including the amendment would jeopardize passage of the bill in \nthe House. That result would not have been an acceptable outcome.\n  Mr. President, this is a fair compromise and one which is worthy of \nthe support of every Member of the Senate.\n  I understand that there may be one or two items that not all Members \nagree with, but I would remind my colleagues that this is a must pass \nbill. The funding in this bill is critical to the Defense Department in \ncontinuing to support our servicemen and women fighting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  I would point out that if we cannot pass this bill, we will shortly \nrun out of funds to pay our service members and to ensure funds are \navailable to support the readiness of all our forces, not just those \nserving in Southwest Asia.\n  I want to thank my vice chairman for his counsel and support as we \nhave worked through several difficult issues.\n  We have forged this agreement together. I would note that there were \n30 Senate conferees on this measure and 27 signed the conference \nagreement.\n  Finally, I wish to thank all of our subcommittee chairmen and ranking \nmembers and their staffs for their hard work. This conference agreement \nwould not have been possible without their efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Treatment of Committee Witnesses\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last week, there was a disturbing \noccurrence on the other side of the Capitol that I believe needs to be \nbrought to the attention of my colleagues in the Senate.\n  On Tuesday, June 9, the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment of \nthe House Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing on allowance \nallocations policies in the Waxman-Markey climate change bill. One of \nthe witnesses who volunteered to testify before the subcommittee was \nDavid Sokol, chairman of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, based in \nmy State of Iowa, in the capital city of Des Moines.\n  We are all very well aware there are very divergent opinions on the \nso-called cap-and-trade program advocated by Chairman Waxman and \nSubcommittee Chairman Markey. Hearing witnesses are typically invited \nto share different positions and offer different perspectives on \nprospective policies. That was the case with the MidAmerican CEO. His \ncompany supports the cap on emission reductions in the bill but \nstrongly opposes the trading component.\n  In Mr. Sokol's testimony, he made clear his position that the trading \nmechanism in the Waxman-Markey bill will impose huge costs on \ncustomers. The costs will come in two ways: First, to pay for emission \nallowances, which will not reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and then \nfor the construction of new, low, and zero carbon powerplants that will \nactually reduce emissions. So in those two ways, customers pay. He \nindicated MidAmerican's customers would see an increase in electricity \nrates of somewhere between 12 percent at the low end and 28 percent at \nthe high end under the climate bill now before the other body.\n  It appears that Chairman Markey did not appreciate the criticism \nleveled at his bill by Mr. Sokol. During the hearing, a letter was sent \nby Chairman Markey's office to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nrequesting information about MidAmerican's investment and other \nactivities since the 2005 repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company \nAct--the short term around here, or acronym, is PUHCA.\n  The six-page letter also requested a reply from FERC within 2 days, \n``in order to better inform the Subcommittee's deliberations on this \nmatter.''\n  However, the 2005 repeal of PUHCA has absolutely nothing to do with \nChairman Markey's climate change bill. It appears it is more than a \ncoincidence that Chairman Markey was firing off a six-page letter \nconcerning MidAmerican while the CEO was making critical comments on \nhis bill before his committee. This appears to be a blatant use of \npower to intimidate a witness whose opinions differ from the chairman.\n  It has recently been reported that Chairman Markey was unaware that \nthe letter was being sent at the time, and I would accept his position \non that. Once the letter was brought to his attention, Chairman Markey \nrealized how inappropriate it was and subsequently sent another letter \nto FERC clarifying his inquiry. This seems to indicate that there are \nunnamed committee staff who are trying to intimidate and prevent \ndetractors from speaking against their climate bill. These types of \nstrong-arm tactics should not be tolerated.\n  What lengths are proponents willing to go to if they are willing to \nintimidate people who disagree with them? Are they so unsure of their \nown position that they have resorted to apparent retribution to silence \ntheir critics? Quite frankly, those in the Senate should be skeptical \nof legislation that is advanced with such zeal that witnesses are being \nthreatened with intimidation if they oppose it, whether that is by \nstaff writing a letter or any other way.\n  Policymaking is a very complicated process. It is one that depends on \nthe honest and forthright input of outside experts and stakeholders to \ngive information; obviously, not to twist arms. After this incident, it \nseems the process going on in the House of Representatives is not open \nand fair to those who are critical of the Waxman-Markey bill. We owe it \nto the American public to restore this process to a more dignified \nlevel and assure all witnesses before Congress that they will be \ntreated fairly and with respect, regardless of whether they agree or \ndisagree with the chairman and/or staff.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n[[Page S6776]]\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what is the time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 36 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be yielded 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Cash for Clunkers\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one way to stimulate a key part of our \neconomy--auto sales--is to establish a so-called fleet modernization or \ncash for clunkers program that would provide a voucher for purchase of \nnew vehicles to those turning in their older less fuel efficient \nvehicles. This program will encourage people to purchase new more fuel \nefficient vehicles and will both stimulate the sale of new vehicles and \nreduce overall fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. By \nproviding incentives for the purchase of new more fuel efficient \nvehicles, this program will provide a much-needed boost to the \nstruggling auto industry, including manufacturers, dealers, suppliers \nand other related industries.\n  New vehicle sales of all auto companies in the world continue to \nsuffer as we weather this unprecedented downturn in the U.S. economy. \nSince the end of last year, we have seen a decrease in sales of 30 to \n40 percent over the same period a year ago. Therefore, it is imperative \nthat we turn around this sales decline, and one way to help is with \nincentive programs such as the cash for clunkers program. Legislation \nto implement such a program was first passed by the House of \nRepresentatives as a stand-alone measure and has now been included as \npart of the Supplemental Appropriations Act before the Senate. \nIncluding this measure in this critical legislation will allow this \nprogram to be implemented quickly and begin to have a positive effect \non the economy.\n  There is strong evidence that this type of program will work. Nearly \nevery major industrialized country in the world with an auto industry \nhas now some kind of vehicle scrappage program in place and there is \ndocumented evidence of increased sales. Germany has seen an increase in \nnew vehicle sales of 25 to 40 percent since its program was implemented \nearlier this year. China saw an increase in new vehicle sales of 15 \npercent in March after its program was implemented. France has seen an \nincrease in vehicle sales of 8 percent since its program was \nimplemented at the end of 2008. Other countries--such as Japan and \nKorea--have more recently followed suit and implemented programs like \nthis. It is too early to have sales data for these countries, but they \nare expected to show similar positive increases in sales of new \nvehicles.\n  Under the legislation passed by the House and included in the \nsupplemental, an individual would be able to bring in an eligible older \nand less fuel efficient vehicle and receive a voucher for a new more \nfuel efficient vehicle. To be eligible to be turned in, the old vehicle \nwould need to have a fuel economy value of 18 miles per gallon or less, \nor in the case of a work truck, be older than a 2002 model. The \nindividual turning in the old vehicle would then receive a voucher for \na new vehicle. The minimum threshold for the new vehicle purchased \nwould be 22 miles per gallon fuel economy for new passenger cars, 18 \nmiles per gallon fuel economy for new light duty trucks, and 15 miles \nper gallon fuel economy for new large trucks.\n  The amount of the voucher received for a new purchase would depend \nupon the incremental improvement in fuel economy of the new vehicle \nover the old vehicle. Individuals would receive a voucher of no less \nthan $3,500 toward purchase of the new vehicle, but could receive as \nmuch as $4,500 based upon the fuel economy value of the new vehicle. \nHigher fuel economy, therefore, would bring higher savings--thereby \ncreating a positive incentive for individuals to buy the most fuel \nefficient vehicles available. To ensure that the older less fuel \nefficient vehicle would not be used on the road again, the old vehicle \nwould be taken to a registered disposal facility where it would be \ndestroyed by dismantling the drive train and engine block. Any value of \nother used car parts would be protected, however, as these parts could \nbe sold separately by the disposal facility.\n  The compromise before the Senate provides a well-crafted and balanced \nfleet modernization program. It will accelerate national economic \nrecovery by stimulating up to an estimated 1 million new vehicle sales \nwhile at the same time pushing consumers toward purchase of more fuel \nefficient vehicles. This legislation is based upon months of work to \ndevelop a compromise among the administration, the auto companies, \nenvironmental organizations, and auto dealers. It provides a reasonable \ncompromise and establishes a solid program that will give consumers \nwith older vehicles an immediate cash incentive to purchase new more \nfuel efficient cars and trucks. By including a hierarchy of cash \nvouchers for purchase of new vehicles that increases the amount \navailable for the most fuel-efficient new vehicles, this legislation \nwill both stimulate the economy and encourage consumers to purchase \nmore fuel-efficient vehicles. This legislation strikes the appropriate \nbalance between economic stimulus and fuel efficiency.\n  The proposal before us today keeps the focus on the primary purpose \nof this effort--to stimulate the U.S. economy by providing an incentive \nfor individuals to turn in their older less fuel efficient vehicles and \npurchase a new more fuel efficient vehicle. It provides the proper \nbalance--it encourages consumers to purchase more fuel efficient \nvehicles by including a hierarchy of incentives that offer a greater \namount for a more fuel efficient vehicle. Stimulating vehicle sales \nwhile also getting older less fuel efficient vehicles off the road is \nsurely an important national goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the senior \nSenator from Michigan.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask that the time be charged \nequally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2346, the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009.\n  The conference report includes $105.9 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority for fiscal year 2009, which will result in outlays in 2009 of \n$30.5 billion. Of this budget authority, $90.7 billion is designated as \nbeing for overseas deployments and other activities pursuant to S. Con. \nRes. 13, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2010. \nThis results in new outlays of $27 billion in 2009. The conference \nreport also includes $16.2 billion in emergency discretionary budget \nauthority, which results in outlays of $3.5 billion in 2009. Finally, \nthe conference report includes rescissions of existing budget authority \nand other changes that result in -$1 billion in regular budget \nauthority and -$37 million in 2009 outlays.\n  The conference report includes several emergency designations each of \nwhich is subject to a point of order established by section 403 of the \n2010 budget resolution. In addition, the conference report includes \nlanguage relating to credit scoring that is within the\n\n[[Page S6777]]\n\njurisdiction of the Budget Committee and as a result is subject to a \npoint of order under section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act. \nFinally, the conference report includes several provisions that make \nchanges in a mandatory program--CHIMPS--that result in an increase in \ndirect spending over the 9-year period, 2011-2019.

The adoption of this provision in \nthe 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act will aid in the economic \nrecovery of Arkansas as demonstrated in the various letters from \nGovernor Beebe, the Arkansas congressional delegation and the related \ndata and communications that are to be printed in the record after my \nremarks.\n  With regard to the amendment itself, it is the intention of the \ndrafters and the Senate, that despite the ordering of its paragraphs, \nthe language concerning the uniform accessibility of provisions of the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 are to apply to all \nbonds and obligations issued under that act for all purposes for which \nbonds under the act may be issued and are not limited to matters \nassociated with housing. Without this amendment, Arkansas may not have \nready access to the same Federal programs to which our sister States \nhave access. Again, thanks to my colleagues for recognizing that the \neconomy of and commerce in Arkansas affects and is affected by every \nother State and their respective commerce.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following documents be printed in \nthe Record as supporting documentation of the intent and reasoning \nbehind this important provision: (1) a letter from Arkansas Governor \nMike Beebe dated May 14, 2009, (2) a letter from Arkansas Governor Mike \nBeebe dated March 14, 2008, (3) a letter from the Arkansas \nCongressional Delegation dated May 14, 2009, (4) a letter from the \nCouncil of Development Finance Agencies dated May 29, 2009, and (5) \nPresentation to the Arkansas House Committee on State Agencies and \nGovernmental Affairs regarding a proposed State constitutional \namendment to deal with this issue. The inclusion of these documents \nserves to make clear our intent regarding this important provision.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 14, 2009.\n     Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of \n     2009 (ARRA) provides the first significant improvements to \n     the federal public-finance legislation in decades. The \n     municipal finance industry, cities, counties, and state \n     finance agencies will have until 2011 to utilize the new \n     authority given by Congress.\n       Unfortunately, governmental entities in Arkansas are still \n     subject to provisions in the Constitution of Arkansas that \n     impose interest-rate limits and restrict our use of the ARRA \n     funds. The State is currently taking steps to amend our \n     Constitution with respect to interest-rate controls, but such \n     changes, if approved, will not become effective in time for \n     the State to be able to fully participate in the National \n     Recovery by utilizing these new financing tools,\n       In light of the negative impact of the current restrictions \n     in the Arkansas Constitution, we respectfully request a \n     temporary federal preemption of State interest-rate limits \n     until January of 2011 for those federal programs that deal \n     with public-finance matters addressed in ARRA.\n       The amendments and modifications in ARRA provide for more \n     participation from investors, from private industry, and from \n     governmental entities. We need temporary relief from the \n     controls in Arkansas so that our State may participate fully \n     in the development activities and the improved finance \n     capacities enjoyed by the rest of the country. Thank you for \n     your attention to this critical matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mike Beebe.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 14, 2008.\n     Senator Blanche Lincoln,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Mark Pryor,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Representative Marion Berry,\n     Rayburn House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Representative Mike Ross,\n     Cannon House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Representative John Boozman,\n     Longworth House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Representative Vic Snyder,\n     Longworth House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Friends and Colleagues: As you know, Arkansas is the \n     only state that has a prescriptive usury provision in its \n     constitution. With regard to some commercial transactions, \n     this usury provision poses a problem for those entities that \n     are not removed from its authority via federal preemption.\n       In recent years, Congress has enacted several laws \n     preempting the Arkansas usury provision for Arkansas banking \n     institutions, auto finance companies, and other similar \n     entities, However, the usury provision is still applicable to \n     certain transactions involving governmental entities, as a \n     federal preemption has not been granted in their favor.\n       The recent reduction of the primary credit discount rate by \n     the Federal Reserve Bank in its efforts to stimulate the \n     economy has exposed the negative effects that the Arkansas \n     usury provision can have on particular governmental entities. \n     While the rate reduction may benefit the overall economy, it \n     also has resulted in the reduction of the Arkansas usury \n     limitation to 8.5 percent currently, with a likely decrease \n     to 8 percent in the near future. This low usury limitation \n     makes it exceedingly difficult for transactions that are \n     mandated by the federal government or that are for the \n     purpose of implementing federally established programs to \n     take place.\n       Specifically, due to the Arkansas usury limitation, the \n     Arkansas Student Loan Authority (ASLA) is finding it more and \n     more difficult to finance activities that allow it to make \n     student loans available for Arkansas students. Current \n     distresses in the financial markets and the recent changes to \n     the federal student loan program have greatly impacted the \n     student loan industry. The credit market situation is \n     predicted to worsen before experiencing improvement. Although \n     ASLA has financial stability, it will need additional capital \n     to fund loans when they reach the point that they are unable \n     to continue recycling loan funds. The Arkansas usury \n     provision is currently acting as a barrier to additional \n     capital, as banks are not willing to accept bonds that may be \n     limited by the current low usury rate. This is a problem that \n     not only plagues ASLA, hut also affects the manner in which \n     the Arkansas Development Finance Authority (ADFA) implements \n     its single-family mortgage program and its multi-family \n     programs, as well.\n       Accordingly, I am asking you to consider enacting \n     legislation that would grant a usury preemption provision in \n     those instances when either a governmental or a private \n     entity, such as ASLA or ADFA, is responsible for carrying out \n     federally mandated programs or implementing federally \n     established programs. We believe that when so expressed, the \n     Congress's ability to preempt state usury laws under the \n     commerce clause is broad enough to cover the federal \n     preemption suggested. Representatives of both ASLA and ADFA \n     have been working on a draft usury-preemption provision, and \n     they, along with a representative from my office, will be \n     contacting your office regarding this issue. I am hopeful \n     that this can be accomplished in a manner similar to the \n     preemption granted to Arkansas banking institutions through \n     the Gramm-Leach-Biley Act.\n\n[[Page S6778]]\n\n       This is a developing matter of some urgency, and I very \n     much appreciate your cooperation and consideration with \n     regard to this issue.\n           Cordially,\n     Mike Beebe.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders Reid and McConnell: As members of the Arkansas \n     delegation, we are requesting your support for an amendment \n     we will be offering to the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights \n     Act of 2009 (H.R. 627) during Senate consideration. This is a \n     critical legislative proposal that will provide temporary \n     relief for an Arkansas-specific interest rate problem that is \n     having a severe impact on Arkansas students, consumers, and \n     businesses, as well as our municipalities and state \n     government.\n       Arkansas is the only state in the nation with a \n     constitutionally-defined, artificially low interest rate \n     limit that is tied to the Federal Discount Rate. Under \n     current law, the interest rate on special-revenue bonds and \n     non-bank consumer loans may not exceed five percent above the \n     Federal Discount Rate, currently set at .50 percent. Other \n     bonds are capped even lower, at 2 percent above the Federal \n     Discount Rate. As a result, Arkansas' state and local \n     governments, public universities, and utilities in search of \n     financing for construction and improvement projects are \n     severely hampered by the current limit; as are Arkansas \n     consumers, who are facing a lack of credit availability.\n       Practically speaking, the current interest rate limit in \n     Arkansas on all non-bank lending is no higher than 5.50 \n     percent. Not surprisingly, this low rate of interest has \n     contributed to bond investors looking to other states across \n     the country where their yields will be much higher, as well \n     as credit rationing by non-bank lenders that have been forced \n     to restrict funds to consumers, particularly now when capital \n     is hard to come by.\n       Although we understand the Federal Reserve's actions in \n     recent months to continue lowering the Federal Discount Rate \n     were intended to combat the economic crisis and stave off a \n     further decline in our financial markets, their actions have \n     only exacerbated the economic challenges faced in our state. \n     Additionally, many of the tools put in place in the American \n     Recovery and Reinvestment Act earlier this year to jumpstart \n     our economy, such as the Recovery Zone Bonds and the Build \n     America Bonds, are not available in our state because of our \n     lack of competitiveness in the bond market. As stated in a \n     recent Arkansas Democrat-Gazette article on this issue:\n       ``The bond market has responded to the Build America \n     program. Since its introduction, investors have purchased $8 \n     billion in offerings, providing the bulk of activity in the \n     taxable-bond sector. Arkansas is not in position to take \n     part.''\n       This is an issue that impacts Arkansas alone and Arkansas \n     does indeed intend to fix the problem. However, we can't do \n     so immediately because this archaic clause in Arkansas law \n     must be rectified through a statewide ballot initiative. \n     Therefore, a proposal to permanently modify this outdated law \n     will be voted on by the people of Arkansas, but not until the \n     next statewide ballot in 2010. Unfortunately, the economic \n     challenges our nation now faces are magnified in our state \n     because of this problem and immediate, emergency intervention \n     is essential.\n       There is precedent for Federal action on this issue, as the \n     U.S. Congress enacted an Arkansas-specific provision to \n     exclude Arkansas bank lenders from this exact interest rate \n     limit in 1999, The amendment we are offering today is more \n     limited in scope, allowing only a temporary relaxation of the \n     current interest rate limit to a more reasonable level, not \n     to exceed 17 percent; and it would only be in effect until \n     the state ballot initiative is considered. This is merely a \n     bridge to get us through the immediate crisis and to a point \n     when our state can permanently address the problem next year.\n       This is a matter of great urgency for our state. We hope we \n     can count on your support and look forward to discussing \n     further if you have any questions or concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n     Blanche L. Lincoln,\n       U.S. Senate.\n     Mark Pryor,\n       U.S. Senate.\n     Marion Berry,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Vic Snyder,\n       Member of Congress.\n     John Boozman,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Mike Ross,\n       Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                        Council of\n\n\n                                 Development Finance Agencies,\n\n                                      Cleveland, OH, May 29, 2009.\n     Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: The Council of Development Finance \n     Agencies (CDFA) respectfully urges support and passage of the \n     temporary federal preemption on municipal interest rates \n     until December 31 of 2010 for those federal programs dealing \n     with public finance matters addressed in the American \n     Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). This preemption was \n     proposed by Senator Lincoln as an amendment to H.R. 2346, a \n     supplemental spending bill. It is a measure that would \n     provide significant benefits to the State of Arkansas.\n       Most of the ARRA provisions only have a two-year window. \n     Unfortunately, the governmental entities in Arkansas; state \n     agencies, state bond authorities, cities and counties are \n     still governed by the provisions in the Constitution of \n     Arkansas that control interest rate limits. The State of \n     Arkansas is taking steps to amend their Constitution with \n     respect to interest rate controls. HJR 1004 has been referred \n     by the State Legislature to the Arkansas voters during the \n     2009 legislative session. HJR 1004 is a proposed \n     constitutional amendment that will remove the ceiling on \n     interest rates for governmental units. That vote will be \n     decided at the general election in November of 2010, which \n     would essentially prevent Arkansas from utilizing the two-\n     year provisions, including Build America Bonds.\n       CDFA is a national association dedicated to the advancement \n     of development finance concerns and interests. We have a long \n     history of working with Arkansas agencies that would be \n     positively impacted by this amendment, including the Arkansas \n     Development Finance Authority (ADFA). They have been a \n     longtime member and active on our Board of Directors. ADFA is \n     one of the leading development finance agencies in the \n     country and was recognized as having the best industrial \n     development bond program in 2006 by CDFA. ADFA is also one of \n     10 organizations highlighted as case studies in CDFA's \n     recently published book, the Practitioner's Guide to Economic \n     Development Finance.\n       In light of the negative impact of the restrictions \n     embedded in the Arkansas Constitution, CDFA respectfully \n     requests a temporary federal preemption on interest rates \n     until December 31 of 2010 for those federal programs dealing \n     with public finance matters addressed in ARRA. This exemption \n     would allow ADFA and other Arkansas agencies access to \n     financing tools that would allow them to issue debt and \n     finance new projects at significant cost savings to Arkansas \n     taxpayers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Toby Rittner,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Proposing a Constitutional Amendment To Remove From the Constitution \n    Interest Rate Limits on Bonds Issued By and Loans Made By or To \n                           Governmental Units\n\n\n                            legal highlights\n\n       The proposed amendment eliminates constitutional interest \n     rate limits currently applicable to governmental units.\n       The proposed amendment provides that the General Assembly \n     shall have the power to establish interest rate limits.\n       The proposed amendment removes the interest rate limit on \n     city and county bonds backed by taxes (such as sales, \n     property, and hotel/restaurant taxes) which must be voter \n     approved. Amendment No. 62 sets the limit at 2.00% above the \n     Federal Discount Rate on the date of the election approving \n     the bonds. The Federal Discount Rate is currently .50% which \n     produces an interest rate limit of 2.50%.\n       The proposed amendment removes the interest rate limit on \n     revenue bonds. Amendment No. 65 that authorizes revenue bonds \n     to be issued without an election states that Amendment No. \n     60's interest rate limit is to apply to revenue bonds. That \n     limit is 5.00% above the Federal Discount Rate when the \n     contract or bond purchase agreement is signed. The Federal \n     Discount Rate is currently .50% which produces an interest \n     rate limit of 5.50%.\n       Any agreement that provides for an interest rate that is \n     variable over its term is currently controlled by the initial \n     limit established when a contract is signed, without regard \n     to market changes over the term of the agreement.\n       The proposed amendment removes the interest rate limit on \n     loans made by governmental units, including State Agencies \n     that have project loan programs such as the Arkansas \n     Development Finance Authority and the Arkansas Natural \n     Resources Commission. The Amendment No. 60 limit mentioned \n     above applies to such programs (5.00% above the Federal \n     Discount Rate on the date any program loan agreement is \n     signed, currently 5.50%).\n       The proposed amendment removes the interest rate limit on \n     short term financing for cities and counties. Amendment No. \n     78 that authorizes short term financings sets a limit based \n     upon one year U.S. treasury obligations. The limit changes \n     quarterly.\n\n[[Page S6779]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS18JN09.001\n     \n\n\n[[Page S6780]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS18JN09.002\n     \n\n\n[[Page S6781]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS18JN09.003\n     \n\n\n[[Page S6782]]\n\n     Arkansas's Interest Rate Restrictions Impact on State Agencies\n\n\n               EFFECT ON ARKANSAS STUDENT LOAN AUTHORITY\n\n       The Arkansas Student Loan Authority (``ASLA'') provides \n     student loans to Arkansas residents and students at \n     Arkansas's universities and colleges. ASLA also provides \n     liquidity for Arkansas banks participating in the Federal \n     Family Education Loan Program. ASLA raises the money from \n     which it makes and purchases student loans by issuing bonds \n     in the capital markets.\n       The maximum amount of interest that ASLA may pay a bond \n     investor under the Arkansas interest rate restriction is \n     determined at the time bonds are issued, and this rate cannot \n     change even if the market changes over the 25-30 year life of \n     the bonds. The current maximum interest rate under Arkansas \n     law is 5.50%. The interest rate limit is determined by adding \n     5 percentage points to the Federal Discount Rate. The current \n     Discount Rate is 0.50%.\n       ASLA was forced to redeem approximately $80 million in \n     bonds in 2008 due to the bond interest rates exceeding limits \n     established at the time bonds were initially sold to \n     investors. These funds would have normally been used to make \n     or purchase student loans.\n       Previously, ASLA and other student loan issuers accessed \n     funds in the capital markets primarily by issuing Auction \n     Rate Bonds. The interest rate limit was a nuisance when \n     issuing Auction Rate Bonds but was not an impenetrable \n     barrier. The Auction Rate Bond market has collapsed and is \n     not expected to return.\n       The most likely vehicle through which ASLA will access the \n     capital markets is through Variable Rate Demand Bonds, which \n     require a ``liquidity bank''. The banks who typically act as \n     liquidity providers are unwilling to do business in Arkansas \n     due to the artificial interest rate ceiling placed on bonds \n     issued by governmental agencies in the state.\n       The interest rate restriction affects much more than \n     student loans; it is having a negative effect on Arkansas \n     cities, counties, non-profits and State governmental agencies \n     that depend on the issuance of revenue bonds to gain access \n     to funding. Such agencies use revenue bonds to finance \n     facilities for water, sewer, industrial development, \n     education, recreation and other important projects that serve \n     the needs of the citizens of Arkansas.\n\n\n                effect on other arkansas state agencies\n\n       The inability of State of Arkansas bond issuers to lock in \n     long-term interest rates for governmental, student loan, \n     housing, economic development and 501(c) 3 projects puts \n     Arkansas at a competitive disadvantage with the rest of the \n     world. Arkansas borrowers who need fixed rate financing for \n     their long-term assets are being subjected to interest rate \n     risk and higher transaction costs due to refinancing, because \n     the bonds are only able to be sold with shorter term \n     maturities, if they can be sold at all.\n       Following this page is information on two example \n     transactions completed to support economic development that \n     were impacted by the existing constitutional interest rate \n     limit. The bond issues were for the Hewlett Packard \n     facilities in Conway and Sage Foods in Little Rock. \n     Fortunately, these issues were completed before the Federal \n     Discount Rate was lowered to its current level of .50%. \n     Otherwise, the negative impact could have been greater.\n       Lenders located outside the borders of Arkansas that \n     provide liquidity and credit enhancement to bond issues will \n     not be extending credit if interest rates in Arkansas do not \n     float up and down with the market. These out-of-state lenders \n     do not want to take interest rate risk on bond issues for \n     their manufacturing clients that are located in Arkansas.\n       Arkansas governmental agencies that make loans and manage \n     revolving loan funds need proper compensation for lending \n     risks, making it easier to build sustainable pools of lending \n     capital for the State of Arkansas.\n       Taskforce on the 21st Century Economy: (Web site--http://\ntaskforce21.arkansas.gov/)\n       One charge of the 21st Century Taskforce: Define the \n     programs and services needed for the state and its \n     communities to be globally competitive within the role and \n     scope of 21st Century economic development.\n\n\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009--Build America Bonds\n\n       With rates currently capped at 5.5%, Arkansas will not be \n     able to participate in this taxable bond financing program in \n     a very meaningful way. Current federal law limits these new \n     bond issues to years 2009 and 2010. Many other substantive \n     changes were also made to federal tax law.

The \n     Company needed $11,000,000 to build a 90,000 square foot \n     industrial facility for the production of instant rice and \n     frozen rice in the Little Rock Port Industrial Park. The \n     Bonds were originally structured to have $6,000,000 issued \n     with an Arkansas Development Finance Authority (``ADFA'') \n     Guaranty and $5,000,000 with an Arkansas Department of \n     Economic Development (``ADED'') Guaranty, with level debt \n     service and a final maturity of 2023.\n       Because of Arkansas interest rate limits, the true interest \n     cost (TIC) on the Bonds is limited to 5% over the federal \n     discount rate the day the bond purchase agreement is signed. \n     The discount rate was lowered to 1.75% on October 8th, which \n     meant the TIC couldn't exceed 6.75% on the Bonds. With this \n     limitation, $4,455,000 of the ADFA Guaranteed Bonds were sold \n     on October 28th with a final maturity of 2023. The Borrower \n     needed the final series of bonds issued by year end. With the \n     change in the discount rate to 1.25% on October 29th, the \n     structure of the remaining Bonds had to be shortened to 2014 \n     with the bulk of the bonds maturing in the final year. These \n     bonds were sold in early December, a week before the discount \n     rate was lowered to .50%.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, just about 1 month ago I voted against \nthe emergency supplemental spending bill and stated my reasons for \ndoing so at some length. I will not repeat what I said then, but my \nconcerns also apply to the conference report we are considering. While \nthe President has provided a timeline for redeployment of our troops \nfrom Iraq, I remain concerned that we may see upwards of 50,000 U.S. \ntroops remain in that country. Leaving such a substantial number of \ntroops in Iraq could undercut the benefits of redeployment, and might \nresult in a significant uptick in violence against U.S. troops.\n  I am also concerned that this supplemental pads the defense budget \nwith items not needed for the war and outside the normal appropriations \ncycle.\n  Finally, and even though President Obama has a plan to focus the \ngovernment's attention and resources where they are most needed--on \nAfghanistan and Pakistan--I am worried that the current strategy does \nnot adequately address, and may even exacerbate, the serious national \nsecurity problems we face in that part of the world. Those problems \ncould be made worse, not better, by sending 21,000 more U.S. troops to \nAfghanistan and they may be further aggravated if there is not an \nadequate response to the nearly 3 million Pakistanis who have recently \nbeen displaced.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will soon vote on a motion to waive a \npoint of order. In the last Congress, we heard our colleagues say \nthings such as:\n\n       I cannot understand how we can claim to support our troops \n     and yet put them in increased jeopardy as a result of our \n     failure to act.\n\n  Here is another:\n\n       It is so irresponsible to tell these young men and women \n     who are serving in uniform with the orders of their Commander \n     in Chief that you're not going to give them the necessary \n     ability to defend themselves. In my view it's terribly \n     misplaced priorities.\n\n  And another:\n\n       It is time to put politics behind us and support our troops \n     with the funds they need.\n\n  Each of these quotes were spoken by Republicans when a Republican was \nin the White House. Today, with a Democrat in the White House, some \nRepublicans threaten to stand in the way of our efforts to support our \ntroops. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines have done everything we \nhave asked of them and more. As always, our troops and commanders have \ngone above and beyond. The least we can do is give them the basics they \nneed to fight this war against terrorists. This bill does that. It \ngives our brave troops, including more than 1,000 men and women from \nthe State of Nevada, the resources they need to do their jobs and to \nreturn home safely. It provides $80 billion for the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  In this important piece of legislation, we are also dedicating \nbillions of dollars to make sure we are prepared for and to respond to \na potential flu pandemic. We must be ready. There is no other \nopportunity than this legislation to be ready by this fall. We are also \ndedicating billions of dollars in this legislation to strengthen the \nsecurity\n\n[[Page S6783]]\n\nalong our borders, and we are also dedicating billions of dollars to \nsupport counterterrorism programs both at home and abroad. This is very \nimportant.\n  But in this bill are not merely numbers. This legislation also \ncontains our commitment to strengthen our military, rebuilding our \nrelationships with key allies around the world and reducing key \nsecurity threats.\n  Rather than restoring our standing in the world, some Republicans are \nstanding in the way, period. I repeat, rather than restoring our \nstanding in the world, some Republicans are standing in the way. They \nare threatening to block this entire bill and the good it does because \nof one small but significant part of it. That small but significant \npart is actually a tremendously important and good program. It is \ncalled cash for clunkers.\n  This is a program that has been tested in other places. In Germany, \nit has been tremendous for their economy. It helps our economy and our \nenvironment. Here is how it works. If you trade in your car over the \nnext 4 months, we will give you up to $4,500 toward a new car that is \nmore fuel efficient. That sounds pretty good. Everybody benefits, the \nenvironment and the economy. Those who oppose this may not think it is \na worthy goal, but they should not hold hostage the equipment and \ntraining our troops need because of this small provision in the bill. \nThey should not let less than 1 percent of this entire important bill \nsink the whole thing, but that is exactly what some of our colleagues \nare planning to do.\n  Are they doing it to embarrass the President? Are they doing it \nbecause they don't think the troops need the resources to fight those \ntwo wars? Why are they doing this?\n  Because everyone should understand, if this point of order is not \nwaived, this bill is finished. The House had a difficult time passing \nthis legislation because the House got no support from Republicans. The \nquestion is whether these Senators still agree we must never walk away \nfrom our troops or if they only believe it when their party is in the \nWhite House. I sincerely hope Senate Republicans do not follow the lead \nof the House Republicans. Out of 435 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, 5 Republicans voted to support our troops. They had a \ndifferent excuse in the House. What they said was: We are not going to \ndo this because there is a small amount of money in there for the \nInternational Monetary Fund. There hasn't been a word raised in this \nbody over that because it is so important. It is supported by Democrats \nand Republicans over here, that particular provision in the \nsupplemental.\n  In the Senate, they have raised another issue, cash for clunkers. \nSome are saying: Well, cash for clunkers isn't bad, but I don't like \nthis version of it. I think we could do a version that would be more \nenvironmentally friendly and so, as a result, I am voting against it.\n  Everyone should understand, especially those who care about our armed \nservices--and I know the American people support them 100 percent--all \nthe American people should understand, if there is not a waiver of this \npoint of order, the troops will not get their money. Secretary Gates \nhas been very good. He has not sent out any blue slips telling them \nthey are going to lose their jobs, to civilian employees first, and \nthen the pink slips to others that they will lose their jobs \npermanently. But that time is fast approaching. We cannot simply \nrevitalize this bill in a matter of a few minutes. We have to do it \ntoday. There are provisions in this bill that are important to our \nstanding in the world. We have to support our troops.\n  I, personally, with 5 children and 16 grandchildren, am a little \nconcerned about the flu pandemic that all scientists, with rare \nexception, are telling us is going to hit in the fall. We are spending \nthis money at this time so we can be ready for that and have shots that \npeople can get to stop them from getting sick or not getting as sick.\n  Our troops, each and every one of whom volunteered for duty, are the \nlast people who should be caught in the crossfire of political \ngamesmanship.\n  I hope the point of order will be waived and that the money for the \ntroops will be on its way in a matter of hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nstatement. I know there is controversy involved in this so-called cash \nfor clunkers, which is a humorous name for a very serious proposal. \nLet's be real honest about where we are in America today. We have seen \nthe largest decline in automobile sales in 50 years. Sales are down 29 \npercent. Automobile production is down 46 percent from where it was \njust 17 months ago. Plummeting auto sales have reduced production, and \nit has had a ripple effect across the economy, forcing dealerships and \nfactories to close. We have lost 280,000 American jobs in the \nautomobile industry. That is what this is about, 280,000 American jobs \nthat are lost and more that will be lost if we do nothing.\n  Some would have us do nothing. While the automobile industry is \nroiling from job losses and declining production, many consumers in the \nmarket for new cars are waiting. They are holding back. The purpose of \nthis legislation is to put some movement into the purchasing of new \nautomobiles. It is a targeted way to give incentives to Americans to \nbuy cars, get them back in the showrooms, back on the lots buying the \ncars that start moving the inventory, creating demand, and creating a \nmore positive feeling about the automobile industry. Are there better \nways to have written this? Yes. I think I could have sat down with \nothers and spent more time. But that is the case in almost every bill \nthat comes before us.\n  Some have argued: Listen, this just came up in the conference \ncommittee. It passed the House of Representatives before it was brought \nup in the conference committee. I will concede that I wish that bill \nwould have been debated and passed here, but we didn't have the \nopportunity to do it. We literally did not. This is a matter of seizing \nan opportunity that could make a profound difference.\n\n  Has this concept of giving cash incentives to customers to buy cars \never been tried? It turns out it has. It was tried in January of this \nyear in Germany, where they offered $3,300 to consumers to replace old \ncars with new ones. At the end of the program's first month, car sales \nin Germany dramatically increased by 21 percent. The bad news? That \nsame month automobile sales in the United States went down by 41 \npercent. Germany knew how to create a surge in purchasing by consumers \nwith similar legislation to what is being brought to the floor.\n  Let's be honest about the automobile industry. Next to the housing \nindustry, it is at the base of our economic pyramid. We need to make \nsure a strong auto industry is available to America so we can rebuild \nout of this recession and start creating jobs. Those who want to kill \nthis provision are walking away from incentives to put people back to \nwork in dealerships selling cars, servicing cars, and producing cars \nacross America.\n  I beg those who oppose this to understand what we will face if we do \nnothing, which is what they want to do, nothing. I think that is a \nterrible outcome. If we want to stand behind recovering from this \nrecession and restoring consumer confidence, if we want to move old \ncars off the road, the so-called clunkers, and bring new cars on the \nroad with higher gas mileage, this is our opportunity. Let's not get \ncaught up in some procedural tanglement. Keep our eye on 280,000 \nAmericans out of work in this industry, more to follow if we do \nnothing. This is going to be an important measure for us in the long \nrun. We need to build on it. First, we need to pass this today.\n  As Senator Reid has said, it is an important provision in the House \nof Representatives. Without it, we are not sure we can pass this \nsupplemental bill, which has so many other important provisions, not \nthe least of which is providing for our troops in the field. It is a \ndelicate balance that brings this to the floor. I hope those who oppose \nit don't want to stand back and do nothing as this recession continues, \nunderstand the gravity of this automobile industry being flat on its \nback at this point in time, and realize that we owe President Obama \npassage of this supplemental legislation. President Obama did not want \nto ask for this bill to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But, \nunfortunately, the previous\n\n[[Page S6784]]\n\nPresident made us fund these wars on an emergency basis. So we had to \ncome in with a supplemental appropriations bill to pay for the war. \nThat will not happen again.\n  Next year, President Obama is putting it in the regular budget. This \nis one of the last things we have to do to clean up a situation left \nfor this President by President Bush. This bill for automobiles--this \none that has a broad cross section of bipartisan support--includes \nsupport of business and labor: the United Auto Workers, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the \nNational Automobile Dealers Association, as well as more than a dozen \nGovernors.\n  It is important we defeat this procedural objection to this program, \nthat we put this money into our economy, give people a chance to buy a \nnew car that is more fuel efficient, and put people back to work across \nAmerica, so we can start digging ourselves out of this recession hole.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first off, I appreciate the assistant \nmajority leader clarifying the situation unalterably; that this waiver \nissue is solely about the issue of cash for clunkers--a piece of \nlegislation which has absolutely nothing to do--nothing to do--with \nfunding our troops in the field and was airdropped into a conference \nwithout being paid for, adding $1 billion of new debt to our children's \nbacks. That is what this waiver is about.\n  The majority leader has said this waiver will, in some way, harm the \nability to fund the troops. I believe that to be totally inaccurate. \nThis motion comes out of a piece of legislation which the majority \nleader and the assistant majority leader authored. They wrote the bill \ncalled the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. That bill created \nthis point of order specifically to address this type of situation, \nwhere in a conference one or the other of the two bodies sticks into a \nbill that is a must-pass bill language which has nothing to do with \nthat bill and which is not paid for.\n  In this case, it is $1 billion of spending not paid for which has \nnothing to do with the troops in the field. The reason they structured \nthe rule this way was so it would not harm the underlying bill, so that \nif this point of order is successful, this bill goes back to the House \nand they can vote for it and send it to the President and fund the \ntroops.\n  Is it the position of the assistant leader that this cash for \nclunkers bill is so important that the House of Representatives would \nnot fund the troops if the language was not in the bill? Is he saying \nthe Democratic leadership of the House is holding the funding of the \ntroops hostage to spending $1 billion on an extraneous program, which \ncreates virtually no environmental improvement in our fleet and which \nis simply part of the economic effort to revive the auto industry--\nwhich we have already spent $83 billion on, by the way. Is that what he \nis saying?\n  That seemed to be the implication of his language: that the House \nwill not pass the funding for the troops if we take it out of it--under \na rule created for the purpose of disciplining ourselves this way, a \nrule created by the majority leader and by the assistant majority \nleader; authored by them and designed specifically to address this type \nof situation, where a conference is truly abused relative to funding \nand spending money which we do not have.\n  I do not believe that is realistic. I do not believe the Democratic \nmembership of the House is going to vote against this bill if the cash \nfor clunkers language is taken out on a surgical strike under a \nprocedural right which was created by the Democratic leader and the \nDemocratic assistant leader.\n  In addition, of course, there is the fact that pay-go is being \nviolated. There is the great irony that the President of the United \nStates, surrounded by the Democratic leadership of the Senate and the \nHouse, held a very dramatic press conference at the White House, at \n12:30 in the afternoon, saying they were going to reestablish the pay-\ngo rules for future spending, that new programs would have to be paid \nfor. And then that House leadership went back up to Capitol Hill, and \non the same day, passed this cash for clunkers bill, which was not paid \nfor and violated the pay-go rules. The hypocrisy of it is so \nextraordinary that it cannot even be described. But that is what \nhappened.\n  And then, in order to protect this bill, which was an unpaid-for \nviolation of the pay-go rules, they stuck it into the conference report \nto fund the troops. How outrageous is that? So a pay-go point of order, \nwhich might take down this whole bill, is not appropriate to make. But \nit is appropriate to make this very targeted point of order, which will \nonly eliminate the cash for clunkers language.\n  The policy of cash for clunkers is debatable. Maybe it makes sense; \nmaybe it does not make sense. But it certainly should not have been put \ninto this Defense bill, which is necessary for funding our troops. If \nit is a strong idea, let it stand on its own two feet on the floor of \nthe Senate. Let it be debated. Let it, hopefully, be paid for. But at \nleast let it be amended so those of us who think it should be paid for \ncan propose ideas for paying for it.\n  Under the bill as it is being handled now, there are no amendments \nallowed. We have to take this $1 billion of new debt, like it or not, \nwhether we support the program or not. We have to pass a bill which is \ngoing to add this $1 billion of additional debt on our children's \nbacks. It is a totally inappropriate way to legislate.\n  My effort is not to slow down or to stop or to marginalize in any way \nthe funding for our troops--I voted for every troop funding bill that \nhas come through this Congress, and I intend to continue to vote for \nthem--but it is to take out this language, which is inappropriate, to \nlive by the rules the majority leader passed, the assistant majority \nleader put in place--rule XLIV--to live by the pay-go rules, to not, in \nthe name of addressing a special interest group, spend $1 billion for \nwhich we will pass the bill on to our kids and our grandchildren.\n  Why should our grandchildren have to pay for cars we are going to buy \ntoday? Does that make any sense, that for the next 20 years we are \ngoing to end up paying these bills? Of course, it does not make sense.\n  So we should take this language out. It is not going to slow this \nbill down, not at all. This bill will go back to the House. It will be \npassed, and it will be sent to the President. It will be an act of \nfiscal responsibility, and we will be limiting the amount of debt we \nwill be putting on our children's backs, which is the way we should be \napproaching legislation.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  How much time is there available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes on the Republican side; 10 \nminutes on the majority side.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from \nOklahoma wish to have?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my \ntime. I see the Senator from Michigan on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, let me communicate that we are talking \nabout a motion to waive less than 1 percent of this bill. It is an \nemergency bill. It is a supplemental. It is less than 1 percent. In \nterms of the overall scope of what is before us, it is small. But I can \ntell you, in small towns and cities all across America, this is a big \ndeal.\n  We have up to 3 million people who, in some way, work with our \nautomobile industry. We have small businesses all across this country \nthat are looking at this vote. We have had colleagues come to the \nfloor. We have had hearings held, letters, and press releases about \nhelping dealers at this time. This is the moment. This is the moment \nand the vote as to whether we will do that.\n  I am very grateful for the chairman of the committee and his \ngraciousness in working with us on this issue and to our leadership.\n\n  We know that while this has not come through the regular process in \nthe Senate, in the House it went through the committee. It was reported \nout of committee. It was passed on the House floor, with 298 votes from \nRepublicans and Democrats. Over two-thirds voted for this.\n\n[[Page S6785]]\n\n  The reason it has been moved into this emergency supplemental is \nbecause it is an emergency, because we are seeing dealers that have \nbeen told they are going to have to phase out who have inventory to \nsell. We are seeing dealers all across America that are seeing sales go \ndown and down and down; and the question is, How long are they going to \nbe able to hold on?\n  The average dealer hires 53 people in their dealership. These are \nsmall businesses. I grew up on a car lot. My dad and my grandfather had \na car dealership. I know what this is about for a small town.\n  When we look at the fact that from January to May every automobile \ncompany--for GM, it has been a 41.8-percent reduction in sales; for \nToyota, it has been a 39-percent reduction in sales; and there are the \nreductions in sales for Ford, Chrysler, and Honda. All across the \nboard, these sales are down.\n  This may not seem like an emergency to people here, but I can tell \nyou, this is an emergency for families and small businesses, for an \nindustry that has been the backbone of our economy for a generation, \nwith up to 3 million people working in this industry. This, in fact, is \nan emergency and worth our time to put this into this bill as less than \n1 percent--less than 1 percent--of the emergency spending that is in \nfront of us.\n  Every other country with an automobile presence has, in fact, done \nsomething to help their industry. Germany found that in the first \nmonth, in January, when they put a similar kind of incentive plan in \nplace, they raised sales 21 percent--21 percent at the same time our \nsales were falling 40 percent.\n  We have seen similar plans in China, Japan, Korea, Brazil, Great \nBritain, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Romania, and \nSlovakia--Mr. President, Slovakia. But the United States has not yet \nacted on a program that has been effective around the world, when we \nhave so many small businesses right now, literally, whose futures are \nhanging in the balance.\n  This is something supported by business and labor, by the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, and, \nof course, the auto dealers.\n  I am also very pleased it is now supported by the Sierra Club. We \nknow that, from an environmental standpoint, there is always more we \ncan do. But we know this moves us in the right direction. In terms of \nthe environment, this is a win with every single new car that is sold. \nEvery car or truck sold under this program will be more fuel efficient, \nwill be cleaner than the car or truck it replaces. That is a fact.\n  This bill will save 133 gallons of gasoline per vehicle per year and \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1.45 million metric tons.\n  In 2010, vehicles from model year 1998 or earlier will account for 25 \npercent of the miles driven but 75 percent of all the tailpipe \nemissions.\n  So if we are able to get older vehicles, vehicles that are worth \n$4,500 or less, off the road--they are scrapped when they are turned \nin, so they can no longer pollute--and people buy a vehicle that gets \n22 miles a gallon or more, or if it is 10 miles per gallon better than \ntheir old car, they get a $4,500 voucher. That seems to me to be a step \nin the right direction.\n  Is it all it could be? No. It never is here. We work hard. We take \none step. We take two steps. We take three steps. But this is certainly \na step forward.\n  This bill is about jobs. This is a bill about jobs. It is about small \nbusiness. It is about the environment as well. We will see immediate \nreductions in fuel use, carbon emissions, and air pollution. Our \nconstituents, from the major business organizations to labor and the \nSierra Club, are supporting this effort. Not only are carmakers \ninterested in this, as I have said already, but the people who work in \nthe offices, the engineers, the designers, the clerks, the office \nmanagers, the salespeople, the mechanics, the car washers, the \nprinters, the advertisers, local newspapers, television, and radio, who \nall depend on their local dealer. This is a program that has been \nsuccessful around the world. There has been a tremendous amount of \neffort that has gone into this.\n\n  I thank the bill's sponsor in the House, Congresswoman Sutton, who \nintroduced the first bill and worked so hard and introduced the bill \nthat was finally passed. I thank all of those who worked together on \nboth sides of the aisle to put together something that passed \noverwhelmingly in the House. It comes to us now in a bill labeled \n``emergency spending.''\n  This bill goes way beyond just helping the automakers. It would \nparticularly benefit dealers, auto suppliers, State governments, \nworkers, communities, and consumers in every State in the country. I \nwanted to clarify for the record that this legislation is meant to \ninclude dealers in every State in the country. Although, the term \n``State'' is used in several definitions of title XIII, I would like to \nclarify that the CARS legislation is intended to have the same meaning \nas the term ``State'' defined in 49 USC 32304(a)(14) to ensure coverage \nof the program in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and other U.S. \nterritories, just as it applies to the 50 States.\n  On behalf of the auto dealers, large and small, across this country, \nthe people who depend upon these businesses, depend upon the making of \nthese automobiles, the selling of these automobiles, I would ask my \ncolleagues to please give us the opportunity for a short-term stimulus. \nThis is a matter of a few months. It is less than 1 percent of this \nentire bill, which is an important bill for our country and our defense \nand for our troops. This is a small piece of what is in front of us, \nbut for small businesspeople and Americans working hard every day \nacross this country, it is a big deal and it is a chance to help. I \nhope we will.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. And on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am going to yield to the Senator from \nOklahoma, but before I do, I wish to take just 30 seconds to respond \nquickly to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The idea that we haven't done anything for the automobile industry is \nreally hard to accept, $83 billion having been spent on the automobile \nindustry. The idea that $1 billion is just a small amount of money is \nalso very hard to accept; $1 billion of new debt is $1 billion that our \nchildren are going to have to pay, and it is not a small amount of \nmoney, and it compounds. We fly in the face of the procedures which the \nDemocratic leader set up around here to have pay-go and to have the \nOpen and Honest Leadership Act, we fly in the face of that by putting \nin this bill this special interest piece of legislation, unpaid for, \nand it is totally inexcusable.\n  This has nothing to do with funding the troops--nothing. The fact \nthat $1 billion is being spent and not paid for is totally \nirresponsible. It is debt our children do not need to receive.\n  At this point, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask to be made aware when I have 1 \nminute remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on June 16, the House passed the bill we \nhave been talking about here. I have concerns that have not been \ndiscussed in the last few minutes.\n  Although the Senate voted 90 to 6 on a bipartisan amendment to \nprohibit funding for the transfer of Gitmo detainees to the United \nStates, the supplemental appropriations conference report deleted that \nlanguage. That language came from an amendment that was authored by \nmyself and my good friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, but they \nstripped that language. The Senate's bipartisan amendment would have \neffectively prevented the closing of the terrorist detention facility \nat Gitmo. Since President Obama announced that he intended to close \nGitmo, it has become widely circulated that these detainees could be \ntransferred to American prisons for prosecution in U.S. criminal courts \nand potentially released in the United States.\n  In February of this year, I led a delegation--I have been there \nseveral times--a delegation that had never been down to Gitmo, and they \nsaw the fine treatment the detainees get down there and saw the rooms \nwhere torturing supposedly is going on. Not one incident of torture has \never been documented.\n\n[[Page S6786]]\n\n  After I returned, I introduced S. 370 to prevent the detainees at \nGitmo from being relocated anywhere on American soil. Since that time, \nit has been called to our attention that the administration is talking \nabout maybe 17 locations in the United States to put these terrorists. \nOne of those locations was Fort Sill in my State of Oklahoma. I went \ndown there, and I found out that would not be at all workable. In fact, \nSergeant Major Carter, who is in charge of the prison at Fort Sill, \nsaid: Why in the world would they close a place like Gitmo? It is the \nideal place to keep these people.\n  Currently, even though they are talking about putting them in \nsupermax prisons, the only supermax facility is located in Florence, \nCO. According to the Bureau of Prisons, as of May 21, only one bed has \nnot been filled at supermax. Obviously, this isn't going to work. The \nrated capacity of BOP facilities at the beginning of this month was \n13,648 inmates, while the total prison population of those facilities \nwas far more than that--exceeding 20,000.\n  Despite claims by Senator Durbin that supermax prisons in the United \nStates are ready to receive detainees, the supermax prisons in the \nUnited States are at or above their maximum capacity.\n  Additionally, the civilian prisons do not meet the same standard as \ncurrently exists at Gitmo. In 2002, an entire wing of a jail in \nAlexandria, VA, was cleared out for the 9/11 ``20th hijacker,'' \nZacarias Moussaoui, to be housed in the jail. That was just one \ndetainee. For one detainee, they are talking about clearing out the \nentire wing. So moving detainees to the United States would not be \nreasonable.\n  It would also place America and its citizens at risk in inevitably \ncreating a new set of targets. This is the problem we have. We have 17 \nplaces in the United States where we would be putting these people. We \nhave 17 magnets to draw in terrorists located around the country.\n  Three weeks after I called for President Obama and my Senate \ncolleagues to go see firsthand the facility at Gitmo, Attorney General \nEric Holder--he is our new Attorney General appointed by President \nObama--went down there, and he came back with a glowing report that the \nfacility is well run by its current military officers. This affirms \nwhat I have been saying all along; that is, Gitmo is a state-of-the-art \nfacility that provides humane treatment for all detainees and is fully \ncompliant with the Geneva Conventions.\n  When the war supplemental came to the floor in the Senate, I was \nextremely pleased that Democrats and Republicans in the Senate joined \ntogether and announced they would not include the $80 million in the \nwar supplemental to close Gitmo. Sadly, this bipartisan initiative has \nfallen victim to partisan politics without any regard for our national \nsecurity or the wishes of the American people.\n  Senator Reid, Harry Reid, declared--and I agreed with him--in a press \nconference after my bipartisan Senate amendment was passed that, ``We \nwill never allow terrorists to be released into the United States.'' I \nthink that is a good statement. I agree with it. He went on to say, \n``We don't want them around the United States. I can't make it any \nclearer than the statement I have given you. We will never allow \nterrorists to be released in the United States.'' Well, that sounds \nreal good, and I agree with him and I hope he is right. However, the \nproblem is, if you try to try these people in our Federal court system \nwhere the rules of evidence are different in terms of admissibility of \nevidence, many times we would not be able to get a prosecution and they \nwould be turned loose.\n  Finally, Senator Durbin said the feeling was at this point that we \nwere defending the unknown, we were being asked to defend a plan that \nhasn't been announced. Well, I have to say it still hasn't been \nannounced.\n  Two weeks ago, the Obama administration again went against the will \nof Congress and the American people by transferring the first Gitmo \ndetainee to the United States for his trial in New York City. This was \nAhmed Khalfan Ghailani. This is a guy, if you remember, who is the \nterrorist responsible for the bombing at the American Embassies in \nTanzania and in Kenya. He was later captured in Pakistan in 2004 while \nworking for al-Qaida preparing false documents and facilitating a \ntransport of arms to insurgents across the Afghan and Pakistan border. \nIntelligence shows that Ghailani met both bin Laden and Khalid Shaikh \nMohammed in Afghanistan and remained in close association with al-Qaida \nuntil his capture in 2004. Now this bona fide terrorist will have the \nprivilege of a U.S. civilian court trial in the United States. Ahmed \nGhailani was just 1 of 239 detainees housed in the state-of-the-art \nfacility at Gitmo.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal today, a government official has \nsaid that well over 50 detainees have been approved for transfer to \nother countries and that negotiations were continuing with Saudi Arabia \nto take a large group of Yemen detainees. Attorney General Eric Holder \nestimated yesterday that more than 50 detainees may end up in trial by \nU.S. authorities. This news comes as more and more Americans are \ngrowing opposed to the closure of Gitmo. In fact, I would have to say \nthis: Recently, we have had more and more polls taken, and it is now \nabout a 3-to-1 ratio that people don't want these people tried in the \nUnited States, they don't want to have them housed in the United \nStates.\n  So we have a very serious problem. Not only are we talking about \ndetainees down there, we are also talking about an increase in the \nsurge in Afghanistan, and even though Afghanistan does have two \nprisons, they won't take any detainees unless they are Afghans. So if \nthey are from Yemen or from Djibouti, they won't take them. So this is \nthe problem we have right now.\n  The views of Congress haven't changed. In 2007, the Senate voted 94 \nto 3 to a nonbinding resolution to block detainees from being \ntransferred to the United States, declaring:\n\n       Detainees housed at Guantanamo should not be released into \n     American society nor should they be transferred stateside \n     into facilities in American communities and neighborhoods.\n\n  In 2009, the Senate voted 90 to 6 to again keep detainees out of \nAmerica.\n  The views of the American people have not changed. I mentioned the \npolls. The polls are all conclusive that the American people do not \nwant to have these people turned loose into the United States, which is \nexactly what could happen.\n  While the quality of the facility of Gitmo has not changed, it is the \nonly facility of its kind that is currently--it has six levels of \nsecurity from the different levels of security. It has one doctor for \neach two detainees, and, as everyone agrees, it is the ideal place.\n  I might add that this is one of the few good deals we have in \ngovernment in that it only costs us $4,000 a year. We have had this \nplace since 1903, and it is something we can't get rid of. The only \nreason I mention this now is because I have the bill that is filed, \nwhich is S. 370, that meets the will of the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  So this bill I have, S. 370, will give people in this Chamber an \nopportunity to vote to keep the detainees--to keep the terrorists--out \nof the United States of America.\n  I would say this: If there are some people who would be voting for \nthe supplemental as it is right now, at least they would have another \nopportunity to express their will, as they have expressed on two other \noccasions, that we don't want the detainees, we don't want the \nterrorists tried in America or to be detained within the United States \nof America.\n  So with this, it is my hope the majority will allow an immediate vote \non the bill I have filed, S. 370.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as the Senate takes up legislation \ntoday on emergency funding for combat operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, U.S. forces overseas can be reassured by this: unlike some \nof our previous recent debates, broad bipartisan agreement now exists \nin support of the proposition that the efforts of our service men and \nwomen should be funded and supported.\n  The supplemental agreement we are considering today includes nearly \n$80 billion for the Defense Department.\n\n[[Page S6787]]\n\nThis funding will allow General Odierno and our uniformed men and women \nin Iraq to preserve the security gains they achieved during the surge, \ncontinue the transition to greater Iraqi control and capability, and \ndeny refuge to al-Qaida in Iraq.\n  These funds will also be used to support a surge of forces in \nAfghanistan. And to those of us who ignored previous calls for \narbitrary withdrawal dates in Iraq, it is particularly encouraging to \nsee that President Obama has accepted the recommendations of General \nPetraeus for sending additional forces into Afghanistan. Success there \nisn't assured. Looking ahead, we can expect continued challenges \nassociated with the upcoming Afghan national elections, the need to \ncontinue the expansion of the Afghan National Army and Police, and the \nneed to combat corruption within the Afghan ministries. But the \nPresident was right to direct a surge of forces, appoint a new \ncommander, and refocus our efforts on a broad counterinsurgency \nstrategy to combat the Taliban.\n  Republicans support this surge and understand that broad security \ngains in Afghanistan cannot be achieved without the sustained \nimprovement of the Afghanistan National Army and police forces. But \nthis strategy will also require a sustained effort on the part of the \ngovernment, the people, and the military forces of Pakistan to deny the \nTaliban, al-Qaida, and associated groups sanctuary in the tribal areas \nof Pakistan.\n  Just 2 months ago, the situation in Pakistan appeared to be so dire \nthat the Secretary of State openly voiced concern that ``the Pakistani \ngovernment is basically abdicating to the Taliban and to extremists.'' \nSince that time, the Pakistani military has moved in force into the \nSwat Valley to combat this threat. Our commitment to helping Pakistan \nprevail in this fight, which must be conducted as a counterinsurgency \nif it is to succeed, must be sustained. Fortunately, the supplemental \ncontains funds to allow it.\n  Another important issue that must be addressed is the effort by some \nto force the release of photos depicting the alleged mistreatment or \nmistreatment of detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am afraid that \nthose encouraging the release of these photos fail to appreciate the \npotential consequences of such a release. The United States has \npainfully come to learn that al-Qaida and the Taliban are sophisticated \ncommunicators who exploit the airwaves and the internet. That is why \nthe concerns expressed by our military commanders over the release of \nadditional photos depicting the alleged mistreatment of detainees were \nof equal concern to our allies and friends. Iraq, Afghanistan, \nPakistan, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and other countries deal each \nday with the threat of militant radicals. They know how these images \ncan be exploited by terrorist groups, and the bitter consequences that \ncould follow. Senators Lieberman, Graham, and McCain should be \ncommended for making these concerns their own and carrying them to the \nAmerican people.\n  Senator Graham noted on the floor yesterday that he believes the \nPresident shares the Senate's concerns about the potential dangers of \nreleasing these photos. Last evening we passed legislation that would \nprevent any additional strategic harm from the release of photographs \nlike these. Now the House must act.\n  Although Republicans support the President's support in the \nsupplemental for our operations and overall objectives in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, a bipartisan majority disagree with the President in one \nimportant respect--and that is the administration's request for $80 \nmillion from Congress for the purpose of closing the detention facility \nat Guantanamo Bay before the administration even has a place to put the \ndetainees who are housed there, any plan for military commissions, or \nany articulated plan for indefinite detention or for transferring \ndetainees in a manner that ensures the safety of the American people.\n  During January of this year, by Executive order, the President \nestablished an arbitrary date for closing the detention facility at \nGuantanamo Bay. In April, the administration submitted its funding \nrequest to close Guantanamo as part of this supplemental bill, and the \nSenate voted 90-6 against including that funding. But it is worth \nreminding the Senate that the defense budget request for fiscal year \n2010 includes a similar funding request, so the Senate will consider \nthis matter again in the near future.\n  Bipartisan majorities of both Houses and the American people oppose \nclosing Guantanamo without a plan, and several important questions \nremain unanswered: why was it necessary to bring detainees to the \nUnited States for prosecution, rather than using the courtroom at \nGuantanamo? If these terrorists are found to be not guilty by a \ncivilian court, will they be returned to detention or released? What \nthreat assessments were conducted prior to the recent transfers of \ndetainees to Iraq, Chad, and Saudi Arabia?\n  The task force established by the President to review the closure of \nGuantanamo is scheduled to conclude its work in July, so Congress may \nlearn of the administration's plans later this year. But this \nconference report requires the President to report to the Congress \nconcerning the threat any further detainees who are released or \ntransferred pose to the American people and our service members \noverseas. This will be of increasing importance as the task force \ndecides the fate of detainees from Yemen.\n  As I said, Republicans supported the President when he reconsidered \nhis plan to withdraw forces from Iraq. It is our hope that he will show \nsimilar openness when it comes to his arbitrary deadline for closing \nGuantanamo. The Senate has spoken clearly on this issue repeatedly. It \nis our hope that the administration heeds the wishes of the American \npeople as expressed through their elected representatives when it comes \nto releasing and transferring dangerous terrorists.\n  As the arbitrary closure date approaches, we will continue to press \nthis issue forward.\n  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have placed a great strain on our \ncombat forces, the weapons and equipment that they need to succeed and \non the training base that helps to keep the force ready. This bill \ncontinues the Senate's support for this force, and for the dangerous \nmissions that they undertake on our behalf, and therefore it deserves \nour support. It is not perfect, but it meets the needs of our \ncommanders in the field. America remains a nation at war. Our forces \nfighting these wars deserve our support, and the funding in this bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand the chairman wishes to close, \nso I will just speak and then yield back the remainder of our time, and \nso the chairman can make his closing comments.\n  I just have to reemphasize how much of an afront it is to the process \nwhich we set up at the beginning of this Congress to try to have fiscal \ndiscipline if we do not support this point of order. This point of \norder was specifically put in to address this type of situation, where \nthere is an extraneous piece of legislation airdropped into a \nconference report by one House or the other House, and in this case, it \nis $1 billion of spending which will go directly to the debt of this \ncountry.\n  We have heard from the Chinese that they are getting worried about \nbuying our debt. They are the ones who are financing us. We have heard \nfrom our own experts and economists that the American debt rating, \nwhich is AAA-plus, may be at risk. We know we are running up debt at \nsuch an extraordinary rate right now--$2 trillion this year, over $1 \ntrillion next year, $1 trillion a year on average for the next 10 \nyears--that our debt is going to double in 5 years and triple in 10 \nyears.\n  Where do we start to discipline ourselves? Well, one would hope we \nwould start to discipline ourselves with something that so obviously \nviolates the rules we set up here for fiscal discipline. It violates \npay-go. It is not paid for, even though the President calls for pay-go.\n  This is a new program, unpaid for, and it violates the new rule put \nin under the Openness in Government and Honesty in Leadership Act, \nauthored by Senators Reid and Durbin, and Senator Stabenow was a \ncosponsor. It said don't put into a conference report things that are \nextraneous and aren't paid for. Yet this does exactly that. Will it \naffect the troops in the field? No. This bill will pass now. If this \npoint\n\n[[Page S6788]]\n\nof order is sustained, this bill will pass this House and fully fund \nthe troops. Then it will go back to the House of Representatives.\n  I cannot believe, under any scenario, that the House of \nRepresentatives is not going to vote to fund the troops, that they are \ngoing to hold the funding of the troops in the field hostage to \nspending $1 billion and adding new debt on an extraneous program that \nhas to do with buying old cars. Nobody is going to do that. That \ndoesn't even pass the smell test as being credible.\n  The bill will pass the House and be sent to the President probably \nbefore the day is out. That is the way it should be. That is why this \npoint of order was put into place. That is why the Senator from \nIllinois, working with the Senator from Nevada, the leaders on the \nother side of the aisle, created this very good and appropriate rule, \nso things like this could be addressed in a surgical way, so they would \nnot lead to adding $1 billion--in this case--which is a lot of money.\n  A couple of Members have said it is just a little bit. In New \nHampshire, $1 billion will run our State government for a considerable \nperiod of time. That is a lot of money. I have never seen it. It is a \nlot of money.\n  There is no reason to pass on to these young pages that debt. If we \nthink the cash for clunkers idea is a good one, let's pay for it. There \nare a lot of places we can find $1 billion in a $2 trillion-plus \nbudget. So let's pay for this. Let's budget effectively. Remember the \nwords of the chairman of the Budget Committee because they are \nprophetic: The debt is a threat. It is a threat to this Nation.\n  We have a chance to do a little bit--$1 billion worth, which is a \nsignificant amount--to try to address the debt problem by supporting \nthis point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I find it very difficult to be on the \nopposing side of my dear friend from New Hampshire. There has been a \nlot of discussion on the premise that conferees did not pay for the \ncash for clunkers bill.\n  Technically, that is correct. But I believe my colleague should be \nadvised that under the Congressional Budget Office scoring, the \nconferees are scored with a savings of $1.47 billion in discretionary \nspending in this bill.\n  In title 14 of the bill, the conferees included a provision which \nmandates that more than $1 billion in discretionary spending in \nrescissions shall be allocated as savings in the bill not used as an \noffset.\n  While the conferees were required to designate the Cash for Clunkers \ntitle as an emergency for technical reasons, it is also true that we \nincluded a $1 billion offset in discretionary spending which for all \npractical purposes offsets the spending for Cash for Clunkers.\n  So while much of the debate about this matter has involved the fact \nthat the conferees didn't pay for this provision, that is not \ncompletely accurate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the last page \nfrom the scorekeeping document of the appropriations committee on the \nsupplemental which shows $1 billion $47 million in savings.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n

On this vote, the yeas are 60, the nays are \n36. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have had a long conversation with the \nRepublican leader. Senator McCain is going to speak for a while. After \nthat, it is my understanding we will have a vote on passage of the \nsupplemental conference report. The matter to follow that is the \ntourism bill, which is so important to every State. The managers of \nthis bill are Senators Dorgan and Martinez. What we will do is start \nwith five amendments--Republicans can have three, and we will have \ntwo--see if we can work through this bill before we have to do anything \nprocedurally.\n  This is a heavily bipartisan bill. I don't know if there has been a \nbill this whole Congress that is more bipartisan. The reason it is \nbipartisan is tourism is so important.\n  The Presiding Officer's State ia a beautiful State to go to--Aspen, \nto Vail, all the many things they have in the national parks. Nevada, \npeople think it is the bright lights of Las Vegas and Reno, and it is, \nbut it is a lot more. People don't realize Nevada is the most \nmountainous State in the Union, 314 mountain ranges. We have 32 \nmountains over 11,000 feet high, one 14,000 feet high. Every Senator \nhere could boast about why people should visit their State. I have been \nto virtually every State in the Union. They are all beautiful. All work \npromoting tourism.\n  In our country, we do not promote tourism. We are the only \nindustrialized Nation that does not. Some nonindustrialized nations \npromote their countries; we don't. We need to have people come here. \nSince 9/11, the number of people coming to the United States has \ndropped significantly because of 9/11. They haven't been told it is the \nsafest place in the world to come. People should come here. So this \npublic-private partnership that is in this legislation will have \nprograms set up.\n  Frankly, it is comparable to what happens in Las Vegas with the Las \nVegas business authority. They have done such a remarkable job of \nbringing people to Las Vegas. This should be done nationwide. I didn't \ndraft the bill, but they did copy a lot that has made Nevada \nsuccessful.\n  I hope we can work our way through the amendments and, in the \nprocess, do something good for the country. I don't believe there is \nanyone who wants to deep-six this bill. But I hope people who are \noffering amendments will offer amendments that are relative and \ngermane. If they don't, they have a right to do that, and we will be \nhappy to take a look at them. I have no concern whether the legal \njargon of germaneness may not apply. I would rather not have to file \ncloture on this bill. Because of the supplemental, I guess there has \nbeen a lot of concern by the Republicans, but that should be gone now. \nI think we have satisfied all their demands on the supplemental. \nHopefully, we can move forward with this and a number of nominations.\n  There will be more votes tonight. Maybe it will only be one more \nvote, but we will have one vote on passage of the supplemental. Then we \nwill see what we set up for tomorrow and next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, here we have a supplemental appropriations \nconference report, supposedly, ostensibly to fund the wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq and to make sure the men and women who are serving \nhave the necessary equipment and wherewithal to pursue those conflicts \nwith the utmost efficiency. It is business as usual in our Nation's \nCapital. It is business as usual in the Congress of the United States. \nInstead of legislation to fund our troops and efforts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, we have a bill that includes such things as $2 million for \nfreeze-dried platelet and plasma development, $35 million for the FBI \nto investigate mortgage fraud, predatory lending, financial fraud and \nmarket manipulation, $13.2 million for payments to air carriers for \nparticipation in the essential air service program.\n  Of course, one of the most remarkable feats of legerdemain I have \nseen in my many years here, cash for clunkers. Someone should at least \nattempt to explain how cash for clunkers has any relation whatsoever to \nthe wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It bribes Americans to trade in less \nfuel-efficient vehicles, considered clunkers, despite the fact that the \ncar could have been bought yesterday, for a voucher worth up to $4,500 \ntoward the purchase of a new car that must get at least 18 miles per \ngallon, at least 18 miles per gallon--18 not 38? It is estimated to \ncost about $1 billion, but some economists have declared the real cost \nwill be between $3 and $4 billion. I predict it will be a lot closer to \n$3 to $4 billion than it will be to $1 billion.\n  A giveaway of this nature will be obviously something that will be \nirresistible to many.\n  Here we are considering a supplemental appropriations conference \nreport totaling $105.9 billion, $13 billion less than the President's \nrequest, $9 billion more than the House-passed bill, and $14.6 billion \nabove the Senate-passed bill. So what we have done is, we pass a bill \nover here, they pass a bill over there, and we add to the sum of both. \nThe conference report provides crucial funding for ongoing military, \ndiplomatic, and intelligence operations. It provides emergency funding \nto strengthen response to the H1N1 influenza outbreak and the borrowing \nauthority for the International Monetary Fund and, as I mentioned, \nvouchers for consumers to trade in old cars for new, ``old'' meaning as \nshort a time as 1 year.\n  The majority of the conference report contains urgently needed \nfunding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, our \nmilitary is engaged in an effort that can and must succeed. It also \ncontains important assistance for the Government of Pakistan, including \nfunding for the Pakistan counterinsurgency fund. The provision of this \nfunding should send a message to the people of Pakistan that the United \nStates has made a long-term commitment to stand by their side in the \nregion and at home as they battle domestic insurgents and extremists. \nHowever, the conference report also contains billions of dollars in \nunrequested spending that is largely unjustified and certainly \nnonemergency.\n  President Obama's message to the Congress was to keep funding focused\n\n[[Page S6790]]\n\non the needs of our troops and not to use the supplemental to pursue \nunnecessary spending and to keep earmarks and other extraneous spending \nout of the legislation. Despite the President's insistence not to \ninclude unnecessary spending in the supplemental, the conference report \ncontains a number of earmarks and unrequested congressional program \nadditions.\n  I am disappointed the majority chose to use the supplemental as a \nvehicle to add billions in unrequested funding and policy proposals \nwhich should have been fully vetted and considered on their own merits, \nwhile at the same time stripping out the Senate-passed detainee photo \nprovision offered by Senators Lieberman and Graham. The conference \nreport is also being used by the appropriators as a back door for \nfunding fiscal year 2010 ``base'' requirements.\n  The House allocations for 2010--commonly referred to as 302(b) \nallocations--cut defense spending by $3.5 billion and reduced \ninternational affairs funding by $3.2 billion. In other words, the \nsleight of hand of adding nonemergency program funding to supplemental \nappropriations is becoming all too familiar as a way of skirting fiscal \ndiscipline by increasing discretionary spending above congressional \ndiscretionary caps outlined in the budget resolution. In other words, \nwe are continuing what was, unfortunately, common in the previous \nadministration. Again, about cash for clunkers, it is remarkable.\n  On June 16, 2009, Citizens Against Government Waste wrote a letter to \nall Members of the Senate stating that this provision ``is really \nanother bailout for the auto industry. American taxpayers have already \nspent $85 billion.''\n  We now own two automotive companies, we and the unions. Why do we \nneed another bailout for the auto industry?\n       The ``Cash for Clunkers'' provision has no place in a bill \n     that provides emergency war funds.\n\n  I couldn't agree with Citizens Against Government Waste more.\n  The Wall Street Journal wrote in a June 11, 2009, editorial:\n\n       Congress wants to pay you to destroy your car . . . as \n     economic policy, this is dotty. It encourages Americans to \n     needlessly destroy still useful cars and then misallocates \n     scarce resources from another, perhaps more productive, use \n     in order to subsidize replacement. By the same logic, we \n     could revive the housing market by paying everyone to burn \n     down their houses, to collect the insurance money and build \n     new ones . . . The proposal is really intended to help \n     Detroit out of a recession by subsidizing new car purchases . \n     . .\n\n  Maybe that is why the president and CEO of the Alliance of Automobile \nManufacturers wrote asking all Senators to support this program, as \nwell as the United Auto Workers legislative director, who called this \nprovision ``the single most important step Congress can take right now \nto assist the auto industry.''\n  Hasn't Congress done enough for the auto industry? When is $85 \nbillion not enough for the auto industry?\n  Lastly, this provision is a lemon, according to a June 13, 2009, \narticle from the LA Times that stated:\n\n       Critics say the improvements required in the trade--as \n     little as 1 mile per gallon for certain light trucks--\n\n  In other words, you trade in your old light truck and buy another one \nthat is 1-mile-per-gallon more fuel efficient. So you can swap one gas \nguzzler for another.\n  So for $1 billion, this provision doesn't achieve the environmental \ngoals its authors set forth either. My colleagues, Senators Feinstein \nand Collins, argued such in an opinion piece published in the Wall \nStreet Journal on June 11, 2009, and also wrote that this provision \n``being pushed by the auto industry is simply bad policy,'' that it is \n``designed to provide Detroit one last windfall in selling off gas \nguzzlers currently sitting on dealers lots because they're not a smart \nbuy.''\n  This unrelated provision is an unwise use of taxpayers' hard-earned \nmoney and bad environmental policy. It doesn't belong in this bill, and \nI strongly disagree with its inclusion.\n  There are a few more earmarks I would like to highlight: $2.2 billion \nin unrequested funding for eight C-17 Globemaster cargo aircraft. \nCurrently, we have either bought or ordered 30 more C-17 cargo aircraft \nthan is the military requirement. This is not a jobs program, as the \nbacklog of C-17s is so great that Boeing will not begin building these \neight aircraft for another 3 to 5 years. While Secretary Gates called \nthe C-17 ``a terrific aircraft,'' he stressed that the military users \n``have more than necessary capacity'' for airlift over the next 10 \nyears. These are, again, testimonies to the power of the military \nindustrial congressional complex in Washington, DC.\n  An unholy alliance between manufacturers, Members of Congress, and \nlobbyists brings these things about. There is $504 million in \nunrequested funding for seven C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft. In \ntestimony on May 14, 2009, Secretary Gates said:\n\n       We have over 200 C-130s in the Air National Guard that are \n     uncommitted and available for use for any kind of domestic \n     need.\n       All I know is that I have a great deal of unused capacity \n     in the C-130 fleet.\n\n  That is what the Secretary of Defense says. So we are going to spend \n$504 million more for seven C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft.\n  There is $3.1 billion in unrequested funding for international \naffairs operations and programs. The additional funding added by the \nHouse majority and agreed to in conference is to offset the $3.2 \nbillion reduction recently made by the Congress to the base budget \nrequest.\n  There is $49 million in unrequested funding for hurricane damage \nrepairs to the Mississippi Army Ammunition Plant. This funding was \nadded even though the Army advised the managers of this bill there are \nno storm-related repairs required at the plant--so we are going to \nspend $49 million to repair a plant that does not need to be repaired--\nand that no valid military requirement exists for the funding.\n  Mr. President, $186 million is provided above the President's request \nfor lightweight howitzers built in Mississippi for the Marine Corps. \nThe additional funding is not requested in the Future Year Defense \nPlan, nor was it on the fiscal year 2009 or fiscal year 2010 Marine \nCorps Unfunded Requirements Lists. In other words, the Marine Corps \ndoes not need it. The Department of Defense says it is not needed, but \nwe are going to spend $186 million additionally for howitzers built in \nthe State of Mississippi.\n  Mr. President, $150 million is included for Air Force A-10 Warthog \naircraft wing kits and installations. While Davis Montham Air Force \nBase is in my State of Arizona and additional wing kits would be \nwelcomed, the additional funds were not requested by the \nadministration, and I oppose this $150 million.\n  It end runs the Defense Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC, process \nby prohibiting the Secretary of Defense from carrying out a 2005 BRAC \ndecision to discontinue the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.\n  I was very disappointed the House Democrats succeeded in their \nefforts to strip from the supplemental spending bill the detainee photo \nprovision offered by Senators Lieberman and Graham. This provision, \nwhich would support the President's efforts to bar the release of \nphotos of past detainee abuse, would help protect our troops from the \ninevitable recriminations that these photos would incite. Releasing the \nphotos would not supply new information about the issue of detainee \nabuse, but, rather, expose evidence of alleged past wrongdoing and put \nour fighting men and women in greater danger.\n  That is not my view. It is that of our leading military commanders, \nincluding GENs David Petraeus and Ray Odierno. Both of these \ndistinguished military leaders have stated that the release of these \nimages could endanger the lives of U.S. soldiers and make our \ncounterinsurgency efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan more difficult.\n  That is why I commend the leadership demonstrated by Senators \nLieberman and Graham, both of whom have steadfastly demanded that this \ncrucial provision be addressed now by the Congress. Their efforts \nculminated in the passage, by unanimous consent, of stand-alone \nlegislation that will help prevent the release of these damaging \nimages.\n  So there are other troubling aspects of detainee policy included in \nthis supplemental bill. Provisions in this bill attempt to address \ndetainee policy in a\n\n[[Page S6791]]\n\npiecemeal way that fails to constitute a comprehensive plan for what to \ndo with detainees at Guantanamo and those terrorist suspects captured \noff the battlefield in Afghanistan.\n  It does not include the $80 million requested by President Obama to \nclose Guantanamo. This is a serious rebuke by Congress and reflects a \nbipartisan backlash against the idea of announcing a date for the \nclosure of Guantanamo while failing to provide a plan for what comes \nnext.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the fiscal year 2009 \nsupplemental earmarks and unrequested congressional add-ons be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    FY 2009 Supplemental Earmarks and Unrequested Congressional Adds\n\n       $2.2 billion not requested by the President for 8 Air Force \n     C-17 aircraft.\n       $1 billion not requested by the President nor included in \n     the Senate or House-passed bills for vouchers of $3,500 or \n     $4,500 to be applied toward the purchase or lease of a new \n     fuel efficient automobile or truck.\n       $504 million not requested by the President for 7 Air Force \n     C-130 aircraft.\n       $439 million not requested by the President for barrier \n     island restoration in Mississippi.\n       $150 million not requested by the President for Air Force \n     A-10 aircraft wing kits and installations.\n       $150 million not requested by the President for Army \n     Stryker vehicles.\n       $117 million above the President's request for Lightweight \n     Howitzers built in Mississippi.\n       $100 million above the President's request for UH-1Y and \n     AH-1Z helicopters.\n       $94 million above the President's request for Defense \n     Education Agency programs.\n       $61 million not requested by the President for Link 16 \n     aircraft communications equipment.\n       $49 million not requested by the President for an Army \n     ammunition plant in Mississippi.\n       $26.7 million not requested by the President for the Navy's \n     Saber Focus program.\n       $20 million not requested by the President for additional \n     Air Force Reserve flying hours.\n       $20 million above the President's request for Navy expenses \n     related to countering piracy.\n       $17.9 million above the President's request for Marine \n     Corps Manned Reconnaissance Systems.\n       $15.9 million not requested by the President for Army \n     tethered surveillance balloons.\n       $15.5 million not requested by the President for the Air \n     Force's Project Liberty program.\n       $4 million not requested by the President for a Vision \n     Center of Excellence in Maryland.\n       $2.2 million not requested by the President for Afghan \n     intelligence and surveillance infrastructure.\n       $1.2 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) not \n     requested by the President to offset the $3.2 billion \n     reduction made by the Congress to the President's FY 2010 \n     base budget request. The increase is to pre-fund 2010 base \n     budget requirements for Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Mexico and \n     Lebanon.\n       $404 million in Diplomatic and Consular program funding not \n     requested by the President to offset the $3.2 billion \n     reduction made by the Congress to the President's FY 2010 \n     base budget request.\n       $135 million in Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) funding not \n     requested by the President to offset the $3.2 billion \n     reduction made by the Congress to the President's FY 2010 \n     base budget request.\n       $150 million in Global Health and Child Survival funding \n     not requested by the President.\n       $700 million for a new Pakistan Counterinsurgency \n     Capability Fund not requested by the President. Funds are not \n     needed in 2009 because the conference report provides the DoD \n     $400 million for the same purposes in 2009. Funding is \n     intended to pre-fund FY 2010 programs.\n       $400 million in international food assistance not requested \n     by the President.\n       $98 million in International Narcotics and Law Enforcement \n     funding not requested by the President to offset the $3.2 \n     billion reduction made by the Congress to the President's FY \n     2010 base budget request.\n       $57 million in Migration and Refugee assistance funding not \n     requested by the President.\n       $23 million in Embassy Security, Construction and \n     Maintenance funding not requested by the President.\n       $40 million in Disaster Assistance funding not requested by \n     the President.\n       $2 million not requested by the President for Freeze Dried \n     Platelet and Plasma Development.\n       $40 million not requested by the Administration for the \n     Economic Development Administration to provide grants under \n     Trade Adjustment Assistance to communities and firms \n     adversely impacted by trade.\n       $60 million not requested by the Administration for the \n     Department of Justice for detention costs due to increased \n     enforcement activities along the US-Mexico border.\n       $10 million not requested by the Administration for the \n     U.S. Marshals Service for enhanced judicial security in \n     districts along the southwest border, the apprehension of \n     criminals who have fled to Mexico, and to upgrade \n     surveillance equipment used to monitor drug cartels and \n     violent gang members.\n       $35 million not requested by the Administration for the FBI \n     to investigate mortgage fraud, predatory lending, financial \n     fraud and market manipulation.\n       $20 million not requested by the Administration for the DEA \n     to expand its Sensitive Investigation Unit program in Mexico.\n       $10 million above Administration's request for the ATF for \n     upgrade technology for ballistics evidence sharing with \n     Mexico and Project Gunrunner firearms trafficking activities \n     along the Southwest border.\n       $10 million not requested by the Administration to meet \n     increased workloads resulting from immigration cases and \n     other law enforcement initiatives.\n       $8 million not requested by the Administration for the \n     necessary expenses of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission \n     established in the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of \n     2009.\n       $10 million not requested by the Administration for \n     necessary expenses for investigations of securities fraud.\n       $46.2 million not requested by the Administration for \n     salaries and expenses, including the care, treatment and \n     transportation of unaccompanied alien children and border \n     security issues on the Southwest border of the U.S.\n       $5 million not requested by the Administration to respond \n     to border security issues on the Southwest border of the \n     United States.\n       $66.8 million not requested by the Administration for the \n     care, treatment and transportation of unaccompanied alien \n     children and border security issues on the Southwest border.\n       $139.5 million not requested by the Administration for \n     expenses to support Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \n     Enduring Freedom for the operation and maintenance of \n     vessels, law enforcement detachments, port security units and \n     salaries for the Coast Guard Reserve on active duty.\n       $30 million not requested by the Administration for \n     Operation Stonegarden to assist State and local law \n     enforcement agencies which may be impacted by the increased \n     violence in Mexico and to help prevent its spillover into the \n     U.S.\n       $2 million for the Congressional Budget Office not \n     requested by the Administration for salaries and expenses.\n       $13.2 million not requested by the Administration for \n     payments to air carriers for participation in the essential \n     air service program.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. So in what the American people believed was a time of \nchange, the American people now should know that it is business as \nusual. A combination of lobbyists, industry campaign contributions, \nunnecessary spending continues completely out of control. This was a \npiece of legislation that was supposed to fund the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. So now we add billions of dollars for things such as cash \nfor clunkers, unneeded and unnecessary and unwanted military equipment \nthat is made in the home States of certain powerful Members of \nCongress.\n  It is not good. Sooner or later, the American people will demand that \nit comes to an end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wish to be heard briefly.\n  We heard Senator McCain attack this bill that is before us that \nprimarily funds two wars, takes care of our wounded warriors, invests \nin new hospitals for them to be treated for their brain injuries, helps \nthem with their childcare, and essentially starts us on the path of \nbringing our troops home from Iraq--something President Obama promised \nto do--and changes our focus in Afghanistan, which has been very \nscattered, and focuses us on routing out the Taliban, who make it \npossible for al-Qaida to thrive. So this bill protects the American \npeople.\n  I have been very clear, I have said I want to see our Afghanistan \npolicy work. I said I am going to give it this year for that to happen, \nand I hope it does happen. Because we were attacked by al-Qaida. We \nwere attacked by Osama bin Laden. We were attacked because al-Qaida had \nsanctuary in Afghanistan. And instead of going into Afghanistan, the \nway we should have, we shortchanged that mission that I voted for and \nturned around and went into Iraq. We had President Bush, with his \nconstant focus on Iraq, lead us to a very dark period--very dark \nperiod--in our history, where we lost thousands of our soldiers, \nthousands more were\n\n[[Page S6792]]\n\nwounded--and you all know the story of the torture and all the rest \nthat accompanied this--and led us to a place where America has lost its \nstanding in the world.\n  This President inherited two wars. Yes, he is trying to end one and \nrefocus another. He inherited the worst recession since the Great \nDepression. I call it the ``Great Recession.'' And he also had to cope \nwith threats from North Korea, Iran, from pirates on the open seas, \ninstability in Pakistan. And then, on top of it all, he is facing, and \nwe are facing, a health threat from the swine flu, the H1N1 virus. So \nhe comes to us with an emergency spending bill.\n  Do I like everything in this bill? I do not. This is about a \ncompromise. I do not like everything in this bill. But to tear down the \nattempt of what we are trying to do here, which is to begin moving our \ntroops out of Iraq, refocus our effort in Afghanistan, focus on the \nwounded warriors, focus on global AIDS reduction, focus on the world \nrecession--that is another thing we are doing. I think it has to be \ndone. I would much rather do it all in the normal budget process. That \nis why President Obama has said this is the last war supplemental we \nwill have. I compliment him on that. President Bush sent supplemental \nrequests to Congress year after year after year. This President says \nthis is the last time, and I take him at his word.\n  I think it is important, instead of being so terribly negative, to at \nleast give a balanced overview. Many of the funds in the bill for \nAfghanistan will go to help the women and the children of Afghanistan. \nIt is very hard for me to understand how anyone could oppose that. We \nhave women who have acid thrown in their face if they do not obey their \nhusband or they take off a face covering. We have children being \nstoned--girls--on their way to school. It seems to me that we ought to \ngive it a chance before we leave these women high and dry. I, for one, \ncannot do that.\n  Again, I have said we have to do this right, and we have to do it \nquickly. Because I am not going to give my vote to an open checkbook \nfor another war. But I believe this administration gets it and I \nbelieve they are training the troops in Afghanistan and I believe they \nare working to build a civil society there. Because, at the end of the \nday, we cannot be the policemen of the world. We have to make sure the \npeople we are helping want to be helped and want to run their own \nsocieties. That is our hope in Iraq, finally. That is our hope in \nAfghanistan.\n  As I look around and I look around the world and I look around this \ncountry and I see the pain and suffering in this country--this \nrecession--we have to understand we are in a global economy. That is \nwhy the President wanted those IMF funds: So we can avert a depression \nout there in the world.\n  There are peacekeeping funds in this bill. Anyone who is following \nwhat is happening in Africa--whether it is Darfur or the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo or other places--understands the brutality that is \ngoing on. We need to help end the brutality, particularly--and I know \nmy colleague in the chair knows this--the brutality against the women, \nwhere in these countries rape is used as a tool of war and rape is used \nas a tool of ethnic cleansing. We cannot allow that to happen. It is an \nobligation we have as the leader of the free world.\n  I guess I wish to say to my colleague from Arizona, I totally \nunderstand his frustration with spending. I have to tell him, this \nDemocratic Congress is going to wrap its arms around spending. We did \nit before under President Clinton. We had horrible deficits that \nPresident Clinton inherited from the other George Bush, and we got our \nact in order. We had pay as you go. We are going to do that with this \nPresident.\n  But let me tell you, this President has been in office for five \nmonths, January through June, and we have averted economic disaster and \nwe have a foreign policy on the right track. There was an election in \nLebanon where the Lebanese people elected a pro-Western government. We \nhave other things happening around the world today that indicate people \nhear now. In very high-tech ways, they are learning that freedom is \nvaluable. But it does not come to us free.\n  Yes, I do not like everything in this bill. I could go through my \nlist too. Because each one of us would write a different bill. But I \nwill tell you what I like less, the loss of jobs, the threat of the \nswine flu, the threat of AIDS, the threat of world instability, the \nspread of weapons.\n  So I say, we should vote for this bill, as flawed as it is, sending a \nclear message to our President that we agree with him, but that this \nshould be the last war supplemental. Let's do these things on budget. \nLet's go back to pay-go. Let's wrap our arms around fiscal \nresponsibility, the way we did in the 1990s.\n  Let me remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who are \nranting and raving about deficits, under their President we had the \nmost outrageous deficits, the most outrageous debt. We Democrats, under \nBill Clinton, got a balanced budget in place, and we had a surplus--not \na deficit, we had a surplus--and we had the debt going down. It was \ngoing to be eliminated. Then George Bush came in. He started this war \nin Iraq--a war with an open checkbook, no end in sight, no checks and \nbalances on it, and tax breaks to the people who earn $1 million or \nmore. It drove us into the ground. That is what brought us to this \nJanuary, when our new President took all this on his shoulders and \nshared the burden with the Democratic Congress. I think we have averted \nthe worst of it. We have a long way to go. I think this supplemental \nwill help us get the rest of the way. Coming at us is pay as you go. \nComing at us is fiscal responsibility. Coming at us is a challenge. We \nare going to have to make those difficult choices. That is one of the \nreasons we want to take care of health care and energy because, at the \nend of the day, those will help our economy.\n\n  The challenges are great. There is plenty of stuff in this bill I \ndon't like, but I think, overall, this bill moves us in the right \ndirection, in terms of helping our men and women in uniform, helping \nour national security, helping our public health, helping the global \nrecession, and moving us toward a better day.\n  So I will support this bill. I thank you very much, Madam Chair.\n  I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Juneteenth Independence Day\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, next month, the Fourth of July, this \nNation will pause to remember the moment when we asserted our \nindependence and declared ourselves free from tyranny. It is a day all \nAmericans hold dear, and rightly so.\n  But on the 19th of this month, which will be tomorrow, many in this \ncountry observe another independence day. It echoes the ideals laid \ndown in that first declaration. It celebrates liberation from a more \noppressive tyranny. It marks a ``new birth of freedom'' for the slaves \nwho had been excluded from the promise of the American dream.\n  That is why I have submitted this Senate resolution observing the \nhistorical significance of that day--Juneteenth Independence Day.\n  Slavery officially ended in the Confederate States of America when \nPresident Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, \n1863. But many slaves did not learn of their freedom until much later.\n  Finally, on June 19, 1865, more than 2 years after the Emancipation \nProclamation, Union soldiers led by Major General Gordon Granger \narrived in Galveston, TX. They brought news that must have been almost \nunbelievable to all who heard it--especially those who had known no \nexistence outside of bondage. The Civil War was over, they announced, \nand all slaves were free.\n  From that day on, former slaves in the Southwest celebrated June 19 \nas the anniversary of their emancipation.\n  Over the past 144 years, Juneteenth Independence Day celebrations \nhave been held to honor African-American freedom. But this date has \ncome to hold even greater significance.\n\n[[Page S6793]]\n\nThroughout the world, Juneteenth celebrations lift up the spirit of \nfreedom and rail against the forces of oppression.\n  At long last, Juneteenth is beginning to be recognized as both a \nnational event and a global celebration. The end of slavery marked a \nmajor step towards achieving equal rights for every American, \nregardless of race, creed or color.\n  Just as the Fourth of July marks the beginning of a journey that \ncontinues even today, we must not forget that the long march to freedom \nthat started on June 19 is far from over.\n  Our progress along this path and our progress as a Nation can be \nmeasured in many ways, but none so dramatic as the popular election of \nan African American to the Presidency of the United States.\n  America has come a long way since that first Juneteenth, and yet we \nhave a long way still to go.\n  Juneteenth should be a day of reflection--a day to remember those who \ncame before, who fought and suffered and died. But it should also be a \nday of action; a day for all of us to stand together and hold up the \nliberties we hold so dear; a day to look ahead to the future, to \ncontinue the fight for freedom and equality; a day to think of our \nchildren as much as our forefathers.\n  Together, we must ensure that our sons and daughters know an America \nthat is even more free, more fair, and more equal than the America we \nlive in today.\n  When we leave this place, let us share in the joy of those who \ngreeted General Granger's arrival into Galveston on that fine June day \nmore than 140 years ago. And let us stand with our forefathers to \ncontinue this journey in our own lives.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting \nthis resolution observing the historical significance of Juneteenth \nIndependence Day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of \nthe leader, that no further points of order be in order during the \npendency of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2346, and that at \n4:40 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the conference \nreport, with the time until then equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form.

Madam President, as Members of the Senate and the House \ntackle health reform, two overriding objectives have become apparent. \nWe must bring down cost and we must expand access, while allowing \npeople who are happy with their health care to stay in the plan they \nare in now. Fix what is broken; preserve what works. Perhaps nowhere \nare these needs more obvious than the area of biopharmaceuticals or so-\ncalled biologics. Biologics are the fastest growing segment of \nprescription drug spending. With costs to biologics ranging anywhere \nfrom $10,000 to $200,000 per patient per year, biologic treatments pose \na significant financial challenge for patients, for insurance \ncompanies, for employers who are paying the bills, and for Federal and \nState governments that are also paying the bills. Let me give examples.\n  If you suffer from an inflammatory condition such as rheumatoid \narthritis or psoriasis or Crohn's disease, you probably would be \nprescribed Enbrel or Humira or Remicade. These biologics cost about \n$14,000 a year, more than $1,000 a month. Do you know what that does to \nan individual's pocketbook, an insurer or taxpayer? If you are \ndiagnosed with multiple sclerosis--as 200 Americans are per week, some \n30 Americans every day--you would probably be prescribed an interferon \nlike Avonex, Betaseron, or Rebif, at a cost of $19,000 per year. If you \nneed Zevalin to treat lymphoma, which strikes nearly 75,000 Americans \nevery year, it costs up to $30,000 for a full round of treatment.\n  When other prescription drugs go off patent, after they have had \npatent protections for many years, there is a process at the Food and \nDrug Administration for approving lower cost generic versions. So you \nwill see, when you go to a drugstore, many drugs which now are off \npatent. They have provided good profits for the developer, the drug \ncompany, but they are now off patent. So there could be generic \ncompetition in many of the drugs we use. That has worked to keep the \nprice down and to bring competition to the industry. But no such \nprocess for biologics exists, no allowance of a generic substitute to \ncompete with the biologic.\n  As it stands, biologic manufacturers are in the envious position of \nhaving a permanent monopoly. No one can compete with them. Even after \ntheir patent has expired, FDA, under law, cannot legally approve \ncompeting products because of a gap in FDA law. At this point the only \nthing that stands in the way of establishing a generic approval process \nfor biologics is the political muscle of the biologics industry. Here \nis what the industry tells us. They don't want any kind of approval \nprocess for generic biologics. They don't want competition. They want \nto continue to charge $14,000 if you have Crohn's disease, $19,000 if \nyou have MS, and $30,000 per round of treatment for the 75,000 \nAmericans who have lymphoma.\n  If we do establish such a process, they want to render it useless by \ngranting biologics the equivalent of a permanent patent extension. \nMaybe you\n\n[[Page S6794]]\n\ngive them 12 years. After 12 years, you allow a generic, unless they \nslightly change a molecule or a process and you get another 12 years \nand another 12 years and another 12 years. So in addition to 20 years \nworth of patent protection, they want 12 years of market exclusivity \nwhich has the exact same effect as patent protection. When FDA grants a \ndrug market exclusivity, it means that FDA will not approve any generic \nversion of that drug, period.\n  After the first 12 years of market exclusivity is over, the biologics \nindustry wants to slightly modify their product, and they get another \n12 years of market exclusivity. And if they slightly modify the product \nagain, they want another 12 years and another. In other words, they \nwant no generic competition.\n  We have generic competition in all kinds of drugs that are very well \nknown, but there is no provision for any kind of generic competition \nfor these biologics. The Federal Trade Commission, the government \nagency with no skin in the game, with no belief that one product is \nbetter than another, with no ties to the drug industry, with no ties to \nanybody, issued a report asserting that the biologics industry gets \nplenty of marketplace protection through patents and they should not be \nafforded even 1 day of market exclusivity, much less 12 or 24 or 36 \nyears.\n  AARP recently reported that the top 10 biologics recoup their R \ninvestment after 2 years of sales. The industry claims they need \ndecades sometimes to recoup their investment. But the AARP doesn't make \nthis stuff up. Biologics manufacturers, even though AARP said they only \nneed 2 years of sales to recoup their investment, are given more time \nthan that so they can make a healthy profit. Yet biologics \nmanufacturers are asking for 20 years of patent protection, coupled \nwith 12 more years of market exclusivity; again, renewed over and over. \nThat is the way they like it. The biologics industry wants us to go \nhome and tell constituents with arthritis or respiratory illness, \nhemophilia, cancer, or multiple sclerosis, numerous other conditions \nnow treated by biologics, if they are lucky, in 24 or 36 years they \nwill have access to treatments that are more affordable.\n  If we care about patients and fiscal responsibility, we will not \nallow the biologics industry to bully us into giving them more \nmarketplace protection than any other industry. But it will take the \npersonal will of Members from both sides of the aisle to overcome the \nbiologic industry's clout.\n  Some Members of this body have already taken a stand. I was proud to \njoin Senator Schumer, Senator Collins, Senator Vitter, and Senator \nBingaman--Democrats and Republicans--to introduce legislation that \nwould close the gap on FDA law that prevents generic versions of \nbiologics from being approved. This legislation is a compromise. It \nwould provide 5 years of market exclusivity--remember, they already \nhave patent protection--the same as that provided to other prescription \ndrugs. Then they would be eligible for an additional 3 years of market \nexclusivity for beneficial changes to their products and even more \nexclusivity if they conduct pediatric tests on their product. This \ntiered approach, which I hope to include as part of the health care \nreform bill moving through the HELP Committee, would provide needed \ncompetition, long-term savings, and an opportunity for consumers to \nhave safe, effective, and affordable medical treatments.\n  I credit the manufacturers and the scientists and thank them, the \nmedical researchers, for this. They provide great promise and hope to \nthose suffering from devastating diseases and chronic illness. But \nabsent price competition, countless Americans will be unable to benefit \nfrom these medicines because they are too expensive. We are talking \nabout tens of thousands of dollars a year just for this drug treatment, \nthis biologic treatment, let alone all the other doctors' bills and \nmedicine they would need.\n\n  I hope when my colleagues are lobbied by the biologics industry--and \nthey are spending millions of dollars on this because it means hundreds \nof millions of dollars in more profits for them--I hope when my \ncolleagues are lobbied by the biologics industry, they will remember 12 \nplus 12 plus 12. It simply does not work for us. The American patients, \nAmerican businesses, and American taxpayers cannot afford to wait 12 or \n24 or 36 years for affordable biologics. Frankly, we should not make \nthem wait.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have spoken here a few times already \nabout Federal employees and the great work they perform. I am honored \nto be in a position to come here and do it again. I enjoy sharing \nstories in this Chamber about excellent public servants.\n  These stories are only but a few pieces in the vivid mosaic of our \nFederal workforce. The stories are exemplary, not exceptional. These \nare regular people doing a great job.\n  The real story of our Federal employees--that of their dedication, \ntheir talents, and their important contributions--needs to be told.\n  Service in government is characterized by sacrifice. Many of our \nFederal employees wear a uniform and sacrifice on the battlefield. \nOthers work in civilian jobs but still make great sacrifices by working \nlong hours and foregoing opportunities in the private sector, such as \nsubstantially better pay and bonuses. Their bonus, as I have said \nbefore, is the satisfaction of having served their country.\n  Today I wish to speak about a man who risked his life during wartime \nand then spent nearly three decades working as a civilian engineer for \nthe U.S. Army Missile Command.\n  Joe Connaughton, a native of Tuscaloosa, AL, had already \ndistinguished himself during the Second World War. He served as a \nnavigator and bombardier on 47 missions in both the European and \nPacific theaters. Joe was decorated with three air medals and four \nbattle stars, and his unit received the Croix de Guerre for support \nprovided to the French Expeditionary Force during the Allied offensive \nin Italy.\n  After returning home, Joe took advantage of the GI bill to pursue a \nbachelor of science degree in chemical engineering from the University \nof Alabama. He began working for the U.S. Army Missile Command near \nHuntsville in the late 1950s.\n  For 27 years, Joe worked for the Army Missile Command's Research, \nDevelopment, and Engineering Division at Redstone Arsenal. He and his \nengineering team helped develop and perfect weapons systems critical to \nmaintaining our military edge during the Cold War. This included the \nLance, Hellfire, and THAAD missile propulsion systems.\n  When Joe and his colleagues were working on the Hellfire missile, \nwhich is carried primarily by the Apache attack helicopter, there was a \nproblem when the TV-based guidance system encountered difficulties in \nsmoke and bad weather. A missile whose own propulsion method gives off \na smoke plume cannot be accurately directed if the smoke hinders its \nguidance system. The engineering team on which Joe worked developed a \nsmokeless propellant, which greatly enhanced the missile's accuracy.\n  For this achievement, Joe and his team earned the Army Missile \nCommand's Scientific and Engineering Award in 1980.\n  When the Hellfire entered service in 1984, it was intended for use \nagainst Soviet tanks in a future Cold War conflict. But with the \ncollapse of communism in Europe just a few years later, some began to \ndoubt whether its development--and that of similar systems--was worth \nthe cost.\n  However, with the laser guidance and missile propulsion system \ndeveloped by the civilian engineers at Redstone Arsenal, the Hellfire \nproved its worth during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.\n  In that conflict, the Army and Marine Corps used the Hellfire to \ndisable the Iraqi air defenses in its initial strike, quickly gaining \nair supremacy. Apache helicopters launched Hellfire missiles against a \nmyriad of targets,\n\n[[Page S6795]]\n\ndemonstrating the usefulness and effectiveness of this new weapon.\n  This guided missile system, perfected in Alabama by Joe and other \nFederal employees, helped spare civilian lives in Iraq and ensured a \nrapid coalition victory. They continue to play a major role today, as \nPredator drones carry Hellfire missiles on missions over Afghanistan.\n  Our military depends on countless civilian engineers just like Joe. \nWithout their hard work and important contributions, we could not \nmaintain the military strength we have today. They are all--every one \nof them--Government workers, and they work on bases and in research \nfacilities throughout the country, including at Redstone Arsenal in \nHuntsville.\n  These men and women wake up each day and go to work knowing that they \ndirectly participate in keeping America safe. The technologies they \ndevelop remain at the forefront of our fight against al-Qaida and other \nextremist groups.\n  We must never forget that they, along with the rest of our civilian \ngovernment employees, enable the military to do its job.\n  Some give their lives for our country. Others give their lives to it. \nAll of them demonstrate this greatest hallmark of patriotism; which is \nsacrifice.\n  Joe could have made more money in the private sector. Doubtless, he \ncould have moved from the Army Missile Command to work for a private \nmilitary contractor, the same people he worked with on a daily basis in \ndeveloping these systems. But he didn't. His priority was making a \ncontribution, not making money.\n  In some ways, we have lost sight of this sense of purpose, which is \nthe engine of our American spirit. I am greatly encouraged that \nPresident Obama has called for a new generation to take up the torch of \npublic service through careers in government. He has called on us, once \nagain, to make sacrifices in order to ensure the future safety and \nprosperity of this country we all love so dearly.\n  Our Federal employees, like Joe, feel a sense of duty to serve this \ngreat Nation. It is what sustained him--a 20-year-old airman from \nAlabama--over Italy, France, Yugoslavia, China and Japan. It is what \nsustained him as an engineer when he returned home to Alabama and \nworked to build America's defenses. It is love of country. It is \nservice above self.\n  Joe embodies this spirit, and I know he has passed it on to the next \ngeneration. I can see it firsthand, because his son, Jeff, is my chief \nof staff--a great Federal employee and a great person.\n  Families across America will gather this Sunday to mark Father's Day \nand to celebrate the important bond between fathers and their children. \nOn this occasion I am reminded of my own father--who spent most of his \ncareer as a government employee--and the important lessons he taught me \nabout the value of public service.\n  I also think about fathers throughout America who have chosen--along \nwith so many mothers--to dedicate their careers to serving the public. \nThey are powerful role models, not only for their own daughters and \nsons, but for all young Americans who want a chance to shape this \ncountry's future.\n  I hope all my colleagues will join me in honoring the sacrifices and \nthe achievements of all our Federal employees.\n  I want to wish Joe a happy Father's Day, and I extend the same well \nwishes to fathers across the country, and especially to those serving \noverseas or with a loved one serving overseas.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.

Mr. President, Senator Kyl and I will join in \nintroducing a resolution concerning freedom of the press, freedom of \nspeech, and freedom of expression in Iran.\n  In the past week, the flow of information in and out of Iran has been \nsuppressed. Voices in Iran have been silenced, and the international \nright to freedom of expression has been restricted, especially in the \npress.\n  I support Iran's sovereignty and deeply respect the will of the \nIranian people. While Iran has enthusiastically embraced elections, the \nlong road to democracy does not end there. It also includes fundamental \nfreedoms, such as freedom of expression, which is protected under the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n  In 1976, Iran was one of the first countries to ratify this U.N. \ntreaty which also protects the right to hold opinions without \ninterference and the right to receive and impart information in \nwriting, print, or through any other media.\n  Our resolution supports the Iranian people as they take steps to \npeacefully express their opinions and aspirations and seek access to \nmeans of communication and the news. It expresses respect for the \nsovereignty, proud history, and rich culture of the Iranian people, and \nrecognizes the universal values of freedom of speech and freedom of the \npress.\n  As President Obama said earlier this week:\n\n       The democratic process--free speech [and] the ability of \n     people to peacefully dissent . . . are universal values and \n     need to be respected.\n\n  This is the case not just in Iran but anywhere in the world.\n  Since the Iranian presidential election on June 12, there have been \nincreased restrictions on freedom of the press in Iran and limitations \non the free flow of information. Newspapers and news services have been \ncensored, access for journalists has been restricted, and specific \nmedia outlets have been blocked. Foreign journalists have had their \npress credentials canceled and videos confiscated. They have been \nconfined to their hotels and told their visas would not be renewed. \nBureaus of foreign press agencies in Tehran have been closed, and \nothers have been instructed to suspend all their Farsi-language news.\n  For Iranian journalists, the stakes have been even higher. Numerous \nIranian journalists have been detained, imprisoned, assaulted, and \nintimidated since the elections on June 12. Journalists have been \ninstructed to file stories solely from their offices, which has limited \ntheir ability to provide timely and accurate news. There has also been \ninterference with international broadcasting in Iran, whether through \nthe jamming of radio transmissions or blockage of satellite signals.\n  Shortwave and medium-wave transmissions from the Farsi-language Radio \nFree Europe/Radio Liberty's Radio Farda have been partially jammed, and \nsatellite broadcasts, including those of the Voice of America's Persian \nNews Network and the British Broadcasting Corporation, have also been \nintermittently blocked as well. These services are widely popular in \nIran, serving as a vital source of communication and entertainment, and \nattempts to thwart such broadcasts are shameful.\n  Efforts to suppress the free flow of information have not focused on \nthe media alone. Blogs and social networking sites have been targeted \nas well, including popular Web sites such as Facebook and Twitter. \nShort message service in Iran has been blocked--preventing text message \ncommunications and jamming Internet sites that utilize such services--\nand cell phone service has been partially shut down.\n  These restrictions have prevented the free flow of information and \nprecluded Iranian citizens from communicating with each other. Some \nIranians have circumvented these restrictions through proxy Web sites \nand third-party carriers, and the Internet has served, at times, as the \nonly outlet for communication within Iran and with the rest of the \nworld.\n  This resolution reinforces the universal values of freedom of speech \nand freedom of the press. It supports the Iranian people as they take \nsteps to peacefully express their voices, opinions, and aspirations. It \ncondemns the detainment, the imprisonment, and the intimidation of all \njournalists in Iran and throughout the world.\n\n[[Page S6796]]\n\n  As President Obama said Tuesday:\n\n       To those people who put so much hope and energy and \n     optimism into the political process, I would say to them that \n     the world is watching and inspired by their participation, \n     regardless of what the ultimate outcome of the election was.\n\n  This resolution is not about the election in Iran. Rather, it is \nabout the fundamental right to free speech, free press, and free \nexpression of the Iranian people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the business of the Senate, now that we \nhave had the final vote on the supplemental here in the Senate, will be \nthe Travel Promotion Act. That is a piece of legislation that is widely \nbipartisan. We have passed it by unanimous consent through the Senate \nCommerce Committee and brought it to the floor of the Senate with very \nsubstantial Republican and Democratic support. I am an original author \nof the legislation called the Travel Promotion Act, but a good many \nRepublicans are cosponsors and colleagues on the Democratic side are as \nwell. It should not be controversial. Yet getting that bill to the \nfloor of the Senate required the filing of a cloture motion, which \nmeans, just on the motion to proceed, we had to wait 2 days and then \nhave a vote on whether we could actually proceed to the motion to \nproceed to the legislation itself. That passed, I believe, 90 to 6. \nThen we had 30 hours postcloture.\n  We have been in a waiting position to try to determine can we get to \nthis bill. Let me make the point that this is a piece of legislation \nthat is almost unique, in the sense that, No. 1, it is very bipartisan \nand, No. 2, the Congressional Budget Office says it is going to reduce \nthe Federal budget deficit.\n  Let me say that again. The Congressional Budget Office says this \nlegislation will actually reduce the Federal budget deficit by very \nclose to $500 million over 10 years. There ought not be substantial \ncontroversy about this legislation.\n  What we are working on and have been working on for some hours is to \ntry to determine how we get, now, on the bill and agree on amendments. \nWe have had lists back and forth of what amendments might or might not \nbe offered. We have not been able at this point to agree on the list. \nWe are not asking for a finite list, just a list on how to begin. There \nhave been so many amendments that have been proposed that have nothing \nat all to do with the legislation, so we are working back and forth. It \nappears we are not going to be able to reach agreement on a list of how \nwe begin with these amendments this evening, but my hope remains that \nperhaps tomorrow we will be able to have some kind of agreement on a \nlist that would allow us to proceed to the Travel Promotion Act.\n  Let me mention briefly that this legislation is not controversial. \nTravel promotion means that our country would begin to address a \nproblem. What is that problem? The fact is, we have many fewer visitors \nfrom abroad to this country, in terms of international tourism, which \nis very job creating, strongly supportive of economic growth because \ninternational tourists spend a lot of money. On average I believe they \nspend somewhere around $4,500 per trip when they come to this country, \nfor hotels and car rentals and airplanes and tourist attractions and so \non. It is very job creating.\n  The fact is, we have far fewer tourists coming to this country from \nabroad than we had in the year 2000. That is a very serious problem; we \nhave fallen substantially behind other countries that are aggressively \nmarketing their countries for destination by international travelers. \nItaly, France, Great Britain, Spain, Australia--the list goes on and on \nof countries that say come to our country, travel here, visit here, be \npart of the experience in our country. Our country is not involved in \nthat. It is as if there is a competition and we are not competing.\n  We put together a piece of legislation that would create and promote \ninternational destination travel to our country because it will surely \ncreate jobs and certainly be beneficial to our economy. As I said, it \nhas wide support throughout the industry, throughout this Chamber, with \nRepublicans and Democrats, and it actually reduces the Federal budget \ndeficit. It is pretty hard to find a piece of legislation such as that.\n  Despite all that broad support and the fact it passed out of the \nCommerce Committee unanimously, we are having trouble getting it to the \nfloor in a way that has amendments offered and in the regular order we \nconsider this legislation.\n  As of tonight we are not able to reach an agreement on a list, but I \nremain hopeful. As we continue to exchange and have discussions about \nbeginning this process and agreeing to amendments that can be debated, \nmy hope remains that perhaps tomorrow we will be able to agree to such \na list.\n  I believe others will have additional comments tomorrow as these \ndiscussions continue. My hope is we will be successful.\n  I have a number of unanimous consent requests I wish to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6796-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor S. Res. 182, \nrecognizing the democratic accomplishments of the people of Albania and \nexpressing the hope that the parliamentary elections on June 28 \nmaintain and improve the transparency and fairness of democracy in \nAlbania. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.\n  As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I am aware of what Albania \nhas accomplished since its first multiparty elections in 1991, but I \nalso know what a struggle it has been. Albania was under a ruthless and \nisolationist communist regime for decades. While not part of the former \nYugoslavia, it was also impacted by the conflicts in neighboring and \nnearby Balkan countries in the 1990s, which was a setback for the \nentire region.\n  The promise of NATO membership did much to encourage progress in \nAlbania in recent years. While problems relating to the rule of law and \nfight against corruption persisted, we supported Albania's NATO \nmembership with the understanding that reforms will continue. The State \nDepartment in particular emphasized that other NATO members continued \nthe reform process after joining the Alliance. That is our hope for \nAlbania as well.\n  This resolution more actively expresses our hope as well as \nexpectation that Albania live up to international standards it has \naccepted, in particular as they relate to the holding of elections. \nThere are concerns about these elections, especially in regard to new \nvoter identification cards and their distribution in time to allow \ncitizens to vote. Even if Election Day does go smoothly, it is \nunfortunate that there was a delay in preparations--which causes \nconfusion, frustration and suspicion among the Albanian electorate.\n  Albania is a good friend of the United States, and by passing this \nresolution we are investing in that relationship to make it grow. We \nwant Albania to succeed, and this resolution will hopefully encourage \nAlbania to hold successful elections on June 28. I believe the \nresolution is balanced, raising concern while noting progress and \nclearly favoring no particular political party. While those currently \nin power may have the additional responsibilities that come with \ngovernance, all parties have a role to play in order to make these \nelections meet international standards.\n\n[[Page S6797]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6797-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Staff Sergeant Edmond LO\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to U.S. \nArmy SSG Edmond Lo of Salem, NH.\n  Tragically, on June 13, 2009, this brave 23-year-old gave his life \nfor this Nation when an improvised explosive device detonated while his \nexplosive ordnance disposal team courageously worked to neutralize the \nthreat near Samarra City, Iraq. At the time of this hostile action, \nSergeant Lo, a member of the 797th Ordnance Company based at Fort Hood, \nTX, was serving his second tour in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom.\n  Edmond demonstrated a willingness and dedication to serve his country \nfrom an early age. A 2004 graduate of Salem High School, Edmond was a \nmember of the Air Force Junior ROTC Program and commander of the drill \nteam, color guard, and operations squadron. He was well known and liked \nby his teachers and fellow students and earned himself a full \nscholarship to a top engineering school upon graduation. However, \nsensing a call to duty, and because of his desire to protect his \ncountry, Edmond instead chose to join the Army.\n  Just as many of America's heroes have taken up arms in the face of \ndire threats, Edmond dedicated himself to the defense of our ideals, \nvalues, freedoms, and way of life. His valor and service cost him his \nlife, but his sacrifice will live on forever among the many dedicated \nheroes this Nation has sent abroad to defend our Nation's freedom.\n  A beloved member of the Salem community, Edmond was respected and \nadmired by all those around him. As a loyal member of the U.S. Army, he \ncontinually performed above and beyond all expectations. Because of \nEdmond's efforts, our liberty is more secure.\n  Kathy's and my thoughts, condolences, and prayers go out to Edmond's \nparents, David and Rosa Lo, his brothers and sisters, and his other \nfamily members and many friends who have suffered this most grievous \nloss. All will sorely miss Edmond Lo, a true patriot who was proud of \nhis family, proud of where he lived, and proud of what he did. In the \nwords of Daniel Webster--may his remembrance be as long lasting as the \nland he honored. God bless Edmond Lo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6797-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.\n\n                     CELEBRATING WEST VIRGINIA DAY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize that 146 \nyears ago today, West Virginia became the 35th State to join the Union. \nThe only State to have seceded from a Confederate State, West \nVirginia's birthday shines as an anniversary which commemorates the \nspirit, perseverance, optimism, and hard work of its people.\n  West Virginia is unique in countless ways; and her history is just \nthe beginning. For almost 200 years, West Virginians have played a \nsignificant role in the development and advancement of our nation. From \nthe Battle of Philippi in Barbour County, which was the first organized \nland battle of the Civil War, to John Brown's historic raid on the \nArsenal in Harpers Ferry, we recognize the role our State has played in \nthe making of America's history.\n  The only State to lie entirely within the borders of Appalachia, we \nremain incredibly diverse; our geography, population, and heritage are \nwhat have lead to our identity as the ``Wild and Wonderful'' State. \nFrom the renowned Greenbrier Hotel and Resort in White Sulphur Springs, \nto the New River Gorge in Fayetteville, which houses the longest steel-\narch bridge in the United States, it is no wonder that we draw tourists \nhere from all over the globe.\n  But it is not the many historical sites or beautiful landscapes that \ncapture the fortitude of West Virginia, but rather, her people--people \nwho continue to inspire with pride and honor, and overcome challenges \nwith a resolve like no other.\n  Early last month, flash flooding devastated families throughout \nsouthern West Virginia, damaging at least 1,500 homes with the worst \nflooding the area has seen for quite some time. The humanitarian \nresponse within the State has been profoundly moving; with people \ntraveling hours to donate their time and energy to assist their fellow \nWest Virginians, and some 300 National Guard troops posted in the \narea--proving that goodwill is alive and well in West Virginia. Seeing \nthis outpouring, I was reminded of serious flooding in our State when I \nwas Governor. I opened National Guard armories to house displaced \nfamilies but none showed up--because their neighbors had taken them in. \nThat is a shining example of our Mountaineer spirit.\n  In addition to serving the people of our State, the West Virginia \nNational Guard is committed to global security, with 38 active units \nserving around the world, including in Afghanistan and Kosovo. Our \nState motto, ``Mountaineers are always free,'' can be found resonating \nnot only in all corners of the Mountain State but across the globe. And \nit is a motto that West Virginians have stood up for time and again--as \nour State's veterans are among the bravest, most selfless, and most \ndevoted in the entire Nation.\n  West Virginians have the amazing ability to make sure our culture--\nwhich we are so proud of--is also part of our future. Ours is a State \nwrapped in age-old traditions, but also a State with a readiness to \nadapt to its younger generations; a veritable melting pot of both old \nand new world. The Ramp Eating Capitol of the World is found in \nRichwood, where international crowds gathered in April for the annual \nRamp Eating Contest to delight in this West Virginia favorite. And \nartists across our State are finding more innovative ways to market our \ncultural heritage, from Blenko Glass and amazing woodwork, to folk-art, \nquilts and Appalachian music.\n  Our schools, colleges and universities have inspired some of the best \nand brightest young leaders. West Virginia University and Marshall \nUniversity have produced some of the greatest minds in some of the \ntoughest fields worldwide, and have played an integral role in \nsupporting the communities they inhabit. The Promise Scholarship, which \npays instate collegiate tuition fees for those high school graduates \nwith qualifying academic records, has helped thousands of students \nafford college since its inception. Thanks to this measure, admission \nto institutions of higher education in West Virginia has steadily \nincreased, drawing students from across the Nation to study subjects \nsuch as biometrics, forensics, and defense.\n  Native West Virginians often joke that telephone calls placed to God \nare local, as our State is ``almost'' heaven. We love and are so proud \nof our awe-inspiring scenery and our towering mountains, and we can't \nwait to show them off to anyone who visits. And what those visitors \nalso find when they come to our beautiful State is a population well-\nversed in humility and good-nature. It is indeed the people who pay the \ngreatest tribute to our Mountain State, and it is my honor and \nprivilege today to wish you on their behalf, the happiest of birthdays, \nWest Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6797-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6797-S6798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           INDIRECT LAND USE\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a lingering issue \nthat could have serious detrimental effects on our nation's ethanol \nindustry.\n  The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 increased the \nrenewable fuels standard--commonly known as the RFS--to 36 billion \ngallons annually of ethanol and other biofuels by 2022.\n  I support the RFS . . . Always have. The RFS simply means more \ndomestic energy production, less imported oil from unfriendly nations, \nand more jobs in rural America--both on and off the farm.\n  The 2007 law requires EPA to come up with new rules to determine \ngreenhouse gas emissions throughout the lifecycle of renewable fuels. \nSimply put, EPA must calculate how much greenhouse gas is emitted from \nthe time the seed is produced to the time drivers use the fuel in their \ncars, with every step in between. These steps include production, \ntransportation, distribution, and blending, just to name a few.\n  Under the 2007 law, renewable fuels must emit anywhere from 20-60 \npercent fewer greenhouse gases than petroleum.\n\n[[Page S6798]]\n\n  Unfortunately, when calculating lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, \nEPA has included theoretical indirect land use changes.\n  As the theory goes, increased production of biofuels leads to more \ngrain being used for biofuels and less being exported to foreign \nmarkets. Allegedly, this decrease in exports means additional grain \nproduction is required in other parts of the world, creating increased \ncultivation in those areas. Proponents of this way of thinking say \nforests in other parts of the world are being converted to crops to \nsubstitute for the missing U.S. grain.\n  However, that is all it is, an unsubstantiated theory, an argument \nthat just doesn't hold water. Pure bunk.\n  As an example, in 2004, over 10,000 square miles of the Amazon was \ndeforested. In 2008--the peak year for ethanol production to date--that \nnumber dropped to under 5,000 square miles. How is that possible?\n  Due to significant technological advances and ever-increasing \nefficiency, the American farmer continues to meet the demand for food, \nfeed, and biofuel. For instance, in 1980, the average corn yield per \nacre in this country was 91 bushels. Last year, it was 153.9 bushels--a \n70-percent increase in productivity.\n  In fact, this spring, American farmers will use almost exactly the \nsame amount of acres for corn production as they did 30 years ago--\nabout 85 million acres. Yet the productivity advances mean we will \nlikely harvest roughly 6 billion bushels more corn on the exact same \namount of land.\n  The soybean industry can tell a similar story. In 1980, American \nfarmers produced just under 1.8 billion total bushels of soybeans on \n69.5 million acres. In 2007--almost 30 years later--they produced \nalmost 2.7 billion bushels on 64.7 million acres. That is a production \nincrease of nearly a billion bushels, on 5 million fewer acres.\n  So the facts seem clear. Even as the production of biofuels \nincreases, deforestation rates have been cut in half just in the last 5 \nyears.\n  Clearly, no reliable or accepted model for measuring indirect land \nuse change exists. Projection models for indirect land use are based on \nassumptions about how landowners made choices about what to do with \ntheir land. And unless the EPA has recently hired mind-readers, they \nmight as well be playing pin the tail on the donkey.\n  Calculating emissions from indirect land use changes is such an \ninexact science; it is really no science at all. There is literally no \nway to know if what you come up with is accurate.\n  Our farmers and ethanol producers should not be held responsible for \nland use decisions made half way around the world, especially when they \nare based on untested and unreliable assumptions.\n  Just last year, the President's own Interior Secretary, Ken Salazar--\nthen a sitting U.S. Senator--signed a letter to EPA stating that EPA's \ncalculations pertaining to indirect land use are based on ``incomplete \nscience and inaccurate assumptions.''\n  For all these reasons, today I sent a letter to EPA Administrator \nLisa Jackson requesting a 120-day extension of the deadline for the \npublic comment period on the RFS. EPA needs adequate time to hear from \nimpacted industries and organizations about the potentially devastating \neffects of these untested, unreliable indirect land use calculations. I \nhope the EPA will give serious consideration to my request.\n  Additionally, I am cosponsoring S. 943 and S. 1148, both bills that \nwould remove indirect land use assumptions from the renewable fuel \nstandard. Doing so does not in any way impact emissions reductions \nrequirements. The requirements remain intact and the same goals can be \nreached. These bills will simply remove a very untested, incomplete, \nassumption-based factor from the equation.\n  And while the environmental benefits of ethanol have been well-\ndocumented, the RFS was enacted to increase our energy security and \ndecrease our dependence on foreign oil. Right now, over 60 percent of \nour oil is imported from other countries. Much of it comes from \ncountries that, put very simply, don't like us very much. We have to \ntake steps to become less reliant on these nations for our energy needs \nand more reliant on ourselves, and the RFS does that.\n  For example, the production and use of 9 billion gallons of ethanol \nin 2008 displaced the need for over 320 million barrels of oil. This is \nthe equivalent of eliminating oil imports from Venezuela for 10 months. \nPut another way, it represents the equivalent of 33 days' worth of oil \nimports. Those are not insignificant numbers.\n  An expanded ethanol industry has yielded another very important \nresult: rural economic development. Using my home state of Nebraska as \nan example, ethanol has clearly benefitted many rural communities.\n  Almost 10 years ago, as Governor of Nebraska, I supported several \ninitiatives to incentivize what was then a relatively small ethanol \nindustry. Well, today Nebraska is the Nation's second largest ethanol \nproducer.\n  Nebraska currently has 20 operational ethanol plants, with a combined \nproduction capacity of over 1.3 billion gallons of ethanol each year. \nThese plants represent more than $1.4 billion in capital investment and \nprovide direct employment for roughly 1,000 Nebraskans.\n  Energy security, economic development, environmental improvement, \nthese issues are all connected.

Meringolo, vice president \nfor development at St. Mary's College since 1997.\n  Mr. Meringolo leaves a remarkable record of accomplishment at St. \nMary's College. He was hired 15 years ago as director of the library \nand information services and directed a comprehensive modernization \neffort that encompassed library partnerships with the University of \nMaryland System and raised $2 million for the library's endowment.\n  During his tenure as vice president for development, St. Mary's \nendowment has grown from less than $5 million to more than $24 million. \nMoreover, Mr. Meringolo pursued Federal funding strategies that have \nyielded more than $6 million for programs such as St. Mary's River \nProject and campus IT networking infrastructure.\n  For the past 3 years, Mr. Meringolo has served as secretary to the \nBoard of Trustees. I had the honor of serving on the board from 1988-\n1999. He has provided staff support to the board's development, \ngovernance, and executive committees.\n  Mr. Meringolo often represents the college in the local community, \nhaving served as vice president of the Patuxent Partnership, as a \nmember of the Navy Alliance, and the college's representative to the \nEconomic Development Commission of St. Mary's County.\n  When the college and Historic St. Mary's City joined forces to create \nthe $65 million Maryland Heritage Project, Mr. Meringolo worked to \nensure a compelling and timely application. The facilities of St. \nMary's College were reshaped over the last decade as a result of the \nMaryland Heritage Project.\n  The challenge presented by St. Mary's small-scale and modest \nresources was largely overcome by the talents of this very thoughtful \nand experienced individual. The college has experienced enormous growth \nin the last 15 years and much of that growth can be attributed to Mr. \nMeringolo's leadership.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding the many accomplishments \nof Torre Meringolo and in wishing him success in his future \nendeavors.\n\n[[Page S6799]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6799-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    COMMENDING JANE MARGARET O'BRIEN\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I pay special tribute to the \noutstanding accomplishments of Jane Margaret O'Brien, Ph.D. president \nof St. Mary's College since 1996. I was a member of the St. Mary's \nBoard of Trustees and have known Maggie for many years. I have the \nutmost respect for her and what she has been able to accomplish at St. \nMary's during her tenure.\n  During her 13 years as president, the College has distinguished \nitself as a premier honors college that excels at scholarship, \nresearch, creative thinking, community engagement, and an appreciation \nand commitment to world issues, cultures, and communities.\n  Dr. O'Brien provided critical guidance to the development of the \ncollege's external relations and fundraising efforts during its \ntransition to the Honors College Curriculum. Fundraising during Dr. \nO'Brien's tenure has profoundly reshaped the college's scholarships, \nprofessorships, lecture and learning series, arts, athletic, and \ncommunity programs.\n  I will provide two examples of Dr. O'Brien's wonderful legacy. The \nCenter for the Study of Democracy, an advisory board on which I have \nhad the pleasure of serving since 2002, was established with a $2 \nmillion National Endowment for the Humanities--NEH--grant and challenge \nmatches. The center is a leading programmatic initiative between the \ncollege and neighboring Historic St. Mary's City. This relationship \ncontinues to flourish with the opportunity for students to serve as \nMaryland Heritage Scholars and for faculty from the college and the \ncity to serve as Maryland Heritage Fellows.\n  The Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, where Dr. O'Brien \nwill continue her work for St. Mary's, was founded in 1975 for two \npurposes: to establish in Oxford a permanent institute for the \ninterdisciplinary study of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and to \nprovide academic training for overseas students who wish to study at \nOxford.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding Maggie O'Brien for her \nstellar leadership at St. Mary's College and in wishing her success in \nher continuing work on behalf of this unique institution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6799-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             125TH ANNIVERSARY OF PARK RIVER, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th \nanniversary. On July 2-5, 2009, the residents of Park River will gather \nto celebrate their community's history and founding.\n  The town of Park River was founded in 1884. It was named for its \nlocation on the Park River. The river itself was named by pioneer fur \ntrader Alexander Henry, to note the corrals or parks that the \nAssiniboine Indians had built by the river to herd wild animals.\n  Park River's town motto, ``Park River, The Town with a Heart,'' truly \ncaptures the essence of the community where people are always willing \nto lend a helping hand. The town's all volunteer ambulance service, the \nWalsh County EMS, operates 24 hours a day and demonstrates the town's \nwillingness to help each other out.\n  Today, the town's economy is mostly agricultural based, but also does \nfocus on incorporating businesses in the technology and health care \nsector. Park River's health care industry is epitomized by its state-\nof-the-art hospital, First Care Health Center. This center has been \nproviding quality medical care for the past 55 years to the residents \nof Park River and those in surrounding communities.\n  To celebrate their 125th anniversary, the people of Park River have \nplanned a number of events including a polka fest, talent show, \nfireworks, road rally, an all class reunion, an American Legion \nbaseball reunion game, and a parade that will be held on July 4th.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Park \nRiver, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well through the next century. By honoring Park River and all the \nother historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great \npioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places \nsuch as Park River that have helped to shape this country into what it \nis today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our \nrecognition.\n  Park River has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6799-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                125TH ANNIVERSARY OF CANDO, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On \nJuly 2-5, the residents of Cando will gather to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Founded in 1884, Cando was designated the county seat for Towner \nCounty and named for the ``Can Do'' spirit of the pioneers. That spirit \nis still visible in this active community, where hunting, fishing, \ncamping, and bird-watching are all popular activities. In fact, ducks \nare so common to the area that Cando is known as the duck capital of \nNorth Dakota.\n  This active community, located in north-central North Dakota, is home \nto two museums, a golf course, bowling alley, and many thriving \nbusinesses.\n  In honor of Cando's 125th anniversary, town officials have organized \nactivities including a golf tournament, street dance, folk dance, \nparade, potluck, tractor pull, and variety show.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Cando, \nND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well \nin the future. By honoring Cando and all other historic small towns of \nNorth Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for \nfuture generations. It is places such as Cando that have helped shape \nthis country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is \ndeserving of our recognition.\n  Cando has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6799-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING LARRY G.

Robertson will retire at the end of \nthis month after proudly serving in the Arkansas State Police for 32 \nyears, providing protection and assistance to Arkansans across the \nState.\n  Captain Robertson's record of accomplishment spans three decades. He \nbegan his law enforcement career in 1973 as Star City, AR, chief of \npolice before he was commissioned on January 17, 1977, as a state \ntrooper assigned to the highway patrol division, troop E headquartered \nin Dumas, AR. Robertson distinguished himself in the line of duty and \nworked his way up the promotion ladder quickly from the rank of \nsergeant, to lieutenant, and finally, in 1999, to the rank of captain, \nhighway patrol commander, troop F, the largest geographical troop in \nthe State covering nine counties in southeast Arkansas.\n  Under Captain Robertson's leadership as troop F commander, his \ntroopers consistently led the State in DWI arrests and other activities \ndespite having fewer personnel than most other troops. His dedication \nto keeping his fellow Arkansans safe extended beyond the highway patrol \ndivision. During his 30 years of service, he led the Arkansas motor \nvehicle inspection team and served as a sniper and later commander of \ntroop E special response team.\n  Captain Robertson retires from the Arkansas State Police on June 30, \n2009. His commitment to excellence sets an example for not only his \nfellow law enforcement officers, for whom he is a mentor and friend, \nbut also for those in the civilian community he worked diligently to \nprotect. Although he will be missed in the line of duty, I wish him \ncontinued success in his retirement and thank him for his service to \nour great State of Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6799-5", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6799-S6800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             100TH ANNIVERSARY OF McLAUGHLIN, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the \nFederal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the \nemergency declared in Executive Order 13159 of June 21, 2000, with \nrespect to the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the \naccumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in \nthe territory of the Russian Federation, is to continue beyond June 21, \n2009.\n  It remains a major national security goal of the United States to \nensure that fissile material removed from Russian nuclear weapons \npursuant to various arms control and disarmament agreements is \ndedicated to peaceful uses, subject to transparency measures, and \nprotected from diversion to activities of proliferation concern. The \naccumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in \nthe territory of the Russian Federation continues to pose an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of \nthe United States. For this reason, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to \nthe risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation of a \nlarge volume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the \nRussian Federation and maintain in force these emergency authorities to \nrespond to this threat.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, June 18, 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6800-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6800-S6801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-2043.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine urging the President, the Secretary of \n     Energy, and Congress to review national policy on used \n     nuclear fuel; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, nuclear utility ratepayers have committed more \n     than $31,000,000,000 in fees and interest, as mandated under \n     the federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, for the purpose \n     of establishing a permanent repository for storage of used \n     nuclear fuel from commercial reactors and defense-related \n     high-level radioactive waste; and\n       Whereas, the ratepayers of Maine Yankee, Maine's former \n     nuclear power facility, now decommissioned, paid $65,500,000 \n     into the federal Nuclear Waste Fund for nuclear fuel used \n     after the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was enacted in 1982 and \n     are continuing to make payments into the Spent Nuclear Fuel \n     Disposal Trust Fund to fund a $185,000,000 obligation for the \n     disposal of spent nuclear fuel used prior to 1983; and\n       Whereas, the United States Government failed to begin \n     accepting commercial used fuel by 1998 as required by the \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and by contracts with used \n     fuel owners, and only in 2008 did the United States \n     Department of Energy finally submit an application to the \n     federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission to construct a \n     permanent used fuel repository; and\n       Whereas, the expected funding levels for the permanent fuel \n     disposal program in the fiscal year 2009 federal budgets and \n     statements by the Federal Government concerning the fiscal \n     year 2010 federal budgets point to continuing chronic delays \n     for the Yucca Mountain repository, if not the outright \n     termination of the project; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Government's failure to meet its 1998 \n     statutory and legal obligations to accept used fuel has led \n     to the Federal Government's being found in partial breach of \n     the contracts with nuclear utility owners, leading to federal \n     taxpayer payments to the utilities of about $1,000,000,000 \n     thus far; and\n       Whereas, in light of the Federal Government's failure to \n     meet its responsibility, the commercial nuclear industry has \n     embraced an integrated nuclear fuel management program \n     incorporating:\n       1. Continued safe and secure storage of used fuel at \n     commercial plant sites;\n       2. Development of 2 Nuclear Regulatory Commission-licensed \n     private or government-owned centralized interim storage \n     facilities in communities that would host such facilities \n     voluntarily;\n       3. Continued public and private sector efforts on research, \n     development and deployment of technologies to recycle used \n     fuel in a safe, environmentally responsible, proliferation-\n     resistant and commercially viable way; and\n       4. Continued review of the permanent repository license \n     application by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and \n     continued policymaker engagement to ensure the safety and \n     security of whatever facilities or sites ultimately are \n     chosen for permanent disposal of the by-products of the once-\n     through or close nuclear fuel cycle; and\n       Whereas, several prominent national state officials' \n     organizations, the National Conference of State Legislatures, \n     the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners \n     and the American Legislative Exchange Council, have all \n     endorsed immediate establishment of centralized Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission-licensed interim fuel storage \n     facilities in voluntary host communities and continued \n     research on the recycling of fuel and other advanced fuel \n     management technologies: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request the United States Government to protect nuclear \n     utility ratepayers by immediately reducing the fee that \n     sustains and overfunds the Nuclear Waste Fund to a level that \n     will cover only the costs incurred by the Department of \n     Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and local Nevada \n     government units that provide oversight of the permanent used \n     fuel repository program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, also respectfully \n     urge the United States Government to immediately enact \n     legislation expediting the establishment of 2 Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission-licensed, private or government-owned \n     interim storage facilities for used commercial nuclear fuel, \n     with community incentives funded by the Nuclear Waste Fund, \n     and requiring the Department of Energy to take possession of, \n     safely transport and store used fuel at these facilities by \n     leasing space at these facilities, and giving first priority \n     to moving fuel from decommissioned plants; and be it further\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, also respectfully \n     urge the United States Government to enact legislation \n     creating an independent panel of esteemed public policy, \n     scientific, environmental, engineering and affected community \n     leaders that would be charged with conducting a long-term \n     strategic assessment of the Nation's used fuel and defense \n     waste management practices and developing specific \n     recommendations on how to proceed in the future while interim \n     storage facilities are being developed; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable Barack H. Obama, President of the United \n     States, to the United States Secretary of Energy, to the \n     President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives and to each Member of \n     the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-50. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee urging the President and \n     Congress to oppose legislation relative to the Employee Free \n     Choice Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 26\n\n       Whereas, the right to private elections is the cornerstone \n     of American democracy; and\n       Whereas, private ballot elections are the most democratic \n     way to determine employees' wishes and guarantee an outcome \n     unaffected by outside pressures; and\n       Whereas, federally supervised elections conducted by the \n     National Labor Relations Board have been the accepted law \n     governing union recognition campaigns for sixty years, \n     providing detailed procedures that ensure a fair election, \n     free of fraud, where employees may cast their vote \n     confidentially without peer pressure or coercion from unions \n     or employers; and\n       Whereas, limiting union recognition to signing \n     authorization cards (``card check'') in the presence of union \n     officials, coworkers, and employers does not reflect the \n     unbiased will of employees; and\n       Whereas, in recent years, the vast majority of businesses \n     targeted by union organizing campaigns have been small \n     businesses with fifty or fewer employees; and\n       Whereas, small businesses are more likely to be held \n     captive at the will of union organizing efforts, as they have \n     less resources for the lengthy legal process of union \n     recognition campaigns; and\n\n[[Page S6802]]\n\n       Whereas, efforts to eliminate private elections are an \n     attack on the free speech rights of business and workers' \n     individual rights; and\n       Whereas, compulsory binding arbitration, which would force \n     employers to accept the terms of a first contract if the \n     employer and the union cannot agree, is fundamentally \n     unconstitutional, and will dramatically undermine the ability \n     of any employer to negotiate; and\n       Whereas, compulsory arbitration discourages the parties \n     from offering compromises in bargaining for fear that they \n     may prejudice their position in arbitration: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred Sixth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, That the General Assembly \n     and the people of the State of Tennessee oppose proposals \n     seeking to eliminate the private election phase of union \n     recognition campaigns and implement compulsory binding \n     arbitration on employers. Be it further\n       Resolved, that the Senate and the people of the State of \n     Tennessee support democracy in the workplace by maintaining \n     every worker's right to privately decide whether or not to \n     allow a particular union to represent their interests. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that the Senate urges the President of the United \n     States and the United States Congress to oppose legislation \n     that is detrimental to the rights of workers and is an \n     offense against democratic principles by opposing the \n     Employee Free Choice Act and any of its components in 2009 \n     and in future years.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-51.

A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to allow children in foster care to be placed with their parents in \nresidential family treatment centers that provide safe environments for \ntreating addiction and promoting healthy parenting; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Keeping \nFamilies Safe Act of 2009 which seeks to keep families together when a \nparent is in a comprehensive residential family treatment program. \nComprehensive residential family treatment is a unique program that \nserves parents and children together in a safe residential environment \nas the parent undergoes treatment for substance abuse.\n  Such programs tend to be small, but their results are impressive. One \nstudy found that 60 percent of mothers who participated in the Pregnant \nand Postpartum Women and Their Infants program were completely clean \nand sober six months after their discharge. This same study found that \n88 percent of these children were still with their mothers six months \nafter the mother was discharged. However, only 5 percent of all \nsubstance abuse treatment facilities are able to accommodate children. \nThe goal of this legislation is to offer support and flexibility to \nsuch promising programs by allowing children who are in foster care be \nplaced with their parent in the comprehensive residential family \ntreatment center, and bring their foster care payment with them as \ntheir placement is transferred. By allowing these funds to follow the \nchild to the residential facility, the chances for that family's \nsuccess are much greater.\n  Family based substance abuse treatment centers have proven to be an \neffective means of treating substance abuse and reuniting families, but \nmost facilities are struggling to make ends meet. Many of the parents \nin treatment are motivated by the hope of overcoming their addiction \nand reuniting with their children. This bill is designed to give them \nthat chance, and it will hopefully inspire them by allowing their \nchildren to be part of the recovery, in a completely safe environment. \nI urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to help keep \nfamilies together and provide another funding source for these \npromising programs for children and parents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Coburn, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1287. A bill to provide for the audit of financial statements of \nthe Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal years \nthereafter, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today Senators Coburn, Grassley, and I are \nintroducing the Department of Defense Financial Accountability Act of \n2009, which imposes hard legislative deadlines on the Department of \nDefense to finally fix its broken bookkeeping system. This legislation \nis not only necessary, it is long overdue.\n  The bill establishes a series of deadlines, beginning next year and \nrunning through 2017, for DoD and the Services to become audit ready. \nIn particular, it compels the Services to account for military \nequipment, real property, inventory, operating materials and supplies, \nenvironmental liabilities, and fund balances with Treasury. Thereafter, \nDOD must undergo a full, independent audit of its financial statements. \nIf DoD fails to meet any deadline set forth in the bill, it must timely \ndocument and explain its failure to Congress.\n  The Department of Defense is the most massive and complex of any \norganization, public or private. It is entrusted with more taxpayer \ndollars than any other federal department or agency. For fiscal year \n2009 alone, Congress appropriated over $513 billion for DoD's base \nbudget. It added an additional $7.4 billion for DoD in this year's so-\ncalled stimulus bill.\n  To support its business functions, DoD has thousands of separate \nbusiness systems that it has layered upon one another for decades. They \nare archaic, overly complex, and error-prone. They are sometimes \nredundant and often lack standardization. It is no wonder that since \n1995, GAO has classified the Pentagon's financial management as high-\nrisk, which makes it vulnerable to fraud and waste. Indeed, according \nto GAO, DoD's accounting problems cost the American taxpayer $13 \nbillion in 2005--that's $35 million a day.\n  This has been a problem for decades. In 1975, the Army disclosed that \nit had spent $225 million over its budget because of a serious \nbreakdown in its accounting and financial management reporting system. \nFor fiscal year 1986, the Navy failed to disclose $58 million in real \nproperty, $1.7 billion in guaranteed loans, and data on operating \nleases on ships. According to the Government Accountability Office, \nbetween 1970 and 1980, the Air Force incurred numerous over obligations \nin amounts up to $210 million of its industrial funds. This would never \nbe tolerated in the private sector.\n  This is not only about numbers and audits--this is also about the \nsecurity of our troops and our nation. These broken systems affect \noperations and endanger our troops. Over the years, the GAO has \nreported that the Pentagon's poor financial management has caused pay \nproblems for National Guard and reservists; impeded delivery of food \nand other essential supplies to U.S. troops; and had the Pentagon \nscrambling to identify and locate 250,000 defective chem-bio suits, \nsome of which were being sold over the Internet.\n  Let me read into the record one account of how this impacted ongoing \noperations in Iraq. According to a February 5, 2006 Star Tribune news \narticle: ``When Perry Jeffries was serving in Iraq, the computers \nshowed that his 4th Infantry Division troops had access to drinking \nwater, a place to shower and working wheels on their vehicles. As the \nfirst sergeant came to understand when scrounging for water, towing \nimmobilized tanks and driving to other posts or to Kuwait to pick up \nneeded parts, the Pentagon's bookkeeping doesn't always match reality. \nJefferies saw the real-life results of what has been a visible \n`accounting' problem in Washington--the Pentagon's inability to keep \naccurate track of transactions and assets.''\n  Congress has already enacted several laws mandating financial \nmanagement reform and the Office of Management and Budget has issued \ncirculars on internal controls over financial reporting and financial \nmanagement systems. Notably, none contain hard deadlines for an audit.\n  Meanwhile, DoD has repeatedly promised Congress that it would fix the \nproblem. In 1999 and 2000, then-DoD Comptroller William Lynn testified \nbefore Congress that financial management reform was his highest \npriority. In fact, Mr. Lynn's successor, Dov Zakheim, set a deadline to \nhave the Department of Defense audit ready by 2007. Under DoD's latest \nFinancial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan, that deadline is now \n2017.\n  I want to recognize that the Department has tried, with varying \ndegrees of effort, to improve financial management, but DoD auditors \nand GAO continue to report significant weaknesses.\n\n[[Page S6808]]\n\n  I appreciate that our military is engaged in ongoing operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan. That is why Senators Coburn, Grassley and I have \nsought to be reasonable and realistic with the deadlines. They are the \nsame deadlines in DoD's current Financial Improvement and Audit \nReadiness Plan.\n  It has been 19 years since the CFO Act was passed requiring DoD and \nother departments to have an audit. It will be 2019--nearly 30 years \nafter the passage of the CFO Act--before the Department of Defense is \nable to get an audit opinion, if we hold them to their current \ntimeline. If we do not, this may never happen.\n  The ultimate outcome of this legislation will be the implementation \nof effective financial management processes, efficient business systems \nand strong internal controls that are essential to producing timely, \nreliable and useful financial information. Quality information will \nallow DoD to make informed business decisions and ensure accountability \non an ongoing basis.\n  Every dollar we save through improved financial management is another \ndollar for our troops--for body armor, for medical supplies, for \nveterans care. Improved financial systems will ensure that troops in \nthe future do not find themselves in the same straits as the 4th \nInfantry Division, searching for supplies that a computer says they \nalready have.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1287\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1289. A bill to improve title 18 of the United States Code; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Foreign Evidence Request Efficiency Act, which I have \nintroduced on behalf of myself and the Chairman and Ranking Members of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Senators Leahy and Sessions. It has been a \npleasure to work with them on this truly bipartisan effort, and I am \ngrateful for their support.\n  Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Sessions, and I have all served as \nprosecutors. I can say with no exaggeration that few responsibilities \nare more important to the rule of law, to the security of our \ncommunities, and to the rights and freedoms that we enjoy as Americans. \nI served as the U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island--Senator Sessions served \nin that capacity in Alabama--and I know we both will always remember \nthe feeling of standing up in court to say: ``Your Honor, may it please \nthe Court, I represent the United States of America.'' It was the honor \nof a lifetime.\n  As my colleagues know, the United States routinely helps foreign law \nenforcement agencies as they pursue criminal conduct involving activity \noutside their borders, including inside the United States, and they do \nthe same for us. This is exactly as it should be. As the world grows \nmore interconnected and crime becomes increasingly global, it becomes \nall the more important for law enforcement agencies in the United \nStates and around the world to work together to bring criminals to \njustice. Otherwise, it would be very hard to build cases against \ninternational organized crime organizations, drug cartels, purveyors of \nchild pornography on the internet, and other criminal threats from \noutside our borders.\n  One way that a law enforcement agency provides assistance to another \nis by gathering evidence from within its borders that a foreign law \nenforcement agency needs to prosecute a case. The United States \nroutinely completes requests submitted to it by foreign law enforcement \nagencies just as it receives comparable assistance when it makes \nevidence requests in foreign countries. For example, let's assume that \nSpanish authorities are investigating a complicated financial fraud \nthat is being conducted over the internet, apparently from a base in \nthe United States. After conducting their investigation in Spain, the \nSpanish authorities submit a request to the United States for financial \nrecords, internet records, and various other kinds of evidence. U.S. \nAttorneys review the requests and then seek warrants for the evidence \nas appropriate. When the evidence is collected, the United States \ntransmits it to Spanish authorities, leading to prosecution in Spanish \ncourts.\n  This process sounds quite simple, but unfortunately in practice it is \nextremely cumbersome. This is because under the existing rules, any \nforeign evidence request must be split up and sent to each district \nwhere the evidence exists. So take the Spanish example I just gave, and \nimagine that the financial records sought are in banks in six different \nfederal judicial districts, that the internet records are in another \nfive federal judicial districts, and that other documentary evidence is \nspread over another five districts. Under existing law, sixteen \ndifferent U.S. Attorneys' Offices would have to work on the evidence \nrequest. This is incredibly inefficient and burdensome for U.S. \nAttorneys across the country.\n  The Foreign Evidence Request Efficiency Act would end this problem by \nallowing such foreign evidence requests to be handled centrally, by a \nsingle or more limited number of U.S. Attorneys offices as appropriate. \nWhy, as in my example, should sixteen U.S. Attorneys' Offices have to \ndeal with an evidence request that one office can coordinate? Simply \nput, this reform would make life easier for our U.S. Attorneys. We owe \nthem no less.\n\n[[Page S6810]]\n\n  Of course, respect for civil liberties demands that we not suddenly \nchange the types of evidence that foreign governments may receive from \nthe United States or reduce the role of courts as gatekeepers for \nsearches. The Foreign Evidence Request Efficiency Act would leave those \nimportant protections in place, while simultaneously reducing the \npaperwork that the cumbersome existing process imposes on our U.S. \nAttorneys.\n  Two points merit emphasis. First, by making it easier for U.S. \nAttorneys to collect evidence, the United States can respond more \nquickly to foreign requests for evidence. Setting a high standard of \nresponsiveness will allow the United States to urge that foreign \nauthorities respond to our requests for evidence with comparable speed. \nThe United States will benefit if foreign governments cannot use our \nown delay to justify responding slowly to our requests. Second, the \nForeign Evidence Request Efficiency Act would not change the United \nStates' obligations to foreign nations. It would only make it easier \nfor the United States to respond to these requests by allowing them to \nbe centralized and by putting the process for handling them within a \nclear statutory system.\n  I urge my colleagues to act promptly on this bipartisan legislation. \nI would like to thank the excellent attorneys in the Department of \nJustice who have worked with me on this legislation, and would like to \nrequest unanimous consent to insert their letter of support into the \nCongressional Record. I again thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member \nSessions for their support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                 Washington, D.C., March 27, 2009.\n     Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Whitehouse: Per your request, the Department \n     of Justice (the Department) has examined the draft bill \n     entitled ``To improve Title 18 of the United States Code''. \n     The Department strongly supports early introduction and \n     consideration of the proposed legislation ``[t]o improve \n     title 18 of the United States Code'' which clarifies \n     procedures for executing and fulfilling foreign requests for \n     evidence. We firmly believe this legislation will facilitate \n     the ability of the United States to assist foreign \n     investigations, prosecutions and related proceedings \n     involving organized crime, trafficking in child pornography, \n     intellectual property violations, identity theft, and all \n     other serious crimes. The ability of the United States to \n     assist foreign authorities to obtain evidence and other \n     assistance in an effective and timely manner will improve \n     reciprocal treatment when we seek assistance in foreign \n     countries in all types of U.S. criminal investigations. Thus, \n     facilitating our ability to provide assistance to foreign \n     investigators has a direct impact on the safety and security \n     of Americans.\n       The proposed legislation will complement the existing \n     authority in current statutes and self-executing Mutual Legal \n     Assistance Treaties and multilateral conventions. It will \n     greatly facilitate the ability of the U.S. government to meet \n     its obligations under these valuable international \n     instruments and will ensure that we can provide, at our \n     discretion, similar assistance to our non-treaty foreign law \n     enforcement partners. In addition, the filing provision of \n     the new section 3512 will permit the U.S. government to \n     execute foreign assistance requests with greater efficiency \n     than at present, thereby contributing to the effective \n     administration of the federal courts and the Offices of the \n     United States Attorneys.\n       The statutes that currently govern the obtaining of \n     electronic and other evidence based upon a foreign request \n     for evidence have two limitations. First, existing law does \n     not make it clear which district court can participate in \n     fulfilling legitimate foreign requests for assistance in \n     criminal and terrorism investigations. The sole statute \n     regarding international requests for evidence is 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1782, which was designed essentially to accommodate the \n     execution of letters rogatory in civil cases via the issuance \n     of subpoenas. Under the statute, the Department is largely \n     relegated to civil practice rules that require prosecutors to \n     file in every district in which evidence or a witness may be \n     found. In complex cases, this inefficiency means involving \n     several U.S. Attorneys' Offices and District Courts in a \n     single case. Even in less complex cases, referring the \n     requests out to the field wastes scarce attorney resources \n     and creates delays.\n       Second, in 2001, Congress changed the wording of 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2703 in a way that inadvertently introduced confusion in \n     routine mutual legal assistance cases. For example, section \n     2703(a) requires that the court issuing a search warrant for \n     stored electronic evidence have ``jurisdiction over the \n     offense''. As a U.S. court often has no jurisdiction to try a \n     foreign offender, the wording of 2703(a) needlessly \n     complicates the use of this sort of court process.\n       The proposed legislation addresses both of these \n     difficulties by clarifying which courts have jurisdiction and \n     can respond to appropriate foreign requests for evidence in \n     criminal investigations. Under this proposal, a legitimate \n     request for assistance can be filed in the District of \n     Columbia, in any of the districts in which any of several \n     records or witnesses are located, or in any district in which \n     there is a related federal criminal case. The proposal would \n     clarify the ambiguity in section 2703 by re-articulating the \n     bases for courts to act without changing any of the \n     procedural safeguards present in U.S. law.\n       We note that the proposed legislation would not in any way \n     change the existing standards that the government must meet \n     in order to obtain evidence, nor would it alter any existing \n     safeguards on the proper exercise of such authority. \n     Moreover, it would not expand the nature or kind of \n     assistance the Department provides to foreign law enforcement \n     agencies. Indeed, the proposed legislation would not alter \n     U.S. obligations or authorities under existing bilateral and \n     multilateral law enforcement treaties. Instead, by \n     streamlining procedures, the amendment would eliminate \n     needless confusion and wasted time in the government's \n     response to those requests.\n       The proposed legislation references ``provider of \n     electronic communication service''. The current reference, \n     however, fails to address the presence of wire services, \n     though 18 U.S.C. 3124(a), (b) references ``provider of wire \n     or electronic service''. To provide consistency throughout \n     Title 18, United States Code, and to cover more fully the \n     providers involved, the Department recommends adding ``wire \n     or'' before ``electronic communication service'' each place \n     it appears.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed \n     legislation. The Office of Management and Budget has advised \n     that there is no objection from the standpoint of the \n     Administration's program to the submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  M. Faith Burton,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself, Mr. Grassley, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1292. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to provide for \ntake-back disposal of controlled substances in certain instances, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenator Klobuchar, and Senator Feinstein, in introducing the Secure and \nResponsible Drug Disposal Act of 2009. The abuse of prescription \nnarcotics such as pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and \nsedatives is currently the fastest growing drug abuse trend in the \ncountry. According to the most recent National Survey of Drug Use and \nHealth, NSDUH, nearly 7 million people have admitted to using \ncontrolled substances without a doctor's prescription. People between \nthe ages of 12 and 25 are the most common group to abuse these drugs. \nHowever, more and more people are dying because of this abuse. The \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention report that the \nunintentional deaths involving prescription narcotics increased 117 \npercent from the years 2001 to 2005. These are statistics that can no \nlonger be ignored.\n  Millions of Americans are prescribed controlled substances every year \nto treat a variety of symptoms due to injury, depression, insomnia, and \nother conditions. Many legitimate users of these drugs often do not \nfinish their prescriptions. As a result, these drugs remain in the \nfamily medicine cabinet for months or years because people forget about \nthem or do not know how to properly dispose of them. However, these \ndrugs, when not properly used or administered, are just as addictive \nand deadly as street drugs like methamphetamine or cocaine.\n  According to the NSDUH, more than half of the people who abuse \nprescription narcotics reported that they obtained controlled \nsubstances from a friend or relative or from the family medicine \ncabinet. As a result, most community anti-drug coalitions, public \nhealth officials, and law enforcement officials have been encouraging \npeople within their communities to dispose of old or unused medications \nin an effort to combat this growing trend.\n  Despite these ongoing efforts across the country to eliminate a \nprimary source of prescription narcotics from within their communities, \nmany people are finding the Controlled Substances\n\n[[Page S6811]]\n\nAct, CSA, is making these efforts difficult. When the CSA was passed in \nthe early 1970's many people did not anticipate the large amount of \nprescription narcotics that would be used today or the high potential \nfor these drugs to be diverted and abused. Under the CSA, most people \nwho legally possess controlled substances cannot legally transfer them \nto anyone for any purpose, including for the purpose of disposal. \nBecause the legal method for disposal is unclear, communities \ninterested in providing citizens with an easy process of disposal \nhesitate to do so or risk violation of the CSA to offer the service. We \nneed to change the CSA so that unused controlled substances do not get \ndiverted in to the stream of illicit drug use and to prevent potential \nenvironmental harms, as many people dispose of controlled substances by \nflushing them down the toilet or dumping them in unlined landfills.\n  Accordingly, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Feinstein and I are \nintroducing the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2009 to fix \nthe CSA so these efforts to eradicate abuse are not impeded by federal \nlaw. This legislation will amend the CSA to allow a user to transfer \nunused controlled substances to a DEA sanctioned entity for disposal \nwithout mandating any specific method of disposal upon communities. \nThis will enable communities to develop methods of disposal best suited \nfor their areas while minimizing the pollution of water supplies or \nincreasing the chances that these drugs will be diverted for abuse. \nSince most long-term care facilities store large amounts of \nprescription narcotics for their tenants but are unable to legally \ndispose of them the bill also enables these facilities to dispose of \nold medication on behalf of their past and current patients.\n  This legislation will not cost the government any money to implement \nand would not place any financial burden on states or industries. It \nsimp ives local communities the option to safely dispose of unused \ncontrolled substances. I am pleased that the Department of Justice has \nendorsed this legislation. They and many others out there know how \nserious the abuse of prescription narcotics has become in this country. \nNow is the time to act, and I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting the Safe and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2009.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNET (for himself, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 1293. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to improve automatic enrollment procedures for the national school \nlunch and school breakfast programs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with \nSenators Brown of Ohio and Casey of Pennsylvania called the Enhancing \nChild Health with Automatic Enrollment for School Meals Act. We wrote \nthis legislation because too many kids across this country are not \ngetting the free school meals their families are qualified to receive. \nAs members of the Agriculture Committee's subcommittee on Nutrition, \nSenators Brown, Casey and I share an interest in eradicating childhood \nhunger and increasing the efficiency of the National School Lunch and \nBreakfast programs.\n  Our bill builds on the foundation laid during the 2004 child \nnutrition reauthorization which included a mandatory phase-in of an \nautomatic enrollment process called `direct certification.' Our bill \nstipulates that schools, districts, and states must directly certify at \nleast 95 percent of children who can be enrolled in the national school \nlunch and breakfast programs using this method. The intent of this \nprovision is to modernize the enrollment process by reducing reliance \non paper applications and to improve access to school meal programs by \nensuring kids who should be receiving free school meals actually \nreceive them.\n  Because we want to reward achievement and encourage improvements to \nthe school meal enrollment process, our bill includes performance \nawards for the five states which make the best use of direct \ncertification and for the five states which show the most improvement \nfrom one school year to the next. Additionally, our bill requires \nstates which are unable to meet the 95 percent standard to submit a \nreport to Congress and the U.S. Department of Agriculture that \nidentifies the challenges prohibiting effective use of direct \ncertification and maps out a plan for improvement.\n  As former Superintendent of Denver Public Schools I cannot stress \nenough the importance of reducing red tape and administrative costs in \nschools. We cannot expect our children to focus on fractions when their \nstomachs are growling nor can we expect teachers, principals and school \nadministrators to prepare our children to be tomorrow's leaders if they \nare spending their time filling out paperwork. That's why modernizing \nthe National School Lunch and Breakfast programs is one of my top \npriorities for the child nutrition reauthorization this Fall and that \nis why I am introducing this bill today.\n  Two additional provisions in the bill would eliminate paperwork and \nimprove the existing system of determining whether or not kids qualify \nfor free meals. The first is a clarification that sending a letter in \nthe mail to a child's household letting them know they are eligible for \nfree school meals is not an acceptable means of direct certification. A \nchild who can be enrolled for free school meals automatically should be \nenrolled without any action on behalf of the child's household. We make \nthis clarification because a vast number of paper notifications sent to \nfamilies are not returned and, therefore, kids miss out on meals they \nshould receive.\n  The second is a request for a study from the U.S. Department of \nEducation that would help determine how data the Department of \nEducation is currently collecting is being used currently and could be \nused in the future to ensure all kids who should receive free school \nmeals are provided those meals.\n  Initially, Senators Brown, Casey and I were working on ways to expand \naccess to free school meals independently, but now we are working \ncollaboratively. Meeting President Obama's goal of ending childhood \nhunger by 2015 will require all hands on deck. Last week Senator Casey, \nalong with Senator Specter and myself, introduced the Paperless \nEnrollment for School Meals Act to make it easier for schools and \ndistricts to serve free meals to all children. The bill we are \nintroducing today is yet another installment in the ongoing dialog with \nChairman Harkin, members of the Agriculture Committee and the USDA in \npreparation for reauthorizing child nutrition and WIC programs in the \ncoming months.\n  In Colorado and around the nation there is a renewed call for common \nsense measures to improve existing programs and provide assistance to \nthose who need them most during these tough economic times. I encourage \nall Senators to do right by our children and support this legislation \nand the principles of the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs \nSenators Brown, Casey and I have outlined.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1293\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ncover transitional care services to improve the quality and cost \neffectiveness of care under the Medicare program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nTransitional Care Act of 2009. Time and again, we have heard that our \nhealth care system is not working. Costs are too high, outcomes too \npoor and access too limited. I agree with so many of my colleagues that \nwe need to work together to ensure that all Americans have access to \nquality and affordable health care.\n  Everyone deserves stable health care coverage that they can count on, \nregardless of the job they hold or the curveballs life may throw. All \nAmericans should be able to count on insurance premiums and deductibles \nthat will not continue to rise and eat away more and more of our \npaychecks. Finally, all Americans deserve stable care that lets you \nkeep your doctor, and your health care plan, that you trust and with \nwhom you have built a relationship.\n  Let me be clear: health care costs are too high. Every day in New \nHampshire and across our country, families are struggling with the \ncrushing cost of health care that threatens their financial stability, \nleaving them exposed to higher premiums and deductibles, and putting \nthem at risk for a possible loss of health insurance coverage and even \nbankruptcy. In 2007 our Nation spent $2.2 trillion--or 16.2 percent of \nthe GDP on health care. This is twice the average of other developed \nnations. As a Nation, our health outcomes are no better. We still lag \nbehind other countries when it comes to efficiency, access, patient \nsafety and adoption of information technology.\n  It is essential that we cut our Nation's health care costs and \nimprove the quality of care our patients receive.\n  I rise today to offer a solution that can help address this crisis. I \nrise to introduce the Medicare Transitional Care Act of 2009--\nlegislation that will reduce costly hospital readmissions, improve \nMedicare patients' care and cut Medicare costs. I thank Representative \nBlumenauer and Representative Boustany for their leadership on this \nissue in the House and I am pleased to be joined by colleagues, Senator \nCollins, and Senator Lincoln, in introducing this legislation.\n  This bill is about reducing costs and offering better support and \ncoordination of care to Medicare patients. It will help keep seniors \nwho are discharged from the hospital from going back. Simply put, it \nwill improve the health care we offer our seniors while saving money.\n  According to a report from the New England Journal of Medicine, \nalmost one third of Medicare beneficiaries discharged from the hospital \nwere re-hospitalized within 90 days. One half of the individuals re-\nhospitalized had not visited a physician since their discharge, \nindicating a lack of follow-up care. The study also estimated that in \n2004 Medicare spent $17.4 billion on unplanned re-hospitalizations. \nThis problem is costly for our government and troublesome for our \nseniors. But the good news is that this problem is avoidable.\n  Research shows that the transition from the hospital to the patient's \nnext place of care--be it home, or a nursing facility or rehabilitation \ncenter--can be complicated and risky. This is especially true for older \nindividuals with multiple chronic illnesses. These patients talk about \nthe difficulty remembering instructions, confusion over correct use of \nmedications, and general uncertainty about their own conditions.\n\n  For example, take Michael, a 71-year-old patient who lives with his \n73-year-old wife, and has diabetes. Michael had a knee replacement that \nrequired two surgical revisions. He uses a walker and has been \nhospitalized four times. He says ``they would discharge me and the same \nday I'd be back in the ER. The wound would burst apart.'' Under this \nlegislation, a transitional care clinician could be there to help make \nsure that Michael and his wife do not need to go back to the hospital.\n  Let me also tell you about Bill. Over time, Bill has endured a heart \nattack that required open heart surgery, angioplasty with stent \nplacement, stroke, kidney disease, HIV and depression. He has been \nhospitalized three times, underwent rehabilitation therapy in an \ninpatient facility once and lives alone. He says ``there was no help at \nhome [after surgery]. My mother\n\n[[Page S6813]]\n\ncame and took care of household stuff. I was flat on my back for two \nweeks. The hospital called to make sure I was okay--`Hey how are you \ndoing?'--but what could they do?'' Bill also notes the difficulty he \nhad with discharge instructions: ``By the time I'm home,'' he says, ``I \ndon't remember what the doctor said. Sometimes they write it down, but \nI have comprehension problems.''\n  Stories like Bill's and Michael's demonstrate that patients need \nsupport and assistance to manage their health needs along with their \ncaregivers. This legislation provides that opportunity.\n  Under the Medicare Transitional Care Act, a transitional care \nclinician would help ensure that appropriate follow-up care is provided \nto patients during the vulnerable time after discharge from a \nhospital--and help ensure that they are not re-hospitalized \nunnecessarily.\n  The benefit would be phased-in and provided first for the most at-\nrisk individuals. It will be tailored to their needs. It may be as \nsimple as making sure each patient understands how and when to take \ntheir medication; or helping to make sure they schedule and are able to \nget to follow-up appointments with the doctors, or it may be helping \npatients and caregivers coordinate support services, such as medical \nequipment, meal delivery, transportation or assistance with other daily \nactivities.\n  I am pleased that the legislation has the strong support of the AARP.\n  Proper transitional care is important not only to reduce hospital \nreadmissions, but also to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction. \nExperts estimate that this legislation could save as much as $5,000 per \nMedicare beneficiary.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass \ncomprehensive health care reform to fix our broken system. I urge them \nto join me in supporting a transitional care benefit that will support \npatients during the very vulnerable time after discharge from the \nhospital. The evidence is clear. We can implement a transitional care \noption that will save money by reducing hospital re-admisssions while \nimproving the quality of care we deliver to patients in New Hampshire \nand all across this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1295\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Transitional Care \n     Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) More than 20 percent of older Americans suffer from \n     five or more chronic conditions and these older adults \n     typically require health care services from numerous \n     providers across several care settings each year.\n       (2) Insufficient communication among older adults, family \n     caregivers, and health care providers contributes to poor \n     continuity of care, inadequate management of complex health \n     care needs, and preventable hospital admissions.\n       (3) Research suggests that family caregivers often lack the \n     knowledge, skills, and resources to effectively address the \n     complex needs of older adults coping with multiple coexisting \n     conditions.\n       (4) In 2005, health care services for Medicare \n     beneficiaries with five or more chronic conditions accounted \n     for 75 percent of total Medicare spending. The vast majority \n     of these costs were due to high rates of hospital admission \n     and readmission.\n       (5) According to Medicare claims data from 2003-2004, \n     almost one fifth (19.6 percent) of the 11,855,702 Medicare \n     beneficiaries who had been discharged from a hospital were \n     rehospitalized within 30 days, and 34.0 percent were \n     rehospitalized within 90 days.\n       (6) A New England Journal of Medicine study estimates that \n     the cost to Medicare of unplanned rehospitalizations in 2004 \n     was $17.4 billion.\n       (7) The MetLife Caregiving Cost Study demonstrates that \n     American businesses lose an estimated $34 billion each year \n     due to employees' need to care for loved ones.\n       (8) The Transitional Care Model, developed by the \n     University of Pennsylvania, is a care management strategy \n     that identifies patients' health goals, coordinates care \n     throughout acute episodes of illness, develops a streamlined \n     plan of care to prevent future hospitalizations, and prepares \n     the beneficiary and family caregivers to implement this care \n     plan.\n       (9) The major goal of the Transitional Care Model is to \n     interrupt cycles of avoidable hospitalizations and promote \n     longer-term positive health outcomes.\n       (10) The Transitional Care Model has shown through multiple \n     randomized clinical trials to produce significant health \n     outcome improvements, reductions in health care costs among \n     at-risk and chronically ill older adults, and increased \n     patient satisfaction.\n       (11) Preliminary results from a clinical trial of the \n     Guided Care Model (based on a Medical Home which includes \n     transitional care) demonstrated reductions in hospital days, \n     skilled nursing facility days, and home health episodes, as \n     well as preliminary findings of net savings.\n       (12) A clinical trial of the Care Transitions Intervention \n     demonstrated lower re-hospitalization rates and lower \n     hospital costs per patient.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage guaranteed lifetime income payments from annuities and \nsimilar payments of life insurance proceeds at dates later than death \nby excluding from income a portion of such payments; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my friend and \nFinance Committee colleague, Senator Pat Roberts from Kansas, in \nintroducing legislation that can help Americans enjoy a more secure \nretirement. In these economically challenging\n\n[[Page S6815]]\n\ntimes, financial security--especially during retirement--can be a \nfrustrating and elusive goal. In retirement, the chief anxiety for most \npeople is protecting the savings they have accumulated while working \nand deciding how best to manage those assets.\n  In 21st century America, there is another crucial challenge for \nretirees. The good news is that Americans are living longer, but it \nalso means that people have to plan for a longer period of retirement. \nA successful long-term retirement income plan is difficult even in a \nbullish market. How much more difficult is this task in today's \nmarket--particularly for the millions of Americans with limited \ninvestment experience?\n  We believe in encouraging people to save for retirement. Through the \ntax code, we encourage asset-building through home ownership. We \nprovide significant tax incentives for employer-based pension plans and \nfor retirement savings programs by individuals, such as IRAs and 401(k) \nplans.\n  One of the biggest threats to retirement income security for baby \nboomers is their own longevity. It will not be easy to manage their \naccumulated assets so that they will last a lifetime. Unprecedented \nnumbers of Americans are now living into their 90s and even past 100. \nConsequently, people are going to spend more time in retirement than \nprevious generations.\n  Now our society is witnessing the beginning of the retirement wave we \nknew was already building. Before it recedes, 77 million baby boomers \nwill have entered their retirement years. Many of them will not have \nthe guaranteed monthly retirement checks that many of their parents \nenjoyed as a result of employer-based pension plans. Traditional \ndefined benefit pension plans have given way to defined contribution \nplans, which have shifted the retirement income security risk from the \nemployer to the individual.\n  Of course, there are still many Americans who have no access at all \nto employer-provided pension plans. Some have never been in the \ntraditional workforce; others work in seasonal jobs or part time. In my \nstate of North Dakota, as well as in rural and farming communities \nacross America, there is an acute need for retirement vehicles that \nwill provide a secure lifetime payout. Others who could face difficulty \nin securing retirement income are widowed individuals--both men and \nwomen--who suddenly find themselves having to make a life insurance \nbenefit or proceeds from the sale of a business or family home last a \nlifetime.\n  The proposal we are introducing today will provide a valuable tool \nfor helping people avoid the risk of outliving their assets. \nSpecifically, we are proposing a tax incentive to encourage Americans \nto annuitize a portion of their assets available for retirement. If \nthey annuitize--in other words, elect to receive their money from an \nannuity in a series of payments for the rest of their lives, no matter \nhow long that may be--they would be able to exclude from income 50 \npercent of the annuity benefit that represents the accumulation in the \nannuity above and beyond the original investment. The exclusion would \nbe capped at $20,000, indexed, to ensure that tax sheltering activity \nis not encouraged and that the incentive will be effective for people \nwho would benefit most from securing a lifetime income stream.\n  This proposal we offer today would apply only to life-contingent, \nnon-qualified annuities. A life-contingent annuity that is subsequently \nmodified to a fixed-term payout would be subject to a recapture tax.\n  Baby boomers represent an unprecedented challenge to our retirement \nsecurity policies. They should have a wide range of options available \nfor responsible retirement planning. Our proposal focuses on non-\nqualified annuities because it is important to have this option \nconsidered as part of the larger retirement income security debate that \nCongress should have before baby boomers begin retiring in large \nnumbers. Options for making qualified plans more secure should be part \nof that debate as well.\n  I hope that Congress will tackle this matter promptly because over \nthe last few years too many people have seen their retirement savings \nseverely eroded. This legislation will provide an important incentive \nto help them preserve what they have.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1297\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

McCONNELL:\n  S. 1302. A bill to provide for the introduction of pay-for-\nperformance compensation mechanisms into contracts of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs with community-based outpatient clinics for the \nprovisions of health care services, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans \nHealth Care Improvement Act of 2009.\n  As we all know, the Department of Veterans Affairs strives to provide \nthe best possible health care for our nation's heroes. However, it has \ncome to my attention that the quality of care provided to our nation's \nveterans has been inconsistent among community-based outpatient \nclinics. Some of these clinics, including two in my home state of \nKentucky, are operated by private health care providers under VA \ncontracts. These VA-contracted health care providers are compensated \nfor their work at community-based outpatient clinics on a capitated \nbasis, which means they are essentially paid based on how many new \nveterans they see during a pay period. These firms are therefore \nrewarded for the number of veterans they sign up, not for the quality \nof treatment provided to our veterans. I am concerned this provides \ncontractors with the wrong incentives. Contracted health care providers \nshould have the incentive to provide the best possible care for \nveterans, not simply get as many veterans as possible through the door \nonce.\n  As a result of the capitated system, it has been reported that too \nmany of our nation's heroes have faced difficulties at these clinics in \nscheduling appointments, have suffered from neglect or have received \nsubstandard health care. This occurred under the last administration \nand I am concerned it may be continuing in the current one.\n  As such, I am introducing the Veterans Health Care Improvement Act of \n2009, which attempts to fix the way VA-contracted health care providers \nare compensated at clinics. This bill would require the VA to begin to \nintroduce a pay-for-performance compensation plan for contractors, \nthereby gradually incentivizing a higher quality of care for veterans \nseen at privately-administered community-based outpatient clinics.\n  This bill gives the VA the flexibility to begin to implement such a \nsystem through a pilot program and leaves the VA the discretion as to \nhow to adopt and best implement the pay-for-performance standards. In \nthis respect, the bill defers to the VA on how to execute these \nchanges. It is my hope that my colleagues will support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S6817]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1302\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Health Care \n     Improvement Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Veterans of the Armed Forces have made tremendous \n     sacrifices in the defense of freedom and liberty.\n       (2) Congress recognizes these great sacrifices and \n     reaffirms America's strong commitment to its veterans.\n       (3) As part of the on-going congressional effort to \n     recognize the sacrifices made by America's veterans, Congress \n     has dramatically increased funding for the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs for veterans health care in the years since \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (4) Part of the funding for the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs for veterans health care is allocated toward \n     community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs).\n       (5) Many CBOCs are administered by private contractors.\n       (6) CBOCs administered by private contractors operate on a \n     capitated basis.\n       (7) Some current contracts for CBOCs may create an \n     incentive for contractors to sign up as many veterans as \n     possible, without ensuring timely access to high quality \n     health care for such veterans.\n       (8) The top priorities for CBOCs should be to provide \n     quality health care and patient satisfaction for America's \n     veterans.\n       (9) The Department of Veterans Affairs currently tracks the \n     quality of patient care through its Computerized Patient \n     Record System. However, fees paid to contractors are not \n     currently adjusted automatically to reflect the quality of \n     care provided to patients.\n       (10) A pay-for-performance payment model offers a promising \n     approach to health care delivery by aligning the payment of \n     fees to contractors with the achievement of better health \n     outcomes for patients.\n       (11) The Department of Veterans Affairs should begin to \n     emphasize pay-for-performance in its contracts with CBOCs.\n\n     SEC. 3. PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE UNDER DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS CONTRACTS WITH COMMUNITY-BASED \n                   OUTPATIENT HEALTH CARE CLINICS.\n\n       (a) Plan Required.--Not later than one year after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs shall submit to Congress a plan to introduce pay-for-\n     performance measures into contracts which compensate \n     contractors of the Department of Veterans Affairs for the \n     provision of health care services through community-based \n     outpatient clinics (CBOCs).\n       (b) Elements.--The plan required by subsection (a) shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) Measures to ensure that contracts of the Department for \n     the provision of health care services through CBOCs begin to \n     utilize pay-for-performance compensation mechanisms for \n     compensating contractors for the provision of such services \n     through such clinics, including mechanisms as follows:\n       (A) To provide incentives for clinics that provide high-\n     quality health care.\n       (B) To provide incentives to better assure patient \n     satisfaction.\n       (C) To impose penalties (including termination of contract) \n     for clinics that provide substandard care.\n       (2) Mechanisms to collect and evaluate data on the outcomes \n     of the services generally provided by CBOCs in order to \n     provide for an assessment of the quality of health care \n     provided by such clinics.\n       (3) Mechanisms to eliminate abuses in the provision of \n     health care services by CBOCs under contracts that continue \n     to utilize capitated-basis compensation mechanisms for \n     compensating contractors.\n       (4) Mechanisms to ensure that veterans are not denied care \n     or face undue delays in receiving care.\n       (c) Implementation.--The Secretary shall commence the \n     implementation of the plan required by subsection (a) unless \n     Congress enacts an Act, not later than 60 days after the date \n     of the submittal of the plan, prohibiting or modifying \n     implementation of the plan. In implementing the plan, the \n     Secretary may initially carry out one or more pilot programs \n     to assess the feasability and advisability of mechanisms \n     under the plan.\n       (d) Reports.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act and every 180 days thereafter, the \n     Secretary shall submit to Congress a report setting forth the \n     recommendations of the Secretary as to the feasability and \n     advisability of utilizing pay-for-performance compensation \n     mechanisms in the provision of health care services by the \n     Department by means in addition to CBOCs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6817-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6817-S6818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 189--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nTRIAL BY THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT OF BUSINESSMEN MIKHAIL KHODORKOVSKY AND \n PLATON LEBEDEV CONSTITUTES A POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED CASE OF SELECTIVE \n  ARREST AND PROSECUTION THAT SERVES AS A TEST OF THE RULE OF LAW AND \n             INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF RUSSIA\n\n  Mr. WICKER (for himself and Mr. Cardin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 189\n\n       Whereas on April 1, 2009, President Barack Obama and \n     President Dmitry Medvedev issued a joint statement affirming \n     that ``[i]n our relations with each other, we also seek to be \n     guided by the rule of law, respect for fundamental freedoms \n     and human rights, and tolerance for different views'';\n       Whereas the United States and Russia, in a spirit of \n     cooperation, will continue the dialogue on the issues \n     affirmed in such joint statement at an upcoming summit to be \n     held in June 2009;\n       Whereas it has been the long-held position of the United \n     States to support the development of democracy, rule of law, \n     judicial independence, freedom, and respect for human rights \n     in the Russian Federation;\n       Whereas Russian President Medvedev has called Russia a \n     country of ``legal nihilism'' and issued a new foreign policy \n     doctrine citing ``the supremacy of law in international \n     relations'' as one of the top priorities of Russia;\n       Whereas 2 prominent cases involve the Yukos Oil Company and \n     its president, Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his partner, Platon \n     Lebedev, who were convicted and sentenced in May 2005 to \n     serve 9 years in a remote penal camp;\n       Whereas Russian authorities confiscated Yukos assets and \n     assigned ownership to a state company that is chaired by an \n     official in the Kremlin; harassed, exiled, persecuted, and \n     imprisoned many Yukos officers and legal representatives; and \n     issued a series of court rulings against Mr. Khodorkovsky and \n     Mr. Lebedev that violate international legal norms;\n       Whereas at a press conference in May 2005, President George \n     Bush stated, ``it appeared to . . . people in my \n     Administration, that . . . [Mikhail Khodorkovsky] had been \n     judged guilty prior to having a fair trial. In other words, \n     he was put in prison, and then was tried'';\n       Whereas on October 25, 2005, Congressmen Roger Wicker and \n     Tom Lantos introduced H. Res. 525, which noted the actions \n     that the Russian government had taken with respect to Yukos, \n     Mr. Khodorkovsky, and Mr. Lebedev, and called upon Russian \n     authorities to prove that the cases were not politically \n     motivated, that the Russian judicial system is truly \n     independent and not simply an instrument of the Kremlin, and \n     that the state was not engaged in a campaign to selectively \n     reclaim or re-nationalize private enterprises;\n       Whereas on November 18, 2005, Senators Joe Biden, Barack \n     Obama, and John McCain introduced S. Res. 322, which called \n     the cases against Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev \n     ``politically motivated'', noted that Mr. Khodorkovsky and \n     Mr. Lebedev had not been accorded fair, transparent, and \n     impartial treatment, and deplored their transfer to remote \n     prison camps;\n       Whereas Amnesty International, Freedom House, and other \n     prominent international human rights organizations have cited \n     the conviction and imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky as \n     evidence of the arbitrary and political use of the legal \n     system and the lack of a truly independent judiciary in the \n     Russian Federation;\n       Whereas governments, courts, journalists, and human rights \n     organizations around the world have expressed concern about \n     the prosecution, trial, imprisonment, and treatment of the \n     individuals in the Yukos case, and have called on President \n     Medvedev to honor his pledge to end ``legal nihilism'' in \n     Russia;\n       Whereas on February 5, 2007, on the eve of their \n     eligibility for parole, Russian prosecutors brought new \n     charges against Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev, accusing \n     them of embezzling $20,000,000,000 in Yukos oil revenues;\n       Whereas in May 2007 the Prosecutor General in Moscow \n     attempted to disbar Karinna Moskalenko, one of Russia's most \n     distinguished and renown human rights lawyers and defense \n     counsel to Mikhail Khodorkovsky, in apparent reprisal for \n     actions she had taken on behalf of her client;\n       Whereas in August 2007 the highest court of Switzerland \n     denied Russian authorities access to Yukos documents on the \n     basis that the case against Yukos and its principal \n     executives and core shareholders, specifically Mikhail \n     Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, had a ``political and \n     discriminatory character. . .undermined by the infringement \n     of human rights and the right to defense'';\n       Whereas courts in Great Britain, the Netherlands, Cyprus, \n     Liechtenstein, Lithuania, and Switzerland have described the \n     Yukos proceeding as politically motivated and have rejected \n     motions from Russian prosecutors seeking the extradition of \n     Yukos officials or materials for use in trials in Russia;\n       Whereas on October 25, 2007, the European Court of Human \n     Rights ruled that Platon Lebedev's rights to liberty and \n     security were violated during his arrest and subsequent \n     pretrial detention;\n       Whereas the 2008 Department of State Human Rights Report \n     stated: ``The arrest and conviction of Khodorkovsky raised \n     concerns about the right to due process and the\n\n[[Page S6818]]\n\n     rule of law, including the independence of courts and the \n     lack of a predictable tax regime.'';\n       Whereas on March 13, 2008, the European Parliament issued a \n     resolution calling on the Russian President to ``review the \n     treatment of imprisoned public figures (among them Mikhail \n     Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev), whose imprisonment has been \n     assessed by most observers as having been politically \n     motivated'';\n       Whereas in July 2008, President Dmitry Medvedev said it was \n     essential that Russia ``take all necessary means to \n     strengthen the independence of judges'' since ``it goes \n     without saying that pressure is applied, influence is \n     exerted, and direct bribery is often used'';\n       Whereas on August 22, 2008, Mikhail Khodorkovsky was denied \n     parole on the grounds that he refused to take part in \n     vocational training in sewing and that he allegedly failed to \n     keep his hands behind his back during a jail walk;\n       Whereas on October 25, 2008, the State Department issued a \n     statement marking the fifth anniversary of Mikhail \n     Khodorkovsky's arrest, stating ``the conduct of the cases \n     against Khodorkovsky and his associates has eroded Russia's \n     reputation and public confidence in Russian legal and \n     judicial institutions'';\n       Whereas on December 22, 2008, the European Court of Human \n     Rights ordered the release of the terminally ill former Yukos \n     oil executive Vasily Aleksanyan, who had been held in \n     detention since April 6, 2006, despite repeated orders by the \n     European Court that Mr. Aleksanyan be treated in a humane \n     fashion for cancer and AIDS;\n       Whereas in February 2009, Andrei Illarianov, former chief \n     economic advisor to President Vladimir Putin, stated that \n     ``[o]ne of the best known political prisoners is Mikhail \n     Khodorkovsky who has been sentenced to 9 years in the \n

which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 191\n\n       Whereas the incidence of prostate cancer in African-\n     American men is 60 percent higher than in any other racial or \n     ethnic group in the United States;\n       Whereas African-American men have the highest mortality \n     rate of any ethnic and racial group in the United States, \n     dying at a rate that is 140 percent higher than other ethnic \n     and racial groups;\n       Whereas that rate of mortality represents the largest \n     disparity of mortality rates in any of the major cancers;\n       Whereas prostate cancer can be cured with early detection \n     and the proper treatment, regardless of the ethnic or racial \n     group of the cancer patient;\n       Whereas African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed \n     at an earlier age and at a later stage of cancer progression \n     than all other ethnic and racial groups, thereby leading to \n     lower cure rates and lower chances of survival; and\n       Whereas according to a paper published in the Proceedings \n     of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from the \n     Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School have \n     discovered a variant of a small segment of the human genome \n     that accounts for the higher risk of prostate cancer in \n     African-American men: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that prostate cancer has created a health \n     crisis for African-American men; and\n       (2) urges Federal agencies to designate additional funds \n     for--\n       (A) research to address and attempt to end the health \n     crisis created by prostate cancer; and\n       (B) efforts relating to education, awareness, and early \n     detection at the grassroots level to end that health crisis.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to celebrate \nFather's Day by cosponsoring a Senate resolution supporting men's \nhealth by recognizing that the occurrence of prostate cancer in African \nAmerican men has reached epidemic proportions. The resolution also \nurges Federal agencies to address the health crisis by designating \nfunds for education, awareness outreach, and research specifically \nfocused on how prostate cancer affects African-American men.\n  Prostate cancer affects thousands of American men each year and is \ncurrently the second leading cause of cancer related deaths. This \ncancer strikes 1 in every 6 men, making it even more prevalent than \nbreast cancer, which strikes 1 in every 7 women. Last year alone more \nthan 186,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than \n28,000 men died from the disease.\n  The incidence rate or African-Americans is 60 percent higher than any \nother racial or ethnic group in the U.S. African-Americans are more \nlikely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage and thus have higher \nmortality rates than any other group.\n  That is why the Resolution recognizes prostate cancer's prevalence \nand debilitative impact within all communities, but especially for \nAfrican-Americans, and urges Federal agencies to direct funds toward \nefforts to address this particular population.\n  Senators Cardin, Burris, Landrieu and Boxer join me in introducing \nthis resolution. Congress must take the lead in fighting prostate \ncancer. I hope all of my colleagues can support this resolution, as it \ncalls for better education and research that will ensure the health of \nour Nation's fathers, brothers, and sons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/18/senate-section/article/S6819-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6819-S6820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 192--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \nSUPPORTING DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN MONGOLIA AND EXPANDING \n            RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MONGOLIA\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Webb, and Ms. Murkowski) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 153\n\n       Whereas many Eastern European countries were dominated for \n     parts of the last century by Nazi or Communist regimes, \n     without the consent of their people;\n       Whereas victims under the Nazi regime included individuals \n     persecuted or targeted for persecution by the Nazi or Nazi-\n     allied governments based on their religious, ethnic, or \n     cultural identity, as well as their political beliefs, sexual \n     orientation, or disability;\n       Whereas the Nazi regime and the authoritarian and \n     totalitarian regimes that emerged in Eastern Europe after \n     World War II perpetuated the wrongful and unjust confiscation \n     of property belonging to the victims of Nazi persecution, \n     including real property, personal property, and financial \n     assets;\n       Whereas communal and religious property was an early target \n     of the Nazi regime and, by expropriating churches, synagogues \n     and other community-controlled property, the Nazis denied \n     religious communities the temporal facilities that held those \n     communities together;\n       Whereas after World War II, Communist regimes expanded the \n     systematic expropriation of communal and religious property \n     in an effort to eliminate the influence of religion;\n       Whereas many insurance companies that issued policies in \n     pre-World War II Eastern Europe were nationalized or had \n     their subsidiary assets nationalized by Communist regimes;\n       Whereas such nationalized companies and those with \n     nationalized subsidiaries have generally not paid the \n     proceeds or compensation due on pre-war policies, because \n     control of those companies or their Eastern European \n     subsidiaries had passed to their respective governments;\n       Whereas Eastern European countries involved in these \n     nationalizations have not participated in a compensation \n     process for Holocaust-era insurance policies for victims of \n     Nazi persecution;\n       Whereas the protection of and respect for private property \n     rights is a basic principle for all democratic governments \n     that operate according to the rule of law;\n       Whereas the rule of law and democratic norms require that \n     the activity of governments and their administrative agencies \n     be exercised in accordance with the laws passed by their \n     parliaments or legislatures, and such laws themselves must be \n     consistent with international human rights standards;\n\n[[Page S6825]]\n\n       Whereas in July 2001, the Paris Declaration of the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     Parliamentary Assembly noted that the process of restitution, \n     compensation, and material reparation of victims of Nazi \n     persecution has not been pursued with the same degree of \n     comprehensiveness by all of the OSCE participating states;\n       Whereas the OSCE participating states have agreed to \n     achieve or maintain full recognition and protection of all \n     types of property, including private property and the right \n     to prompt, just, and effective compensation for private \n     property that is taken for public use;\n       Whereas the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has called on the \n     participating states to ensure that they implement \n     appropriate legislation to secure the restitution of or \n     compensation for property losses of victims of Nazi \n     persecution, including communal organizations and \n     institutions, irrespective of the current citizenship or \n     place of residence of the victims, their heirs, or the \n     relevant successors to communal property;\n       Whereas Congress passed resolutions in the 104th and 105th \n     Congresses that emphasized the longstanding support of the \n     United States for the restitution of or compensation for \n     property wrongly confiscated during the Nazi and Communist \n     eras;\n       Whereas certain post-Communist countries in Europe have \n     taken steps toward compensating victims of Nazi persecution \n     whose property was confiscated by the Nazis or their allies \n     and collaborators during World War II or subsequently seized \n     by Communist governments;\n       Whereas at the 1998 Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era \n     Assets, 44 countries adopted the Principles on Nazi-\n     Confiscated Art to guide the restitution of looted artwork \n     and cultural property;\n       Whereas the Government of Lithuania has promised to adopt \n     an effective legal framework to provide for the restitution \n     of or compensation for wrongly confiscated communal property, \n     but so far has not done so;\n       Whereas successive governments in Poland have promised to \n     adopt an effective general property compensation law, but the \n     current government has yet to adopt one;\n       Whereas the legislation providing for the restitution of or \n     compensation for wrongly confiscated property in Europe has, \n     in various instances, not always been implemented in an \n     effective, transparent, and timely manner;\n       Whereas such legislation is of the utmost importance in \n     returning or compensating property wrongfully seized by \n     totalitarian or authoritarian governments to its rightful \n     owners;\n       Whereas compensation and restitution programs can never \n     bring back to Holocaust survivors what was taken from them, \n     or in any way make up for their suffering; and\n       Whereas there are Holocaust survivors, now in the twilight \n     of their lives, who are impoverished and in urgent need of \n     assistance, lacking the resources to support basic needs, \n     including adequate shelter, food, or medical care: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) appreciates the efforts of those European countries \n     that have enacted legislation for the restitution of or \n     compensation for private, communal, and religious property \n     wrongly confiscated during the Nazi or Communist eras, and \n     urges each of those countries to ensure that the legislation \n     is effectively and justly implemented;\n       (2) welcomes the efforts of many post-Communist countries \n     to address the complex and difficult question of the status \n     of confiscated properties, and urges those countries to \n     ensure that their restitution or compensation programs are \n     implemented in a timely, non-discriminatory manner;\n       (3) urges the Government of Poland and the governments of \n     other countries in Europe that have not already done so to \n     immediately enact fair, comprehensive, non-discriminatory, \n     and just legislation so that victims of Nazi persecution (or \n     the heirs or successors of such persons) who had their \n     private property looted and wrongly confiscated by the Nazis \n     during World War II and subsequently seized by a Communist \n     government are able to obtain either restitution of their \n     property or, where restitution is not possible, fair \n     compensation;\n       (4) urges the Government of Lithuania and the governments \n     of other countries in Europe that have not already done so to \n     immediately enact fair, comprehensive, non-discriminatory, \n     and just legislation so that communities that had communal \n     and religious property looted and wrongly confiscated by the \n     Nazis during World War II and subsequently seized by a \n     Communist government (or the relevant successors to such \n     property or the relevant foundations) are able to obtain \n     either restitution of their property or, where restitution is \n     not possible, fair compensation;\n       (5) urges the countries of Europe which have not already \n     done so to ensure that all such restitution and compensation \n     legislation is established in accordance with principles of \n     justice and provides a simple, transparent, and prompt \n     process, so that it results in a tangible benefit to those \n     surviving victims of Nazi persecution who suffered from the \n     unjust confiscation of their property, many of whom are well \n     into their senior years;\n       (6) calls on the President and the Secretary of State to \n     engage in an open dialogue with leaders of those countries \n     that have not already enacted such legislation to support the \n     adoption of legislation requiring the fair, comprehensive, \n     and nondiscriminatory restitution of or compensation for \n     private, communal, and religious property that was seized and \n     confiscated during the Nazi and Communist eras; and\n       (7) welcomes the decision by the Government of the Czech \n     Republic to host in June 2009 an international conference for \n     governments and non-governmental organizations to continue \n     the work done at the 1998 Washington Conference on Holocaust-\n     Era Assets, which will--\n       (A) address the issues of restitution of or compensation \n     for real property, personal property (including art and \n     cultural property), and financial assets wrongfully \n     confiscated by the Nazis or their allies and collaborators \n     and subsequently wrongfully confiscated by Communist regimes;\n       (B) review issues related to the opening of archives and \n     the work of historical commissions, review progress made, and \n     focus on the next steps required on these issues; and\n       (C) examine social welfare issues related to the needs of \n     Holocaust survivors, and identify methods and resources to \n     meet to such needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":
