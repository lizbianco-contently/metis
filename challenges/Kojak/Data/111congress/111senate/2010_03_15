Mr. President, the debate over health care continues, \nand this week all eyes are on the House. All we hear about is the arm-\ntwisting and the horse-trading going on over there behind the scenes--\nthe mad dash ahead of the big vote--and once again Americans just can't \nbelieve what they are hearing.\n  Behind all of these stories is a simple truth: Democratic leaders are \ndoing everything they can to convince a handful of lawmakers that they \nshould vote for a bill they don't really like and which their \nconstituents overwhelmingly oppose. They are scrambling to get these \nwavering House Members to vote for a bill which claims to be reform but \nwhich promises to lead to\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\nhigher health care costs, higher insurance premiums, and a vast \nexpansion of government's role in our daily lives. They are pulling out \nall the stops. They are doing everything they can to jam this bill \nthrough, and they don't even seem to care anymore about how ugly it all \nlooks.\n  What we are seeing is nothing more than a replay of the same \nrevolting process Democrats used to pass this bill in the Senate, a \nprocess that completely outraged the public. The same deals they used \nto get this bill through the Senate are back. As if voting on these \ndeals the first time wasn't bad enough, Democrats in the House are now \ngetting ready to vote for them again. Every one of the deals that were \nso revolting to the American people will still be in the bill House \nMembers are expected to vote on later this week. That means that \nanybody who votes for this bill will be voting in favor of the special \ndeals that were put there for no other reason than to sway votes.\n  A handful of Democrats have stood up in opposition to these deals and \nthis entire process. One longtime Democratic Congressman said last week \nthat he won't be voting for the bill as a result of the deals. Here is \nwhat he had to say. This Democratic Congressman said:\n\n       I reject unequivocally the unsavory deal making that took \n     place in the Senate where Nebraska, Florida, and Louisiana \n     obtained special benefits that do not apply to the other \n     States and those special benefits provided to those States at \n     the expense of the residents of all other States. I simply \n     cannot support legislation that contains those unwarranted \n     giveaways to a select few States at the expense of others.\n\n  That was a Democratic Member of the House of Representatives.\n  But others are keeping quiet. They are still on the fence. That is \nwhy this week's vote promises to be even uglier than the last one, \nbecause this bill goes beyond things such as the ``Cornhusker \nkickback'' and the ``Louisiana purchase'' and the ``Gator aid.''\n  I was disappointed to see the White House reverse itself over the \nweekend and endorse many of these sweetheart deals after the President \nsaid he would try to have them removed. Apparently, they determined \nthat removing the deals might jeopardize efforts to pass the bill. So \nnow the White House says it won't object to all of the special deals, \njust some of them. The White House says it won't object to all the \nspecial deals, just some of them. What that means, of course, is that \nsome Senators and House Members are getting special deals on top of \nspecial deals.\n  But that is not all the White House is willing to do to jam this bill \nthrough. According to press reports, it is also promising to raise \ncampaign cash for House Members who vote for the House bill. We read in \none of the papers today that the White House is openly signaling that \nthose lawmakers will go to the top of the list for fundraisers and \nPresidential visits ahead of the November elections. So if press \naccounts are accurate, lawmakers who support the bill are being told \nthey get repaid with Presidential visits and big-money fundraisers from \nthe President or the Vice President--vote for the bill and you get a \nspecial visit for your reelection campaign.\n\n  We also read this morning in the Politico Pulse that the drug \nlobbyists were here in the Capitol over the weekend huddling with \nDemocratic staffers to make sure their interests would be protected in \nthe final bill.\n  This is precisely the kind of thing Americans rebelled against after \nthe last vote on this bill. This debate should be about the substance \nof a bill that would restructure one-sixth of our economy and the \ndirection Americans want to go in as a country, not how much money \nsuch-and-such Senator or Congressman needs in order to vote for it.\n  It is especially disappointing that this particular White House is \nsupporting all this. After the ``Cornhusker kickback'' and the other \nspecial deals, the administration had an opportunity to distance itself \nfrom this process, to hit the reset button, and to work toward a bill \nAmericans could be proud of. Unfortunately, in its desperation to force \nthis bill through, the White House is reverting to the anything-goes \napproach, and the result is predictable: Americans won't like this bill \nany more than they liked the last one. They have issued their verdict \nabout this bill and this process. They don't like either one. And once \nagain, the only people who don't seem to get it are the Democrats here \nin Washington.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/15/senate-section/article/S1490-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to pick up on the comments of my \ncolleague, the Republican leader.\n  There is another distressing story in the paper today reported by the \nAssociated Press. They report that all of the special deals that last \nweek the President said he was going to try to remove from the \nlegislation, now--except for the ``Cornhusker kickback''--they are \ngoing to leave them in there because they need the votes. If that is \ncorrect, this process is even sicker than we thought it was.\n  Part of the reason for the Democratic leadership using the \nreconciliation provision to fix the Senate bill was to take all of \nthese special provisions out, but now it appears, according to the \nAssociated Press, that they are going to be kept in there because they \nneed the votes.\n  Let me detail what a couple of these are. Last week, there was a \nstory in Politico that detailed six specific items. Of course, there \nwas the ``Cornhusker kickback'' that got such bad publicity and \neverybody agreed it had to go, including the Senator who voted for the \nlegislation after he was promised that in his State there would be no \ncost for the coverage of additional Medicaid patients. Now that is \napparently going to be ``fixed,'' at great expense, I might add, to the \ntaxpayers of the United States, but apparently unfixed are six other \nitems, and there are more, by the way.\n  Quote:\n\n       ``We have defended it and we will defend it,'' said Senator \n     Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose state picked up $600 million \n     in extra Medicaid funding . . .\n\n  Again, I am quoting from a March 10 Politico story.\n  Second:\n\n       In a letter to congressional leaders last week, Obama \n     targeted the Nebraska and Florida deals for elimination. The \n     Florida provision could also shield some seniors in \n     California, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, according \n     to Senator Bill Nelson's office.\n\n  This provision deals with Medicare patients. The reason it is \nimportant to me is because there are 330,000-plus Arizona seniors who \nhave Medicare Advantage plans. These are the plans that would suffer \nunder the legislation proposed by the President. Because they would \nhave benefits they currently enjoy taken away from them, the seniors in \nall of the States are obviously complaining to their Senators. So \nDemocrats have said: Well, OK, if seniors are upset about having these \nbenefits taken away, then we will shield the seniors in our States who \nhave these Medicare Advantage policies so that they don't have to give \nup their benefits--the biggest set of beneficiaries, and there are over \n800,000 of them in the State of Florida but apparently also some in \nCalifornia, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. All right. Special \ndeal for them.\n  If this bill, by the way, is so great, why do we have to protect our \ncitizens from its provisions? But that is the way it works. However, my \nsenior citizen constituents in Arizona don't get grandfathered as do \nthose in other States. It just shows you how bad the bill policy is in \nthe area generally that you have to protect your constituents from \nsuffering the effects of the bill but also the bad policy that does \nthat to the detriment of other constituencies. Apparently, now that is \ngoing to stay in the bill.\n\n  Then there was the so-called ``Louisiana purchase,'' $300 million to \nLouisiana. Then there was the $1.1 billion\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\nin extra Medicaid funding to Massachusetts and Vermont. This Politico \narticle quotes Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont:\n\n       What I told Harry Reid is that Vermont does the right \n     thing, and I don't want Vermont to be penalized for doing the \n     right thing.\n\n  Of course, that is the kind of argument that is made in response to \nprovisions in the bill that are bad provisions because they hurt the \npeople in your State. But the solution is not to exempt your State's \nconstituents from the bad effects of the bill. Don't pass the bill. It \nis a bad bill.\n  Here is a fifth example. There is a $100 million hospital grant \nprogram requested by our colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, \n``who has acknowledged that the University of Connecticut would qualify \nfor the money.''\n  Here is a sixth one that is being promoted by the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Baucus, on behalf of the residents of Libby, \nMT.\n  There is another one not mentioned here, but I am aware of it. It \nprotects two insurance companies--Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Mutual of \nOmaha in Nebraska, again at the request of the Senator from Nebraska. I \nbelieve there is another company in the State of Wisconsin protected.\n  My point is, first, if this bill is so wonderful, why do we have to \nhave all these separate carve-outs, special deals, for Representatives \nor for constituents in the States of certain Democrats in order, \npresumably, in the House of Representatives, to help the Speaker of the \nHouse get her vote total up to where she can actually pass the bill? \nWhy don't we just fix the bill in the first place so none of these bad \neffects are visited on the constituents whom I represent, for example, \nor anybody else's constituents for that matter?\n  At a minimum, the President should follow through on his plan last \nweek to try to get these provisions out of the bill. It turns out now \nthat apparently this week, according to David Axlerod, during the \nrotations of the Sunday morning talk shows he was on, that is no longer \npart of the plan.\n  The last thing I would like to do is comment briefly on a Washington \nPost column by Robert Samuelson this morning.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na Washington Post column by Robert Samuelson.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will briefly summarize it. The President is \nvisiting in Ohio, I believe, today to highlight the case of a \nparticular Ohio resident. I believe she is a breast cancer survivor. \nHer insurance eventually became too expensive for her to keep up. She \nnow has a diagnosis of another disease, and the President is \nhighlighting this type of case. I think it is important to highlight it \nfor another reason.\n  I presume the President or the Senators or Representatives of Ohio \nare finding an alternative way to ensure she is cared for. Frequently, \nwe have constituents come to us with situations such as this. They \nrepresent very heartrending situations, problems with which you want to \ndeal. The real question is how to deal with it. The answer to her \nproblem is not to pass this health care bill. There are alternatives.\n  For example, for those who cannot get insurance that is affordable to \nthem because of preexisting conditions--Republicans have put ideas on \nthe table, as have Democrats, but that is a specific kind of problem \nthat can be solved with a specific solution rather than this entire \nhealth care bill the President is trying to sell to us.\n  What Robert Samuelson points out in his article is there are a lot of \ndifferent situations such as this, where people who are not insured \nnevertheless get care. In fact, the argument is made that we need this \nkind of health care bill because there are too many people who are \nuninsured and get expensive and ineffective treatment at the emergency \nroom. He says: ``Unfortunately it's not true.''\n  He quotes a study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that finds \nthat the insured population ``accounted for 83 percent of emergency-\nroom visits, reflecting their share of the population.'' In other \nwords, there is not a difference of who visits the emergency room and \nwho does not depending on whether you are insured.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       After Massachusetts adopted universal insurance, emergency-\n     room use remained higher than the national average, an Urban \n     Institute study found.\n\n  The point is, even after you get the so-called universal coverage, \nyou do not find any difference in terms of emergency room visits. If \nanything, with universal coverage, you had even higher emergency room \nvisits. His point is, and I quote Robert Samuelson:\n\n       If universal coverage makes appointments harder to get, \n     emergency-room use may increase.\n\n  So you are not making the problem better; if anything, you are making \nit worse. My guess is, you are not affecting it much one way or the \nother. It is simply not an argument that because people who are \nuninsured go to the emergency room, therefore, we have to pass some \nkind of nationwide health care bill such as has been suggested to us.\n  He goes on to point out:\n\n       You probably think that insuring the uninsured will \n     dramatically improve the nation's health.\n\n  He goes on to debunk that myth:\n\n       I've written before that expanding health insurance would \n     result, at best, in modest health gains.\n\n  He goes on to point out that studies have validated the fact it does \nnot make a difference one way or another.\n\n       Claims that the uninsured suffer tens of thousands of \n     premature deaths are ``open to question.'' Conceivably, the \n     ``lack of health insurance has no more impact on your health \n     than lack of flood insurance.\n\n  He goes on to detail the reasons why that is so.\n  He concludes with this point:\n\n       Though it seems compelling, covering the uninsured is not \n     the health-care system's major problem. The big problem is \n     uncontrolled spending.\n\n  That is a point Republicans have been trying to make from the very \nbeginning, to point out we ought to first focus on dealing with what is \ndriving up health care costs. That will, if we are successful, have a \npositive impact on getting people insured because it will reduce the \ncost of insurance they have to buy or their employer is buying on their \nbehalf.\n  That is what we should be focusing on rather than this rather elusive \nissue of coverage of the uninsured. To be sure, nobody is arguing we \nshould not help cover the uninsured. That is not the argument we are \nmaking. The argument we are making is, it does not justify a $2.5 \ntrillion expenditure and that, in any event, if you focus first on \ndealing with costs, you are going to reduce costs, which is a good \nthing in and of itself, and, thereby, also enhance coverage because the \ncost is less expensive.\n  Here is the penultimate paragraph in the piece. I will quote him and \nclose. What Samuelson said is the President is:\n\n     . . . telling people what they want to hear, not what they \n     need to know. Whatever their sins, insurers are mainly \n     intermediaries; they pass along the costs of the delivery \n     system. In 2009, the largest 14 insurers had profits of \n     roughly $9 billion; that approached 0.4 percent of total \n     health spending of $2.472 trillion.\n\n  Four tenths of 1 percent.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       This hardly explains high health costs. What people need to \n     know is that Obama's plan evades health care's major problems \n     and would worsen the budget outlook. It's a big new spending \n     program when government hasn't paid for the spending programs \n     it already has.\n\n  His point is, instead of trying to make insurance companies the \nvillain, the President should be honest about what their true cost is.\n  Somebody pointed out--my colleague, Lamar Alexander--if you take all \nthe profits of all the insurance companies, it pays for 2 days' worth \nof health care expenditures in the country. What about the other 363 \ndays? Nobody is defending the insurance companies, but you cannot say \nthey are responsible for the high costs of health care in this country, \nsince they are primarily just passing those costs on.\n  The bottom line is, we need to be honest and explain to the American \npeople what we are trying to accomplish or what we should be trying to \naccomplish is reducing health care costs. That will have the salutary \neffect of making access easier for people\n\n[[Page S1492]]\n\nbecause they will be able to afford the insurance that now may be \nunaffordable for them. But the idea that the insurance companies are \nthe reason we have the problem or that emergency rooms are used more \nbecause of the uninsured are two myths that are dispelled in this piece \nby Robert Samuelson.\n  I yield to my colleague from Oklahoma.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 15, 2010]\n\n                   Obama's Illusions of Cost-Control\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       ``What we need from the next president is somebody who will \n     not just tell you what they think you want to hear but will \n     tell you what you need to hear.''--Barack Obama, Feb. 27, \n     2008\n       One job of presidents is to educate Americans about crucial \n     national problems. On health care, Barack Obama has failed. \n     Almost everything you think you know about health care is \n     probably wrong or, at least, half wrong. Great simplicities \n     and distortions have been peddled in the name of achieving \n     ``universal health coverage.'' The miseducation has worsened \n     as the debate approaches its climax.\n       There's a parallel here: housing. Most Americans favor \n     homeownership, but uncritical pro-homeownership policies (lax \n     lending standards, puny down payments, hefty housing \n     subsidies) helped cause the financial crisis. The same thing \n     is happening with health care. The appeal of universal \n     insurance--who, by the way, wants to be uninsured?--justifies \n     half-truths and dubious policies. That the process is \n     repeating itself suggests that our political leaders don't \n     learn even from proximate calamities.\n       How often, for example, have you heard the emergency-room \n     argument? The uninsured, it's said, use emergency rooms for \n     primary care. That's expensive and ineffective. Once they're \n     insured, they'll have regular doctors. Care will improve; \n     costs will decline. Everyone wins. Great argument. \n     Unfortunately, it's untrue.\n       A study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that \n     the insured accounted for 83 percent of emergency-room \n     visits, reflecting their share of the population. After \n     Massachusetts adopted universal insurance, emergency-room use \n     remained higher than the national average, an Urban Institute \n     study found. More than two-fifths of visits represented non-\n     emergencies. Of those, a majority of adult respondents to a \n     survey said it was ``more convenient'' to go to the emergency \n     room or they couldn't ``get [a doctor's] appointment as soon \n     as needed.'' If universal coverage makes appointments harder \n     to get, emergency-room use may increase.\n       You probably think that insuring the uninsured will \n     dramatically improve the nation's health. The uninsured don't \n     get care or don't get it soon enough. With insurance, they \n     won't be shortchanged; they'll be healthier. Simple.\n       Think again. I've written before that expanding health \n     insurance would result, at best, in modest health gains. \n     Studies of insurance's effects on health are hard to perform. \n     Some find benefits; others don't. Medicare's introduction in \n     1966 produced no reduction in mortality; some studies of \n     extensions of Medicaid for children didn't find gains. In the \n     Atlantic recently, economics writer Megan McArdle examined \n     the literature and emerged skeptical. Claims that the \n     uninsured suffer tens of thousands of premature deaths are \n     ``open to question.'' Conceivably, the ``lack of health \n     insurance has no more impact on your health than lack of \n     flood insurance,'' she writes.\n       How could this be? No one knows, but possible explanations \n     include: (a) many uninsured are fairly healthy--about two-\n     fifths are age 18 to 34; (b) some are too sick to be helped \n     or have problems rooted in personal behaviors--smoking, diet, \n     drinking or drug abuse; and (c) the uninsured already receive \n     50 to 70 percent of the care of the insured from hospitals, \n     clinics and doctors, estimates the Congressional Budget \n     Office.\n       Though it seems compelling, covering the uninsured is not \n     the health-care system's major problem. The big problem is \n     uncontrolled spending, which prices people out of the market \n     and burdens government budgets. Obama claims his proposal \n     checks spending. Just the opposite. When people get \n     insurance, they use more health services. Spending rises. By \n     the government's latest forecast, health spending goes from \n     17 percent of the economy in 2009 to 19 percent in 2019. \n     Health ``reform'' would probably increase that.\n       Unless we change the fee-for-service system, costs will \n     remain hard to control because providers are paid more for \n     doing more. Obama might have attempted that by proposing \n     health-care vouchers (limited amounts to be spent on \n     insurance), which would force a restructuring of delivery \n     systems to compete on quality and cost. Doctors, hospitals \n     and drug companies would have to reorganize care. Obama \n     refrained from that fight and instead cast insurance \n     companies as the villains.\n       He's telling people what they want to hear, not what they \n     need to know. Whatever their sins, insurers are mainly \n     intermediaries; they pass along the costs of the delivery \n     system. In 2009, the largest 14 insurers had profits of \n     roughly $9 billion; that approached 0.4 percent of total \n     health spending of $2.472 trillion. This hardly explains high \n     health costs. What people need to know is that Obama's plan \n     evades health care's major problems and would worsen the \n     budget outlook. It's a big new spending program when \n     government hasn't paid for the spending programs it already \n     has.\n       ``If not now, when? If not us, who?'' Obama asks. The \n     answer is: It's not now, and it's not ``us.'' Pass or not, \n     Obama's proposal is the illusion of ``reform,'' not the real \n     thing.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE.

Mr. President, after weeks of the global warming \nscandal--and we talked about it on the floor, what happened with \nclimategate just prior to the Copenhagen convention--I had the \nopportunity to visit and to uncover some of the things we had suspected \nwere going on for a long period of time. Five years ago, I had occasion \nto give a speech on this floor, where I outlined, from information that \nhad come through the backdoor to me from scientists, how bad the \nscience was and how it had been, in fact, cooked. Then, of course, \nalong came climategate.\n  After weeks of the global warming scandal, the world's first \npotential climate billionaire is running for cover. Yes, I am talking \nabout Al Gore. He is under siege these days. The credibility of the \nIPCC is eroding, EPA's endangerment finding is collapsing, and belief \nthat anthropogenic global warming is leading to catastrophe is \nevaporating. Gore seems to be drowning in a sea of his own global \nwarming illusions. Nevertheless, he is desperately trying to keep \nglobal warming alarmism alive.\n  It is my understanding that tonight he is having a high-level meeting \nof all his global warming alarmists around the country to see how they \ncan resurrect this issue and regroup.\n  Consider Gore's nearly 2,000-word op-ed piece that recently appeared \nin the New York Times. It is a sure-fire sign of desperation. Gore's \npiece was about China, solar and wind power, globalization, rising sea \nlevels, big polluters, melting glaciers, and cap and trade. One \nsearches in vain for any explanation of the IPCC's errors and mistakes \nor of Phil Jones, the former director of the Climate Research Unit. \nThat is in East Anglia. We heard a lot about him. He was the one who \nwas actually assembling a lot of the science--or so-called science--or \ncreating the science, I should say, to support the position of those \nwho believe anthropogenic gases cause global warming.\n  Seven years ago, I believe this month, I had occasion to study on the \nfloor and find out that, in fact, we had spent so much time on this \nissue that everyone was believing this to be true. When we realized the \nscience was not there, I made the statement that the notion that \nanthropogenic gases are causing catastrophic global warming is the \ngreatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.\n  What is Gore's take on the climategate scandal? Climate scientists, \nhe wrote, were ``besieged'' by an ``onslaught'' of hostile information \nrequests from climate ``skeptics.'' That is it, nothing else. Even the \nIPCC announced last week an independent review of its process and \nprocedures.\n  You see, former Vice President Gore was saying: Oh, that was nothing; \nthat was just a few comments. I might add, one of the largest and most \nrespected publications in the UK, which is called the UK Telegraph, \nsaid this is the worst scientific scandal of our generation.\n  The Atlantic Monthly, the Financial Times, the New York Times, the \nChicago Tribune, Newsweek and Time and many others are saying this is a \nlegitimate scandal and reform of the IPCC is absolutely essential. \nLet's keep in mind, IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, is the United Nations. They put this together back in 1988 to \ntry to scare people into changing our policy in this country.\n  By the way, I mentioned Time magazine as one of the many magazines \nand publications that have now said, looking at climategate, this \ninvestigation\n\n[[Page S1493]]\n\nshould be there. This is the same Time magazine--and I don't blame them \nfor doing this; I would have done the same thing--that back in 1975, on \nthe cover they had: Another Ice Age is coming, we are all going to die. \nA couple years ago, you might remember the last polar bear standing on \nthe last cube of ice and it said: Global warming is coming; we are all \ngoing to die. Anyway, the publications are coming around.\n  When it comes to reform, openness, transparency, and peer review, \nwhen it comes to practicing good science, Gore stands alone. He wants \nthe world to put its head in the sand and pretend nothing is happening.\n  It reminds me of the story of the two boy ostriches chasing two girl \nostriches through the woods, and they were catching them. One girl \nostrich said to the other, when they came up to a clearing: What do we \ndo? Well, let's hide. Each of the girl ostriches stuck their heads in a \nrespective hole, and the boy ostriches came galloping up to the \nclearing and one looked at the other and said: Where did the girls go?\n  That is what we are looking at here. They are hiding their heads in \nthe sand. Then Gore is writing in this op-ed piece, even if all these \ndisasters will not happen, we still have to deal with national security \nrisks and energy independence. Of course, Gore fails to mention that \nthe United States leads the world in technically recoverable resources \nof oil, coal, and natural gas. According to a recent release from a \nreport from the Congressional Research Service, America's combined \nrecoverable natural gas, oil, and coal endowment is the largest on \nEarth. America's recoverable resources are far greater than those of \nSaudi Arabia, China, and Canada combined, and that is without including \nAmerica's absolute immense oil shale and methane hydrate deposits.\n\n  It is always kind of humorous when people say: We have to get rid of \nour oil and gas and our coal. Yet those are the things which we are \nusing to generate the energy necessary to run America.\n  They say: Well, we have to become independent. But they want to do \naway with all of that. We have enough oil and gas and coal--and now \nnuclear, which we are expanding--to take care of our needs so we \nwouldn't have to be dependent upon any foreign country for any of our \nenergy. The problem is a political problem. Democrats will not allow us \nto go ahead and explore our own resources and exploit them. We are the \nonly country that doesn't do that.\n  Gore has to know the edifice of alarmism is starting to crumble, so \nhe is swinging for the fences, hoping for a home run to change the \ngame. But Gore is striking out, as he loses his support almost daily in \nCongress and from the American people. Let's face it; Gore's side of \nthe argument is collapsing. He and his allies are running short on \nfacts, and Gore's criticism of recent events rings hollow. For example, \nafter the climategate scandal broke, Gore was asked by an online \npublication called Slate as to what he thought of it.\n  Gore's response: Well, I haven't read all of the e-mails, but the \nmost recent one is more than 10 years old. Obviously, of course, that \nis not true because they go all the way up to 2009. So all he is left \nwith is a two-pronged fork of anger and attack. Just read the New York \nTimes op-ed piece.\n  By the way, I was told his op-ed piece in the New York Times was \nthree times larger than that which they normally will receive. He wrote \nthat those who question climate alarmism are members of a ``criminal \ngeneration.'' That is me--a criminal? Is Roger Pielke, Jr., a criminal? \nHow about Dr. John Christy of the University of Alabama, Richard \nLindzen of MIT, Chris Landsea of the National Hurricane Center? No, \nthey haven't committed any crimes. They just want honest, open \nscientific debate.\n  I might add that thus far the only scientists who commit crimes are \nthose at the CRU. Again, that is the collection point of all the \nscience that the United Nations has put together in this thing called \nIPCC--those involved in climategate, according to findings of the UK's \nInformation Commissioner.\n  The Weekly Standard recently placed Al Gore on its cover--we have \nthat right here--showing that the emperor has no clothes. The cover \nstory, by Steven Hayward, of the Weekly Standard is entitled, ``In \nDenial: The Meltdown of the Climate Campaign.''\n  Hayward writes a compelling narrative of climategate and its \nconsequences. This story is a must read for anyone interested in the \nrecent implosion of global warming alarmism.\n  Let me mention this: If you look at the movie ``An Inconvenient \nTruth,'' the one where he made, I guess, most of his money, the last \nsentence says, I believe: Are you willing to change the way you live?\n  Well, we thought that was probably a good idea, so let's put that up \nhere. It has now been 1,009 days since we have invited Al Gore to sign \nthis pledge. Here is what it says:\n\n       As a believer that human-caused global warming is a moral, \n     ethical, and spiritual issue affecting our survival; that \n     home energy use is a key component of overall energy use; \n     that reducing my fossil fuel-based home energy usage will \n     lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions; and that leaders on \n     moral issues should lead by example; therefore, I pledge to \n     consume no more energy for use in my home, my residence, than \n     the average American household 1 year from today.\n\n  Well, it hasn't been a year; it was 3 years ago. It was 1,009 days \nago.\n  Then, of course, there is always the question: What if we are wrong? \nWhat if we should do something? Since the Kyoto treaty failed--and we \ncame this close, Mr. President. You weren't in your current position at \nthat time, but this is how close we came to actually signing on and \nratifying the Kyoto treaty. We didn't do it.\n  Then along came Members of Congress in 2003, where we had the McCain-\nLieberman bill--cap-and-trade bill--and in 2005 we had the McCain-\nLieberman bill, then the Warner-Lieberman bill in 2008, we had the \nBoxer-Sanders bill in 2009, and now it looks as if we are going to have \nthe John Kerry and Lindsay Graham bill that is up. What do they all \nhave in common? It is all cap and trade.\n  Mr. President, I have some respect for James Hansen. But the one \nthing I really respect is that he has made this statement about cap and \ntrade. He said cap and trade is a devious way of getting away from the \nissue. The main issue is that we have to do something about greenhouse \ngas emissions, anthropogenic gas, CO2. Well, why not just go \nahead and have a tax on them? There is a good reason the cap and \ntraders don't want a tax. Because then the American people would know \nwhat it is costing them.\n  What is the cost of cap and trade? With any of these bills I just \nmentioned, it is approximately the same because cap and trade is cap \nand trade. You have to somehow make everyone think they are winners and \neveryone else is a loser. So we had the ranges come from the Wharton \nSchool of Economics, from MIT, from the CRA, and the range is always \nsomewhere between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. Now, that is \nsignificant--$300 to $400 billion a year.\n  Mr. President, if you are like I am, it is kind of hard to relate to \nbillions and trillions of dollars. So what I try to do is relate it to \nwhat it would cost the average family that pays taxes in my State of \nOklahoma. How much would this cost that family? It comes out to be a \nlittle over $3,000 a year. Now, $3,000 a year is an awful lot of money.\n  What do we get for that? Let's get the other chart up here. I had \noccasion the other day to hear from Lisa Jackson, who is President \nObama's Administrator of the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency--\na fine lady whom I think an awful lot of--when she was testifying \nbefore us. Now, this chart--and people are not questioning this chart's \nreliability--reflects what would happen: U.S. action without \ninternational action will have no effect on world CO2. It \njust stands to reason. And these are the bills that have been \nintroduced that I mentioned before--the McCain-Lieberman bill in 2003, \nMcCain-Lieberman in 2005, Warner-Lieberman in 2008, and some of the \nrest of them. It reflects what would happen if we had passed those and \nwhat would happen if we don't pass them. The chart shows nothing.\n  I asked the question of Lisa Jackson, President Obama's Administrator \nof the EPA. I said: This chart up here, is this an accurate chart? In \nother words, to put it in plain words, to better understand it, if we \nwere to pass--at that time it might have been the Markey bill. I am not \nsure which one it was, but it doesn't matter because cap and\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\ntrade is cap and trade. If we had passed that bill or any of the Senate \nbills we have talked about, how would that have reduced CO2 \nworldwide?\n  Her response: Well, it wouldn't really reduce it because we are doing \nthat unilaterally in the United States of America.\n  What happens when we take away our ability to have energy in America? \nWe have to manufacture it somewhere, and they have estimated how many \nthousands of manufacturing jobs if we were to pass any of these bills.\n  Those are polar bears, by the way, and they are all smiling in case \nyou can't see that too well, Mr. President.\n  We would lose our manufacturing jobs to countries such as China and \nMexico and India. Right now, in China, they are cranking out two new \ncoal-fired generating plants every week. Some people are saying: Oh, \nthey are going to follow us and our example and start restricting their \nCO2. No, they are not. They are preparing right now to be \nable to generate the electricity necessary as the people start coming \nin. So that is what is happening right now.\n\n  I would say this, though. I don't want you to feel--even though his \nworld is crumbling, don't feel sorry for Al Gore because he is doing \nall right. There is actually an article that just came out--this is the \nNational Review--at the same time a New York Times article did, and I \nhave kind of put together things from both of them. This from the New \nYork Times says:\n\n       Former Vice President Al Gore thought he had spotted a \n     winner last year when a small California firm sought \n     financing for an energy-saving technology from the venture \n     capital firm where Al Gore is a partner. The company, the \n     Silver Spring Networks, produces hardware and software to \n     make the electricity grid more efficient. It came to Mr. \n     Gore's firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, one of Silicon \n     Valley's top venture capital providers, looking for $75 \n     million to expand its partnership with utilities seeking to \n     install millions of so-called smart meters in homes and \n     businesses.\n       Mr. Gore and his partners decided to back the company, and \n     in gratitude Silver Spring retained him and John Doerr, \n     another Kleiner Perkins partner, as unpaid corporate \n     advisers. The deal appeared to pay off in a big way last \n     week, when the Energy Department announced $3.4 billion in \n     smart grid grants. Of the total, more than $560 million went \n     to utilities with which Silver Spring has contacts.\n\n  Wait a minute, we are talking about Silver Spring, the company with \nwhich Al Gore is connected.\n\n       Kleiner Perkins and its partners, including Mr. Gore, could \n     recoup their investment many times over in the coming years.\n       Silver Spring Networks is a foot soldier in the global \n     green energy revolution Mr. Gore hopes to lead. Few people \n     have been as vocal about the urgency of global warming and \n     the need to reinvent the way the world produces and consumes \n     energy. And few have put as much money behind their advocacy \n     as Mr. Gore and are as well positioned to profit from this \n     green transformation if and when it comes.\n       Critics, mostly the political right and among global \n     warming skeptics, say Mr. Gore is poised to become the \n     world's first ``carbon billionaire,'' profiteering from \n     government policies he supports that would direct billions of \n     dollars to the business ventures that he has invested in.\n       Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from \n     Tennessee, asserted at a hearing this year that Mr. Gore \n     stood to benefit personally from the energy and climate \n     policies he was urging Congress to adopt.\n       Mr. Gore says that he is simply putting his money where his \n     mouth is. ``Do you think there is something wrong with being \n     active in business in this country?'' Mr. Gore said. ``I am \n     proud of it. I am proud of it.''\n       In an e-mail message this week, he said his investment \n     activities were consistent with his public advocacy over the \n     decades. ``I have advocated policies to promote renewable \n     energy and accelerate reductions in global warming pollution \n     for decades, including all the time I was in public \n     service.'' Mr. Gore wrote: ``As a private citizen, I have \n     continued to advocate the same policies. Even though the vast \n     majority of my business career has been in areas that do not \n     involve renewable energy or global warming pollution \n     reductions, I absolutely believe in investing in ways that \n     are consistent with my values and beliefs. I encourage others \n     to invest in the same way.''\n       Mr. Gore has invested a significant portion of the tens of \n     millions of dollars that he has earned since leaving \n     government in 2001 in a broad array of environmentally \n     friendly energy and technology business ventures, like carbon \n     trading markets, solar cells, and waterless urinals. He has \n     also given away millions more to finance the nonprofit he \n     founded, the Alliance for Climate Protection, and to another \n     group, the Climate Project, which trains people to present \n     the slide show that was the basis of his documentary ``An \n     Inconvenient Truth.'' Royalties from his new book on climate \n     change, ``Our Choice,'' printed on 100 percent recycled \n     paper, will go to the alliance, an aide said.\n       Other public figures, like speaker Nancy Pelosi and Robert \n     F. Kennedy, Jr., who have vocally supported government \n     financing of energy-saving technologies have investments in \n     alternative energy ventures. Some scientists and policy \n     advocates also promote energy policies that personally enrich \n     them.\n       As a private citizen, Mr. Gore asked not to have to \n     disclose his income and assets, as he did--\n\n  as I do, as others do in this Chamber\n\n     in his years in Congress and the White House. When he left \n     government in 2001, he listed assets of less than $2 million, \n     including homes in suburban Washington and in Tennessee. \n     Since then his net worth has skyrocketed, helped by timely \n     investments in Apple and Google, profits from books and his \n     movie, and the scores of speeches for which he can be paid \n     more than $100,000 . . .\n\n  a speech. I suggest now that price may be going down a little bit for \nAl Gore.\n\n       Mr. Gore's spokeswoman would not give a figure for his \n     current net worth, but the scale of his wealth is evident in \n     a single investment of $35 million in Capricorn Investment \n     Group. . . .\n\n  It goes on and on. I ask unanimous consent to submit the rest of this \nfor the Record because it is pretty good reading.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. Gore's spokeswoman would not give a figure for his \n     current net worth, but the scale of his wealth is evident in \n     a single investment of $35 million in Capricorn Investment \n     Group, a private equity fund started by his friend Jeffrey \n     Skoll, the first president of eBay.\n       Ion Yadigaroglu, a co-founder of Capricorn, said that Mr. \n     Gore does not sit on the fund's investment committee, but \n     obviously agrees with the partners' strategy of putting long-\n     term money into promising ventures in energy, technology and \n     health care around the globe.\n       ``Aspirationally,'' said Mr. Yadigaroglu, who holds a \n     doctorate from Stanford in astrophysics, ``we're trying to \n     make more money than others doing the same thing and do it in \n     a way that is superior in ethics and impacts.''\n       Mr. Gore has said he invested in partnerships and funds \n     that try to identify and support companies that are advancing \n     cutting-edge green technologies and are paving the way toward \n     a low-carbon economy.\n       He has a stake in the world's pre-eminent carbon credit \n     trading market and in an array of companies in bio-fuels, \n     sustainable fish farming, electric vehicles and solar power.\n       Capricorn holds a major stake in Falcon Waterfree \n     Technologies, the world's leading maker of waterless urinals. \n     Generation has holdings in Ausra, a solar energy company \n     based in California, and Camco, a British firm that develops \n     carbon dioxide emissions reduction projects. Kleiner Perkins \n     has a green ventures fund with nearly $1 billion invested in \n     renewable energy and efficiency concerns.\n       Mr. Gore also has substantial interests in technology, \n     media and biotechnology ventures that have no direct tie to \n     his environmental advocacy, an aide said.\n       Mr. Gore is not a lobbyist, and he has never asked Congress \n     or the administration for an earmark or policy decision that \n     would directly benefit one of his investments. But he has \n     been a tireless advocate for policies that would move the \n     country away from the use of coal and oil, and he has begun a \n     $300 million campaign to end the use of fossil fuels in \n     electricity production in 10 years.\n       But Marc Morano, a climate change skeptic who until \n     recently was a top aide to Senator James M. Inhofe, \n     Republican of Oklahoma, said that what he saw as Mr. Gore's \n     alarmism and occasional exaggerations distorted the debate \n     and also served his personal financial interests.\n       Mr. Gore has testified numerous times in support of \n     legislation to address climate change and to revamp the \n     nation's energy policies.\n       He appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee \n     in April to support an energy and climate change bill that \n     was intended to reduce global warming emissions through a \n     cap-and-trade program for major polluting industries.\n       Mr. Gore, who shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for his \n     climate advocacy, is generally received on Capitol Hill as \n     something of an oracle, at least by Democrats.\n       But at the hearing in April, he was challenged by Ms. \n     Blackburn, who echoed some of the criticism of Mr. Gore that \n     has swirled in conservative blogs and radio talk shows. She \n     noted that Mr. Gore is a partner at Kleiner Perkins, which \n     has hundreds of millions of dollars invested in firms that \n     could benefit from any legislation that limits carbon dioxide \n     emissions.\n       ``I believe that the transition to a green economy is good \n     for our economy and good for all of us, and I have invested \n     in it,'' Mr. Gore said, adding that he had put ``every \n     penny'' he has made from his investments into the Alliance \n     for Climate Protection.\n       ``And, Congresswoman,'' he added, ``if you believe that the \n     reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is \n     because of greed, you don't know me.''\n\n\n[[Page S1495]]\n\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. ``Marc Morano, a climate change skeptic who was recently \na top aide to [me], Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, \nsaid that what he saw as Mr. Gore's alarmism and occasional \nexaggerations distorted the debate and also served his personal \nfinancial interests.''\n  I say don't feel sorry for Al Gore. He is doing fine right now.\n  Last, on this subject, my wife and I have been married for 50 years. \nWe have 20 kids and grandkids. They are achievers. They are great \npeople. All 20 of them, all but 6, live within walking distance of my \nhome in Tulsa, OK. Not many people can say that. The one who doesn't is \nthe family of six of my daughter Molly, her husband, and four children.\n  It happens one of these children you can't see very well right here, \nZegita Marie, actually was one we found in Ethiopia. My daughter \nadopted her. Molly only had three boys and always wanted a girl so she \nadopted this cute little girl. This little girl, by the way, is 9 years \nold. She is reading at college level. She came up to Washington to \nspeak to a group I sponsor every year. It is called the African Dinner, \nabout 400 or so of them.\n  Anyway, when they are up here, I say to my friend in the chair, they \nfound, because of the global warming problem we had, we had all these \nsnowstorms and blizzards and consequently the airport was closed and \nthey were stuck here. What do you do with a family of six when they are \nstuck? They went out and built, of all things, an igloo. They are kind \nof engineering oriented. This is not an igloo. It sleeps four people \nwith ice bricks and all that. On top of that they put ``Al Gore's New \nHome.'' It is right next to the Library of Congress. This is a picture \nof it. I thought that was fun.\n  I regret to say one of the real liberal stations, Keith Olbermann, \ndeclared my daughter's family as ``The Worst Family in America.''\n  One last subject here I want to address. I want to compliment Sean \nHannity for something I saw last night. I happened to get in at the \nlast of it, so I found out what this guy is up to. What he has done is \nhe has taken--there is a lot of wasteful, stupid spending in America. \nHe has taken 102 of the ridiculous things that we spend money on around \nhere and he has listed them. He started several days ago.\n\n       No. 102: Protecting a Michigan insect collection from other \n     insects--$187,00O;\n       No. 101: Highway beautified by fish art in Washington--\n     $10,000.\n\n  It goes on and on.\n  Over those last few evenings he listed these. Last night was the last \n20 of them. Let me quickly run over these in reverse order.\n\n       No. 20: Researching how paying attention improves \n     performance of difficult tasks in Connecticut.\n\n  That was just $850,000.\n\n       No. 19: Kentucky Transportation Department awarded \n     contracts to companies associated with the road contractor \n     accused of bribing the previous state transportation \n     secretary--$24 million.\n       No. 18: Amtrak losing $32 per passenger nationally but \n     rewarded with windfall--$1.3 billion.\n       No. 17: Widening an Arizona interstate even though the \n     company that won the contract has a history of tax fraud and \n     pollution--$21.8 million.\n\n  I am going to submit this for the Record. To get on down to the last \nitems--\n\n       No. 9: Resurfacing a tennis court in Montana--$50,000;\n       No. 8: University in Indiana studying why young men do not \n     like to wear--\n\n  I will not say that.\n\n       No. 7: Funds for Massachusetts roadway construction, to \n     companies that have defrauded taxpayers, polluted the \n     environment, and have paid tens of thousands of dollars in \n     fines for violating workplace safety laws\n\n  --in the millions of dollars.\n\n       No. 6: Sending 11 students and 4 teachers from an Arkansas \n     university to the U.N. climate change convention in \n     Copenhagen, using almost 54,000 pounds of carbon dioxide from \n     air travel alone--$50,000.\n       No. 5: Storytelling festival in Utah--$15,000.\n       No. 4: Door mats to the Department of the Army in Texas--\n     $14,000;\n       No. 3: University in New York researching young adults who \n     drink malt liquor and smoke pot--\n\n  that is only $389,000;\n\n       No. 2: Solar panels for a climbing gym in Colorado--\n     $157,800;\n       No. 1: Grant for one Massachusetts university for \n     ``robobees''--miniature flying robot bees.\n\n  That was $2 million.\n  I want to ask you, Mr. President, what do you think all 102 of these \nprojects have in common? Do you think they are congressional earmarks? \nA lot of people probably believe they are. They are not. The one thing \nthey have in common is they are all done by the President, President \nObama. He said back when they passed the $787 billion stimulus bill, \nthere would not be one earmark in this bill. Everything you are looking \nat there was all in this bill. That was not done by Members of \nCongress, that was done by unelected bureaucrats.\n  The inconvenient truth is that we do have a problem with earmarks in \nAmerica, but it is not congressional earmarks. I was distressed, the \nother day, last Thursday, when I saw my fellow Republicans over in the \nHouse did something they should not have done. They actually said we \nare going to stop, we are going to put a permanent moratorium on all \nearmarks that we in the Republican Party have over there.\n  Let's stop and think about that. One of the things people do not \nunderstand is if you kill what they call--what people think is a \nCongressional earmark, it does not save a penny. What happens to it, \nbecause it is part of an underlying bill, is it goes to the \nbureaucracies, the unelected bureaucrats, the President, President \nObama. I suggest there is a serious problem with what the House did. \nThey resolved that it is the policy of the Republican conference that \nno Member shall request a Congressional earmark, limited tax benefit, \nand so forth, all in conjunction with clause 9, rule XXI of the Rules \nof the House of the 111th Congress.\n  Let's see what that is. Clause 9 of rule XXI applies to all \nlegislation in the House of Representatives, whether it be \nauthorization, appropriation, tax or tariff.\n  That is what we are supposed to be doing here, and then said we are \nnot going to do it. I think that is rather interesting because we all, \neveryone in this room who serves here--I have done it four times--takes \nan oath of office. In that oath of office we solemnly swear we will \nsupport and bear true allegiance to the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Here they have come out and said we are not going to do that. This is \nmind boggling, that this can take place. It is something that will have \nto be reversed. When you go back and look at the Federalist Papers, \nJames Madison, the father of the Constitution, made it very clear. He \nis the one who coined the phrase ``power of the purse.'' That is what \nwe do here in the Constitution. In article I, section 9 it says what we \nare supposed to do. We are supposed to do the appropriations and spend \nthe money that comes in. That is what we are supposed to do. That is \nour constitutional responsibility.\n  We have a serious problem in this, what they are talking about, the \nmoratorium. I think there are some of those who want the Senate to do \nit. I am hoping we will not follow that course. I respect my friends \nover in the House but they made a mistake and we do not want to march \ndown that same path. I think it is very important for us to understand \nearmarks, what they call appropriations over here; that is what an \nearmark is, if you want to define it. They do not save any money. That \nmoney merely goes to the bureaucracy so they can spend it. All 102 of \nthe things I mentioned were bureaucratic earmarks. Not one of them was \na congressional earmark.\n  We have this as a very serious problem right now. One of the reasons \nI have always said I do not like the idea of the earmark discussion is \nthat people do not understand. They think they are something if you \neliminate you save money. You don't save a cent. By the way, earmarks \nof the spending that takes place are discretionary, not mandatory \nspending. It constitutes 1.5 percent. I am concerned about the 98.5 \npercent. For that reason I have introduced a bill that is very similar \nto something President Obama said. Everyone rejoiced during the State \nof the Union Message when he stood up and said I am going to freeze \nnondefense discretionary spending at the 2010 level. Everyone \napplauded. They thought that was a great statement to make until I went \nback and I looked and found out that this nondiscretionary spending had \nincreased between 2008 and 2010 by\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\nact of this President, Obama, by 20 percent. So what he is saying is we \nare going to increase discretionary spending by 20 percent and then we \nare going to freeze it. I do not want to freeze it. I want to bring it \nback down. So I have taken the same bill and said we are going to \nfreeze that at 2008 levels.\n  I encourage my friends, we have now about 40-some cosponsors of that \nlegislation. That being the case, I hope we will look very carefully \nand consider not just what people are thinking out there but do them a \ngreat service and tell them in fact what the real issue is on earmarks.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

We have been working and focused very much in the last \nfew weeks on the economy with our tax extender bill as well as the jobs \nbill we passed, and I, for one, am glad. My State is glad, because that \nis what I have been hearing all around my State, especially from small \nbusinesspeople who have been troubled, are having trouble getting \ncredit. Mr. President, as someone who has worked so much on this issue, \nyou know how important that is to the strength of our economy, as 65 \npercent of our jobs have come from small businesses.\n  Today, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss two bipartisan \nbills I recently introduced that I hope will do more to add to the \ncreation of jobs, to innovation, to exports. The first one is called \nthe Export Promotion Act of 2010, and the second is the Travel \nRestriction Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2010.\n  Export promotion is a topic of special interest to me. I chair the \nSubcommittee on Competitiveness, Innovation, and Export Promotion. The \nExport Promotion Act is cosponsored with my good friend on the \nsubcommittee, the Republican ranking member, George LeMieux, and also \nby Senators Shaheen and Wyden, who have taken an active interest in \nexport promotion.\n  We have an important national interest in promoting exports. Access \nto new markets can make the difference between expansion and stagnation \nof a new and developing business. The President recognizes this, and \nthat is why I am pleased he called for a doubling of exports in his \nState of the Union speech, a doubling in the next 5 years.\n  One way to do this, to take this opportunity to open new markets, is \ngoing to be Cuba. A bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator Enzi, a \nsecond bill, would do just that. The bill makes it easier for American \nfarmers to export agricultural products to Cuba--currently a closed \nmarket--by relaxing the restrictions on financial transactions between \nthe two countries and by making it easier for American farmers to \ntravel there to promote their products. The sponsor of the bill in the \nHouse is Minnesota Congressman and chair of the Agriculture Committee, \nColin Peterson.\n  Another way to promote American exports is to make sure businesses \nknow about the potential export opportunities available to them. \nCurrently, the United States derives the smallest percentage of its GDP \nfrom exports compared to all other major countries. America has always \nbeen ``the world's customer,'' buying our way and in effect buying our \nway to huge trade deficits. But it is clear that exports will be \nincreasingly important to our economy as people in China, India, and \nother developing countries gain more purchasing power and they become \nour potential customers. Right now, more than 95 percent of the world's \ncustomers are outside our borders. Think of it; with the growing \neconomic power of customers in these new developing nations--I was just \nin India a few months ago, and you see that mass of humanity, the \npotential, as that country builds itself up, of people who can buy our \nproducts from all over our country. More exports will mean more \nbusiness, more jobs, and more growth for the American economy.\n  Exports are also important for small businesses for several reasons. \nFirst and most obviously, exports allow a company to increase its sales \nand grow its business. Second, a diversified base of customers helps a \nbusiness weather the economic ups and downs.\n  So there is a world of opportunity out there. I can tell you, I have \nseen it in my own State.\n  Mattracks, a company in Karlstad, MN--population 900, known as the \nMoose Capital of Minnesota--is a little company named after a little \nsecond-grade boy named Matt who came home and drew a picture of tank \ntracks on each wheel instead of going between the wheels. His dad, a \nmechanic, decided to build this product in his machine shop, and they \nnow export to dozens and dozens of countries all over the world. They \nstarted with 5 employees and they are now up to 50. How did they do it? \nThey went over to Fargo, ND, which covered this area of Minnesota, and \ntalked to a woman named Heather at the Foreign Commercial Service \nDepartment. They went over there, and she matched them up, like a \nbusiness match.com, with potential countries, from Kazakhstan to \nTurkey, that were interested in their product. That is how they grew \ntheir business in Karlstad, MN.\n  Akkerman, down by Austin, MN, really in the middle of cornfields, is \na longstanding family business--different from Mattracks--where they \nactually do trenchless digging. They put major steel pipes underground, \nand they have the machinery to push those pipes underground. They can \ndig major trenches underground without actually digging up the \nlandscape, without digging up the ground. They have done it in Los \nAngeles, but they are doing it in India. Why? Highly populated areas \nlike digging this way; they do not have to dig up over ground to do it. \nAgain, as you look at these countries with the kind of infrastructure \nthey need, Akkerman is now up to 77 employees--again, in the middle of \nthe farmland in southern Minnesota.\n  But for so many businesses, it is very difficult to do this because \nfor them the world looks like one of those ancient maps that contain \nonly the outlines of the continents and a few coastline features. But \nthe rest of it is blank space, vast unknown and unexplored territory. \nThey know there is something more, they know accessing these markets \nwill help them expand their profits, open new facilities, and hire more \npeople, but they do not really know how to find out about \nopportunities.\n  Fortunately, there is help available. There are a number of Federal \nprograms through the Small Business Administration, the Commerce \nDepartment, and the Export-Import Bank that assist U.S. companies in \npromoting their products abroad. The idea here is to give that kind of \nhelp to small and medium-sized businesses so they can vet a potential \ncustomer, so they can find out what is available. They don't have a \nfull-time trade department or full-time person looking at each \ncontinent like a company such as 3M or Cargill--very successful \nbusinesses in my home State--would have. So they need this help.\n  Another example: Epicurean in Duluth, a company that makes commercial \nand home-kitchen cutting surfaces. With 40 employees, it has customers \nin 45 countries. I invited Epicurean's owner, Dave Benson, to join me \nfor this year's State of the Union Address, and he thinks we are right \non track in focusing on the export market.\n  What does our bill do? Our bill focuses on expanding the Commerce \nDepartment programs that help these companies get the word out. It does \nthree major things:\n  First, it expands the scope of existing Department of Commerce \nprograms that help America's small and medium-sized businesses \ncommercialize and manufacture new technologies that export abroad.\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\n  Second, it increases the people at the Department of Commerce who are \nresponsible for identifying new export opportunities abroad and \nmatching these markets with American companies. For the past 2 years, \nthe program that specializes in matching small business with potential \nexport markets has not replaced retiring officials, losing roughly 200 \npeople since 2004 even as demand for their assistance continues to \nincrease. This bill would restore staffing levels in this program to \ntheir 2004 levels. I talked to Secretary Locke this morning. I know he \nis focused on this. He is doing reshuffling of people in his own \ndepartment. That is the key to this.\n  Finally, the legislation will expand the Commerce Department's Rural \nExport Initiative to ensure that small and medium-sized businesses \nlocated in rural areas know about all of the available export \nopportunities for them. Why is this cost-worthy? Well, look at this: a \nreturn of approximately $213 on each dollar--$213 on each dollar. That \nis what we are talking about here.\n  What we are trying to do here, Senator LeMieux and I, with this bill \nand also with our bill regarding Cuba is to open these markets and say: \nYou know what, if we can give our small and medium-sized businesses and \nour farmers a little help, either getting in the door, knowing whether \na customer is real, letting them know where their product is hot, what \ncountries are interested, they are going to do the work. These are \nprivate sector jobs. Our idea here is not to create the jobs ourselves \nbut to help them to get into these markets, to make them on an even \nplaying field with the big businesses that already have the resources \nto do it.\n  The ability to envision creative new products and then develop them, \ncommercialize them, and sell them has been part of the American dream \nas long as there has been an American dream. That spirit of innovation \nhas gotten us everything in my State from the Post-it note to the \npacemaker. Those companies--Medtronic started in a garage, and 3M \nstarted up in Two Harbors, MN, a tiny little town. Target started as a \ndry goods storefront on Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis, and they grew to \nwhat they were. But they can only do this now if they get that kind of \nhelp. It is no longer only America that is their market; it is India, \nit is Kazakhstan, it is Turkey, it is China.\n  So it is not as easy now to build to the point that they need to \nbuild to. That is why Senator LeMieux and I are introducing this bill, \nto assist the Commerce Department to assist these small and medium-size \nbusinesses. As we continue to fight through this economic crisis, it is \nimportant to keep the end game in mind, an end game where the United \nStates is again the world leader in job creation by virtue of \ndeveloping and selling the world's most innovative products. This bill \nwill help us get there.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I say to my friend, I know he has been \nobserving in the last few days the events that have transpired in \nregard to the situation in Israel and the reaction of the United States \nto the announcement that there would be additional housing construction \nin areas the Israelis believe are within the boundaries that will exist \nonce peace is settled, and that the Palestinians are of the view that \nit is their area--as there are many territorial disputes between the \nPalestinians and the Israelis, which is one of the reasons there is a \ncompelling argument for a peace process.\n  I know my friend from Connecticut is disturbed, as I am, about the \nlevel of tension in the public discourse that has been going on, which \ncannot only not be helpful to Israeli-U.S. relations but also to the \nability of Israel to deal with other tensions in the region and the \nexistential threats they face from their neighbors who have threatened \ntheir extinction.\n  So I have had the great pleasure and honor of travelling to Israel on \nnumerous occasions with my friend from Connecticut. I would state for \nthe record that no one has a closer relationship and a better \nunderstanding of the Israeli-Palestinian situation and the urgency of \nthe peace process.\n  I would just ask my friend, doesn't he think if we want the Israeli \nGovernment to act in a way that would be more in keeping with our \nobjectives, that it does not help them to have public disparagement by \nthe Secretary of State, by the President's political adviser on the \nSunday shows? On the contrary, shouldn't we lower the dialog, talk \nquietly among friends, and work together toward the mutual goals we \nshare?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona for the \nquestion and for the opportunity to engage in this dialog on the \nimportant and troubling course of relations at this moment between the \nUnited States and Israel.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this colloquy be \nconducted as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona what not only he knows, but what he \nhas helped to bring about throughout his career, are two things: that \nthe American relationship with Israel is one of the strongest, most \nimportant, most steadfast bilateral alliances we have in the world \nbecause it is not based on temporal matters--that is, matters that come \nand go and politics or diplomacy--it is based on shared values, shared \nstrategic interests in the world, and, unfortunately, now on the fact \nthat we in the United States and the Israelis are also targets of the \nIslamist extremists, the terrorists who threaten the security of so \nmuch of the world. So we have a strong bilateral relationship.\n  The second thing to say, in answering my friend's question, is that \nthe Israelis depend, to a very large degree, on America's friendship as \nthey approach the world. The Senator is absolutely right, without a \nconfidence--not that everything Israel does America will support, but \nthat underlying we are heading in the same direction, we are allies, we \nare friends, it is as if we are part of the same family. Without that \nconfidence in the U.S.-Israel relationship, the Israelis will not have \nthe confidence to take the risks necessary for peace. So the uproar \nover the last several days is very troubling in that regard.\n  Vice President Biden, as my friend knows, went to Israel to reset the \nrelationship. Unfortunately, at that time, from all the Israeli \nGovernment says--I have no reason to doubt them--a bureaucratic \ndecision was made within one department of the government, the Ministry \nof the Interior, to issue a permit--I gather one of seven permits \nnecessary within the next few years for this building project to take \nplace. It has become not just a bureaucratic mistake but a major, for \nthe moment, source of division between our ally, Israel, and ourselves, \nand it does not help anyone to continue this.\n  I just want to say briefly to my friend because he said something \nmost people do not know--and this is my understanding of the \nsituation--the permits for this housing are in an area of Jerusalem \nthat is today mostly Jewish. The Israeli Government has taken the \nposition, however, since 1967 that anybody ought to be able to buy \nproperty and build and live in any section of Jerusalem they choose to \nregardless of their religion or nationality or anything else. That is a \nvery American concept.\n  Secondly, this particular part of Jerusalem is, in most anybody's \nvision of a possible peace settlement, going to be part of Israel. A \nlot of Israelis believe all of Jerusalem should remain the eternal \nunified capital of Israel. But going to the negotiations that occurred \nbetween President Clinton, Prime Minister Barak, Chairman Arafat in \n2000, which were about as detailed as any recent negotiations, this\n\n[[Page S1498]]\n\nparticular neighborhood of Jerusalem, in the document that was almost \naccepted by Arafat, was part of Israel.\n  So it is not a violation of that. It is not a violation of the \nmoratorium on new settlements that Prime Minister Netanyahu adopted, \nand it ought not to be--I tell you, that first wave of reaction, when \nVice President Biden was there, I understood. He was upset. It was \nembarrassing. Maybe some of the words--``condemn'' was a little strong \nfor a bureaucratic mistake. But why this continues now, including on \nthe Sunday talk shows, with Mr. Axelrod saying it was an affront and an \ninsult by Israel to the United States, serves nobody's good. It does \nnot serve our interests; it does not serve Israel's interests. It helps \nthose like the people in Tehran who want to cause difficulty throughout \nthe region.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask my colleague, shouldn't we be emphasizing \nwhat I very much appreciated? Vice President Biden--and I quote him--\nsaid:\n\n       In my experience one necessary precondition for progress \n     [toward peace in the Middle East] is that every time progress \n     is made, it's made when the rest of the world knows there is \n     absolutely no space between the United States and Israel when \n     it comes to security, none.\n\n  I thought the Vice President had it exactly right, and as the Senator \nsays: Look, mistakes are made. It is a government in Israel which is \nsometimes interesting to watch, particularly when you watch the \nproceedings in the Knesset, the parliamentary proceedings.\n  But somehow it seems that the rhetoric has escalated and maybe given \nthe impression to the wrong people--the neighbors of Israel who have \nstated time after time they are bent on Israel's extinction; the \nstatements by Ahmadinejad that he wants to ``wipe Israel off the \nmap''--and that perhaps there may be sufficient space, as the Vice \nPresident pointed out, that they could exploit that in a way that would \nbe harmful to the State of Israel. I know that was not the intention of \nthe President's political adviser on Sunday, and it is not the \nintention of the Secretary of State. But the Secretary of State knows \nthe Israelis very well. She has had dealings with all of the countries \nin the region. She is very knowledgeable and experienced.\n  I hope all of us would realize, let's lower the rhetoric. Let's try \nand fix the problems that exist amongst the close friends we are rather \nthan escalate the tensions that exist in a very dangerous time.\n  The Senator from Connecticut and I were recently briefed about \nperhaps increased tensions in southern Lebanon, the possibility of \nattacks from southern Lebanon into Israel, the continued nuclear \nbuildup on the part of the Iranians, the continued statements of \nassertiveness by the President of Syria, al-Assad.\n  There are increased tensions in the region, and this is not the \ntime--certainly, most importantly, not the time--that we give the \nimpression that there is such differences between ourselves and Israel \nthat it could be exploited by Israel's enemies.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona. I agree \ntotally with what he said. I think it is very important the Senator \nfrom Arizona has gone to the speech that Vice President Biden made. I \nbelieve it was on Wednesday of last week in Tel Aviv at Tel Aviv \nUniversity.\n  What is interesting is, that speech came after the first date he was \nthere. When this bureaucratic announcement of housing permits being \nissued in Jerusalem was made, Vice President Biden put out a statement \ncondemning that action. I understand why he was upset by it, that it \nhad been happening when he came. Prime Minister Netanyahu outright \napologized in public for it. He said he is appointing a review \ncommittee to look at how it happened so they could set up a mechanism \nwithin the Israeli Government so a decision such as that would not be \nmade, if I understood what their intention is, without the Prime \nMinister's office being notified. Then Vice President Biden made quite \nan important speech at Tel Aviv University.\n  The Senator from Arizona is absolutely right. The Vice President said \nthe relationship between the United States and Israel is unbreakable, \nand there is no space between us. When there is space between us, it \nonly helps our shared enemies, not the two of us, the two great \ndemocracies.\n  Vice President Biden also made clear that while we are committed to \nthe Israeli-Palestinian peace process, it is very important for both--\nand Prime Minister Netanyahu has too. He has taken his Likud Party to a \nplace it has never been before. In a speech he gave at Bar-Ilan \nUniversity, he said for the first time, very clearly, as the Likud \nPrime Minister, that he supports the two-state solution: two countries, \ntwo peoples side by side. Then he issued that moratorium on settlement \nexpansion in a whole series of areas which Secretary Clinton, in an \nearlier visit, described as unprecedented.\n  Then we go to the Vice President's speech. There, he focuses on Iran \nand the threat of a nuclear Iran, the threat of an Iran that suppresses \nthe rights of its people, and he says not only is Iran explicitly a \nthreat to Israel--as Ahmadinejad has said, threatening Israel's \nexistence--Vice President Biden made very clear our concern about an \nIranian nuclear weapon is not because of what Ahmadinejad said about \nIsrael, although, obviously, that concerns us; it is because a nuclear, \nautocratic, tyrannical, totalitarian Iran threatens the short-, medium-\n, and long-term security of the United States of America.\n  After that speech, I thought this whole business about the permits \nfor housing was over. Yet then the State Department spokesman comes out \non Friday with very strong language about the phone conversation with \nthe Secretary of State whom, of course, the Senator from Arizona and I \nnot only respect but like very much. She is our friend, our colleague. \nShe has a long record of support for the United States-Israel \nrelationship. But Friday afternoon's press statement seemed to be \ndredging up again something that seemed to have been calmed and ought \nto be calmed.\n  The Senator from Arizona is absolutely right. I take it that is the \npoint the Senator is making: There is too much that ties us together \nwith Israel, too much on the line for both countries, to continue to \nmake a mistake, for which the Prime Minister of Israel has apologized, \ninto a division between two great allies.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, wouldn't my colleague agree that the \noriginal purpose of the Vice President's trip, as I understand it, was \na precursor or even an announcement of indirect talks between the \nPalestinians and the Israelis, using the good auspices of Senator \nGeorge Mitchell? So the trip was a signal to the world that the process \nof peace between Israelis and the Palestinians was on track, and a \nbeginning, albeit a modest one, was taking place.\n  So it might be good if our friends in the administration--and other \nplaces in the United States--could start refocusing our efforts on the \npeace process, which came very close to the beginning--again, modest, \nindirect but still beginning--of peace talks and emphasize the need to \ncommence those, assure our Arab friends in the region of our commitment \nto the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, and move forward in that \ndirection. We need to understand that the Prime Minister of Israel has \napologized and is trying, as the Senator from Connecticut pointed out, \nto put a mechanism in place to make sure that an incident of this \nnature would not arise again.\n  So we could go back--I will not--and be very critical of the Obama \nadministration's initial demand of a complete freeze of settlements \nwhich was, in my view, an unnecessary precondition and an impediment, \nbut that is done also. So now we have had our spat, we have had our \nfamily fight, and it is time for us to now stop. We have to get our eye \nback on the goal, which is the commencement of Israeli-Palestinian \npeace talks, and move forward with that--and I know the Senator from \nConnecticut shares my view--particularly with the leadership we are \nseeing on the Palestinian side. The chances for fruitful negotiations \nare better than they have been since the time the Senator from \nConnecticut cited back when President Clinton had Arafat and Ehud Barak \nto Camp David.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I agree totally with my friend. Let's \ncut the family fighting, the family feud. It is unnecessary, and it is \ndestructive of our shared national interests, the\n\n[[Page S1499]]\n\nUnited States and Israel, and it takes our eye off the two balls we \nhave to focus on. One is the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and the \nother is the threat of a nuclear Iran, which is not only a threat to us \nand Israel, it is a threat to Palestinian leadership because Iran is \nthe No. 1 supporter of Hamas, which is the foremost antagonist to the \nleadership of the Palestinian Authority.\n  The Senator from Arizona is absolutely right. Peace between the \nIsraelis and the Palestinians requires very difficult, delicate \nnegotiations. But we are at a moment--and my friend and I were together \nin Israel and the Palestinian areas in January of this year and we met \nwith the leadership. It is an interesting moment, because in both \ncountries the economy is doing pretty well. The Palestinians have seen \na real surge in economic growth. Security is better on both sides. We \nhave leadership on both sides: Netanyahu in Israel and the President of \nthe Palestinian Authority, Abu Mazen, and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. \nWe have three leaders there committed to the two-state solution, \nrenouncing terrorism, a peaceful process. If, for some reason, people \nin the American Government continue this dispute, frankly, it makes it \nhard for not just the Israelis but the Palestinians to get into the \npeace process because we can't be more demanding than they are, if you \nwill. I think Abu Mazen and Salam Fayyad want to move the peace process \nforward, I am convinced, as Prime Minister Netanyahu said.\n  So it is time to lower voices and get over the family feud between \nthe United States and Israel. It doesn't serve anybody's interests but \nour enemies: George Mitchell--I will say it here--is a saint. Whoever \nthe saint of patience is, George works under that saint's aegis. \nThrough his patience and persistence, the proximity talks between \nIsrael and the Palestinian leadership are about to begin, and they have \nthe prospect of making some real progress.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Connecticut.\n  I rise today to address the very concerning, and unfortunately very \npublic, tensions that have broken out recently between the governments \nof the United States and Israel. I am not here to take sides or to call \nout one party at the expense of the other. There have been enough \naccusations, recriminations, and bad blood.\n  I certainly understand the anger felt by members of the U.S. \nadministration that the announcement of new settlement construction in \nEast Jerusalem by Israel's Interior Ministry simply seemed intended to \nembarrass Vice President Biden in the middle of his visit. I can also \nunderstand the anger felt by Israelis that the U.S. reaction to this \nannouncement has been out of step with the announcement itself. At this \npoint, there is little to be gained by either side by focusing on their \nanger, however justified they feel it is. It is now time to focus on \nwhat matters most: the common interests we share, the urgent need for \ncooperation between us, and the large capacity within our alliance to \nmove beyond differences and work together.\n  Vice President Biden spoke to exactly these themes in his excellent \nspeech in Tel Aviv during his recent visit to Israel--a speech, I would \nadd, that was delivered 2 days after the Interior Ministry's \nannouncement. Perhaps the most correct and important thing the Vice \nPresident said was this: ``In my experience one necessary precondition \nfor progress toward peace in the Middle East is that every time \nprogress is made, it's made when the rest of the world knows there is \nabsolutely no space between the United States and Israel when it comes \nto security, none.'' This is absolutely correct, and we all need to \nremember it right now.\n  We now have a conservative Israeli leader who is committed to the \ngoal of two States for two peoples, living side by side in peace and \nsecurity. We have a leadership in the Palestinian Authority that is \ncommitted to beginning negotiations while also building the \ninstitutions of a democratic Palestinian state, including effective \nsecurity forces that can enforce the rule of law and fight terrorism. \nWe have a U.S. administration, and U.S. Congress, that is committed to \nbeing engaged in and supportive of the pursuit of peace in the Middle \nEast.\n  So let us focus on the opportunity we have, the United States and \nIsrael together, as historic allies, to achieve goals that serve both \nour interests. The United States is completely committed to Israel's \nsecurity, so Israel can feel totally confident in taking on the large \nand difficult decisions that peace requires. As the Vice President \nsaid, there should be no space between these allies--none.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman).

Mr. President, the House is on my mind right \nnow, since the House seems to have something important going on with \nregard to something known as health care reform and health insurance \nreform. We are waiting expectantly to hear information that the House \nwill get the votes together and pass the Senate-passed bill on health \nreform that we passed on Christmas Eve.\n  But I came to speak about another subject today, something I voted on \nwhen I was a young Congressman, way back in 1980, and that something \nwas known as the Clean Water and Clean Air Act. One of the parts of \nthat legislation--it has a fancy name, but in essence that is what it \nwas, clean air and clean water--one of the major thrusts of the \nlegislation was that we had these toxic waste dumps all over the \ncountry. They were first exposed by a toxic canal, called Love Canal, \nin the State of New York. The cause for the toxic dump, the company, \nwas long since gone, probably bankrupt, and, therefore, there was no \nfinancial means by which we could go about cleaning it up. We couldn't \nget to the responsible party because they had long since left town or \nthey had long since gone through a series of bankruptcies and there \nwere no funds available to clean it up, and that left it on all the \nrest of us--the taxpayers.\n  What we found was there were a lot of these places all over the \ncountry. This was particularly true in my State of Florida. All of \nthese sites are now called Superfund sites, named after the trust fund \nthat was being set up, filled with trust fund money that would come \nfrom a fee being imposed upon the industries that were doing the \npolluting. The concept was that the polluter was going to pay instead \nof the average taxpayer, and they called this trust fund the Superfund. \nSo they called these sites the Superfund sites. In my State, we have 52 \nof these sites, and we have another 13 identified. But nationwide there \nare over 1,200 of these sites that have already been named and which \nneed to be cleaned up.\n  Here is the problem. Why aren't they cleaned up? Well, as I said, \nwhen I was a young Congressman and we passed this new law, we were \ngoing to have the financial means to clean up these sites by having the \nindustries that were polluting pay a fee that annually would go into \nthis trust fund and, in return, they were getting something. They were \ngetting relieved of any financial liability. That was the deal. This \nlaw operated along fine for about 15 years, and it came up for renewal, \nand lo and behold, those industries activated their lobbyists and they \nkilled the reimposition of that fee in the mid-1990s. So they got off \nscot free because they don't have any more liability, but they are not \npaying their fair share.\n  The industries were the petroleum industry--and it was a minor tax \nthat was imposed on the production of oil and the importation of \nforeign oil into this country--and the chemical industry, in 42 \nchemicals that were produced, and there was a small fee that was \nassessed for that which went in and filled up this fund basically to \nthe tune of about $1.3 billion a year. But along come the mid-1990s and \nthose industries activate their lobbyists and they kill the fees on a \ngoing-forward basis--but they didn't kill their relief from liability.\n\n  What we have now is a trust fund that is depleted of money. We have\n\n[[Page S1500]]\n\nover 1,200 sites all over the country that desperately need to be \ncleaned up. There is no money except going to the American taxpayer and \ngetting the money to keep cleaning up these sites.\n  What we need to do is to reimpose the fee so we go back to the \noriginal agreement with these polluting industries; in other words, the \npolluters paid into the trust fund and they got that in exchange for \nrelieving them of liability for the pollution that left these toxic \ndumps.\n  I am introducing legislation that would cause this to occur. The \nPresident has recommended it. He has recommended a provision by which \nit would fill the trust fund partially by $1.3 billion in the first \nyear from these fees and thereafter $2.5 billion a year. I am changing \nthe recommendation from the President a little bit because the \nPresident is imposing a corporate fee as well and I do not think that \ncorporations that did not have anything to do with polluting ought to \nbe paying this fee. I think it ought to be assessed only on those \ncorporations that were a part of the polluting under the original \ntheory of the law back in 1980, so that is how I have changed the \nlegislation from what the President has recommended. I will be \nintroducing this shortly. I am going to send it around to our \ncolleagues and I hope they will join me as cosponsors.\n  I want to tell you about one of these sites I visited this morning in \nJacksonville, FL. It is right on the St. Johns River. It is right next \nto one of the main sites of the Port of Jacksonville, which is a major \nnational seaport. It is 31 acres and it is all fenced, with signs with \na skull and crossbones that say: Don't go on the property because you \ncould get cancer.\n  As a matter of fact, EPA has done an analysis of this. They say the \ntoxic chemicals on this site, if somebody were to drink the water, if \nsomebody were to live there, if somebody were to go and scratch around \nin the sand, they could be exposed to cancer-causing agents. Can you \nimagine. That is right in the middle of a big city, next to the St. \nJohns River where the runoff is going into the St. Johns River, and \nguess who is ingesting that? The fish in the river and the mammals in \nthe river.\n  What we need to do is clean up these sites. This site is a typical \none. It started over a century ago, in the late 1890s. It was a \nfertilizer plant. It operated for almost a century. It was shut down in \nthe 1980s and then it was declared a Superfund site a few years ago. \nAnalysis showed just what kind of toxic things were there. EPA, doing \nan analysis of this, has said it could affect nervous disorders; it \ncould cause cancer. They have gone through a whole list of potential \nterrible health effects that could occur from something that could come \nfrom somebody being exposed to this site.\n  There is another reason we want to close up this site. That is that \nthis 31 acres is sitting right next to the major part of the Port of \nJacksonville, which is going to significantly expand once the Panama \nCanal is widened and the superships that have these cargo containers on \nthem are able to come from Asia, through the Panama Canal to the east \ncoast of the United States. The Port of Jacksonville will significantly \nexpand and this particular location called the Talleyrand part of the \nPort of Jacksonville will be able to expand by 31 acres, right on the \nSt. Johns River, right next to the Port of Jacksonville. That is highly \ndesirable real estate, of which you cannot dare even go through the \nfence and walk on the land because of the potential toxic exposure.\n  Remember, this is just one of 1,200 sites across America that needs \nto be cleaned up. That is the reason people now should clearly \nunderstand, under the theory that the polluter pays, why we need to \nreinstitute the original agreement struck in 1980 for the trust fund to \nbe filled by the fee associated with these toxic substances and \ntherefore be able to clean up these sites for the benefit of the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate returns today to creating jobs. \nToday, we return to the HIRE Act.\n  This bill provides incentives for businesses to hire new employees, \nand it encourages businesses to invest in building their operations.\n  It has a payroll tax exemption for newly hired employees. It provides \ncontinued funding for the vital Federal highway program. It expands the \nsuccessful Build America Bonds program. And it extends the tax \nincentive in section 179 of the Tax Code, which allows small businesses \nto expense capital expenditures, instead of depreciating them over \ntime.\n  These proposals will help to get Americans back to work.\n  The Senate passed the HIRE Act last month, with strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Since then, the House of Representatives considered the legislation \nand returned it to the Senate with some modifications.\n  The HIRE Act includes the Schumer-Hatch payroll tax exemption for \nnewly hired employees. This is a straightforward tax cut: If you hire a \nperson who has been unemployed for 60 days, you don't have to pay your \nshare of the Social Security payroll taxes for that person for the rest \nof the year.\n  And if you keep the newly hired person employed for 1 year, you get \nan additional income tax credit.\n  The House modified the Schumer-Hatch payroll tax exemption to allow \nemployers to receive the exemption if they pay the railroad retirement \ntax instead of the Social Security payroll tax.\n  The House also included modifications to ease implementation of the \npayroll tax exemption.\n  This payroll tax exemption provides a simple and immediate tax \nincentive for businesses to employ new workers, right away. A business \ncan use the cash that it saves from the payroll tax cut to help pay the \nwages of the new employee. Or it can invest in equipment. Either way, \nthe incentive will help boost hiring and help businesses.\n  The HIRE Act will also create jobs in the transportation sector, by \nextending the 2009 highway funding level through the end of 2010.\n  Highway construction plays a vital role in our economy. The \nDepartment of Transportation estimates that every $1 billion in Federal \nhighway spending--when coupled with the State or local matching share--\ncreates or sustains 34,500 jobs. These are jobs in construction, \nengineering, manufacturing and other sectors hard-hit by the recession.\n  The HIRE Act keeps the program working.\n  The HIRE Act also expands the successful Build America Bonds program. \nLast month, Treasury Secretary Geithner testified before the Finance \nCommittee that the Build America Bonds program is the most successful\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\nstimulus program based on jobs per dollar.\n  And the HIRE Act extends the enhanced expensing provision in section \n179 of the Tax Code. This valuable tax incentive allows small business \ntaxpayers to write off up to $250,000 of certain capital expenditures \nin 2010, instead of depreciating those costs over time.\n  This helps small businesses to pay less in taxes now, and thus meet \ntheir needs for cash in this difficult time.\n  The American economy has lost more than 7 million jobs. And the \nunemployment rate is near 10 percent.\n  We need to help people to get jobs. We need to do more to help \nbusinesses to hire more workers. The HIRE Act does just that.\n  And so, let us help America's businesses to create more jobs. Let us \ncomplete our work on this commonsense legislation. And let us send the \nHIRE Act to the President, so that this law can start creating jobs \nright away.\n\n\n                                  PEOs\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I would like to ask the \nchairman of the Finance Committee and its ranking member a question on \nthe application of the pending legislation, H.R. 2847, the Hiring \nIncentives to Restore Employment Act, to Professional Employer \nOrganizations or PEOs.\n  In my State we have over 700,000 workers in Florida who are working \nin PEO arrangements regulated by Florida law. PEOs in my State work \nwith over 50,000 businesses, most of them small, providing a range of \nhuman resource-related services. I would like to ask the Senators to \nconfirm that for purposes of the retention credit for newly hired \nindividuals contained in the legislation the rules for eligibility and \ncalculating the credits would be applied to each business working with \na PEO as if the business was not in a PEO relationship. In other words, \nthe retention credit would be claimed by the business in these cases.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator from Florida is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with the chairman.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to concur in the House amendments to the Senate amendment to the \nHouse amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2847 shall be brought \nto a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from North Carolina (Mrs. Hagan), and the Senator \nfrom Montana (Mr. Tester) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Utah (Mr. Bennett), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), the \nSenator from South Carolina (Mr. DeMint), the Senator from New \nHampshire (Mr. Gregg), the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch), and the \nSenator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``nay.'' The Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 61, nays 30, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 49 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--61\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burr\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Harkin\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--30\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Brownback\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hutchison\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--9\n\n     Bennett\n     Bunning\n     Byrd\n     DeMint\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Hatch\n     Tester\n     Voinovich\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 61, the nays are \n30. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are now postcloture. It is my \nunderstanding that my Republican colleagues wanted some opportunity to \ntalk about this bill. We certainly have no problem with doing that.\n  I ask, however, that we have a definite time to vote on this \nlegislation. I hope we could do it before our caucuses tomorrow. I ask \nmy distinguished friend, the Republican leader, to comment on when he \nexpects being able to vote on this legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my members are here and ready to talk. \nWe are going to be talking about health care, which is the most \nimportant issue in the country. We are fully prepared to discuss it \nthroughout.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much my friend being candid in that \nregard. I ask unanimous consent that we have the vote on this matter by \n12 o'clock noon tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as I just indicated, we are here. We \nhave been notified by the other side that they wish to have a lengthy \ndiscussion. We are here and prepared to do that and fully intend to \ntalk about what we view as the flaws in the health care proposal that \nwill be voted on in the House apparently sometime later this week. \nTherefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we in America today have a major problem, \nand that is jobs. I appreciate the bipartisan support of this bill; it \nhas been bipartisan, but we need to get to this bill and pass it so we \ncan start having small businesses take the tax credits that are going \nto be available in this legislation to allow the Build America bonds to \nbe replenished. We need to make sure that the highway budgets go \nforward as quickly as possible.\n  I understand the efforts to divert attention from the issue at hand, \nbut there is going to be plenty of time to talk about health care. \nLet's get this done. The bill we are on now--when we finish this bill, \nthere is the FAA bill. There are amendments in that regard that have \nbeen offered. As we know, Senators can speak about any subject they \nwant. But let's get off health care for a few hours and get jobs. This \nbill should go to the President tomorrow so people can start being \nhired.\n  For example, I have a provision in this bill that will allow $45 \nmillion that\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\nhas already been appropriated, to be reprogrammed--in fact, I use that \nterm, but it will be directed by this bill--it will go to the \ntransportation departments of Nevada, $45 million. The highway \ndepartments in Nevada will build things to create jobs. That is what we \nneed to do.\n  We understand the concern people have with health care, but this is a \njobs bill. I hope that tonight if my Republican colleagues want to talk \nabout health care they will take a little consideration and understand \nthat this is a jobs bill. But the jobs before us are dealing with this \nbeautiful bill that has passed--bipartisan, a bill that will allow \nsmall businesses to take a tax credit if they hire somebody who has \nbeen out of work 60 days. It will allow someone who has a small \nbusiness who wants to buy a new machine, a new desk, new office \nequipment to write that off--not depreciate it but write it off. Of \ncourse, saving 1 million jobs with the highway bill and the Build \nAmerica Bonds.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. Certainly.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Is it not true, Mr. Leader, by the rules of the Senate, \nthat the minority could spend time talking about health care tonight, \nwithout holding up the jobs bill; that they could let the jobs bill go \nforward and then talk about health care all they wanted?\n  Mr. REID. The answer is yes. I say to my friend from New York, we \nwould be happy to give consent, if they want to talk all night on \nhealth care or whatever they want. That is fine--and we would be able \nto respond to that, of course--but let us get this done. There are \npeople waiting to buy things. Not only does this help small business \nand help them purchase items, but the businesses are going to buy \nthem--up to $250,000. In Reno or Las Vegas, this is big-time stuff, and \nI would think the same is true all over the State of New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is true.\n  Mr. REID. I would bet, in the first week, that this bill was \neffective, there would be a massive purchase of property because people \nno longer have to depreciate. They can write it off, up to $250,000. \nThat is a lot of stuff.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My good friend, the majority leader, left out one \nthing, which is this is the second time he has done what is called \nfilling the tree. What that means to the constituents we represent on \nthis side of the aisle is, we got to offer no amendments, no amendments \nwhatsoever, to this bill. This is the second time and the 27th time the \nmajority leader has filled the tree, thereby denying to the minority an \nopportunity to offer any amendments at all.\n  We can argue, I guess, about the relative merits of this bill. What \nwe do know for sure is that $47 billion of it is not paid for. So it \nadds that much additional money to the deficit. We also note, for sure, \nthe one kind of jobs this administration has been able to produce is \ngovernment jobs.\n  As a result of the spending binge we have been on for the last year, \nwe have added 120,000 government jobs. In America, if you work for the \ngovernment, you make an average of $70,000 a year. If you work in the \nprivate sector, you make an average of $40,000 a year. We have had a \njob boon all right--with the government. Of course, the stimulus \npackage principally benefitted State governments, which were very happy \nto have the money so they did not have to pare back their employment.\n  So we are interested in talking about jobs all right, but health care \nis what the majority has been trying to ram through the Congress over \nthe last year. It is the big issue this week. I am sure Members on my \nside of the aisle who will speak tonight will indeed talk about jobs, \nbut we also fully intend to talk about the health care bill that will \nbe voted on over in the House that cuts Medicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion, \nthat raises $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes, and is replete with special \ndeals. We now understand the fix-it bill--the second bill that will \ncome after the health care bill--will not fix all the special deals; \nmaybe only one of the special deals. So we will have on opportunity----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader has the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We will have an opportunity to discuss all these \nthings, and what I would suggest to the majority leader, if he wants to \nmaximize the time, we could simply agree to vote on this bill at 9 a.m. \non Wednesday and then go back to the FAA bill, upon which we have made \nsubstantial progress. That would be another way to advance the ball, \nwhich I would suggest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Kentucky said it all in the \nlast statement. He would be willing to agree to have a vote at 9 a.m. \non Wednesday morning. Why in the world would we want to waste American \ntaxpayer dollars sitting around here not sending a bill to the \nPresident? This is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill that has been widely \nacknowledged to be approved by groups such as the liberal-minded \nChamber of Commerce, the National Chamber of Commerce, and other such \ngroups. It is a bill that is so badly needed in this country.\n  I would also suggest to my friend, I don't know of a single \ngovernment job that would be produced with our HIRE bill. I don't know \nof a single job because everything we have done in the four provisions \nwill create jobs in the private sector--thousands and thousands of \njobs, new jobs, in the private sector.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Of course, I would.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Again, first, there are four provisions in this bill: \nOne is the highway bill, which as I understand it hires private sector \npeople to build highways; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Second is Build America Bonds, which allows the States \nand cities to hire private people; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. The only thing it can be used for.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Third is the depreciation for small businesses, which is \nobviously for the private sector.\n  Mr. REID. Nondepreciation. Just write it off.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Four is the provision Senator Hatch and I put forward, \nwhich gives directly to small businesses a payroll tax deduction if \nthey hire; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. The four things my friend has enunciated create not a \nsingle government job.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Let me ask one other question because my friend, the \nminority leader, talked about the $48 billion not paid for. Isn't it \ncorrect this bill is fully paid for?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I would also say, Mr. President, the State of Kentucky and \nthe State of Nevada have been having tremendous problems with a number \nof programs, one of which is Medicaid. One of the things we did in our \nrecovery package was to give all 50 States--Nevada and Kentucky, all 50 \nStates--some help with their Medicaid. The cost of health care is \nwreaking havoc with our States. There is nothing wrong with doing that. \nWe have an obligation. Medicaid was a program we started back here. To \ntalk about the States getting some kind of a big benefit they do not \ndeserve I don't think is right.\n  I met 2 weeks ago tonight in Room 219 with 12 Governors. They handed \nme a letter signed by 48 Governors all saying: We need some help, and \none of the places we need help is with Medicaid. These health care \ncosts are skyrocketing. Even though we have given help, there are very \nfew States in the Union that haven't had massive layoffs.\n  Again, I would hope we could get this out of the way and have a \ndiscussion on health care at some subsequent point. There is another \nbill that this is holding up. This bill is going to pass, and I \nappreciate very much my Republican colleagues voting for this \nlegislation, but let's not waste 30 hours because we are not only \nholding up sending this bill to the President but we are holding up \nfinishing work on the Federal Aviation Administration bill.\n  My friend has wanted to offer amendments. Amendments are being \noffered\n\n[[Page S1503]]\n\non this legislation as we do on most everything. I have been very \nnonrestrictive in how I have handled the floor. Of course, there have \nbeen occasions when we have done what has been done here for \ngenerations; that is to say, at this time, we are not going to have, on \na bill dealing with jobs, an abortion amendment, we are not going to \nhave an amendment on gay marriage or on income tax. On things such as \nthat, there comes a time.\n  On this FAA bill, the first year--the first year--the experts tell us \nwill create 150,000 jobs, but not only that, it will make air travel \nsafer. We will have the air travelers' bill of rights. We will have, \nfor the first time in the history of this country, a GPS system for our \naircraft which will allow us to do more flights into airports and to \nmake it safer.\n\n  I would hope we don't waste this time. It is Monday night, it is 10 \nafter 6. Let's not waste tonight and tomorrow and into Wednesday. Let's \nget off this, get to FAA, and if somebody wants to give a health care \nspeech and beat up on Obama, let them do it on the FAA bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As you can see, we are all in the mood for a spirited \ndebate, and I know the junior Senator from Florida is on the floor and \nanxious to begin the discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Before my friend leaves, if I could just say this. I think \nwe could probably accomplish what we both should want by saying: OK, \nlet's vote at a reasonable time Wednesday morning on this jobs bill, \nbut in the meantime--in the meantime, all day tomorrow--let's work on \nthe FAA bill. That way we would accomplish two very important things.\n  I would hope my friend would consider that. That way we could not \nonly have a time certain where we are going to pass this bill--the HIRE \nbill--but we could also work on FAA. We have Senators waiting to do \nwork on the FAA bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I could respond to the majority \nleader's suggestion, it may very well be worth talking about. As I \nunderstand the suggestion, it is that we lock in a time for a vote \ncertain, such as the one I suggested, at 9 a.m. on this bill, and we \nresume consideration of the FAA bill between now--tomorrow--and then.\n  Mr. REID. I think that is very appropriate. During that period of \ntime, people can offer amendments or, if they feel so inclined--\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think that is a matter worth talking about. Why \ndon't we put in a quorum call and have that discussion.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, we are going to have the leadership discuss \nthe process for moving forward, but I wish to take a minute and talk \nabout one of the important bipartisan provisions in the jobs bill. I \nthink colleagues know it is never hard to get me to focus on the health \nreform issue, and we are certainly going to be doing a lot of that in \nthe days ahead, but our constituents want us to focus on jobs as well \nand particularly a jobs effort that is going to work. We have that in \nthe Build America Bonds program. I say to colleagues, the Build America \nBonds program has far exceeded even the optimistic projections some of \nus had for this program.\n  I have been involved in the development of this program now for 6 \nyears. Senator Thune, on the other side of the aisle, has worked very \nclosely with me. When we started our work on the Build America Bonds \nprogram, our hope was that perhaps $4 billion or $5 billion worth of \nthese Build America Bonds would be let. What we have seen is that now \nclose to $80 billion worth of these bonds have been issued. They are \nliterally selling like hotcakes. They have revolutionized municipal \nfinance, and some have projected that perhaps this year $150 billion \nworth of these Build America Bonds will be sold.\n  So Build America Bonds work, and they put people in the private \nsector to work as well. In my home State of Oregon, it has been proven, \ntime and time again, that private investment follows well-targeted \npublic investment. That is what we are seeing with this bipartisan \nprogram, and that is why colleagues on both sides of the aisle have \nproposed expanding it.\n  I note my good friend, Senator Thune, on the other side of the aisle, \nis here. He and I have worked hand in hand on this effort because we \nwanted to have something that would create jobs in our country that was \nnonpartisan.\n  The reason Senator Thune and I have worked on this effort in a \nbipartisan way is we wanted to have something that is common sense, we \nwanted to have a jobs creation effort that responded to basic needs of \nour country, and we wanted to see it part of an effort where the \nprivate sector takes the lead.\n  I am particularly appreciative the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee is here, Chairman Baucus. I wish to express my appreciation \nto him and his staff for their help in this effort. We saw in the \nSenate Finance Committee--Chairman Baucus is here, he remembers our \ndiscussions--our projections for Build America Bonds were pretty \nmodest. The reality blew past those projections almost overnight. The \nprojections for Build America Bonds were a few billion dollars, and we \nblew past those projections like a bullet train.\n  Build America Bonds are getting desperately needed funding flowing \ninto local communities, they are creating jobs, and they are helping to \nstrengthen America's infrastructure. Almost $80 billion has been \ngenerated. This is in addition to the $80 billion of direct Federal \ninfrastructure spending that has been included in the Recovery Act.\n  I note that in the HIRE bill there is going to be an effort once \nagain to ensure there is direct support for infrastructure, and we also \nhave this very promising opportunity with the private sector that we \nhave been able to secure with Build America Bonds.\n  When a project is funded with Build America Bonds, the Federal \nGovernment pays a portion of the finance costs. It equals a very small \npercentage, perhaps a single-digit percentage of the total project \ncost. The city or State pays almost the entire cost of the project over \ntime.\n  A project that is funded with direct spending will often have the \nFederal Government pay 50 percent or 75 percent of the project costs. \nSome communities need that kind of help to get needed projects off the \nground. But when some argued that projects should only be funded with \ndirect spending, I thought it was important to look for other \nopportunities. That is why Build America Bonds came into existence. It \nis not possible, given the enormous needs for infrastructure \nimprovements, for roads and bridges and transportation systems, to rely \njust on direct spending or rely just on bonds. What we ought to do is \nwhat we have done here in the Senate on a bipartisan basis; that is, \nput more options in the tool box for funding infrastructure. Of course, \ndirect spending will be important. What we have seen is Build America \nBonds take off as an additional tool.\n  In my home State, in the Dayton School District, they are using Build \nAmerica Bonds to employ up to 150 people building and remodeling \nclassrooms. By using Build America Bonds, this small school district in \nmy home State saved an estimated $1.2 million in interest costs.\n  Up in Washington State, in Grand Coulee, the Coulee Medical Center \nwas able to finance a new hospital building with Build America Bonds, \nsaving more than $7 million in finance costs. They were able to start \nconstruction immediately. We had discussion on the floor earlier--are \nthese government jobs? What that project did was put people in the \nprivate sector to work--construction workers, plumbers, electricians, \ntradesmen. Once the building, of course, is completed at the end of the \nyear, doctors and nurses, clerks and\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\nsupport staff get to work in the new hospital.\n  Recently, a joint Congressional Budget Office-Joint Tax Committee \nreport highlighted other benefits flowing from Build America Bonds. As \nmy friend Senator Thune, who is in the Chamber, knows about Build \nAmerica Bonds, this report shows that tax-credit bonds, such as Build \nAmerica Bonds, can be more effective than tax-exempt bonds. The report \nalso concluded that because the bonds are more attractive to investors, \nthey are more efficient at raising capital.\n  Once again, Democrats and Republicans have been able to come together \nin the Senate to advance a fresh approach that saves municipalities \ntime and money and effort that can otherwise be devoted to other \npriorities.\n  Aside from the fact that the funds are raised efficiently, they are \nanswering a cry we hear again and again; that is, get the job done \nquickly. People are frustrated that sometimes it takes eons for \ngovernment to work out the particular project, particularly in the \ntransportation area. Bond funds need to be spent within 2 years of the \ndate the bond is issued. What that means is money is not just flowing \ninto projects, it is being spent in the short term. People get back to \nwork quickly. You get more bang for your dollar, and that obviously is \nwhat Americans are asking for, and Build America Bonds deliver.\n  Back in the days before these bonds were issued, the market for the \ntraditional, normal municipal bond was just about frozen. It was hard \nto sell them. Now Build America Bonds have changed that. The private \nsector is strongly supporting this program. Groups such as the Chamber \nof Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers and \nbusinesses across the country are saying they need a fresh approach to \nbuild infrastructure. Particularly with Build America Bonds, we are now \nseeing businesses say this is an approach that gives them a long-term \nboost to what they know they can count on. They can plan new avenues \nfor their businesses when they know there is going to be infrastructure \nthere to support it.\n  It is not, however, just businesses that are buying Build America \nBonds. Nonprofits such as pension funds are finding these bonds are an \nattractive investment. Nonprofits cannot benefit from the tax credits, \nbut bond issuers can pass on the value of the tax credits in the form \nof a higher interest rate for Build America Bonds than other types of \nbonds. By contrast, traditional tax-exempt municipal bonds have not \nbeen a good investment for pension funds and other institutional \ninvestors that do not pay taxes. What Build America Bonds have been \nable to do is provide a way for nonprofits to invest in American \ninfrastructure that traditional tax-exempt bonds don't provide.\n  We are not surprised that Build America Bonds are reinventing the \nmunicipal bond market. We were told by people in the private sector, in \nthe States, in the finance community, all across the country, that they \nthought this was a chance to, in effect, unfreeze the municipal bond \nmarket that had been frozen in Illinois, in Oregon, in South Dakota, \nand across the country. In some cases, these bonds are going to make \nthe difference between whether the infrastructure projects come to \nfruition. In other cases, they are going to lower the cost of the \nprojects and allow the community to reinvest the savings in other \nprojects.\n  By any scenario, the Build America Bonds program helps local \ngovernment, local businesses, and those who rely on them for jobs and \ndependable infrastructure. In my view, that is exactly what the \nAmerican people are looking for from their elected officials--something \nthat works, something that is common sense, something that is \nbipartisan, something with a proven track record. That is, in fact, the \nBuild America Bonds program.\n  Let me close with one last point. There have been discussions--and we \nhave been in consultation with Chairman Baucus and the Senate Finance \nCommittee staff on this--about financial institutions and whether the \nfees they are charging are appropriate for the issuance of Build \nAmerica Bonds. First of all, it has been the position of Chairman \nBaucus, myself, and others that anybody who tries to take advantage of \nState and municipal issuers needs to understand that the Senate Finance \nCommittee is going to have a zero tolerance policy--zero tolerance \npolicy--for ripping off the taxpayers. This program is designed to \ncreate jobs and make infrastructure funding more efficient and \ncertainly not create any opportunities for somebody to try to skate \naround the rules and to take advantage of taxpayers.\n  In the Senate Finance Committee--and I am very appreciative of \nChairman Baucus taking this approach. The Congress included a 2-percent \nlimit on the amount of fees issuers of Build America Bonds can charge. \nIn practice, the typical fee, in fact, has been far less than the \nstatutory maximum fee that is allowed.\n  As the market for Build America Bonds has grown--and I pointed out \nthat it has mushroomed far beyond projections--the fees have kept \ncoming down. They have come down close to the levels currently charged \nfor tax-exempt bonds. With Build America Bonds having become well \nestablished--in fact, they now represent 20 percent of the municipal \nbond market--in our view, there simply is no longer a justification for \ncharging a higher fee.\n\n  As the expiration of the Build America Bonds program approaches at \nthe end of the year--and I am very glad the administration has proposed \nmaking the program permanent--I intend to keep monitoring the fees \ncharged for issuing the bonds. If some can present the case that it is \nappropriate to further reduce the statutory cap on fees, I am certainly \nopen to listening to it. I want to make sure every single dime of \ntaxpayer money goes to these bondholders.\n  I am open to listening to any suggestions and any ideas to make a \nprogram that works, a program that Senator Thune and I have worked on \ntogether for many months that is working--we are certainly open to \nideas for improving on it.\n  I see my friend from Florida is anxious to speak. I appreciate his \ndesire to talk tonight.\n  Let's keep focusing--whether it is health care, whether it is \ntransportation, whether it is tax reform--on ideas that bring the \nSenate together. I wanted to take a few minutes to talk about Build \nAmerica Bonds specifically tonight. Again, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee is in the Chamber. I am very appreciative of his support and \nSenator Grassley's support. As the majority leader, Senator Reid, noted \nearlier tonight, we have to zero in on jobs. There is no economic \nmultiplier out there like jobs. If you put people to work, as I \noutlined--construction workers, electricians, plumbers--restaurants \nmake the sandwiches to feed all the men and women who are doing the \nwork. Let's keep coming back to approaches that bring both sides \ntogether. I have tried to do that in health care, in tax reform, and \ncertainly in transportation, where Senator Thune and I have been able \nto team up on something that works and is being used around the \ncountry. Let's remember that is what is needed right now when our folks \nare hurting. When they are looking for approaches that are common \nsense, that are nonpartisan, we can give them one specifically with the \nBuild America Bonds program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for his \ngood words tonight and for his approach in trying to do things in a \nbipartisan way.\n  There are some good things in this jobs bill. I think the issue we on \nthis side of the Chamber have had is we would have liked to have \noffered some amendments. The 18 million people I represent in Florida \nexpect that we have the opportunity to offer amendments, to bring up \nideas, good ideas, and let those ideas rise and fall depending upon \ntheir merit. Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to have \namendments. My colleague, the Republican leader, said earlier what was \ndone on the majority side was something called filling the tree. What \ndoes that mean? It means we do not have the opportunity to bring \nforward our good ideas. The people of Florida, the people of all of our \nStates, expect that we get to do that. So while there are some good \nthings in here, it is a shame that we could not have made this bill \nbetter.\n\n[[Page S1505]]\n\n  What I really want to speak about tonight is the debate Americans are \nhaving around their living room tables and around their kitchen tables \nabout this health care bill. This is a trillion-dollar bill that is \nbeing discussed in this country and that we now hear is going to go \nthrough the House of Representatives and possibly come back to this \nChamber through a procedure called reconciliation.\n  It occurs to me that what we are dealing with here is a little bit of \nfantasy land. Why do I say that? This weekend, I took my kids to see \n``Alice in Wonderland.'' That is a famous story. It occurred to me that \nwe are creating our own sort of wonderland here in the Senate.\n  A lot of things have been said about this health care bill, what it \ndoes and what it does not do. I thought tonight it would be important \nto go through the representations that are being made to the American \npeople as to whether we should pass this health care bill. Let's go \nthrough all the things we have heard, things that President Obama has \nsaid, things that Members of the majority have said in this Chamber as \nto why we should pass this health care bill.\n  Let me first say that everybody believes we need health care reform \nin this country. We have 4 million-plus Americans who do not have \nhealth insurance. Nearly 4 million Floridians do not have health \ninsurance.\n  We know the cost of health insurance is too high for those Americans \nwho have health insurance. In the last 10 years, health insurance costs \nhave risen by 130 percent. That is unsustainable. It is something that \nis afflicting the people of Florida and all across this country.\n  It is hard to make ends meet when your salary may be going down or \nyou may have lost your job but your health care costs continue to go \nup. So there is no debate within this Chamber that we should do \nsomething. Of course, we should do something. The debate is about what \nwe should do.\n  On this side of the aisle, we would like to take a step-by-step \napproach. We would like to go after the cost of health care. We would \nlike to increase competition in health care so that costs could \nactually go down. We would like to put patients back in charge of their \nhealth care purchasing decisions.\n  We know if the consumer is back involved the price of health care \nwill go down. But we find ourselves having to vote on this massive new \ngovernment entitlement program, a program that I cannot support because \nI do not believe it will be in the best interests of Floridians.\n  Last Monday I was down in South Florida, down in Miami and Fort \nLauderdale. In Fort Lauderdale I had the opportunity to have a townhall \nmeeting where we specifically talked about health care. In that meeting \nI had many Floridians come up to the microphone and ask questions. Most \nof them were bewildered about this plan. They wanted to know why we cut \na $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare. Medicare is health care for seniors. \nWhy would we create a new program by cutting a program we have now that \nis already in financial trouble?\n  We know in the next 7 years Medicare is going to have its own \nsolvency problems. Why would we take money out of health care for \nseniors--more than 3 million Floridians in that program--to start a new \nprogram?\n  They want to know why we are going to raise taxes on medicine and \nhealth care devices which we know will increase the cost of health \ncare. They want to know why we are creating a $1 trillion new \nentitlement program when we cannot afford the entitlement programs we \nhave, when we cannot afford the $12 trillion debt we are saddling upon \nour children and our grandchildren.\n  So with that, I would like to go through some of the myths, some of \nthe myths that have been created in this wonderland I spoke about \nbefore, and try to debunk those myths and say what is in this bill and \nlet the facts speak for themselves.\n  The first myth--and the President likes to say this; he said it again \ntoday in a rally--if you like your health insurance, you can keep it \nunder his proposal. Well, it is simply not true. The Congressional \nBudget Office has said between 8 and 9 million people who would be \ncovered by employment-based plans under current law would not have the \noffer of such a proposal. Why is this going to happen? Because under \nthe incentives and penalties this bill creates, businesses are going to \ndrop health insurance for their employees and put them into the \ngovernment-subsidized system.\n  So for those 8 or 9 million Americans, they are not going to get to \nkeep the health insurance they have now. They are not going to be able \nto keep the health care they want.\n  Rick Foster, the CMS Actuary--and those are the folks who administer \nMedicare and Medicaid--says the number could even be higher. He \nconcluded that 17 million people will lose their employer-sponsored \ncoverage. Seventeen million people will not be able to keep the health \ncare they enjoy today. So what the President says is simply not the \ncase.\n  Second, we know under this myth that you will be able to keep the \nhealth care if you like it, that people who have Medicare Advantage, \nMedicare Part C, a lot of them will not be able to keep their program \neither. Medicare Advantage is a promise that offers extra benefits for \nfolks on Medicare.\n  If you sign up for it, you get wellness benefits, you get hearing \nbenefits, you get dental benefits oftentimes. People like it. We have \nmore than 1 million people in Florida on Medicare Advantage. This bill \ncuts $120 billion out of Medicare Advantage.\n  Now, I am not sure how it is going to impact Florida. There was this \nFlorida fix that was going to be an off-ramp, not an exit. But over \nseveral years they would be in the same situation as the rest of the \nfolks in America. I do not know whether that is going to make it into \nthe final bill. But I do know we are going to cut $120 billion out of \nMedicare Advantage. When that happens, according to Rick Foster, the \nCMS Actuary, lower benchmarks will reduce Medicare Advantage rebates to \nplans and thereby result in less generous benefit packages.\n  He estimates in 2015, enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans would \ndecrease by about 33 percent. So for many folks, they are going to get \ndropped by their employer and not be able to keep the health care plan \nthey have now. For many folks on Medicare Advantage, they are going to \nget dropped as well, as much as 33 percent by 2015. You are not going \nto be able to keep the health insurance you have now.\n  We also know these mandates that exist in this bill are going to \nchange your health insurance policy. If the government deems that your \nhealth insurance plan does not pass muster, they are going to mandate \nthat your health insurance plan change.\n  Now, you may like your health insurance plan the way you have it. You \nmay have a high deductible. You may have bought catastrophic insurance. \nYou may not want to buy a comprehensive health insurance plan that is \nsoup to nuts; you may only want certain things covered.\n  Well, under this plan, under this bill, there are going to be certain \nmandates put in place, and you may not be able to keep the type of \ninsurance you have. So for those three instances alone--for people who \nare going to get dropped by their employer and get forced into the \npublic plan, for people who are Medicare Advantage, and for people who \nhave a certain type of insurance plan--they may not be able to keep it.\n  So we know, unfortunately, what the President is telling us about \nthis bill is not true. Myth No. 1 is busted.\n  Myth No. 2: Your health insurance premiums will go down. Why did he \nget involved in this whole debate to start with? What was told to the \nAmerican people during the Presidential campaign in 2008 and since the \ntime that we have discussed this health care plan? That we were going \nto lower the cost of health insurance for most Americans.\n  That is not going to happen under this plan. We are not going to \nlower the cost of health insurance. In fact, for some Americans the \nprice is going to go up. Table 1--I hate to get into the weeds, but \nlet's look at the facts.\n  We have the CBO report I cited earlier. There is a Table 1 on page 5 \nof that Congressional Budget Office report that analyzes this plan. It \ngoes through what people have in the current insurance market.\n  There are about 25 million people in the small group market. There \nare 134\n\n[[Page S1506]]\n\nmillion people in the large group market. That is 159 million Americans \nwho have health insurance. So the small group market, it is estimated \nthe cost increase or savings is between a 1-percent increase or down 2 \npercent.\n  For those in the large group, it is zero to potentially minus 3 \npercent. So this is not reducing the cost of health insurance in any \nmeaningful way. For individuals who are out there who are not in a \ngroup, who are purchasing insurance individually, the Congressional \nBudget Office says their cost of health insurance will go up 10 to 13 \npercent.\n  So the whole very reason, the primary reason we are about the \nbusiness allegedly of debating health care and passing this big bill \nwas to lower the cost of health insurance for most Americans. Not only \nis it not going to lower the cost of health insurance for most \nAmericans, it is going to increase it for those who are in the \nindividual market.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Table 1 be printed in the Record.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. So you are not going to be able to keep your health \ninsurance, for a lot of Americans, if you like it, and the cost of \nhealth insurance is not going to go down. Those two myths have been \nbusted.\n  Myth No. 3: This plan, the Democratic plan, will lower costs, lower \nthe cost of health care overall. We have all heard about--and I said \nbefore the rising cost of health care, 130 percent in the past 10 \nyears. There is an expression, ``bending the cost curve down,'' making \nsure that we can get control of costs. This plan is not going to do \nthat. This plan does not have mechanisms, true mechanisms in it to \nreally control costs.\n  In today's Washington Post, Robert Samuelson takes on the President's \nclaim that his plan will control costs.\n  In this article, he talks about the fact that when people get \ninsurance they use more health services; that spending rises and by the \ngovernment's latest forecast health spending goes from 17 percent of \nthe economy in 2009 to 19 percent in 2019.\n  According to the CMS Actuary, he estimates overall national health \nexpenditures under this bill will increase by an estimated total of \n$222 billion during 2010 to 2019.\n  It is also going to increase the government's share of health care \nspending. According to the CBO, under the legislation, national outlays \nfor health care would increase by $210 billion over the next 10 years. \nSo we are just chasing our tails. We are going to put a lot more money \ninto health care, but we are not going to reduce costs.\n  How could we reduce costs? How do we get at the problem of increased \nhealth care? Well, we could try to foster more competition among health \ninsurance companies instead of creating these subsidies, which is going \nto plow more money into the insurance companies.\n  We could make the insurance companies compete across State lines. \nThat is one of the ideas the Republicans have brought forward. We also \ncould go after meaningful lawsuit reform. There is one estimate we \nwould save more than $50 billion a year if we had meaningful lawsuit \nreform.\n  My colleague, Senator Coburn from Oklahoma, talks about the fact, \nbeing a practicing physician, that doctors are engaged in defensive \nmedicine, and when thousands of kids across this country this year get \nhit in the nose with a baseball they are going to show up at the \nemergency room. Instead of just watching the patient and making sure \nthe kid is going to be OK, they are going to order a CT scan even if \none is not necessary because that has become the standard operating \nprocedure in order to protect the doctor from lawsuits.\n  The CBO says if we had real medical malpractice reform, we could save \nas much as $54 billion over the next decade. We also do not have \ntransparency. Here is the essential problem with health care costs. We \ndo not know what anything costs.\n  In the next couple of days my wife and I are going to be fortunate \nenough to have our fourth child. She is due any day now. When we go to \nthe hospital, we are going to get back--after that baby is born, just \nlike we have done with the last three kids, we are going to get back a \nbill. It is going to be page after page after page of things that we \ncannot understand.\n  At the bottom of the bill, we will pay some small fraction because we \nhave good health insurance in the Senate. We will pay some small \nfraction of the total bill, and we will never question the pages and \npages and pages of line items of information we do not understand.\n  We will not because we do not have to pay for it, and we, as \nconsumers, have been removed from the transaction in health insurance \nbecause of third-party payers, whether it be Medicare, Medicaid, or \ninsurance companies. We are not involved in that transaction.\n  Now, let me give you a different example. If we had to look at that \nbill because we were responsible for a portion of it because we were \ngiven, say, a tax credit to go out and buy insurance, and we were \ntrying to get the most bang for the buck, and they tried to add $75 for \na bedpan or gauze or for Band-Aids, Mrs. LeMieux would not pay for \nthat. Mrs. LeMieux would be in there saying: Wait a minute. I can go to \nTarget and I can get Band-Aids for $1.50, not $75.\n  I guarantee you that the men and women of this country, if they \nreally had to look at those bills because they really had to pay them, \nwe would not have these exploding costs. We also would not have all of \nthe cost shifting that is going around.\n  The dirty secret about health care is that if I have insurance, my \nfull payment on insurance or close to the full payment is going to pay \nfor the Medicare patient and the Medicaid patient because Medicare and \nMedicaid do not pay enough for the services they render.\n  The hospitals cost shift all the money around. At the end of the day, \nwe don't have a transparent system or a market-driven system. What we \nshould do is give every American who needs it a tax credit to buy \nhealth insurance on their own. If they were out in the marketplace, \nthat would lower cost, because competition would reign and they would \ninsist on bang for their buck. But that is not in this bill. We know \nnow that, one, you will not be able to keep, in a lot of cases, your \nhealth insurance, if you like it. We know, two, it is not going to \nreduce your cost of health care. And we know, three, it will not lower \nthe cost of health care in general. Those myths have been busted.\n  Let me go to the next one, myth No. 4: The Democrats' plan will \nreduce the deficit. We have heard this estimate that over $100 billion \nis going to be saved over the next 10 years. Not true. The way this is \nscored or evaluated by the CBO is that whatever you send them, they \nhave to give you an answer back on the confines and the specifications \nof what you sent. So the Democrats' bill has 6 years of spending or \nbenefits and 10 years of taxes. If they have 10 years of taxes and only \n6 years of spending, then they can get to a situation where the CBO \nwill come back and say: It is going to reduce the deficit. But if you \ncompare apples to apples, spending to deficit, if you compare spending \nto taxes, we know it is going to run a deficit. You cannot create a new \nentitlement program and not run a deficit. It is going to cost us, by \nsome estimates, more than $400 billion over a 10-year period, in the \nfirst 10 years, and $1.4 trillion in the next 10 years. We know that \nmyth is busted. It is not going to reduce the deficit.\n  Let me also say this is going to be a budget buster for States. The \nStates, unlike the Federal Government, have to make ends meet. The \nStates have balanced budget requirements. As we increase the \nrequirements of Medicaid, which this bill does, then we will be putting \nincreased burdens upon our States. Our States are going to have to find \nmore money to put into Medicaid. They can't print money like the \nFederal Government. They can't spend more than they take in. What is \ngoing to happen? They are going to have to cut other programs, or they \nwill have to raise taxes. What is going to get hurt? I can cite the \nexample of Florida where they are suffering under a huge and emerging \nMedicaid problem. Medicaid and Health and Human Services is the No. 1 \nportion of the budget of the State of Florida. It grows every year. So \nwhat loses out? Education, money for teachers and schools, law \nenforcement, protecting the environment, and economic stimulus. Florida \nhas to live\n\n[[Page S1507]]\n\nwithin its means, unlike the Federal Government.\n  This is not a Republican or Democratic issue. Governors of both sides \nof the aisle are very concerned about the increased mandates placed \nupon States. Governor Phil Bredesen of Tennessee called this bill the \nmother of all unfunded mandates. The head of Washington State's \nMedicaid Program believes that States facing severe financial distress \nmay say they have to get out of the Medicaid Program altogether.\n  CBO released its first estimate of expected discretionary spending \nunder this bill, confirming that $10 to $20 billion in discretionary \nspending over the next decade will be used to implement this \nlegislation. We are going to spend $10 to $20 billion to implement this \nbill; $5 to $10 billion to the IRS and to Health and Human Services. \nAlso in terms of this topic, of looking at how the plan will reduce the \ndeficit, which it will not, we know this is going to be a $1 trillion \nprogram over time. With rare exception, when this Congress creates a \nprogram, especially an entitlement program, it does not stay within its \nestimates. It grows and grows.\n  We have a debt. When I first came to the Senate and had the privilege \nto serve here back in September of last year, we were at something like \n$11.6 or $11.7 trillion. Now we are already at $12.4 trillion. It is \nunsustainable.\n  The fifth myth: Medicare cuts won't affect seniors. This bill cuts \nhalf of a trillion dollars out of Medicare. Some say this is savings. \nThe money that is going to be saved is not going back into Medicare to \nprolong the life of Medicare. We had an amendment from my colleague \nSenator Gregg who said that any savings would have to go into Medicare. \nThe majority party defeated that amendment.\n  It makes no sense to me that we would take half a trillion dollars \nout of Medicare to create a new entitlement program. I can't go back to \nmy seniors in Florida, more than 3 million of them, and say: Your \nMedicare Program is already facing insolvency in about 7 years, but we \nare going to take a half a trillion dollars out of it now to create a \nnew health care program.\n  This could not be good for seniors. On its effect on Medicare, there \nwas a letter from the CBO Director to the majority leader, Senator \nReid. He warned that while the effects of the cuts to Medicare remain \nunclear, they could reduce access to care or diminish the quality of \ncare. Let's go through the cuts: $135 billion from hospitals; $120 \nbillion from Medicare Advantage; nearly $15 billion from nursing homes; \n$40 billion from home health agencies, $7 billion from hospice. The CMS \nActuary says that many of the Medicare cuts are unrelated to the \nproviders' cost of furnishing services to beneficiaries. That means it \nis not about savings. That means the money is being taken from \nMedicare, robbing Peter to pay Paul. He concludes it is doubtful that \nproviders could reduce cost to keep up with these cuts. The CMS Actuary \nalso finds that because of the bill's severe cuts to Medicare, \nproviders for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive portion of their \nbusiness could find it difficult to remain profitable and might end \ntheir participation in the program.\n  What does this mean in plain language? We are not paying these health \ncare providers enough under Medicare, but we are going to take out \nstill more money, and they will not be Medicare providers anymore. They \nwill not provide health care for seniors. If you want to see the future \nof this, look at Medicaid. Medicaid is even one step worse in trouble \nthan Medicare is. We know now that folks who are entering into the \nMedicaid system who are trying to find a specialist in a metropolitan \narea, half of them can't find a specialist. We know in Medicare, \naccording to a June 2008 Medicare Payment Advisory Commission Report, \nthat 29 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries it surveyed had trouble \nfinding a primary care doctor. That is up from 24 percent in 2007. If \nthe doctor is not in, it is not health care reform.\n  How can I go back to my seniors in Florida and say: We are creating a \nnew program by taking money out of your program, and you may not be \nable to find a doctor who is going to see you anymore? That is not \nconscionable.\n  Florida will be disproportionately affected by these cuts. It has the \nsecond highest population of seniors and highest concentration of \nseniors in the Nation at 19 percent. Let me tell you how it will \nspecifically hurt one portion of health care for seniors, home health \ncare. I talked to Ron Malone, vice president of Gentiva Health \nServices, one of the largest providers of home health services in \nFlorida. He said: Look, it is not going to hurt us so much. We are a \nbig company. We can spread costs. We will get more market share. But it \nis going to hurt the smaller companies, and a lot of the smaller \ncompanies are going to go out of business.\n  How is that health care reform? Who do we owe an obligation to \nprovide health care more than to our seniors?\n  I recently visited with the president of the Florida Medical \nAssociation, which is the largest physician association in Florida, \nwith 20,000 members. They say:\n\n       . . . this legislation does not adequately fix what's wrong \n     with our current system. It contains many provisions that \n     would allow government bureaucrats to interfere with patient \n     care decisions and actually raises the cost of health \n     insurance unnecessarily.\n\n  This is from the doctors association in Florida. They say it is going \nto interfere with the doctor-patient relationship and increase costs. \nWhy are we doing this?\n  The sixth myth I want to tackle is this idea that emergency rooms are \ngoing to be less burdened. You hear this justification. People now are \nuninsured. They go to the emergency room to get health care. If we give \nfolks insurance or they have the ability to purchase insurance at a \nsubsidized rate, they will stop going to the emergency room, and that \nwill lower the cost of health care because emergency room procedures \nare expensive. It will free up the emergency room for its intended \npurpose, for people who really have an emergency. But according to the \nUrban Institute, after Massachusetts adopted a somewhat similar plan, \nemergency use remained higher than the national average. More than two-\nfifths of the visits in these emergency rooms were nonemergencies and, \nof these, the majority of adult respondents said it was more convenient \nto check into the ER. More convenient?\n  We know we are going to be paying health care providers less. What \ndoes that mean? There is going to be less of them providing health \ncare. That means your lines at the doctor's office, which are already \ntoo long, are going to get longer. So what are folks going to still do? \nThey are going to still show up at the emergency room. If we look at \nthe Massachusetts model, that has happened. We also know that \nultimately we are going to have a severe doctor shortage. We have not \nprepared, nor does this bill prepare, to make sure we will have \nsufficient health care providers to meet new demands.\n  Seventh myth: The Democrats' plan takes on the insurance companies. \nYou have heard the President say we are going to fight against the \ninsurance companies; we are going to make sure that we are putting the \npatient first. Basically what we are going to do, in reality, is create \na lot of new business for the insurance companies. This subsidy plan is \ngoing to force a lot of new people into health care with an insurance \ncompany. That is why the insurance companies are for it. What we need \nto do is empower individuals. What we need to do is give individuals \nmoney that is in their own pocket and let them go out and be consumers. \nIf they were consumers, it would lower the cost of health care. What we \nneed to do is let insurance companies compete across State lines so we \nas consumers have more choices. Look at auto insurance. It is so easy a \ncaveman can do it. In 15 minutes, you can save 15 percent on your auto \ninsurance. These folks are out there competing. We need that in health \ncare. Why do I only get to pick from the insurance companies that are \nin Florida? If there is an enterprising insurance company from South \nCarolina that wants to come into my State and offer cheaper prices, why \nshould I not have that opportunity as a consumer? There are commonsense \nthings we can do, market-driven things we can do that will lower the \ncost of health insurance and, by doing so, when it is less expensive, \nmore people can afford it and you have more access.\n  The eighth myth: It has been said that this bill takes an \nunprecedented step to fight health care fraud. It is\n\n[[Page S1508]]\n\ngoing to go after waste, fraud, and abuse, and we will save billions of \ndollars. In fact, the $500 billion being cut from Medicare is often \ndescribed as an elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse. It is not. It \nis just taking money out of that program and putting it in this \nprogram. To be fair, there are some provisions of this bill that go \nafter health care fraud. They are good, but they go around the margins. \nThey are going to save a billion or two, which is a lot of money, I \nwill grant you that, but it is not the kind of money we need to save. \nWe believe there are $60 to $100 billion of fraud in Medicare every \nyear alone, not talking about Medicaid, not talking about veterans \nhealth care, just Medicare, $60 to $100 billion, $1 out of every $7 \nspent. What we need to do is implement a plan that is going to stop the \nhealth care fraud before it starts.\n  I have a bill, S. 2128, that has bipartisan support, has more than a \ndozen Senators who sponsor it. It would do three things. One, it would \ncreate a person at HHS who would be the No. 2 person at the agency for \nHealth and Human Services, appointed by the President to be the chief \nhealth care fraud prevention officer of this country. No other job, not \nfocused on worrying about H1N1, not focused on anything else that \nshould be done in health, focused on stopping health care fraud, \nsomeone we could measure against performance to make sure we are doing \neverything we can to stop wasting the people's money. The second thing \nit does is it takes a page from another business that exists in the \nmarketplace that does an excellent job at stopping fraud. There is \nanother business that is about the same size as health care, about $2 \ntrillion a year. That business, instead of having a $1-in-$7 fraud \nratio, has a ratio of 7 cents out of every $100. That is the credit \ncard industry. We have all had this experience. You go somewhere to use \nyour credit card and you get a phone call or an e-mail that says: Did \nyou mean to make that purchase? If you do not say yes, they do not pay.\n\n  What we do in health care is we pay, and then if we think something \nis fraudulent, we chase. When we chase, the money is gone. The credit \ncards stop the fraud before it starts.\n  Now, why couldn't we implement that kind of computer technology? In \nhealth care, it is called predictive modeling. So when someone tries to \nsell a wheelchair 100 times in an hour, the bells go off, the phone \ncall is made, and if it is not verified, we do not pay.\n  We have people--unfortunately, a lot of them in my home State of \nFlorida--who are bilking the system for tens of millions of dollars a \nyear because it is much easier to steal from Uncle Sam than it is to \nsteal from anybody else because nobody is watching.\n  One group in town that has evaluated my bill with this predictive \nmodeling system, where we would set up a computer program to stop the \nfraud before it starts and make people verify when there is a \nquestionable transaction, has said it will save $20 billion a year.\n  During the health care debate we had last December, I asked to amend \nmy bill on to the main health care bill, and my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle objected. Why we wouldn't implement real waste, \nfraud, and abuse reform is beyond me. But this bill we are talking \nabout does not have it. That myth I, too, believe is busted.\n  The third part of my bill is, it will require background checks for \nall health care providers. Can you believe we do not do background \nchecks on people who bill Medicare and Medicaid in this country? We \nhave folks who are convicted felons who are billing alleged ``health \ncare'' providers. It is so bad that in reimbursements for AIDS \ntreatment under Medicare, while south Florida only has 7 percent of the \nAIDS population, they bill 78 percent of the treatment--only 7 percent \nof the population and they bill 78 percent of the treatment. It is just \nfraud, and it should stop today.\n  The ninth myth I want to tackle is that this Democratic health care \nreform bill will not impact the doctor-patient relationship. In fact, \nit will. I agree with my colleague, Dr. Barrasso, who supports a \npatient-centered approach. Real health care reform should ensure a \ndoctor and a patient can work together to the best efforts in the \nhealth of the patient. As I said before, we are still going to have \nthird-party payers. We have to put the patient back in charge of their \nhealth care. That is the only way we are going to reduce costs.\n  There is a common thread throughout our governmental programs that \nhas led entitlements to expand and expand and expand; that is, people \ndo not have what is called skin in the game. If I am not paying, I do \nnot care. But if I have to go out as a consumer, if the government \nwould give me a tax credit to go buy health insurance, all of a sudden \nI am in the game. If I have a reasonable deductible where I have to pay \na little when I go to the doctor, all of a sudden I am in the game and \nI am not going to ask for a procedure I do not need. I am going to sit \nthere and talk with my health care provider about whether this is \nsomething I really need. Now, if you tell me it is free, I will take \nit. And if you advertise to me on television every drug in the world, I \nwill go to my doctor and say: Sign me up for that because I get it for \nfree. We have to change the whole structure of how we do health care \nbecause this will just continue to expand. Medicare will continue to \nexpand. Medicaid will continue to expand. If this program passes, it \nwill continue to expand.\n  While it might be great to throw all this money into these programs, \nwe cannot afford it. We cannot afford the programs we have, let alone \nthe programs the majority in this Chamber want.\n  The tenth and final myth I want to tackle tonight is that taxes will \nnot go up. This is a jobs bill for the tax collector. We already said \nthere is going to be $5 billion to $10 billion to the IRS and HHS to \nimplement this bill. Remember, if you do not buy health insurance for \nyourself, you are going to have to pay a tax, a fine, a penalty to the \nIRS--$750 a person. Small businesses that do not provide certain levels \nof health insurance will be fined. And what do you think they are going \nto do? Pay that fine or drop to under 50 employees so they do not have \nto pay the fine anymore, which will cause more people to be out of \nwork.\n  Can you believe that in the United States of America, we are going to \ntax you if you do not buy health insurance for yourself because the \ngovernment cares more about you than you care about you? If the \ngovernment can tax you for not buying health insurance, what else can \nthey tax you for not doing? Not working out? Not eating your spinach? \nThat cannot be what our Founders intended.\n  Remember, we give up our rights to the government. Our institution \nwas created that it governs with the consent of the governed, that we \nhave the inalienable rights. In our social contract, we give those \nrights up to the government. It is not the other way around. How is it \nthe government can fine me for not doing something?\n  So at the end of the day, when this entitlement program increases \nbeyond its means, when it is more than we can afford, and when the $500 \nbillion we take out of Medicare starts to put Medicare in insolvency \neven quicker, what is going to happen? Is the majority in this Chamber \nreally going to cut Medicare? Probably not. So what are they going to \ndo to help pay for this new program without their cuts? They are going \nto raise your taxes--raise your taxes to levels that are going to be \nhard to imagine when you factor in what we are going to have to do for \nall the other entitlement programs we cannot afford, when you factor in \nwhat we are going to have to do with our $12 trillion debt that is \nestimated to be $10 trillion higher by 2020.\n  That is why the National Federation of Independent Businesses has \nsaid:\n\n       When evaluating health care reform options, small business \n     owners ask themselves two specific questions. First, will the \n     bill lower insurance costs?\n\n  We know the answer to that is no.\n\n       Second, will the bill increase the overall cost of doing \n     business?\n\n  The answer to that is yes.\n  They say:\n\n       In both cases, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act fails the small business test and, therefore, fails small \n     business.\n\n  It has been my goal tonight to present facts. I know others have a \ndiffering view.\n  As a Senator from Florida with more than 3 million folks in Medicare, \nas a Senator who cares about health care reform and wants to create \nmore access but also wants to lower the cost of health care, I cannot \nsupport this bill.\n\n[[Page S1509]]\n\n  I hope my colleagues in the House who are being faced with this \noption of voting for this bill and then passing something on \nreconciliation will do the right thing. I hope they will not be \npressured politically to change their votes from ``no'' votes to \n``yes'' votes. I hope they will stand for the people of their State and \nfor the American people.\n  We could get this right. We could work together on a bipartisan way, \nas all of the other big, important bills over time have been done, with \n70 or 80 Senators working together to do the right thing for the \nAmerican people. I sign up for that. I am standing ready to do that if \nthat opportunity presents itself. But I cannot vote for this bill that \nwill not lower the cost of health insurance for most Americans, nor \nwill it put us in a situation financially that is tenable going \nforward.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1510]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS15MR10.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S1511]]\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I yield the remainder of my post-cloture time to the \nRepublican Leader, Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for \ncoming to the floor and expressing his point of view on the issue of \nhealth care, and I would like to have a few minutes to express my own.\n  Let me explain our health insurance, the health insurance we have as \nMembers of Congress. It is a government-administered health insurance \nplan. It has been around for 40 years. It is called the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program. It is a government plan that \nprovides health insurance for most of the Senators in both parties and \ntheir families, and it establishes minimum standards for the health \ninsurance we receive as Members of Congress so we do not end up buying \nhealth insurance that is worthless when we need it. The government \npicks up a share of the cost--70 percent or so, I believe--and we pick \nup the rest. If you decide in the open enrollment period of each year \nthat you want to change your insurance company, you want more coverage, \nthen you are going to pay a higher premium out of your paycheck. The \ngovernment pays a share of it, but you will pay a higher premium. that \nis something like an insurance exchange. In Illinois, my wife and I, \nthrough the Federal employees program, can choose from nine different \nprivate health insurance plans. It is a dream come true that most \nAmericans never, ever experience: competition and choice.\n  That is at the heart of health care reform. We want to give to people \nacross America the same thing we have as Members of Congress. I have \nyet to hear the first Senator come and stand in this well or stand \nbefore a microphone and say: The Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram is socialism. It is a government-run health care program and it \nmandates benefits, and therefore I cannot in good conscience insure my \nfamily with it, and I am turning in my Federal employees health \ninsurance. Not one. Yet when we suggest that for the rest of America, \nthey say: This is an awful idea. It will never work.\n  It has worked for 40 years in providing private health insurance for \nMembers of Congress and Federal employees. It is what we want to make \navailable for small businesses, which have no choices. If Members on \nthe other side think this is such a bad idea, I want them to march down \nthe middle of this aisle and say: We are giving up our Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Programs today; it is such a bad idea. But \nthey will not because it is a great program and it works and it gives \nus choice and it empowers us as consumers. If we do not like the way we \nare treated by an insurance company, we can shop for another one next \nyear in open enrollment.\n  So to argue insurance exchanges are some radical notion--really? We \nlive with it every day as Members of Congress. Don't the people of \nAmerica deserve as good of insurance as their Members of Congress? That \nis the starting point in this debate. I think they do.\n  Secondly, when it comes to whether health care reform is going to add \nto the deficit, we can debate that for a long time. But the people who \nare the experts, the umpires, and referees, are from the Congressional \nBudget Office. They came back and told us: If you do this health care \nreform, you will reduce the deficit by over $100 billion in the first \n10 years and by over $1 trillion in the second 10 years. That is it. \nThey looked at it. They analyzed it, and they concluded it. I hear \nMembers come to the floor and say: Oh, this is just going to run the \ndeficit up to higher levels than we have ever seen before. There is no \nevidence of that. The CBO analysis comes out with exactly the opposite \nposition.\n  This argument about heaping a new burden on Governors because there \nwill be more people on Medicaid--Medicaid is health insurance for the \npoor and disabled in America, and the Federal Government pays at least \n50 percent of the cost of it. It is true the States have to assume a \nburden. But it also says to the State of Illinois, with 11 percent \nunemployment, when people lose their jobs and lose their health \ninsurance and go on Medicaid, the Federal Government is going to pick \nup, in this case, 62 percent of the cost of these Medicaid recipients \nin my State of Illinois, and 38 percent is going to be picked up by the \nState. So Governors can say Medicaid is a terrible thing. What is the \nalternative? More uninsured people in your State showing up seriously \nill and needing treatment, being treated as charity patients? Is that \nthe alternative?\n  I have listened carefully while the people on the other side of the \naisle for over a year have criticized every idea we have come forward \nwith on changing the health care system and making it more affordable. \nI have yet to see them come forward with any kind of comprehensive \nbill. They have ideas, and some of them are not bad, but they have \nnever put them together in a bill and brought them to the floor. We \nhave. That is the responsibility of governing.\n  There are other elements here too. The Senator from Florida is \nnaturally concerned about senior citizens, and he should be. His State \nhas a lot of snow birds from Illinois going down to Florida who spend \ntheir winters there and some of them end up becoming permanent \nresidents. They love the nice climate in your State. We miss it. We go \nvisit too, I might add. But the point is if we do nothing about \nMedicare, it is going to run out of money in 9 years. It will run out \nof money and 40 million people plus will wonder why Congress didn't \nact.\n\n  The health care reform bill adds 10 more years to the life of \nMedicare. It closes the gap known as the doughnut hole in prescription \ndrug coverage under Medicare, and it gives every senior citizen a free \nannual checkup so they can at least get in to see a doctor and find out \nif something has happened that might be stopped early and avoid a major \nexpense or major illness. Those are dramatically positive improvements \nin Medicare.\n  Are we going to have to take some money out of Medicare spending? \nYes. Why? Because we have waste in the system and things that need to \nbe reconciled. For the Senator from Florida, let me give a couple of \nillustrations. I lived in Springfield, IL. The average expenditure \nannually for Medicare recipients in my hometown is $7,600 a year \naverage. The average in Chicago, IL, for Medicare recipients is $9,600 \na year. The average expenditure for Medicare recipients in Miami, FL, \nis $17,000 a year. Miami may be a little bit more expensive than \nChicago--we can argue that point--but is it twice as expensive? I don't \nthink so. I want to know why. Why does it cost so much more in Miami, \nFL, and in McAllen, TX, for Medicare patients than it does in Chicago \nor Springfield or Rochester, MN? And are there ways to save money \nwithout compromising quality?\n  Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado offered an amendment adopted on \nthe floor that said when we get done cutting waste and fraud, we are \nnot going to cut the basic benefits under Medicare. We are on record. \nThat is part of the bill. That is part of the health care reform bill. \nWe could make Medicare better and stronger and save money. There are a \nlot of things being ripped off in Medicare. Turn on late-night TV and \nwatch all the come-on ads for people to come and get something they may \nor may not need and Medicare is going to take care of it. Those are the \nthings we ought to take a look at and I think it is well worthwhile.\n  Let me also say this: We cannot as a nation address the problems of \nhealth care with 50 million people uninsured and the numbers growing \ndramatically. Our proposal will put 30 million of those under the \nprotection of Medicaid and health insurance through exchanges. We will \nprovide, thanks to the leadership of Senator Nelson of Nebraska, up to \n2 or 3 years with the Federal Government picking up every penny of the \ncost for the new Medicaid recipients; then, beyond that, high amounts--\n90, 95 percent--for several years. It is a reasonable transition for \nthe States to absorb people who are now uninsured presenting themselves \nfor care.\n  We end up with 30 million people with coverage. The Republicans' best \neffort addressing the 50 million uninsured in America covered 3 \nmillion. We can do better. We need to do better as a nation. Uninsured \npeople show up at\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\nhospitals, incur costs, and pass them along to other people. I think we \nneed to move forward on health care reform.\n  I had a call in my office on a Saturday. I was sitting around doing a \nfew things at my desk by myself in my office and the phone rang in \nSpringfield and a lady was calling from Nokomis, IL, which is not too \nfar away from Springfield, in Montgomery County. It is a small town \nwith a lot of retired farmers and a lot of conservative folks I have \nrepresented in Congress for a long time.\n  She said: Senator, whatever you do, don't vote for health care \nreform.\n  I said: Do you have health insurance?\n  She said: We do. My husband and I have health insurance.\n  I said: You can keep it. If you want to keep it, you can keep it. We \nare not changing that.\n  Well, I just worry about the government getting involved in it, she \nsays. She says, When government gets involved in insurance, I am not \nsure it is a good thing.\n  I said: Is anybody in your family on Medicare?\n  Well, sure. We have all signed up for it and my mother who is 85 is \non Medicare and recently had a surgery, major surgery at Memorial \nMedical Center in Springfield.\n  How is she doing?\n  Just fine.\n  I said: I am glad your mom could depend on Medicare to pick up the \nbills for the surgery and didn't have to exhaust her savings or sell \nwhatever property she has left in this world. But that is a government \nhealth insurance plan, ma'am. It has been there for all of us. My \ncontributions out of my paycheck help pay your mom's medical bills and \nthat is just fine with me, because I think we are all in this American \nfamily and we should watch out for one another.\n  Well, she didn't see it that way and I am sure I didn't convince her. \nThe phone is ringing off the hook in all the offices of Senators and \nCongressmen for and against this idea. There is a lot of \nmisunderstanding out there. I think this is an important step forward \nfor America. We have put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears in this \neffort and now we need to get it done. We need to give the American \npeople an alternative, because watching health insurance premiums go up \nthe way they are going up is unsustainable. Businesses can't afford it; \nindividuals can't afford it; our Nation cannot afford it.\n  For those who stand on the floor and have different ideas, that is \nyour right. As a Member of the Senate, that is your right--maybe your \nresponsibility. But I also think you have a responsibility to come \nforward with your plan, with your idea, unless you think everything is \nfine and we ought to leave it the way it is; we shouldn't worry about \nthe uninsured; we shouldn't be concerned about the increases in health \ninsurance premiums; we shouldn't worry that Medicare is going to go \nbroke in 9 years. If you think those are things that we should push \naside and, as some say, let's start over, let's do baby steps, let's \nthink about it later, let's go back to it next year, that is a point of \nview, but I don't think that is the responsibility we have as Members \nof the Senate to address the issues facing our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I wish to commend my senior Senator from \nIllinois for his comments on health care and what we must do in this \nbody to pass health care. It is long overdue. It is time for us to work \nwith our colleagues in the House of Representatives to make sure we \ncover those 50 million Americans who are uninsured.\n\n\n                           Urban Prep Academy\n\n  I wish to do a little presentation here for some young men from \nChicago. In 2006, a brandnew school opened its doors to the community \nof Englewood on the south side of Chicago. This school is called the \nUrban Prep Charter Academy for Young Men. It was designed to provide \nquality education to an area desperately in need of a new approach.\n  Local schools were failing. Last year, 93 percent of the public high \nschool students in the neighborhood were classified as low income. The \npublic school attendance rate was around 60 percent. The local high \nschool ranked 81st out of 98 Chicago public schools in terms of \npreparing students to succeed on college entrance exams such as the \nACT.\n  Until 2006, there were few places to turn. Most residents were unable \nto afford to send their sons or daughters to expensive private schools. \nIt seemed inevitable that these young people would face an uphill fight \nto graduate from high school, let alone move on to get a college \neducation and find a good career. It seemed as though there was no \nalternative and no way to break the cycle.\n  But then, in 2002, a group of African-American business persons, \neducators, and civic leaders came together under the leadership of a \nyoung man by the name of Tim King, and they decided to find a solution. \nThey started a nonprofit organization designed to give local residents \nthe tools to succeed in college and to build a better future for \nthemselves. They saw beyond the low-income level and the stereotypes \nand the destructive cycle that kept the neighborhood schools from \nsucceeding. So, in 2006, the Englewood campus of Urban Prep Charter \nAcademy admitted its first class of students.\n  Many charter schools are able to cherry-pick their students, \nselecting from the cream of the crop to ensure a high success rate, but \nthe founders of Urban Prep rejected this idea. They looked at the kids \nin the Englewood public schools and they saw that every one of them had \nthe potential for success, if given the opportunity. So they selected \nstudents based on a lottery system rather than strictly by the numbers. \nSome 400 names went into the barrel and the names were drawn from the \nbarrel.\n  Today, the very first class of Urban Prep students is preparing for \ntheir graduation date. While other local schools have had attendance \nrates of only 60 percent, Urban Prep maintained an attendance rate of \n91 percent. The local public school ranked 81st at preparing their \nstudents for the ACT with an average score of 13.4, but Urban Prep is \nranked third, with an average ACT score of 16.5.\n  When the class of 2010 enrolled in Urban Prep in 2006, only 4 percent \nof these students were reading at grade level. But today, as their \ncommencement date draws near, I am proud to say that every one of \nthem--100 percent of the first-year class--has been accepted to a 4-\nyear college. Not only that, they were accepted with scholarships, 4-\nyear scholarships.\n  This is an extraordinary success story. This is a testament to the \nvision of Tim King and the faculty and staff that he and other local \nleaders have assembled. I applaud them for their dedication and I \ncongratulate them on this outstanding achievement. Most of all, though, \nthis is a testament to the students of Englewood and to all of the \nother communities in Chicago--the students who broke the cycle and \nproved they do have the talent, the skill, and the drive to succeed, if \nonly they were presented with the opportunity. Thanks to Urban Prep and \nthe leadership of those who founded this organization, these students \ngot that chance.\n  But the story doesn't end here. In August of 2009, a second Urban \nPrep campus opened its doors in East Garfield Park, and later this year \na third school will open in South Shore, extending the reach of this \ngreat organization and expanding the opportunity for Chicago students \nto realize their dreams.\n  So in the coming months, as my colleagues and I take up President \nObama's update on No Child Left Behind, I urge them to remember success \nstories such as this one. As we reexamine our educational priorities, I \nhope we can move in a direction that will provide investment in public \nschools that need assistance as well as organizations such as Urban \nPrep. Organizations that grow out of local communities demonstrate a \nshared interest in seizing the best future for our children. We need to \ninvest in communities such as Englewood and East Garfield Park and \nSouth Shore and dozens of others in Chicago and across the country. We \nneed to make sure more and more students have the opportunity to \nsucceed so they can go to college, find a career, and become productive \nmembers of our society and, as I always say, become an asset to society \nand not a liability to society.\n  It really does take a village to educate these young people. It takes \na\n\n[[Page S1513]]\n\nsteadfast commitment to education and a vision such as the one Tim King \nshared with others in his community back in 2002. As a member of Sigma \nPi Phi fraternity, we played a minor role in assisting Urban Prep with \nour fund-raising efforts to contribute to the purchase of a uniform for \nthese young men. We also make ourselves available to go there and work \nwith them during career day to point out our successes and \nopportunities to challenge them to do no less than what we were able to \ndo. So the men of Sigma Pi Phi worked with these young men at Urban \nPrep and we made sure that we made a similar contribution to the \noverall efforts.\n  Let us renew our investment in America's education system. Let us \naffirm our priorities for young people today and make sure every one of \nthem has a chance to get the education they deserve. Together, we can \nbuild more success stories such as Urban Prep, and that is what we must \ndo. Urban Prep is a public school so, therefore, we do not have to be \ndedicating all of the resources commitment to the private schools. We \ncan educate our young people in the public system.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about a dear and \ntrusted friend, not just for me and my family but for the people of \nLorain County, OH. John Hatcher was a man of conscience and courage. \nHis commitment to the highest ideals is unwavering, even in the face of \ncriticism and attempts to silence him.\n  In large and small ways, John Hatcher has done more for the working \nmen and women of Lorain County and organized labor than anyone else I \nknow. John is a retired United Auto Workers member from the Ford Motor \nCompany Ohio assembly plant in Avon Lake.\n  For generations, the plant helped build Lorain's middle class--the \nsame way that American manufacturing built America's middle class. He \nhas long held a position of leadership in the labor movement, and his \nloyalty to his fellow workers and to those who champion them has never \nwavered. He is still president of the Lorain County UAW CAP Council and \na board member of the Lorain County Labor Agency.\n  He has chaired the Lorain County Labor Day Festival Committee for \nseveral years--an event that attracts thousands of Lorain County \nfamilies to celebrate the accomplishments and heritage of organized \nlabor. And every month, John finds time to deliver food to the elderly \nthrough the Lorain County Office on Aging.\n  For the many years I have known John--two-and-a-half decades, \nperhaps--he has been a fighter who is not afraid to stand up for what \nhe believes. And as he battles cancer, John is displaying the same \nvigor, the same fighting spirit. Yesterday, hundreds of friends, \nfamilies, and elected officials joined in honoring John with the Lorain \nCounty AFL-CIO Lifetime Achievement Award.\n  John said--and I was standing with him--``I haven't been out in the \ncommunity much the past few months, but as the warm weather comes, I \nwill be back out soon.''\n  In many ways, John's presence is always felt in Lorain--through the \nworkers he has helped and for the causes which he has championed. He is \na tireless champion for working men and women. He has made an \ninvaluable contribution to the labor movement.\n  You never wonder where you stand with John Hatcher. He is the best \nkind of friend.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Marilyn \nRoberson of Massillon, OH, a proud grandmother of five Eagle Scouts. \nThis year, the Boy Scouts of America celebrates its hundredth \nanniversary of service to our Nation. Already this year, I have \nattended Boy Scout celebrations and Eagle Scout Courts of Honor across \nmy State.\n  Around Ohio and our Nation, families and friends, community and \nbusiness leaders, are celebrating Scouting's commitment to service, to \nprotecting the outdoors--some of the original environmentalists--and to \ninstilling the values of faith and fellowship.\n  Growing up in Mansfield, OH, a city of 50,000 in north central Ohio--\nan industrial town--my parents instilled in my brother and me our own \nvalues of compassion and commitment to community. My two brothers and I \nare Eagle Scouts and my mother wore a charm bracelet representing each \nof her Eagle Scout sons. I always claimed my Eagle Scout emblem was \nlarger than my brothers'. She always denied that.\n  In many ways, Scouting's commitment to family and community laid the \ngroundwork for my years in public service--as it has for the Eagle \nScouts now in elected office in this body--I think there are 6 others \nin the Senate--or executives in boardrooms, teachers in classrooms, or \njust model citizens everywhere in our country.\n  On March 20, 2010, the Boy Scouts of America, Venture Crew 10 of \nMassillon, OH, will hold an Eagle Court of Honor for five young men who \nwill become Eagle Scouts. Among the Eagle Scouts will be Andrew and \nTimothy Bushman, who will become the fourth and fifth grandsons of Mrs. \nMarilyn Roberson to become Eagle Scouts.\n  Marilyn Roberson is now 86 years old, and like many of our role \nmodels she has taught her grandchildren the capacity for selflessness, \nand to have the confidence to serve with humility and honor. I knew \nMarilyn's late husband Al 25 years ago, when I first met Al and Marilyn \nand several of their children. Al grew up in Tupelo, MS, across the \nstreet from Elvis Presley, then moved north, started a business, was \nvery successful, and always--always--Marilyn and Al and their children \ngave back to the community.\n  I congratulate Andrew, Timothy, their fellow Eagle Scouts, Ian \nChristopher McKinney, Mathew Michael McKinney, and Michael David \nTernaux, for earning this important honor. I congratulate Eagle Scouts \nacross Ohio--there are hundreds of New Eagle Scouts every year--for \nearning this\n\n[[Page S1514]]\n\nhonor and taking part in a great American tradition, which asks you to \nlive with honor and loyalty and act with courage and service.\n  It is a creed of common purpose and community service based on the \nScout oath, ever present in the 12 points of the Scout law.\n  While each of you as Eagle Scouts will forever be an Eagle Scout, \nyour accomplishments are not easily defined by the number of badges \nearned but, rather, the character and dignity you show in earning them. \nFor Andrew and Timothy, that dignity has been shaped by your remarkable \ngrandmother, Mrs. Marilyn Roberson. Thank you, Mrs. Roberson, for your \ndedication to your family and for your service to our great State and \nfor the legacy you have created for so many.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have often talked about the importance of \nthe many professional staff members and various support services that \nallow for the proper functioning of this great institution, the U.S. \nSenate. These individuals and offices are rarely mentioned in \nnewspapers or history books, but they work many long hours with great \nenergy, exceptional skill, and admirable adherence to high quality \nwork. As a result, the contribution of such dedicated public servants \ngreatly assists the work we do as Senators; they make our work more \npleasant and productive than otherwise would be possible.\n  An example of the sense of pride and loyalty that Senate employees \nbring to their daily responsibilities is the career of Mrs. Sandra \nMason, who prior to her retirement was the Director of Protocol and \nForeign Travel for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Mrs. \nSandra Mason, who was known to her many friends in the Senate as \n``Sandy'' served on the staff of that committee from 1979 through 2008, \nwhen she completed her Federal employment. As one can easily imagine, \nthis is a position of considerable responsibility, which in no small \npart determines the successful hosting of high-level foreign \ndignitaries visiting the Senate, as well as the efficient operation of \nofficial Senate delegations traveling abroad. I remember that when I \ntraveled on Senate business accompanied by my dear wife Erma, Sandy \nMason's hard work and expert aplomb made all the difference for a \nmemorable and very positive undertaking.\n  During her entire extraordinary career, which commenced with \nemployment with Senator Hubert H. Humphrey in 1971, Sandy earned the \nlove, respect, and praise of all those who worked with her and came to \nknow her.\n  Sandy passed away on Monday, March 8, 2010. She will be greatly \nmissed but certainly not forgotten. I extend warm personal condolences \nto her husband Ronald, her son Aaron, and all of her beloved family, \nand offer my sincere wishes that she, and they, receive the Blessings \nof our Creator.\n\n     Let fate do her worst, there are relics of joy,\n     Bright dreams of the past that she cannot destroy,\n     That come in the night-time of sorrow and care,\n     And bring back the features that joy used to wear.\n\n     Long, long be my heart with such memories filled,\n     Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled,\n     You may break, you may shatter the vase if you will,\n     But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.\n                                                Scent of the Roses\n     --by Thomas Moore\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/15/senate-section/article/S1514-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1514-S1515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 STATE DEPARTMENT HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this month's release of the State \nDepartment's annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices shows the \nvalue of consistently monitoring human rights around the globe.\n  As Chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission charged with monitoring \ninternational human rights commitments in 56 countries from the U.S. \nand Canada to Europe and Central Asia, this annual report is a key tool \nthat we, and others, use to track progress being made on universal \nfreedoms.\n  This year's reports have increased significance as 2010 is the 35th \nanniversary of the Helsinki Final Act and the 20th anniversary of \nhistoric international human rights agreements, the Copenhagen \nDocument, and the Charter of Paris for a New Europe.\n  In a year commemorating such landmark human rights documents, this \nmonth's State Department reports remind us that many of the commitments \ncountries made in the past still have not been met with meaningful \naction today.\n  In Belarus, where I visited last summer, the political space for \nopposition remains tightly controlled, independent media face continual \nharassment, and elections are a farce.\n  The overall situation in Russia remains disturbing as well. There \n2009 was a year again filled with mourning the very people who stood \nfor freedom, be they journalists, human rights advocates or lawyers \nsimply trying to present a case against corruption. The country's \nharassment of Jehovah's Witnesses and forceful break up of public \ndemonstrations remain particularly concerning.\n  I urge Kazakhstan, as the current chair of the OSCE, to lead by \nexample through concrete actions, starting with the release of activist \nYevgeny Zhovtis, whom staff from the Helsinki Commission visited this \nweek in prison. Zhovtis at least deserves the same freedoms afforded \nother prisoners in his facility, including the right to work outside \nthe facility during the day.\n  In Kosovo, in addition to problems with human trafficking, official \ncorruption and a lack of judicial due process, the State Department \nnotes the lack of progress regarding displaced persons of all \nethnicities, politically and ethnically motivated violence, and \nsocietal antipathy against Serbs and the Serbian Orthodox Church. The \nlack of progress regarding the country's international recognition, \nwhile unfortunate, does not absolve Kosovo authorities from their \nresponsibility to ensure greater respect for human rights and adherence \nto the rule of law.\n  Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy Human Rights and Labor \nMichael Posner, who serves as the State Department Commissioner on the \nU.S. Helsinki Commission, did a superb job of unveiling the report \ntoday with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n  I was heartened to hear him specifically flag examples of 2009 human \nrights violations within the OSCE region that drew the attention of the \nCommission last year. The banning of construction of Muslim minarets in \nSwitzerland, the pervasiveness of discrimination against Roma--Europe's \nlargest ethnic minority, and the continued rise of anti-Semitism in \nEurope sadly still remain concerns this year.\n  While these country reports help to hold all governments--including \nour own--to account; and while much of their text shows the reality of \na world troubled by violent conflicts and the mistreatment of our most \nvulnerable people; the State Department reports also show the positive \nthat surrounds us.\n  In this vein, Assistant Secretary Posner was right to mention the \nfairness of Ukraine's recent elections, for which my colleague \nCochairman Hastings led the election observation mission. And the \nreports are eager to cite progress where appropriate.\n  But these reports affirm something else, and that is the strength of \nthe legislative-executive branch cooperation when it comes to upholding \nuniversal standards. The Helsinki Commission is unique among all \nfederal agencies for being comprised of Senate, House and executive \nbranch commissioners, and Assistant Secretary Posner's activity with \nthe Commission\n\n[[Page S1515]]\n\nand the State Department's annual human rights reports mandated by \nCongress are but two examples of our two branches working together to \nkeep a spotlight on human rights abuses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/15/senate-section/article/S1515-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONTRIBUTIONS OF PHARMACIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today, I am proud to recognize the \ncontributions of our Nations' pharmacies to the American health care \nsystem. Over 200 members of the pharmacy community--including \npracticing pharmacists, pharmacy school faculty and students, state \npharmacy leaders, and pharmacy company executives--will come together \nto highlight the importance of supporting policies that protect access \nto neighborhood pharmacies and utilizes pharmacists to improve quality \nand reduce health costs.\n  Currently, there are over 50,000 community pharmacies operating \nnationwide. Pharmacists are one of the Nation's most accessible health \ncare providers, and nearly all Americans live within about 2 miles from \na community retail pharmacy. Pharmacy has a long history of receiving, \nfilling, billing, and dispensing prescriptions in tandem with \ncounseling. But pharmacists, utilizing their specialized education, \nalso play a major role in medication therapy management, disease state \nmanagement, immunizations, health care screenings, and other health \ncare services designed to improve patient health and reduce overall \nhealth care costs.\n  Pharmacists help patients adhere to their medications to improve \nhealth outcomes and reduce the risks of adverse events and unnecessary \ncostly hospital readmissions and emergency room visits. Pharmacists are \nuniquely qualified to work with patients to help manage their \nmedications and play an essential role in helping them take their \nmedications as prescribed. Unfortunately, only 50 percent of Americans \nliving with chronic diseases adhere to their drug regimens. Patient \nnonadherence costs the Nation's economy an estimated $290 billion each \nyear, not to mention the avoidable loss of quality of life for patients \nand their loved ones. Congress recognized the important role of local \npharmacists when it included a medication therapy management, MTM, \nbenefit in Medicare Part D. As we have seen the increasing power of \nthis benefit in improving patient health outcomes, I support community \npharmacy's efforts to strengthen the MTM benefit so it is available for \nseniors and others struggling with chronic conditions and other \nillnesses.\n  As the face of neighborhood health care, pharmacies across the Nation \noffer these and other cost-saving programs and services to help \npatients take medicines they need to achieve positive results from \nappropriate use of their medications. For more than a century, \npharmacies and pharmacists have made a difference in the lives of \npeople in North Carolina and the rest of America. In order to ensure \npharmacies continue to exist in our local communities, pharmacists \ndeserve fair reimbursements for the cost effective medications that \nthey dispense.\n  Today, I celebrate the value of pharmacy and support efforts to \nprotect access to neighborhood pharmacies and utilize pharmacies to \nimprove the quality and reduce the costs of health care. Finally, I \nwould like to congratulate over 200 pharmacy leaders, pharmacists, \nstudents, and executives and the pharmacy community for their \ncontributions to the good health of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/15/senate-section/article/S1515-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO S.

He will retire on April 3, 2010, and I would like \nto take some time to make a few remarks on his accomplishments and \ncontributions to the Louisiana community.\n  Mr. McCurry started his career with Calcasieu parish as assistant \nadministrator in 1976. In 1983 he was named Outstanding Young Man of \nLake Charles, thus beginning a notable career as a public servant. \nFurthering his career with Calcasieu parish, in 1988 he became parish \nadministrator, and he continued making great strides for the State of \nLouisiana. In 1999, Mr. McCurry was named Appointed Public Official of \nthe Year by the Calcasieu Chapter of the National Association of Social \nWorkers and in 2003 he was the recipient of the statewide Public \nService Award given by the Louisiana Public Health Association.\n  In addition to his time as parish administrator, Mr. McCurry served \nLouisiana in many other arenas. He sat on the board of directors of \nFirst Federal Bank of Louisiana and was chair of the Board of Trustees \nof the United Methodist Foundation of Louisiana. He also presided as \npresident of the Organization of Parish Administrative Officials of the \nLouisiana Police Jury Association.\n  Mr. McCurry has been credited with ``raising the level of \nprofessionalism in police jury affairs,'' as well as, ``making local \ngovernments work together more effectively.'' He has been a great asset \nfor the State of Louisiana.\n  Thus, today, I am proud to honor a fellow Louisianan, Mr. S. Mark \nMcCurry, for his distinguished service to Calcasieu Parish and to the \nState of Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/15/senate-section/article/S1515-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:11 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3650.

A bill to establish the Commission on Freedom of Information \nAct Processing Delays; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week, the Nation commemorates Sunshine \nWeek--a time to educate the public about the importance of open \ngovernment. In recognition of Sunshine Week 2010, I am pleased to join \nwith Senator Cornyn to introduce the Faster FOIA Act of 2010, a bill to \nimprove the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA.\n  Senator Cornyn and I first introduced this bill in 2005 to address \nthe growing problem of excessive FOIA delays within our Federal \nagencies.\n\n[[Page S1518]]\n\nOur decision to reintroduce the Faster FOIA Act this year is the most \nrecent example of our bipartisan efforts to help reinvigorate FOIA.\n  Today, thanks to the reforms contained in the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN \nGovernment Act of 2007, millions of Americans who seek information \nunder FOIA will experience a process that is much more transparent and \nless burdened by delays. In 2009, President Obama signed the OPEN FOIA \nAct into law. That bill is the result of another successful \ncollaboration with Senator Cornyn and me that is making the process for \ncreating new legislative exemptions to FOIA more transparent.\n  While both of these legislative accomplishments are strengthening \nFOIA, more reforms are needed.\n  According to the Department of Justice's Freedom of Information Act \nAnnual Report for fiscal year 2009, the Department had a backlog of \nalmost 5,000 FOIA requests at the end of 2009. The Department of \nHomeland Security's report for the same period shows a backlog of \n18,918 FOIA requests. These mounting FOIA backlogs are simply \nunacceptable.\n  The Faster FOIA Act will help to reverse these troubling statistics \nby establishing a bipartisan Commission to examine the root causes of \nagency delay. The commission created by this bill will make \nrecommendations to Congress for reducing impediments to the efficient \nprocessing of FOIA requests.\n  The commission will also examine whether the current system for \ncharging fees and granting fee waivers under FOIA should be modified. \nLastly, the commission will be made up of government and non-\ngovernmental representatives with a broad range of experience in both \nsubmitting and handling FOIA requests, in information science, and in \nthe development of government information policy.\n  Thomas Jefferson once wisely observed that ``information is the \ncurrency of democracy.'' I share this view. I also firmly believe that \nthe Faster FOIA Act will help ensure the dissemination of Government \ninformation, so that our democracy remains vibrant and free.\n  I have said many times that open government is neither a Democratic \nissue, nor a Republican issue--it is truly an American value and virtue \nthat we all must uphold. As we celebrate Sunshine Week, it is in this \nbipartisan spirit that I join Americans from across the Nation in \ncelebrating an open and transparent government.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nreaffirm the United States' historic commitment to protecting refugees \nwho are fleeing persecution or torture; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Refugee \nProtection Act of 2010. This week marks the thirtieth anniversary of \nthe Refugee Act, which was signed into law on March 17, 1980. In the \nyears since, our statute and case law have evolved in ways that place \nunnecessary and harmful barriers before genuine refugees and asylum \nseekers. This bill, which is cosponsored by Senator Levin of Michigan, \nwill restore the U.S. as a beacon of hope for those who suffer from \npersecution around the world.\n  The Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees was negotiated in \n1951 to protect those who suffered persecution in war-torn Europe prior \nto 1951, yet the U.S. did not sign it at that time. In 1967, the U.S. \nsigned and ratified a Protocol to the Convention, which expanded its \ngeographic and temporal scope, establishing a definition of refugee \nthat applied around the world. It was not until 1980, however, that \nCongress enacted implementing legislation to bring our laws into \ncompliance with the Convention and Protocol. During the intervening \nyears, our Government acted in an ad hoc manner to bring in refugees \nfleeing Southeast Asia by boat, to protect Jews and other refugees from \nthe Soviet bloc, and to provide safety for victims of persecution in \nAfrica. Our Nation acted generously in those years, providing aid and \nrelief, but our policies needed to be grounded in law.\n  The Refugee Act of 1980 was championed by the late Senator Edward \nKennedy, who fought for decades to protect victims of persecution who \nhad been forced to flee their home nations,\n\n[[Page S1519]]\n\nleaving behind livelihood, family, and security. I supported the \nRefugee Act in the 96th Congress, and voted for it when it passed the \nSenate. When the Senate debated the bill, Senator Kennedy spoke of its \ndual goals: to ``welcome homeless refugees to our shores,'' thereby \nembracing ``one of the oldest and most important themes in our Nation's \nhistory,'' and to ``give statutory meaning to our national commitment \nto human rights and humanitarian concerns.'' 125 Cong. Rec. 23231-32 \nSept. 6, 1979.) We lost our dear friend last year, but we can honor Ted \nKennedy's memory by carrying forward the mantle of refugee protection.\n  The Refugee Protection Act of 2010 contains provisions of a \nbipartisan bill that I previously introduced in the 106th and 107th \nCongresses to repeal the most harsh and unnecessary elements of the \nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, a \nlaw that had tragic consequences for asylum seekers. It also corrects \nagency and court misinterpretations of law that limit access to safety \nin the U.S. for asylum seekers. Finally, it modifies the immigration \nstatute to ensure that innocent persons with valid claims are not \nunfairly barred from the U.S. by laws enacted after September 11, 2001, \nwhile leaving in place provisions that prevent dangerous terrorists \nfrom manipulating our immigration system.\n  In the years since the Refugee Act was enacted, over 2.6 million \nrefugees and asylum seekers have been granted protection in the U.S. I \nam proud that my home State of Vermont has long welcomed refugees and \nhelped these new Americans to rebuild their lives. More than 5,300 \nrefugees have been resettled in Vermont since 1989, from countries as \ndiverse as Burma, Bhutan, Somalia, Bosnia, and Vietnam. In the early \ndays of resettlement, Vermont accepted refugees fleeing persecution \nfrom Southeast Asia and the Soviet Union, and from the war in the \nformer Yugoslavia and the genocide in Rwanda.\n  Vermonters' welcoming spirit is illustrated by the ``Lost Boys'' of \nSudan. Beginning in the 1980s, thousands of boys in Sudan traveled \nhundreds of miles by foot to escape war and ethnic and religious-based \npersecution. Some had seen family members killed before their eyes. \nThey walked from nation to nation, searching for safety in Ethiopia and \nKenya, before reaching camps that helped them find a permanent and \nsecure home in the U.S. The first group of Lost Boys arrived in Vermont \nin 2001. Many of them have thrived. I am proud that a number of them \nare now college graduates, and some have attended graduate school.\n  Vermonters have made a strong and sustained commitment to assisting \nrefugees with resettlement. Caseworkers and volunteers help new \nAmericans adjust to the new culture, learn English, and navigate daily \nlife, from grocery shopping to public transportation, to school and \nsports programs for their children. The Vermont Refugee Resettlement \nProgram has led the effort with its compassionate and experienced \nstaff, and a roster of more than 250 volunteers. I also want to \nrecognize the organizations, churches, synagogues, and libraries in \nVermont that have offered support, contributions of food, clothing, \nfurniture, English classes, tutoring, and perhaps most importantly, \ncompanionship and friendship to refugees resettled in our state. These \ngroups include the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program, Vermont \nImmigration and Asylum Advocates, the Association of Africans Living in \nVermont, the Vermont Agency of Human Services-State Refugee \nCoordinator, Vermont Interfaith Action, the Housing Resource Center, \nthe Salvation Army, the First Congregational Church of Burlington, the \nCathedral Church of St. Paul, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington, \nthe Islamic Society of Vermont, Ohavi Zedek Synagogue, the Fletcher \nFree Library, and Vermont Adult Basic Education. These volunteers and \norganizations demonstrate the Vermont spirit of tolerance and \ngenerosity. They deserve our thanks and praise.\n  I am proud of the Vermonters who have devoted countless hours to help \nvictims of persecution build new lives in our state. And I am \ncontinually amazed by the resilience of the refugees and asylees in \nVermont. Refugees in Vermont enrich the communities in which they live, \nopening small businesses, farming, and participating in cultural \nactivities. They put all they have at risk to reach the U.S., and once \nhere, strive each day to make our country better and to give their \nchildren every opportunity that America offers.\n  The bill I introduce today will give refugees and asylum seekers a \nfair chance of finding safety in the U.S. For those who seek asylum, it \neliminates the requirement added to the law in 1996 that asylum \napplicants file their claim within 1 year of arrival. By definition, \nworthy asylum applicants arrive in the U.S. after suffering serious \nharm abroad, often experiencing post-traumatic stress. They often must \nspend their first months here learning the language and adjusting to a \nculture that in many cases is extraordinarily different from the one \nthey know. I understand the desire to have asylum seekers submit timely \napplications, but the 1-year rule was deemed unnecessary by the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service when it was enacted. In \npractice, it has barred genuine applicants from gaining the benefits of \nour asylum law, resulting in their return to the country in which they \nwere persecuted.\n  The bill also makes a number of modifications to give asylum seekers \na fair opportunity to respond to requests for corroborating evidence, \nto clarify inconsistencies, and to provide evidence of the persecution \nthey suffered or that which they fear if returned. None of these \nchanges to the law will encourage fraud or frivolous claims; they \nsimply ensure that no asylum seeker is denied the opportunity to \npresent a full application for relief.\n  The 1996 immigration law created the system called ``expedited \nremoval,'' which enables an immigration officer to prevent certain non-\ncitizens from entering the U.S. I fought against expedited removal in \n1996 because I feared that asylum seekers could be turned away from our \nborders without being given the chance to seek protection. In 2005, the \nU.S. Commission for International Religious Freedom, a bipartisan \nCommission established by Congress, documented widespread problems in \nthe implementation of expedited removal. The Refugee Protection Act of \n2010 responds to the Commission's findings by requiring that asylum \nseekers who pass an initial ``credible fear'' interview proceed to an \ninterview with an asylum officer instead of being sent straight to the \nimmigration removal system. Any asylum seeker who is not granted \nprotection by the asylum officer would then be placed in removal \nproceedings and proceed to an adversarial hearing before an immigration \njudge.\n  Under current law, an asylum seeker who arrives at our borders and \nimmediately requests protection is detained. We should not detain \npeople whom our own Government has found to be likely candidates for \nasylum as if they were awaiting a criminal trial. Moreover, the cost to \nthe Government to detain an asylum seeker for months at a time cannot \nbe justified, especially if they have family members or nongovernmental \norganizations that are willing to house them and ensure that they \nappear for their asylum hearing. The Refugee Protection Act would \nclarify that the Secretary of Homeland Security should release asylum \nseekers as long as they do not pose risks of flight or to public \nsafety. It would codify DHS guidance announced in December 2009 stating \nthat it is the policy of the U.S. to release asylum seekers who have \nbeen found to have a credible fear of persecution and who meet the \ncriteria for release.\n  The bill also instructs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to \nauthorize and promote the use of alternatives to the detention of \nasylum seekers, such as releasing them to private nonprofit voluntary \nagencies. For those who would still be detained, the bill would \nguarantee access to legal and religious services, humane treatment in \ndetention, and medical care where needed. These changes will reduce the \ndetention of asylum seekers, offer them fundamental due process, and \nimprove the conditions of their confinement in those cases where \ndetention is appropriate. I have long urged an improvement of the \nshameful conditions of immigration detention, and this need is \nparticularly acute for asylum seekers.\n  For years, I have fought to modify a law that prevents genuine \nrefugees and\n\n[[Page S1520]]\n\nasylum seekers from obtaining protection in the U.S. The law, which \ncontains an overly broad definition of ``material support'' to \nterrorist organizations, has the effect of barring some who were \nvictims of terrorist organizations. More than 2 years ago, Senator Kyl \nand I worked together to ensure that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity had the authority it needed to provide waivers and exemptions \nin certain ``material support'' cases. The Obama administration \nconvened an interagency process to try to resolve the matter, but \nthousands of refugees with pending adjustment of status applications \nare still being held in limbo while the Government studies how to \nexercise its exemption and waiver authority. This bill contains \nlanguage that would fix this problem once and for all. The bill \nmodifies definitions in the statute to ensure that innocent asylum \nseekers and refugees are not unfairly denied protection as a result of \nthe material support and terrorism bars in the law, while ensuring that \nthose with material ties to terrorist activity will be denied entry to \nthe U.S.\n  This bill makes common sense changes to refugee adjudication and \nresettlement. It eliminates the 1-year waiting period for refugees and \nasylees to apply for lawful permanent residence, facilitating \nassimilation into our communities. The bill also allows certain \nchildren and family members of refugees to be considered as derivative \napplicants for refugee status, as long as they pass standard security \nchecks and expedites the adjudication of family reunification \npetitions.\n  The potential effect of these changes is best illustrated by an \nexample. One of the Lost Boys originally resettled in Vermont is a \nyoung man named Jacob. He attended my alma mater, St. Michael's \nCollege, at some point visited Kenya, got married and fathered twin \nsons before returning to Vermont. After he became a U.S. citizen, he \nvisited his wife in Kenya again, this time fathering twin daughters. I \nam happy that my office was able to assist Jacob, and his entire family \nis now happily living in the U.S. Had the Refugee Protection Act been \nenacted, Jacob's family might have been reunited much sooner. The bill \nI introduce today will greatly facilitate family reunification, which \nis at the core of American values.\n  This bill will also help children who have been separated from their \nfamilies during war or flight from persecution. For a child who has \nbeen separated from immediate family, and where it is in the best \ninterest of the child, the bill would authorize refugee status and \nenable such a child to come to the U.S. I am committed to working with \nthe Departments of State and Homeland Security to ensure that the \n``best interest of the child'' protects families that are separated for \nmonths or years, but later discover that children lost or feared dead \ncan be reunited with their immediate relatives.\n  The need for such authority is illustrated by a Vermont resettlement \ncase I know very well. After the Rwandan atrocities, Martha believed \nher son Eric had been killed. A number of years later, she learned that \nher son was alive and living in the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, along \nwith his two young first cousins. Eric had fled the violence with these \ntwo boys on his back, and he is the only father figure they have ever \nknown. Martha petitioned to bring her son and nephews to Vermont, but \nonly her son was granted refugee status as a derivative child. Martha \nhad not seen her son for 10 years, but until my office intervened, the \ncase had languished due to miscommunication. After the case was \nreactivated, Eric had to decide whether to join his mother in Vermont \nor to stay in the refugee camp to continue caring for his two young \ncousins. Eric made the heart-wrenching decision to resettle in Vermont. \nEight months after Eric arrived, with the help of my office, his two \nyoung cousins were successfully resettled with him. Martha is fully \nemployed, just passed her naturalization exam and is about to be sworn \nin as a U.S. citizen. Eric has been working two jobs, studying, and \nraising his cousins, who are both doing quite well in school. This case \nhas a happy ending, but it should not have been so hard or taken so \nlong to resolve. The Refugee Protection Act will help to bring families \nlike Martha's together more quickly.\n  This bill authorizes the Secretary of State to designate certain \ngroups as eligible for expedited adjudication as refugees. Such a \nchange to law would assist those who are at a particularly high risk of \nharm, such as certain groups of Iraqi refugees, groups targeted for \ngenocide, or gay men in countries that impose the death penalty on \nhomosexuals. Congress has tried to respond to specific crises with \nSpecial Immigrant Visas and other limited forms of relief, but \nsomething more must be done.\n  Again, an example is illustrative. An Iraqi family, a mother and two \ndaughters, came to Vermont as refugees from Iraq by way of Syria, after \nthe father had been killed. The son believed his life to also be in \ndanger in Iraq, because he had worked as a driver for a U.S. military \ncontractor. Just before completing the resettlement process, the adult \nson was forced by Syria to leave the country, and he made his way to \nSweden. While he was safe there for a short while, Sweden soon started \ntaking action to deport many Iraqi refugees that it had previously \nwelcomed. The separation was extremely painful for this close-knit \nfamily. They were having a difficult time reopening his resettlement \ncase, but my office was able to help this young man finally receive a \nSpecial Immigrant Visa for Iraqis Employed on Behalf of the U.S. \nGovernment. He was finally reunited with his family in Burlington. I \nwould prefer to see the Secretary of State be able to designate certain \nhighly vulnerable groups for expedited adjudication, so that stories \nlike this one are not common, and eligible refugees reach safety here \nin the U.S. as soon as possible.\n  Finally, this bill makes targeted improvements to the resettlement \nprocess in the United States. Most importantly, it prevents newly \nresettled refugees from slipping into poverty by adjusting the per \ncapita refugee resettlement grant level annually for inflation and the \ncost of living. The current per capita grant is $1,800, but it was just \nraised in January 2010 from roughly half that amount. I thank the Obama \nadministration for recognizing the need to raise the per capita grant \nlevel, but believe it must be adjusted annually for inflation and the \ncost of living. This bill will ensure that the per capita grant level \ndoes not decrease in real terms over time.\n  This bill is supported by leading refugee resettlement organizations \nacross the Nation including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, \nHebrew Immigrant Aid Society, International Rescue Committee, Lutheran \nImmigrant & Refugee Service, the Episcopal Church, Refugee Council USA, \nHeartland Alliance for Human Needs and Human Rights, Church World \nService, and the Interfaith Refugee and Immigration Ministries of \nIllinois. The Congressionally-created and bipartisan U.S. Commission \nfor International Religious Freedom endorsed the provisions that make \nimprovements to the expedited removal system. It is endorsed by \nadvocates and legal aid providers serving the refugee and asylee \ncommunity, including the American Bar Association, Human Rights First, \nNational Immigrant Justice Center, the Center for Gender & Refugee \nStudies at U.C. Hastings College of the Law, Tahirih Justice Center, \nAmerican Immigration Lawyers Association, National Immigration Forum, \nRefugees International, Immigration Equality, Amnesty International \nUSA, Human Rights Watch, and the American Civil Liberties Union. And in \nVermont, it has the support of the Vermont Refugee Resettlement \nProgram, Vermont Immigration and Asylum Advocates, and the Association \nof Africans Living in Vermont. All of those organizations that stand \nwith me in support of this legislation have my sincere thanks.\n  The 30th anniversary of the Refugee Act is this week. It is time to \nrenew America's commitment to the Refugee Convention, and to bring our \nlaw back into compliance with the Convention's promise of protection. \nOur Nation is a leader among the asylum-providing countries, and our \ncommunities have embraced refugees and asylum seekers, welcoming them \nas Americans. Our laws must now match that humanitarian spirit.

A bill to strengthen the capacity of eligible institutions \nto provide instruction in nanotechnology; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, to introduce the Promote \nNanotechnology in Schools Act of 2010.\n  As Co-Chair of the Congressional Nanotechnology Caucus, and former \nChair of the Commerce Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and \nInnovation, I have been involved in encouraging the development of \nnanotechnology for many years. Although I am gratified by the \ntremendous advancements that have already been achieved in \nnanotechnology, there are significant hurdles that could prevent the \nU.S. from realizing the full potential that nanotechnology holds for \njob creation, economic growth, and international competitiveness.\n  During this challenging period when the economy is faltering and the \ngovernment is working to help create jobs, nanotechnology represents an \nopportunity to provide long-term, well-paid employment for millions of \nAmericans. In fact, the National Nanotechnology Initiative--the Federal \nGovernment organization that coordinates nanotechnology research across \nall Federal agencies--estimates that the global nanotechnology \nworkforce will require 2 million trained workers by 2015. It is \nestimated that only 20,000 workers are currently employed in this \nfield.\n  To ensure that many of the needed jobs will be created here in the \nU.S., it is necessary to provide our students\n\n[[Page S1529]]\n\nwith the tools that will provide the skills and knowledge that \nnanotechnology companies need. This is exactly what the Promote \nNanotechnology in Schools Act will do.\n  This act directs the National Science Foundation to establish a grant \nprogram that would provide schools, community colleges, 2- and 4-year \ncolleges and universities and other educational institutions with up to \n$400,000 to purchase nanotechnology education equipment and materials. \nSchools participating in the program would be required to provide \nmatching funds of at least 1/4 of the amount of the grant.\n  In my home State, it has been very rewarding to see the technological \nadvances and entrepreneurial success achieved by the Oregon Nanoscience \nand Microtechnologies Institute, ONAMI. Oregon's first signature \nresearch center, ONAMI is a public-private partnership between the \nState's top research universities, major corporations, and small \nbusiness entrepreneurs. Working with top scientists and graduate \nstudents, and leveraging the nanotechnology equipment available at \nOregon's public universities, ONAMI has provided gap funding to 18 \nstart-up businesses, which have created at least 60 new jobs.\n  While Oregon has been a leader in this arena, it is certainly not \nalone. Nanotechnology job creation efforts are accelerating in hubs for \ntechnology development throughout the country. As Co-Chair of the \nCongressional Nanotechnology Caucus, I have had the opportunity to talk \nwith innovators and entrepreneurs from nanotechnology companies working \nin the areas as diverse as energy management, health technology, \nenvironmental sciences, advanced computing, textile and material \nsciences, and many others. What I have heard in common across all of \nthese fields is the need for qualified workers.\n  If high school and college students are not exposed to \nnanotechnology, this emerging field will not be able to reach its full \npotential. Without a qualified workforce that will allow nanotech \ncompanies in this country to scale-up, foreign competitors will be able \nto fill the vacuum in the global marketplace. With the Promote \nNanotechnology in Schools Act, this country will put the resources into \nplace that will prepare our students to meet the needs of the emerging \nnanotech economy.\n  That is why I want to thank Senator Snowe for joining me in \nintroducing this timely, and much-needed legislation. I also want to \nacknowledge the support and efforts of the nanotech companies that \nworked with me and other Members of Congress to help build support for \nthis bill. Finally, I call upon my colleagues to move quickly not only \nto pass this legislation but also the National Nanotechnology \nInitiative Amendments Act reauthorization. These important bills will \nhelp advance nanotechnology in this country, and protect the U.S.'s \nposition at the forefront of innovation and economic opportunity.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support innovation and promote \nentrepreneurial competition by cosponsoring this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/15/senate-section/article/S1529-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 454--SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF WORLD TUBERCULOSIS DAY \n                 TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT TUBERCULOSIS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 454\n\n       Whereas tuberculosis (TB) is the second leading global \n     infectious disease killer behind HIV/AIDS, claiming 1,800,000 \n     lives each year;\n       Whereas the global TB pandemic and spread of drug resistant \n     TB present a persistent public health threat to the United \n     States;\n       Whereas according to 2009 data from the World Health \n     Organization, 5 percent of all new TB cases are drug \n     resistant;\n       Whereas TB is the leading killer of people with HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas TB is the third leading killer of adult women, and \n     the stigma associated with TB disproportionately affects \n     women, causing them to delay seeking care and interfering \n     with treatment adherence;\n       Whereas the Institute of Medicine found that the resurgence \n     of TB between 1980 and 1992 was caused by cuts in TB control \n     funding and the spread of HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas, although the numbers of TB cases in the United \n     States continue to decline, progress towards TB elimination \n     has slowed, and it is a disease that does not recognize \n     borders;\n       Whereas an extensively drug resistant strain of TB, known \n     as XDR-TB, is very difficult and expensive to treat and has \n     high and rapid fatality rates, especially among HIV/AIDS \n     patients;\n       Whereas the United States has had more than 83 cases of \n     XDR-TB over the last decade;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimated in 2009 that it costs $483,000 to treat a single \n     case of XDR-TB;\n       Whereas African-Americans are 8 times more likely to have \n     TB than Caucasians, and significant disparities exist among \n     other United State minorities, including Native Americans, \n     Asian-Americans, and Hispanic-Americans;\n       Whereas the United States public health system has the \n     expertise to eliminate TB, but many State TB programs have \n     been left seriously under-resourced due to budget cuts at a \n     time when TB cases are growing more complex to diagnose and \n     treat;\n       Whereas, although drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines for TB \n     exist, these technologies are antiquated and are increasingly \n     inadequate for controlling the global epidemic;\n       Whereas the most commonly used TB diagnostic in the world, \n     sputum microscopy, is more than 100 years old and lacks \n     sensitivity to detect TB in most HIV/AIDS patients and in \n     children;\n       Whereas current tests to detect drug resistance take at \n     least 1 month to complete and faster drug susceptibility \n     tests must be developed to stop the spread of drug resistant \n     TB;\n       Whereas the TB vaccine, BCG, provides some protection to \n     children, but has little or no efficacy in preventing \n     pulmonary TB in adults;\n       Whereas there is also a critical need for new TB drugs that \n     can safely be taken concurrently with antiretroviral therapy \n     for HIV;\n       Whereas the Global Health Initiative commits to reducing TB \n     prevalence by 50 percent;\n       Whereas enactment of the Lantos-Hyde Global Leadership \n     Against HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria Act and the Comprehensive \n     TB Elimination Act provide an historic United States \n     commitment to the global eradication of TB, including to the \n     successful treatment of 4,500,000 new TB patients and 90,000 \n     new multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB cases by 2013, while \n     providing additional treatment through coordinated \n     multilateral efforts;\n       Whereas the United States Agency for International \n     Development provides financial and technical assistance to \n     nearly 40 highly burdened TB countries and supports the \n     development of new diagnostic and treatment tools, and is \n     authorized to support research to develop new vaccines to \n     combat TB;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     working in partnership with United States, States, and \n     territories, directs the national TB elimination program and \n     essential national TB surveillance, technical assistance, \n     prevention activities, and supports the development of new \n     diagnostic, treatment, and prevention tools to combat TB;\n       Whereas the National Institutes of Health, through its many \n     institutes and centers, plays the leading role in basic and \n     clinical research into the identification, treatment, and \n     prevention of TB;\n       Whereas the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \n     Malaria provides 63 percent of all international financing \n     for TB programs worldwide and finances proposals worth \n     $3,200,000,000 in 112 countries, and TB treatment for \n     6,000,000 people, 1,800,000 HIV/TB services, and in many \n     countries in which the Global Fund supports programs, TB \n     prevalence is declining, as are TB mortality rates; and\n       Whereas, March 24, 2010 is World Tuberculosis Day, a day \n     that commemorates the date in 1882 when Dr. Robert Koch \n     announced his discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the \n     bacteria that causes tuberculosis: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals of World Tuberculosis Day to raise \n     awareness about tuberculosis;\n       (2) commends the progress made by anti-tuberculosis \n     programs, including the United States Agency for \n     International Development, the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the \n     Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and\n       (3) reaffirms its commitment to global tuberculosis control \n     made through the Lantos-Hyde United States Leadership Against \n     HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2008 (Public Law \n     108-25; 117 Stat. 711).\n\n
