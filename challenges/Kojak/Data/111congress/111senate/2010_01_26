Madam President, at the end of last December, I made a \ncommitment to bring S. 2799, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions \nAccountability and Divestment Act, to the Senate floor. This critical \nlegislation would impose new sanctions on Iran's refined petroleum \nsector and tighten existing U.N. sanctions. The act will create \npressure on the Iranian regime and help stop Iran from acquiring a \nnuclear weapon. I thank Senator Dodd, Senator Kerry, and many other \nSenators for their hard work.\n  I have had conversations with the distinguished Republican leader. We \nare committed to finding a time to do this legislation. This is going \nto be a piece of legislation dealing with just this narrow issue. We \ncannot get into foreign aid and all those other things. I am reaching \nout to my Republican colleagues to help me find a path to get that done \nin the next few weeks. We started this session by working on important \nlegislation to prevent the Federal Government from defaulting on its \nobligations, including my amendment to put in place strict statutory \nrequirements that will ensure the cost of any new spending or tax cuts \nwill not increase our deficit. But everyone should know that I am \nlooking forward to moving on the Iran Sanctions Act, as I have \nindicated, but we are going to need some cooperation to get this \nlegislation done. I had a conversation with the Republican leader \nyesterday, and it is our goal to finish the legislation on the debt \nlimit quickly. Hopefully, we can do that and maybe the Bernanke \nnomination by Thursday or Friday.\n  The Republicans have scheduled a retreat. We are going to have one \nnext week. When this was scheduled, no one\n\n[[Page S210]]\n\nknew when the President was going to give his State of the Union \nMessage. But it happens it is on tomorrow. So we have the State of the \nUnion tomorrow night. We have the retreat tomorrow. We are not going to \nhave any legislative issues here unless the Republicans have agreed. We \nare not going to interfere in any way with their retreat. These are \nextremely important. The two caucuses can move alone and not be \nbothered by other things. It is very important. We are going to do the \nsame next week. I think what we have done in the last year or so has \nbeen important. We used to do these retreats on Fridays, but with \nschedules such as they are, not many people showed up, or not as many \nas we wanted. With the new schedule of having votes on Tuesday and \nThursday, in fact, it causes people to want to be here on Wednesday.\n  I look forward to working with the Republican leader and others in \ncoming up with a glidepath to finishing these matters as quickly as we \ncan. By virtue of some cloture motions I filed, we are scheduled for \nvotes in the morning. I want to do everything I can to avoid that and \nwill maybe put those over until Thursday or maybe try to get rid of \nthose votes today would be the best thing we could do.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend the Republican leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/26/senate-section/article/S210-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, a year ago this week, millions of \nAmericans were looking to Washington with the hope that always comes \nwith a new beginning. In the midst of a terrible economic downturn, a \nnew President was vowing to meet our problems head-on. Americans hoped \nfor every success, but in the 12 months that have passed since then, \nAmericans have not seen the improvements they were hoping for. Far from \nit. Since last January, nearly 3.5 million Americans have lost their \njobs and nearly 3 million have lost their homes. Americans are still \nstruggling, and they are looking to Washington for the policies that \nwill right our economic ship.\n  To their credit, the President and his allies in Congress tried to do \nsomething about our economic situation. Unfortunately, their policies \nmissed the mark, and 2009 was another very difficult year. Americans \nwaited patiently for the administration and Congress to implement \npolicies that would create the conditions for creating jobs, growing \nbusinesses, and helping struggling middle-class families weather the \nrecession. Instead, they got policies that vastly increased government \nspending and put a crushing amount of debt onto the Federal credit \ncard. Then Americans looked on in disbelief as the administration spent \nalmost an entire year--an entire year--pursuing a closed-door, partisan \nhealth care plan that would have raised their taxes and their health \ninsurance premiums and slashed Medicare for seniors in the middle of a \nrecession.\n  By the time November came around, Americans had clearly run out of \npatience--not with the President, whom they like, but with the \nadministration's policies. They rejected a trillion-dollar stimulus \nbill that was supposed to stop unemployment at 8 percent but did not. \nThey rejected a budget that will double the national debt in 5 years \nand triple it in 10. And they rejected a health care plan that would \nhave led to higher costs, lower quality, and massive new government \nspending. The American people have spoken clearly. They want a new \npolicy direction.\n  This is why some of the comments we have been hearing in the \nadministration about its plans for the year ahead are so distressing. \nThe lesson of the last year should be crystal clear: Americans are not \nhappy with the administration's approach. They are tired of the \nspending, debt, and government takeovers. They want a step-by-step \napproach to our problems, not grand government experiments and schemes. \nYet some in the administration seem to believe that the message of \nVirginia, New Jersey, and Massachusetts is something entirely \ndifferent. They seem to think the voters are frustrated at nothing in \nparticular, that they are just angry in general. The proper response to \nthese elections, the administration seems to think, is to retool its \nmessage to make people believe it is finding new ways to help the \neconomy, even as it continues to pursue the exact same policies as \nbefore. One of the President's top advisers insisted over the weekend, \nfor example, that the administration will continue to pursue its plan \nfor health care even as it works to retool its message on the economy. \nThis is a clear sign that the administration has not gotten the \nmessage; that it has become too attached to its own pet goals; that it \nis stuck in neutral when the American people are asking it to change \ndirection. And then the administration said over the weekend that \nAmericans will not know what is in the Democratic plan for health care \nunless and until it is passed. That is precisely the problem. Americans \ndo not want to have to learn about what politicians in Washington are \ndoing to their health care after the fact. They want to know the \ndetails before the changes are approved, not later.\n  Americans are not frustrated in general; they are frustrated with an \nadministration that insists on taking them in a direction they do not \nwant to go and which does not seem to be interested in acknowledging \nthe direction in which Americans actually want to go.\n  These are some of the signs that the administration has not gotten \nthe message. But it is not too late. Tomorrow night, the President will \ndeliver his State of the Union Address. It is my hope that he deals not \nin a retooled message but in a changed direction and that he advances \nit with the same kind of enthusiasm and intensity that he attempted to \nadvance his health care plan.\n  Here are some of the things the President could do tomorrow night:\n  First, put the 2,700-page Democratic health care bill on the shelf \nand leave it there. The best first step we could take in righting our \neconomic ship is to take this job-killing and tax-increasing \nmonstrosity off the table once and for all and move toward the kind of \nstep-by-step approach Americans really want.\n  Second, declare that taxes will not go up at the end of the year as \nscheduled for millions of American families and businesses. Even some \nDemocrats are calling on the President to do this. Struggling small \nbusinesses are asking themselves whether they can hire new workers. The \nprospect of a massive tax hike makes it far less likely that they will.\n  Third, return unused TARP money and put it toward paying down the \ndeficit. Taxpayers who bailed out the banks last year are wondering why \ntheir money is still laying around unspent. Money that has come back to \nthe Treasury should be used to pay down the deficit, not used on new \nspending programs.\n  Fourth, job programs. The stimulus was sold to the public on the \npromise that it would hold unemployment at 8 percent. A year later, \nunemployment is at 10 percent, its highest level in a quarter century. \nAt a time of trillion-dollar deficits, the President should direct \nunspent stimulus funds to pay down our debts right now, rather than \nhave the money spent on questionable projects 9 years down the road.\n  Fifth, no more debt. Later this week, the administration, with an \nassist from Democrats in Congress, plans to increase the amount of \nmoney available on the Federal credit card by nearly $2 trillion. In \nother words, they want to increase the amount of money we can borrow by \nan amount equivalent to what it cost to pay for the entire Federal \nbudget 10 years ago.\n  Sixth, explain to the American people how the Federal Government will \nend its ownership of auto companies, insurance companies, and banks. \nAmericans do not think the U.S. Government should be one of the largest \nshareholders of GM, Chrysler, and AIG.\n  Seventh, energy. Nuclear power is one of the cleanest, most efficient \nsources of energy. The President should commit to expanding it. Until \nthese clean green sites are up and running, he should allow the States \nto drill for oil and natural gas off their shores, if they want to.\n\n  These are just a few concrete things the President could do to show \nthe\n\n[[Page S211]]\n\nAmerican people he is committed to working with both parties to address \nthe problems Americans are most concerned about, such as doing whatever \nit takes to create jobs and get people who have lost their jobs back to \nwork.\n  Americans aren't looking for cosmetic proposals. They do not want the \nadministration to push sweeping changes it wants but to nibble around \nthe edges when it comes to changes the American people want. It is time \nfor the White House to show it is listening to the American people. If \nthe President opts for solutions that reflect the real concerns of the \nAmerican people, if he moves to the middle with commonsense bipartisan \nideas on job creation, then he can expect the support of Republicans.\n  It is not too late. It is not too late to deliver the kind of \ncommonsense reforms Americans want.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/26/senate-section/article/S211-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I ask \nunanimous consent that I be recognized to manage the time on our side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. After the Senator from Illinois, I will yield up to 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, the Senator from Montana, for yielding 5 minutes.\n  I have listened carefully to the statement made by the Republican \nminority leader on the floor, and I think he has characterized the last \nyear leaving out some very important facts, some glaring omissions in \nhis statement.\n  What the Republican leader failed to mention is, when this President \ncame to the White House, he inherited the worst economic mess in the \nhistory of this country since the Great Depression. The President \nturned to both parties--Democrats and Republicans--and said: We need to \nturn this economy around and do it quickly. He, personally, appealed to \nthe Republican Members of the Senate and the House to join him in a \nbipartisan effort to turn this economy around. At the end of the day, \nthe President put forward a plan to reinvest in America and recover \nthis economy that didn't draw one single Republican vote of support in \nthe House and only three Republican Senate votes. It was, in fact, \nlargely a Democratic effort but not because the President didn't try to \ninclude the Republicans in this effort.\n  What has been the net impact? The Senator from Kentucky comes to the \nfloor and is very critical of the state of the economy. It is easy to \nbe critical. But let us understand from where we came. When the \nPresident took office, we were losing in the range of 800,000 jobs a \nmonth in America--800,000 a month. It was awful. Now we are down to \nabout 10 percent of that total per month that we are losing. It is \nstill too high. We want to start gaining jobs. But understand, in 1 \nyear, we have reduced by 90 percent the monthly loss in unemployment. \nIt is a trend line which is positive, moving us toward a growing \neconomy and growing employment. That is because the President took \nleadership, took control, and--largely with Democratic votes--passed a \nstimulus package.\n  Also, remember that in April of last year--2009--the Dow Jones \nindustrial index was at 6,500. This morning it is at 10,000. That \nindex, which at least is a reliable index of some economic growth, \nshowed almost a 60-percent increase in value over this 1-year period of \ntime.\n  To be totally dismissive of this effort by the administration is to \nignore the obvious: We have come a long way. We have stared down at the \nabyss and we have drawn back and we are starting to regain our stride, \nas we should. But to dismiss this and say it is just a vain effort that \nhad no impact is to ignore the obvious.\n  Let me also say about the health care bill that we know--and the \nSenator from Montana, as our leader in the Finance Committee, knows \nthis personally--of the efforts the Senator from Montana made to reach \nout to the Republican side of the aisle. He had 61 personal meetings \nwith Republican Senators--Senators Grassley and Enzi and Snowe--in an \neffort to make this a bipartisan bill. Sadly, it didn't result in a \nbipartisan bill but not for lack of effort on our side, not for lack of \neffort in the Senate HELP Committee or the Senate Finance Committee, \nwhere 170 Republican amendments were adopted. Yet, at the end of the \nday, only one Republican Senator--Senator Snowe of Maine--would cast a \nfavorable vote for the committee effort. To argue this has been a \npartisan effort, well, it has been, to some extent, but not for lack of \neffort on the Democratic side to engage the Republicans.\n  What if the Republicans had their way on health care? What if we \nliterally walked away from this challenge? I tell you what will happen: \nIn 7 years, the Medicare Trust Fund will be exhausted. Under the bill \nwe had before the Senate, we added 9 years of life to that Medicare \nTrust Fund. If we do nothing, as many Republicans would have us do, \nthat Medicare Trust Fund will start to fail in 7 years.\n  Let me also add, if we do nothing, the number of uninsured will grow \nfrom 47 million today in America to 57 million and continue to grow. \nPeople will lose their insurance, and those insured will have little \nprotection as this market becomes even more ruthless.\n  Finally, let me add, the cost of health insurance, if we do nothing, \nis going to grow dramatically. We expect it to more than double in 10 \nyears. Think about that--what it means to individual wage earners, \nbusinesses, and families if more and more money has to be plowed into \nhealth insurance costs with no increase in coverage. That is the \nreality of the Republican approach. Do nothing or do little but go \nslowly. Take tiny, little pieces of this instead of looking at the \nchallenge we face. That may be the political reality, but I don't \napplaud it.\n  Our effort at comprehensive health care reform took on an issue which \nis central to our economy's growth. If we don't deal with the cost of \nhealth care, unfortunately, we are going to find ourselves in a very \ndifficult competitive position in the world.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                         Bernanke Reappointment\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to share a few remarks on the \nreappointment of Mr. Bernanke as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. \nI do\n\n[[Page S212]]\n\nbelieve we should state our views about it. I stand in opposition to \nhis nomination; I intend to vote against it.\n  First, I believe the financial debacle this Nation is desperately \nattempting to work its way through did not have to happen. That free \neconomies have a tendency to boom and bust, there can be no doubt. But \nsound Federal economic and fiscal policy that promotes stability and a \nsound dollar can mitigate against the excesses of market cycles and \nkeep them from ratcheting out of control, as we have seen here.\n  What role did Mr. Bernanke play before the bubble burst? For 3 years, \nhe served on the Federal Reserve Board, where much of our Nation's \nfinancial policy is set and, in 2006, he followed Mr. Greenspan as \nChairman. The American people have a right to ask: How did he perform \nduring that period? Did he see this crisis coming, did he give warning, \nand did he take any actions that could have ameliorated or avoided the \ncatastrophe that has befallen us? The minutes of the Federal Reserve \nBoard during the critical 2003 time period show he was what the Wall \nStreet Journal called ``the intellectual architect'' of the loose money \npolicies that, as the Journal notes, kept:\n\n       . . . monetary policy exceptionally easy for far too long \n     as the economy grew rapidly from 2003-2005. He imagined a \n     ``deflation'' that never occurred, ignored the asset bubbles \n     in commodities and housing, dismissed concerns about dollar \n     weakness, and in the process stoked the credit mania that led \n     to the financial panic.\n\n  That is what the Wall Street Journal said about it, and I think that \nhas to be considered an accurate and fair comment. Only responsible \nactions, perhaps painful to us now in the short run, founded on mature \nunderstanding of the forces that actually control world economies will \ndo today. The time for artificial government policies and spending and \nstimulus is past. Nothing comes from nothing. Reducing deficits \nsignificantly will be necessary and will be painful, but only such a \npolicy, resolutely executed, will inspire real confidence that we are \non the right track.\n\n       Transferring massive private debt to massive government \n     debt, as we have done, tripling our total national debt in 10 \n     years--as we are on the path to do under the President's own \n     budget--is wrong and unacceptable. Experts and the normal \n     person know such policies will only end poorly. We need the \n     kind of responsible policies the bipartisan team of Fed \n     Chairman Paul Volcker and President Reagan executed, policies \n     that led eventually to 20 years of sound growth. But, for \n     sure, stabilizing an economy in turmoil was difficult for \n     them and for the American people at the time, for a while. \n     But the people understood sound policy was needed in the \n     early 1980s, and they stayed with their strong leaders \n     through the tough times. The people knew then we had acted \n     irresponsibly--as we have today--and they knew a steep hill \n     had to be climbed to get us on sound footing. They met the \n     challenge.\n\n  I am not seeing that kind of leadership today. President Reagan knew \nhe would be criticized, but he knew this great Nation would rebound. He \nhad confidence in our people and in free markets. He did not, for one \nmoment, believe expanding government would lead to economic growth.\n  During this time of economic turmoil, I don't think we are hearing \nthat kind of economic straight, honest talk. We are told not to worry; \nthat we are going to spend our way out of debt. We will have the \ngovernment stimulate the economy. Well, if that is so easy, why don't \nwe do it every day--just spend, spend, spend forever? If that doesn't \nwork, we can have another stimulus package, they tell us. Deficits \ndon't matter. Debt doesn't matter. We will worry about the consequences \nof that later. The President of the European Union said this strategy \nwas the economic ``road to hell.'' And I think that is an embarrassment \nto the United States. The Chinese are aghast. But this is the plan of \nthe President and Mr. Bernanke--spend it now, worry later.\n  Mr. Bernanke's nomination is before us today. He was the prime \narchitect of the policies that got us into this mess. He did not see it \ncoming. He supported the disastrous $800 billion stimulus package, \nevery penny of which was mainly social spending--had to be borrowed, \nand it has not produced the kind of jobs and growth we needed because \nit was not focused sufficiently on job creation.\n  Mr. Bernanke also supported the $182 billion bailout of AIG, and now \nwe know most of that money was used to compensate AIG's counterparties, \nsuch as Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank at 100 cents on the dollar, \nwhich I think is unthinkable. Last November, the TARP inspector \ngeneral, Neil Barofsky, reported that the Federal Reserve did not \nbelieve AIG's counterparties posed a systemic risk to the economy, \nwhich frankly calls into question the entire justification for the \nbailout.\n  Amazingly, Chairman Bernanke has learned little from these errors, \nand that worries me. Tragically, he is supporting or acquiescing in \npolicies that I think have proven not to work and are contrary to sound \ncommon sense. If there is any dispute about his leadership, I call my \ncolleagues' attention to his speech on January 3. There he plainly \nrefused to acknowledge his loose money policies were a significant \nfactor in creating the bubble and the inevitable bust. Incredibly, he \nrelied on half-truths to justify his abandonment of the Taylor rule, a \nformula that has proven to work to contain the temptation for \nexcessively low interest rates.\n  While anyone can make a mistake, becoming too insulated, too \narrogant, too political, and coming to believe tried and true \nprinciples no longer apply in the new world of today, is especially \ndangerous. He has not admitted his mistakes nor is he calling us to the \ntried and true. Sound money, low taxes, solid, steady growth, and \nincreased productivity based on the historic principles of a free \neconomy--principles that are as immutable as the law of gravity--are \nthe foundation of economic growth, not government spending and Fed \nmaneuvering.\n  At one of my townhall meetings, a man offered that his daddy always \nsaid, ``You can't borrow your way out of debt.'' How true. Shouldn't we \nbe hearing such common sense from the Fed? You can't produce something \nfrom nothing. There is no free lunch. Somebody will pay. Our ``masters \nof the universe'' think these rules don't apply to them--a most \ndangerous arrogance indeed.\n  Right now, the American people, our constituents, are the ones \npaying. It is time for the ``masters of the universe'' who are \nresponsible to pay--those who rejected the tried and true; those who \nbelieve that since we are blessed with their leadership, with their \nbrilliance, America doesn't have to move forward steadily and soundly; \nthat the old verities do not apply and, if things get a bit dicey, why \nby exercising their skill and exceptional knowledge they can fix it \nbefore anything bad happens. Did that happen before, in 2007? They were \nnot so smart then.\n  I think these are the most dangerous leaders--the ones who know the \nrules but believe they are so brilliant that they may ignore them.\n  Mr. Taylor, the one of the rule, laid it out in the Wall Street \nJournal on January 11, 2010. I don't see how anyone can seriously argue \nthat keeping interest rates so low, maintaining easy money, during the \n2002-2005 period did not play a significant role in the bubble and the \nresulting bust. Not only was Chairman Bernanke intimately involved in \nthe creation of these disastrous policies, as was President Obama's \nSecretary of Treasury Geithner, but he maintains today his violation of \nthe Taylor rule was no harm no foul.\n  Chairman Bernanke should be rejected for his grievous previous \nmistakes that helped cause this economic debacle, and he should be \nrejected, even more emphatically, for his failure to learn from his \nmistakes.\n  In December, former Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the \nSenate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, saying:\n\n       The challenge to contain this threat is more urgent than at \n     any time in our history. Our nation has never before had to \n     confront so formidable a fiscal crisis as is now visible just \n     over the horizon.\n\n  That is a real warning.\n  We need a courageous Chairman of the Fed, of the quality and firmness \nof Chairman Volcker, one who average Americans, and importantly, our \ntop corporate leaders, will recognize as being a consistent voice and \nforce for sound financial policy--one who knows he is not so brilliant \nthat he can cease to be bound by the iron laws of economics and \nmarkets.\n  We need a courageous Fed Chairman who has the firmness of Mr. Volcker \nto lead us through this period. I have not\n\n[[Page S213]]\n\nseen that in Mr. Bernanke and will oppose his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3302\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President. I would like to express my strong \nsupport for the Conrad-Gregg fiscal task force amendment. I thank \nChairman Conrad and Senator Gregg for crafting a proposal that rises \nabove petty Washington partisan bickering.\n  When my oldest daughter Caroline was born in 1999, our Nation's debt \nstood at about $5.6 trillion. Our country welcomed her with an unpaid \nbill totaling $20,000--the amount every American would have to pay up \nin order to balance the budget.\n  But there was reason for hope. A President was working with Congress, \nusing pay-go and discretionary spending limits--and reducing our annual \ndeficit down to virtually zero, even running a surplus in a much \nstronger economy than today's.\n  Two years later, we welcomed Caroline's younger sister Halina into \nour family. Our debt had jumped to about $5.8 trillion. She also owed \nabout $20,000. We had a new administration with new priorities--tax \ncuts that were not paid for, a prescription drug plan that was piled on \nthe deficit, and unfunded mandates like No Child Left Behind, and the \nwar in Iraq.\n  In 2004, we welcomed our youngest daughter Anne. The debt had \nskyrocketed to over $7.3 trillion. Anne's share of the national debt \nstood at $25,000.\n  By Caroline's 10th birthday last year, the national debt stood at \nabout $11 trillion--double what it was when she was born. She owed \nabout $36,000 at this point. I would have to say that is a lousy \nbirthday present for any 10-year-old.\n  Now we have had to deal with the worst recession since the Great \nDepression, and the necessary steps we have taken to provide middle \nclass and small business tax cuts and preserve jobs for police officers \nand teachers have contributed to the red ink.\n  Today, our debt stands at just over $12 trillion. Each person owes \nabout $40,000. By 2019, the White House projects that it will double \nyet again. If we do not come to our senses soon, we may pass the point \nof no return with this unfair and vast mortgage on our children's \nfuture.\n  The other day I was at a house party in Denver and I was talking \nabout how we were passing this debt on to our kids and they were going \nto have to pay it back. Caroline was with me. We walked outside the \nparty and she said: Daddy? I said: What? She said: Just to be clear, I \nam not paying that back. Which I think is the right attitude we should \nhave. We need to take care of it now.\n  No Member of this body wants my three daughters or any child to \ninherit the fiscal mess we have caused. Yet partisan stalemate prevents \nreform from even getting off the ground.\n  For my part, I introduced the Deficit Reduction Act, which would \nreinstitute discretionary spending limits and cap our deficit to 3 \npercent of the GDP, and I cosponsored pay-go. Yet even ideas as basic \nas these have faced stiff opposition.\n  We need the Conrad-Gregg amendment. Their commission would enable \nCongress to reduce the deficit without the usual backroom deals, \nappeasing of special interest groups, and engaging in partisan \nblamesmanship.\n  It is a shame that a commission is necessary. But it is. We have to \ntake the partisanship out of reducing the deficit or nothing will get \ndone. The commission can do this. Sadly, Congress, left to its own \ndevices, has proven that it will not.\n  Conrad-Gregg is a chance to make Congress live by fiscal rules. I \ncommend the President for expressing his strong support for this \namendment.\n  And to my Republican and Democratic colleagues, now is our chance to \nshow that you are serious about real reform--serious about reducing our \ndeficit.\n  I urge my colleagues to follow Judd Gregg's lead, and to follow Kent \nConrad's lead. They designed this commission to allow for everyone's \npoint of view.\n  When I think about extending the debt limit, I cannot help but return \nto my daughters and all the children across this country. They have \ntheir entire lives in front of them.\n  Most of us in this body are parents or grandparents or aunts or \nuncles. One way or another, we are in public service to help our kids. \nLet's view the Conrad-Gregg proposal through their eyes. They are \ndepending on us to plan for their future--to pay for our tax cuts and \nto restrain our spending impulses to only the most important \npriorities.\n  I urge support for the deficit commission proposal. We need 60 \nSenators to stand for fiscal responsibility. Let's not allow this \nchance for bipartisan breakthrough to pass us by. Vote yes on Conrad-\nGregg. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Colorado for his very powerful \nand persuasive remarks this morning. I hope colleagues are listening. \nThis is a time that will define part of our economic future. This vote \nthis morning will be a vote that will be recorded in history.\n  Senator Begich is seeking time.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I am seeking to speak on this issue.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alaska, Senator \nBegich.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I rise today to support the Conrad-Gregg \namendment. Our economic recovery and our Nation's long-term economic \nhealth are at risk. Americans are watching and waiting for Congress and \nthe administration to do the right thing and not accept the status quo.\n  Deficit and debt will rise to an unprecedented level in the coming \ndecades without major changes in our fiscal policies. As of today, our \nnational debt has reached a staggering $12.3 trillion. It has continued \nto climb at an average of $3.89 billion per day since the fall of 2007.\n  I am not complaining. Like you, we are freshmen here. But we were \ndealt the cards and we have the responsibility to take care of it and \nhandle it. If we do not address this, the Federal debt will go \nskyrocketing from 53 percent of our gross domestic product at the end \nof fiscal 2009 to more than 300 percent of GDP in 2050. If we take no \naction, that will be almost three times the existing record which was \nset back when the debt had reached 122 percent of GDP at the end of \nWorld War II. That would leave the economy vulnerable to significant \nharm.\n  Since 2001 we have acted as though debts and deficits did not matter. \nThe national debt has nearly doubled since then because of the way we \nhave paid for things such as wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Bush \ntax schemes. Congresses of the past dealt with these by not paying for \nthem and that has made the recession worse. We are on track to double \nit yet again. Our economic future is on the line and we must work \ntogether to fight for stability and a solution.\n  The fiscal situation is wreaking havoc in my own State of Alaska. \nAlaska's unemployment rate is at a record level of 8.4 percent. Our \neconomic security clearly is at risk. China is our No. 1 creditor and \nhas put us on notice regarding their concerns about American economic \ndecisions. What would happen if China and other foreign nations decided \nthey would no longer engage in financial relationships with the United \nStates? The answer is frightening: higher taxes and interest rates.\n  To my friends across the aisle, let's put aside partisan politics and \ndo what is right for the American people. Many of you are preparing to \nvote against raising the debt limit as well as the Conrad-Gregg \namendment and others. In fact, six of my Republican friends withdrew \ntheir support for this amendment this past Friday, just 24 hours before \nthe Obama administration endorsed it. What does that say to the \nAmerican people? What does it say to the American families trying to \nbalance their family budgets? It says politics as usual.\n  I know my own constituents expect me to play by the same rules they \ndo, to be responsible and pay the bills. I remind all of you that \nincreasing the debt limit does not authorize a single cent of new \nspending. It simply enables\n\n[[Page S214]]\n\nthe Government to pay the bills and prevents the truly dire consequence \nthat would cripple us if the nation were ever in a position of being in \na default.\n  You have a unique opportunity to show Americans that you are willing \nto put aside your political differences for economic security and the \nfuture of this country. I call upon my six colleagues to reconsider and \njoin me in doing the right thing.\n  Americans are frustrated by the political games that are played here \nin Washington. I stand here before you wondering if some of my friends \nacross the aisle are suffering from amnesia. How is it that so many of \nmy Republican colleagues voted seven times to raise the debt limit when \nthey were in the majority and voted at least that many times for \npolicies and spending that were not paid for, but today they stand \nprepared to vote against America simply paying the bills? I call upon \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Conrad-Gregg \namendment or, if that fails, other options that I know will be prepared \nby Senator Baucus and others. It is critical that we deal with this \ndeficit.\n  Again, I am not complaining. I got elected. I ran for this office. We \nwere dealt the cards and it is the responsibility of this Congress to \nstep up, pay the bills, and look at the long-term future. As Senator \nBennet laid out, speaking about his family, his child doesn't want to \npay the bill in the future. We have a responsibility and it is a \npainful responsibility because the bills have mounted and there has \nbeen a lack of that responsibility over the last decade plus. But it is \nincumbent upon us to reach across the aisle and figure out the right \nsolution for the long term.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alaska, Mr. \nBegich, for his strong statement. I also thank him for his attention to \nthe deficit and debt. In meeting after meeting, the Senator from Alaska \nhas been one of the leaders, along with Senator Bennet of Colorado and \nSenator Udall of Colorado.\n  Over and over, they have emphasized the need to our colleagues to \nface up to the debt threat. I very much appreciate their leadership.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I also wish to express my appreciation to \nthe Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Colorado, Senator Bennet, \nfor supporting this effort by myself and Senator Conrad.\n  It is important to note what we are trying do is address what is \ncoming at us as a fiscal crisis of inordinate proportions which will \nprobably leave this Nation in a situation where it will either be \nfiscally bankrupt or confronting a massive reduction in the standard of \nliving for our children.\n  It is a serious issue. I am glad there is a coming together on both \nsides on the need to address it. At this time I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Colorado, Mr. Udall.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I want to start out by \nacknowledging the tremendous leadership of Senator Gregg and Senator \nConrad. Their work together is a breath of fresh air in a town that, \nunfortunately, has become polarized over these last months. But the \namendment today before us is a chance to start anew.\n  In that spirit, I rise today in support of the Conrad-Gregg amendment \nof which I am an original cosponsor. As we have heard, the amendment \nwould create a bipartisan task force to comb through the Federal budget \nand then make recommendations for reining in our annual exploding \ndeficits.\n  In this light, I also applaud President Obama's call yesterday for a \n3-year freeze in Federal discretionary spending. This is a bold \nannouncement. The President has made clear he has heard the American \npeople, including those from Colorado who have asked that the Federal \nGovernment get control over its ever-increasing deficits and debt.\n  Deficit spending, kept as a manageable percentage of our economic \noutput, is one thing, but a deficit of the magnitude that we now face \nis not sustainable. The trajectory we are on makes our current annual \ndeficit look like peanuts. We are at, in sum, a critical point in our \nNation's economic history. If we fail to address this issue now, the \nFederal deficit will have significant economic ramifications in the \nshort run, as Senator Gregg has pointed out, and it will severely \nundermine the prospects for our children and our grandchildren in the \nlong run.\n  Our exploding debt could drive disastrous inflation and leave future \ngenerations with fewer resources to invest in, among other things, \ninfrastructure and education. My colleague from Colorado, Senator \nBennet, put it in perspective when he said: Each and every Coloradan \ntoday owes $40,000 to our national debt. In addition, American \ntaxpayers last year put forward $250 billion to our creditors just for \ninterest payments on our debt. Think what that $250 billion could have \ndone if it was not directed to those interest payments.\n  If we do nothing, by the year 2019 the American taxpayers will owe \nover $700 billion in annual interest alone. That is more than we spent \nlast year to fund two wars and finance all of our other defense \nresponsibilities.\n  So we have a daunting challenge. We need to spur job creation, spend \nwisely, and also chart a course for a balanced Federal budget. Our \ngovernment, as Senator Bennet pointed out, should live by the same \nbudgeting rules hard-working Colorado families live by every day. It \nmakes no difference what your political party is, commonsense budgeting \nis just good policy.\n  In the coming days I look forward to hearing more about President \nObama's proposals to put a freeze in place. I want to study the budget \nthe White House will send us too. I am going to keep fighting for other \nsolutions, practical solutions, to restoring fiscal responsibility, \nsuch as tough statutory pay-go rules, earmark reform, a line-item veto \nauthority for the President, and offering the Conrad-Gregg fiscal task \nforce that is before us today.\n  Unfortunately, as is often the case, partisan politics continues to \nget in the way of pragmatic solutions, and there has been more interest \nin casting blame for deficit spending than breaking the mold and trying \na new approach. Well, I have something to say today. Both parties are \nresponsible for the present situation. So let's quit pointing fingers \nand let's go to work and bridge our political divides. We can do that \nby putting in place this bipartisanship fiscal task force to review the \nentire budget and then force us to take a vote on those \nrecommendations.\n  It will be a hard pill to swallow, but it is medicine that we need to \ntake. In today's political atmosphere, it is unfortunate that the \nDemocrats and Republicans have a hard time finding common ground. But \nthis Gregg-Conrad Commission provides a strong example of how we indeed \ncan and must work together on bipartisan solutions to meet our Nation's \nmost pressing problems.\n  Coloradans, I know, expect no less from me or from Senator Bennet. \nThe fact that President Obama has signaled his strong support for this \namendment underlines the critical importance of this effort.\n  Back in Colorado, back in New Hampshire, back in North Dakota, and \nthroughout the rest of the United States, families are tightening their \nbelts, living within their means, and paying down their own personal \ndebt. When they look at Washington, all they see is partisan bickering \nand exploding national debt, and no efforts to find viable solutions.\n  So, in my opinion, and the opinion of many Senators, the best and \nperhaps the only way to effectively address this potential calamity of \na tsunami of debt is through a special process such as that being \nproposed by Senators Conrad and Gregg.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to support this amendment. We can move \nahead in a responsible and important way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Colorado, Mr. \nUdall. Over and over, he has emphasized the need for fiscal \nresponsibility in dealing with the long-term debt. I very much \nappreciate his words this morning.\n\n[[Page S215]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I do not think there is any disagreement \namong Senators that it is important to reduce our deficit and debt. \nThat is not the issue at all. So that should be off the table. The \nquestion is how.\n  Madam President, the journalist Brooks Atkinson once said:\n\n       The perfect bureaucrat . . . is the [person] who manages to \n     make no decisions and escape all responsibility.\n\n  The Senators from North Dakota and New Hampshire have come up with \nthe perfect process to transform all Senators into bureaucrats. They \nhave come up with a process that saves all Senators from making \ndecisions.\n  They have come up with a process to escape Congress's central \nresponsibility.\n  At the core of the Conrad-Gregg proposal is the idea that Senators \ncould not amend this new commission's recommendations. Senators could \nnot change the commission's product. Senators could not exercise their \ncentral responsibility as legislators.\n  Two things most define a Senator. Senators can amend legislation, \neven with different subjects. And Senators can debate legislation, \nsometimes at length. The Conrad-Gregg proposal curtails both of those \ndefining powers.\n  The Conrad-Gregg proposal completely eliminates the ability to amend. \nAnd the Conrad-Gregg proposal sharply limits the ability to debate.\n  And that is why the first amendment that this Senator offered would \nprotect Social Security. The Conrad-Gregg proposal would not allow \nSenators to offer amendments to protect Social Security later. So that \nis why we have to vote to protect Social Security now, while we still \ncan.\n  The Conrad-Gregg proposal would allow Senators to escape \nresponsibility for cutting Social Security later. So that is why we \nhave to vote now, while we still can, to ensure that this new \ncommission cannot cut Social Security later.\n  Social Security is a solemn contract that we as a Nation made with \nour seniors. They were the Greatest Generation. They fought World War \nII. They fought in Korea. They worked a lifetime. They paid their \ntaxes. And now, we owe them the benefits that they earned.\n  Social Security is one of the greatest poverty-fighting machines ever \ninvented. If Social Security did not exist, 44 percent of America's \nseniors would live in poverty today. Social Security lifts 13 million \nAmerican seniors out of poverty.\n  America's seniors rely on Social Security. For two-thirds of \nAmerica's seniors, Social Security provides most of their income. For \none-third of America's seniors, Social Security provides almost all of \ntheir income.\n  The chairman and ranking Republican member of the Budget Committee \nhave painted a big red bull's-eye on Social Security. Their commission \nis a Social Security-cutting machine.\n  This morning, we will put that proposition to the test. If Senators \nwant to put Social Security on the cutting table, then they should vote \nagainst my amendment. But if they truly want to protect Social \nSecurity, if they do not want this new commission to cut Social \nSecurity, then they should vote for my amendment.\n  At least with regard to Social Security, let us not stand by like \nbureaucrats. Let us take responsibility. And let us protect this vital \nlifeline.\n  I regret that I have only one other amendment slot available to me. \nBecause I also want offer an amendment to protect veterans programs. We \nowe a solemn duty to America's veterans, as well.\n  I also want to offer an amendment to protect America's ranchers and \nfarmers from this commission's cuts.\n  I also want to offer an amendment to protect America's poorest \ncitizens from this commission's cuts to Medicaid.\n  The point is: We don't know where this commission will cut. All we \nknow is that if we adopt this new Conrad-Gregg commission, we will not \nbe able to offer amendments to stop it from cutting Social Security, \nMedicare, veterans programs, farm price supports, or the safety net for \nthe poorest among us.\n  Yes, we should address the fiscal challenges before us.\n  But that does not mean that we have to become bureaucrats. That does \nnot mean that we have to stop making decisions for ourselves. That does \nnot mean that we have to give up all responsibility.\n  For those who favor creating a fiscal commission, there is an \nalternative. Pending before the Senate, in addition to the Conrad-Gregg \ncommission, is this Senator's amendment to create a fiscal commission.\n  My amendment would create the exact same commission as the Conrad-\nGregg amendment. But my amendment would not create new fast-track \nprocedures for the commission's product.\n  Thus, my amendment would allow Members of Congress from both parties \nto come together to formulate policies to address our fiscal \nchallenges.\n  But my amendment would protect the rights of Senators to offer \namendments to the commission's recommendations. My alternative would \nallow Senators the best of both worlds--a bipartisan statutory \ncommission, without the damage to the Senate's process.\n  Some who advocate the Conrad-Gregg amendment have asserted that we \nhave employed special procedures like the Andrews Air Force Base summit \nto enact prior budget agreements. They cite these budget agreements as \na reason to adopt the Conrad-Gregg amendment.\n  But let's look at two recent budget agreements, those of 1990 and \n1997. Both of these agreements led to substantial deficit reduction.\n  Congress enacted both of these budget agreements using the existing \nbudget process. Both in 1990 and in 1997, Congress employed the budget \nreconciliation process to enact these agreements.\n  And as a result, the Senate considered numerous amendments to each of \nthese amendments.\n  The 1990 budget agreement had the support of the first President Bush \nas well as the Democratic leadership of Congress. Even so, the Senate \nconsidered 23 amendments. The Senate voted on 21 amendments to that \nlegislation. That was a broad, bipartisan agreement. But the Senate \nstill allowed amendment. And then, the Senate passed that landmark \nlegislation, using the existing budget process.\n  Again, in 1997, the President and the congressional leadership came \ntogether in a bipartisan budget agreement. That time, in 1997, it was \nPresident Clinton and the Republican leadership in Congress. And even \nthough it was a bipartisan agreement, the Senate considered 77 \namendments. And the Senate voted on 47 amendments to that legislation. \nAnd then, the Senate enacted that landmark legislation.\n  Thus, in the two most successful recent bipartisan efforts to enact \nsubstantial deficit reduction, the Senate employed the existing budget \nprocess. And the Senate allowed Senators to amend those agreements.\n  That is the process that Congress employed in 1990 and 1997. And that \nis the process that Congress should employ to implement any bipartisan \nagreement today.\n  This Senator knows something about bipartisan agreements. This \nSenator knows something about legislating.\n  Moving major legislation is not easy. But it is not impossible, \neither.\n  This Senate has, in recent memory, passed legislation to reform \nhealth care. We have enacted legislation to expand coverage for \nchildren. We have enacted legislation to provide life-saving \nprescription drugs to America's seniors. We have enacted legislation to \ncut taxes broadly for middle-income Americans.\n  And this Senate has, within the memory of this Senator and many of \nour colleagues, enacted major deficit reduction legislation in 1990, in \n1993, and again in 1997.\n  None of those efforts came easily. But then, few good things in life \ndo.\n  That does not mean that they were impossible. That means that they \ntook skill. That means that they took effort. That means that they took \ncourage.\n  Bureaucrats do not enact great legislation. Senators do.\n  I call upon my colleagues. The people of our States elected us to do \nthis work. Let us not shirk our responsibility.\n  Let us make decisions for ourselves. Let us accept the responsibility \nthat\n\n[[Page S216]]\n\nour constituents gave us. And let us reject this commission.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3300, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that my amendment No. 3300 be \nmodified with the modification I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3300), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       (_) (a) Limitation on Changes to the Social Security Act.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, it shall not be \n     in order in the Senate or the House of Representatives to \n     consider any bill or resolution pursuant to any expedited \n     procedure to consider the recommendations of a Task Force for \n     Responsible Fiscal Action or other commission that contains \n     recommendations with respect to the old-age, survivors, and \n     disability insurance program established under title II of \n     the Social Security Act, or the taxes received under \n     subchapter A of chapter 9; the taxes imposed by subchapter E \n     of chapter 1; and the taxes collected under section 86 of \n     part II of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code.\n       (b) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n        (c) Appeals.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required in the Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of \n     the Chair on a point of order raised under this section.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This modification, which I make on behalf of Senator \nGrassley and myself, would make clear that changes to Social Security \ntaxes would be off the table, as well.\n  The Parliamentarian's Office has advised us that this is how the \nChair would have interpreted my original language. This modification \nmakes that entirely clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, would the Chair advise us as to the status \nof the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 19 minutes, \n13 seconds remaining. The Senator from Montana has 4 minutes remaining. \nThe Senator from North Dakota has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 5 minutes of my time to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire and the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this debate is about the economic future of the \ncountry. This is the headline in Newsweek magazine from December 7, \n2009: ``How great powers fall. Steep debt, slow growth, and high \nspending kill empires--and America could be next.''\n  If you go to the inside of the story, it reads:\n\n       This is how empires decline. It begins with a debt \n     explosion. It ends with an inexorable reduction in the \n     resources available for the Army, Navy and Air Force. . . . \n     If the United States doesn't come up soon with a credible \n     plan to restore the federal budget to balance over the next \n     five to 10 years, the danger is very real that the debt \n     crisis could lead to a major weakening of American power.\n\n  That is what this debate is about. We are on a course that is totally \nunsustainable. We are headed for a debt of 400 percent of the gross \ndomestic product in 50 years. That is the estimate of the Congressional \nBudget Office and others who have looked at it, including the \nGovernment Accountability Office and the Office of Management and \nBudget. All of them have warned that we are on an utterly unsustainable \ncourse.\n  The National Journal, in an article on November 7 last year, said:\n\n       The debt problem is worse than you think.\n\n  In the article, they said:\n\n       Simply put, even alarmists may be underestimating the size \n     of the (debt) problem, how quickly it will become unbearable, \n     and how poorly prepared our political system is to deal with \n     it.\n\n  Senator Gregg and I, after several years of effort and consultation \nwith our colleagues, have come up with a proposal we will be voting on \nin just minutes. It provides that all task force members are directly \naccountable to the American people. There are 18 members of the task \nforce--16 Members of Congress evenly divided between Democrats and \nRepublicans and 2 representatives of the administration, with the \nSecretary of the Treasury being specifically named.\n  For those who have asserted that this is an outsourcing of our \nresponsibility, no, this is an outsourcing to ourselves. Sixteen of the \n18 members of the commission are Members of Congress. Two are \nrepresentatives of the administration. It is currently-serving Members \nof Congress selected by the Democratic and Republican leaders, with the \nTreasury Secretary and one other official representing the \nadministration. These are people who are accountable to the American \npeople. This is not an abdication of responsibility; this is an \nacceptance of responsibility, an acknowledgment that what we have been \ndoing has not worked. What could be more clear?\n  The record is there for everyone to see--a doubling of the debt in \nthe previous administration, a scheduled doubling of the debt in the \ncurrent administration if we fail to act. The fiscal task force we have \nproposed has everything on the table, spending and revenues.\n  The proposal we have made provides for an expedited process, with \nrecommendations to be received after the 2010 election, with fast-track \nconsideration in the Senate and the House. It is true, we have a \nproposal that does not permit amendments. Why? Because all of us know \nthe game that is played. If we permit amendments, there will be a \nDemocratic amendment and there will be a Republican amendment. There \nwill be a dozen other amendments that will suggest they have a way of \ndoing what needs to be done, and that will then permit them to actually \nvote against the final resolution. That is what has happened year after \nyear, as the debt has mounted and mounted.\n  What we are proposing leaves no place to hide. Let's give 18 Members \nand representatives of the administration the responsibility to come up \nwith a plan, and then let's vote on the plan, with the final vote \nbefore the 111th Congress adjourns. Every Member of this Senate will \nhave a chance to vote. When they say this is outsourcing, it is \noutsourcing to Members of Congress and the administration to come up \nwith a plan. There is no outsourcing of the vote. The vote is going to \noccur right here and in the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Dakota has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the Senator an additional 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. In addition, we have done everything we can, Senator \nGregg and I, to ensure a bipartisan outcome. Fourteen of the 18 task \nforce members must agree to the recommendations. Final passage requires \nsupermajorities in both the House and Senate. The President still \nretains his veto power. Make no mistake, Congress makes this decision \nand the President must agree.\n  The President has issued this weekend a very strong endorsement of \nthe proposal. He said:\n\n       That's why I strongly support legislation currently under \n     consideration to create a bipartisan, fiscal commission to \n     come up with a set of solutions to tackle our nation's fiscal \n     challenges.\n\n  The American people support this effort. In a recent poll by Peter \nHart, 70 percent favor the creation of a bipartisan commission.\n  On the question of what is included, we have said everything should \nbe included. Why? Look at where we are. The red line is the spending \nline. Spending as a share of our national income is the highest it has \nbeen since 1950. Spending is the highest it has been in 60 years, and \nrevenue is the lowest it has been in 60 years. Of course, the task \nforce has to look at both.\n  The assertion has been made that the task force would put the bull's-\neye on Social Security and Medicare. We have just learned from the \nCongressional Budget Office that Social Security is cash-negative \ntoday, and the report just released 1 hour ago by the CBO says that \nSocial Security is going to be cash-negative every year but two until \n2016 and then it is going to be permanently cash-negative. Those who \nwant to defend Social Security are going to have to change Social \nSecurity because Social Security is headed for insolvency. The same is \ntrue of Medicare. Medicare is cash-negative today. The trustees tell us \nit will be bankrupt in 2017, 7 years from today.\n\n[[Page S217]]\n\n  Let me conclude by saying that over and over we have heard people \ncome to the floor and say: We know we have a problem. How do we deal \nwith it? I suggest to my colleagues, trying what we have been doing is \na proven failure. It is time for something different. It is time for an \nattempt that brings both sides together, Republicans and Democrats, \nwith an assurance that the recommendations of the commission come to a \nvote to face up to this debt threat. Make no mistake, this country \nconfronts one of the greatest economic challenges in our Nation's \nhistory. The question before us today is, Do we have the courage to \nstand up to it?\n  I know groups on the right and the left are right now calling our \ncolleagues asking them to vote no. Groups on the right are saying: \nWell, this could lead to more revenue. Groups on the left are saying: \nThis could lead to reductions in entitlement programs.\n  Everything must be on the table. America must take charge of its \neconomic destiny. Now is the time. Now is the opportunity. This is a \nbipartisan proposal to take the debt threat on in a bipartisan way. I \nurge my colleagues' support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 9\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from Montana has 4 minutes. The Senator from North \nDakota has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Did the Senator from Montana wish to speak?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3300\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me first address to my colleagues the \nissue of the Baucus amendment, as modified now by the Grassley \nlanguage. I think it is an important amendment.\n  A lot of my colleagues on our side of the aisle have come up to me \nand said: We are concerned about the tax issue. I know a lot of people \non the other side and our side of the aisle said: We are concerned \nabout the Social Security issue. As I understand the Baucus-Grassley \namendment, it essentially says: There is a 60-vote point of order now \non Social Security benefits and taxes, so that before you can proceed \nto the commission's up-or-down vote, you will get two more votes--one \non Social Security benefits and one on payroll taxes. So there can be \nno question but that those two extraordinarily sensitive issues are \nraised and are aggressively handled in a bipartisan way because you \nwould have to waive it with 60 votes.\n  That is an important point. The reason I raise it is because I don't \nthink there is a real issue here with Social Security benefits or \ntaxes. I know the interest groups out there are ginning up the issue. \nThat is what they do. That is how they make their money. That is how \nthey get to drive around town in limousines. They send out fundraising \nletters and say: Conrad-Gregg is going to destroy Social Security or it \nis going to raise taxes. But that is not going to happen. Who is on the \ncommission? There are eight people appointed by our leadership, Senator \nMcConnell and Congressman Boehner, and there are eight people appointed \nby your leadership, Senator Reid and Speaker Pelosi.\n  So we are giving them a gun. Do you think they are going to put the \ngun to their head and pull the trigger on taxes or on Social Security? \nOf course not. They are going to act responsibly. The proposal they \ncome back with is going to be bipartisan. That is the whole purpose. It \nis fair, it is balanced, and it will make progress. It will not \ncompletely resolve the problem, but it will make progress, and it will \nsay to the world: We are making progress on this absolutely critical \nproblem; which is the fiscal insolvency of our Nation that we are \nheaded toward.\n  We know, without question, our country goes into what amounts to \nfiscal bankruptcy probably within 7, maybe 10 years. We will be unable \nto catch up with the debt we have put on the books. We will be unable \nto pay for that debt in a reasonable way because, basically, people are \ngoing to start saying: I am not going to lend you guys any more money, \nexcept at outrageous interest rates.\n  So we have to take action. We can wait until the time happens. We can \nwait until we hit this wall. We can wait until we go off this cliff, \nwhere our debt goes to 100 percent of GDP, which we know will happen. \nToday it was reported our deficit this year is going to be at least \n$1.34 trillion, and for as far as the eye can see it is going to be $1 \ntrillion-a-year deficits and the debt will have doubled in 5 years and \ntripled in 10 years.\n  The practical implication of that is our Nation is on a path that is \nabsolutely unsustainable, where our children will get a country where \nthey cannot afford to pay down that debt or, if they do pay it down, it \nis going to basically take away the resources they would have used--our \nkids would have used--to buy a house, send their kids to college or get \na new car.\n  Something should be done now. Why wait until we hit the wall? Isn't \nit our job, as responsible people, as the people who have been \nentrusted with the governance of this Nation, to do something? If you \nwant to look at the scene of the crime where this has happened, it has \nhappened in the Congress. We are the ones who have put on the books the \npolicies which have led to this crisis, this looming crisis. So it \nshould be our job to straighten it out. That is what this commission, \nthis task force does. It is balanced, it is fair, and it is structured \nin a way that will be bipartisan because it requires a supermajority--\n14 of the 18 people--just to report the proposal. Then it requires a \nsupermajority to pass it in both Houses. Then the President has to sign \nit or it comes back for a 67-vote veto override vote, which is a true \nsupermajority.\n  So this proposal will be absolutely bipartisan, it will be balanced, \nit will be fair, it will address the outyear fiscal insolvency of this \nNation, and it is the only game in town. There are a lot of other \nproposals floating around this place, but they are all political cover. \nThat is all they are. They are all political cover. They are structured \nbasically to give people a vote so they can go back and run a campaign \nad and say: I was acting responsibly. I voted for the XYZ proposal. But \nnone of those proposals work. We know they do not work. We have been \nhere before. We have seen this before. We have seen this story before. \nRegular order does not work around here.\n  So unless you have fast-track approval, unless you have an up-or-down \nvote, unless you have no amendments--for the reasons the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has outlined--unless you have a balanced commission with a \nsupermajority to report, you do not get bipartisanship, you do not get \nfairness, and you do not get action. So what we propose leads to \naction.\n  I wish to say, again, especially to people on my side, if you are \nconcerned about this tax issue--which I think is a straw dog because I \nknow Mitch McConnell is not going to appoint four Senators to this \ngroup who are for some sort of massive expansion in taxes, and \ncertainly Congressman Boehner is in the same camp, so I think it is a \nstraw-dog argument being ginned up by people who basically have other \nagendas, in my opinion--but if you believe it is a serious argument, \nthen the Baucus amendment takes it away. It essentially takes it away, \nthe Baucus-Grassley amendment.\n  So I would hope people would look at that amendment and agree with \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, the Senator from Montana, Mr. \nBaucus, that this is an appropriate amendment because it redresses the \nconcerns around here on the issue of taxes and on the issue of Social \nSecurity and it makes this whole process even stronger.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg.\n  There is a real reason why it is important to protect Social \nSecurity. Social Security is probably the most successful social \nprogram this Congress, this country, has ever adopted. Look\n\n[[Page S218]]\n\nhow many people it has helped. If we did not have Social Security \ntoday, 44-some percent of American seniors would be living in poverty--\nthat many. At one time, it was 50 percent. It is close to 50 percent of \nAmerica's seniors who would be living in poverty today without Social \nSecurity.\n  These are mostly people who have worked hard during their lives: the \nWorld War II generation, the product of the Great Depression, the \nKorean war. These are hard-working Americans, the real soul of America, \nby and large, and they deserve Social Security.\n  About one-third of America's seniors today get almost all their \nincome from Social Security. About one-third get almost all their \nincome from Social Security. So why in the world would we even \ncontemplate cutting Social Security? It makes no sense. That is why I \noffer this amendment, to make it clear we do not cut Social Security.\n  Social Security, also, is not a big problem in our American fiscal \nsituation. Social Security does not go ``belly up'' until about the \nyear 2043. It is not a big problem in our fiscal situation. It is not. \nThere are also reasons why we protect Social Security. Other reasons \nare recognized by this Congress. In 1985, for example, Senator Hawkins \nfrom Florida offered an amendment that passed that Social Security be \nexempt from the reconciliation process. That is in the law today. In \n1990, we took Social Security out of the unified budget. That is in the \nlaw today.\n  This body, this Congress, over the years, has recognized the \nimportance--not the importance, the critical importance--of Social \nSecurity. It is so important that it should not be part of \nreconciliation, and it should not be part of the unified budget. We \nshould protect Social Security. So I say to my colleagues, vote for \nthis amendment I am offering to protect Social Security. Show to \nAmerican seniors we hear their needs, we are taking action to protect \nthem.\n  I hope very much this amendment passes because then it will take one \nitem off this budget commission, if it passes; and it should not pass, \nin my judgment. I will have more to say about that later because the \nregular order has worked here. We have cut the budget three times in \nthe regular order since 1990. It works. That is what we, as Senators, \nshould do. We should use the regular order to make sure we do get our \nfiscal situation back in order. But first let's vote for the amendment \nto protect Social Security.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have no problem with the amendment \noffered by Senator Baucus. Basically, what it does is creates another \n60-vote hurdle to any work the commission would do, and this underlying \nproposal requires 60 votes. So I do not see the Baucus amendment as a \nproblem for the vote that will follow. So I would say to Members, \nSenator Baucus has made a strong argument for his amendment and to have \nanother 60-vote hurdle does not change what would be required to get a \ncommission recommendation because we would require 60 votes.\n  The far larger question is whether we have an alternative approach to \nwhat we are currently doing. What we are currently doing I do not think \nis poised to deal with the challenge of the debt threat confronting the \nUnited States. I do not think it is possible for it to cope effectively \nwith what we confront.\n  Is the Senator from Minnesota seeking time?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. No, I am not. Thank you.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I do not see that the Baucus amendment does fundamental \ndamage to the amendment that follows, and to put up another 60-vote \nhurdle to protect Social Security is not an unreasonable request by the \nSenator from Montana, the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  On the second vote, I think it is absolutely critical we continue the \nmomentum that has been building to sending a message to the American \npeople and the markets all across the world that the United States is \nprepared to stand and deal with this debt threat.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Senate is at its best when we \ntackle challenges together, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents \nworking together to solve the big problems that confront this country.\n  Today we face a monumental problem--our fiscal crisis. Consider the \nmeasure before us now; legislation to increase the statutory limit on \npublic debt to over $14 trillion--a staggering number. Many of us are \nloathe to approve this measure to allow the Federal Government to add \nnearly $2 trillion to our national debt.\n  Yet the alternative is also not acceptable; namely, that the United \nStates default on its obligations. If we fail to increase the national \ndebt limit, the United States would have to suspend payments for \nActive-Duty military salaries, for Social Security benefits, for \nveterans' compensation and pension payments, and for unemployment \nbenefit and Medicare payments to States.\n  Still, we should not approve this dramatic expansion of public debt \nwithout taking steps here and now to reverse course and get control \nover this economic crisis. We can do that in a bipartisan manner by \napproving the Conrad-Gregg amendment. This amendment, which I have \ncosponsored and which has the support of President Obama, would put in \nplace a commission to make recommendations on how to reduce the \ndeficit. These recommendations would be considered by the House and \nSenate under fast-track procedures and would not be amendable.\n  Like so many Americans I have become increasingly alarmed by the \nmagnitude of mounting debt our country carries and the potential impact \nof our unfunded liabilities. I believe that if we fail to act, we will \nbe confronted with an economic tsunami that will far surpass the \ncurrent crisis. The adoption of this amendment to authorize a fiscal \ncommission will be the first step toward preventing the economic \ndisaster that is looming on the horizon. And, adoption of this \namendment will send a message to the American people that Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents are ready to work together to put our \ncountry first and address the critical issues of the day.\n  Earlier this year I joined my colleague, Senator Voinovich, in \nintroducing a similar bipartisan proposal, the SAFE Commission Act, and \nlast month I joined the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \nSenator Conrad, and the ranking member, Senator Gregg, in introducing \nthe Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action Act of 2009, a \nbill which is reflected in the amendment before us. Both bills call for \na fiscal commission to make recommendations on how to restore fiscal \nsanity and balance. And both bills require that the recommendations be \nconsidered under fast-track procedures under which amendments are not \nallowed. My committee, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, held a hearing on fiscal commissions last year and \nheard testimony from Senators Conrad and Gregg as well as former \nFederal Reserve Chairman Greenspan and former Comptroller General David \nWalker in support of this concept.\n  As our long-term economic challenges mount, the need for this type of \ncommission is ever more evident. I have no doubt that all my colleagues \nare aware of the daunting numbers:\n  Our national debt is about $12 trillion and rising.\n  Nearly half of the $7 trillion in publicly held debt is held by \nforeign governments.\n  Interest on Treasury debt securities this year is $382 billion. \nConsider now many worthwhile programs we could fund with $382 billion.\n  Our current national debt pales in comparison to our unfunded \npromises and commitments.\n  Current unfunded liabilities considered together total $56.4 \ntrillion, according to information published by the Peter G. Peterson \nFoundation.\n  Mr. President, $36.3 trillion of this is Medicare benefits not \ncovered by taxes and other contributions, and $6.6 trillion of this \namount is Social Security benefits not covered by taxes and other \ncontributions.\n  This unfunded liability comes to $483,000 for each American \nhousehold.\n  Total spending for this current year is around $3.7 trillion, and \nonly $1.2 trillion of this is discretionary, or subject to \nappropriations. Simply put, we have very little control over most of \nour spending. And this pattern only\n\n[[Page S219]]\n\ngets worse as the 77 million baby boomers retire in ever larger numbers \nfurther straining the balance sheets for Medicare and Social Security. \nMy great concern in the context of health care reform has always been \nthat we not do anything to exacerbate the uncontrollable costs on our \nnational ledger.\n  Our children and grandchildren must pay these bills and face the \neconomic perils that large deficits can induce, including reduced \nnational savings, pressure on interest rates, and dependence on foreign \ngovernments to finance our debt. Recently, a lead Moody's analyst, when \ncommenting on our current and projected deficits, stated that the AAA \nrating of the United States is not guaranteed.\n  The solutions to addressing our staggering fiscal imbalances revolve \naround implementing unpopular measures like cutting spending or raising \nrevenues, and controlling health care costs. Yet Congress as an \ninstitution has proven itself incapable of enacting such bitter \nmedicine. Our constituents don't want their taxes raised, their \nbenefits cuts, or their Federal services pared back. The very structure \nof Congress makes it difficult to advance the kinds of legislative \nproposals that are necessary to achieve substantial and long-term \nfiscal balance in the face of constituent opposition. And the \npartisanship that has become pervasive makes a difficult task \nimpossible.\n  This is why I am convinced that the only way to enact real fiscal \nreforms is by a special process such as that contained in this proposal \nto establish a fiscal commission. I commend President Obama for coming \nout in support of this amendment and urge all Members of this body to \nvote for this amendment and in doing so vote for the future vitality of \nour economy and strength as a nation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this vote is a difficult one for procedural \nand process reasons. Many of us worry about the precedent of \ncircumventing key Senate committees on such vital issues where \nCongress's responsibility is clear and compelling.\n  Still, a larger and looming reality is staring us in the face. This \nis no ordinary moment. We cannot continue our current fiscal path and \nrely on China to finance our debts for decades. With the Federal budget \ndeficit at $1.4 trillion this year alone and the Federal debt at above \n$12 trillion, it is undeniable that we must together address soaring \nFederal spending and revenue issues, and we must also find real answers \nthat preserve critical programs like Social Security and Medicare for \nfuture generations.\n  We have been in difficult fiscal circumstances before. When I first \ncame to the Senate, we were saddled with then-record deficits and I \nbroke with many in our caucus to support the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \nBalanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. That \ninitiative wasn't perfect but it was a start--and it marked a break \nwith an attitude that the sky was the limit for spending. During the \n1990s, I supported spending cuts and fiscal restraint that helped lead \nto budget surpluses. Unfortunately, in 2001 we began an 8-year period \nwhere the Vice President of the United States himself famously advised \nthat ``deficits don't matter.'' Run-away spending coupled with massive \ntax cuts for those at the top helped turn projected surpluses into all \ntoo real record deficits. Two wars, and a near-financial collapse, \nbail-out, and a needed stimulus have all added to the situation we face \ntoday. We need to put aside partisan differences and work together to \ncontrol the deficit.\n  That is why I have voted in favor the Conrad/Gregg amendment which \ncreates a bipartisan fiscal task force. These issues cannot be ignored. \nThere are many ways we must tackle them in the years ahead--and this \ncommission should be just one of them, and I also believe Congress \nshould have the opportunity to amend the task force recommendations. I \nwill continue to work with Senate Budget Committee Chairman Conrad and \nPresident Obama to develop a task force that will put our Federal \nbudget on a sustainable path.\n  In the past, I have introduced line-item veto legislation and \ncosponsored legislation to address corporate subsidies. These ideas \nneed to be revisited. We should be open to all ideas that will reign in \nlooming deficits. The bottom line is undeniable: these questions cannot \nbe deferred or denied, they must be addressed, and that will require \nmore--much more--than this single vote by the Senate.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, people are angry and they are anxious. \nThey are worried their middle class way of life is slipping by. During \nthe last several months as I listened to people they had very clear \nmessages.\n  First, ensure the solvency and stability of Medicare and, they said, \nno Medicare rationing.\n  Second, they said to get the government's fiscal house in order. They \nsaid to be as frugal as they have to be in their own homes.\n  I absolutely agree the government has to get its fiscal house in \norder. And I am unrelenting in making sure that Medicare is there when \npeople need it, and is there in the way their doctor says they need to \nhave it.\n  I fear this commission is a back door to rationing Medicare. I \npledged during health care reform, and I pledge now, I will not ration \nMedicare.\n  I agree that Congress needs a gut check on spending, but we don't \nneed a gutless vote. I worry that this commission will be a fast track \nprocess to ration Medicare run by a group with limited accountability \nselected by the very same politicians who were incapable of making the \ntough decisions. I will not vote for a commission to ration Medicare.\n  Social Security is not the real cause of the debt crisis. It has \nnever added to the debt. It can be fixed through regular order with \nsmall tweaks that don't cut benefits.\n  I believe tough decisions on the budget and revenue should be made in \nthe full light of day and through regular order with full \naccountability, and without subcontracting responsibility to a \ncommission.\n  I support the goal of fiscal responsibility. We need urgent action. \nWe must clean up the mess of many years of failed economic policies \nwhile ensuring the long-term health and economic security of Americans \nthrough the protection of Medicare and Social Security and at the same \ntime, be aware that we must deal with job creation and the wrenching \nproblem of home foreclosures.\n  I have made tough budget decisions in the past. I opposed tax cuts \nthat went to the lavishly wealthy and cuts that let hedge fund managers \npay lower taxes than their secretaries. I opposed tax cuts for \ncorporations that shipped jobs overseas. I have used the powers of both \nmy office and of other institutions to fight waste, fraud and abuse.\n  In the late 1990s, I was one of nine votes against repealing the \nGlass-Steagall Act which allowed banks to make risky bets with \nfamilies' checking accounts with little regulation and no \naccountability, leaving taxpayers to clean up the mess with TARP. And \nit created the go-go permissiveness that got our economy into a ditch \nwith a big recession that is part of the debt problem.\n  During the prescription drug debate I voted against the bill because \nBush and the Republican Congress refused to allow the government to \nnegotiate with drug companies for lower prices. It was just one more \ngive away for drug and insurance companies so they could charge seniors \nand the government more for prescription drugs.\n  I have stood for strong and independent inspectors general at Federal \nagencies so they have power to ensure fairness and accountability. I \nasked the Department of Justice IG to investigate when political \nappointees were awarding grants to their friends. And IG made \nrecommendations to reform the grant process.\n  I asked the Government Accountability Office to recommend reforms for \nthe Chesapeake Bay Program to focus the bay program on results because \nthe bay program was fudging its data to overstate progress in cleaning \nup the bay.\n  I have fought on my own committee against botched government \nboondoggles--lavish conferences with $4 meatballs at the Department of \nJustice, satellite construction contracts that have run billions over \nbudget and years behind schedule, and Enron-like accounting in the \nAmeriCorps Program.\n  And I have supported strong protections for whistleblowers, so \ntalented civil servants can come forward about wrongdoing without fear \nof retribution\n\n[[Page S220]]\n\nwhen they uncovered corrupt practices. I believe some commissions can \nwork, like the Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Task Force \nheaded by Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin that will issue tough \nrecommendations on revenue and spending.\n  I look forward to their findings and I want to hear recommendations \nfrom others. I would support a commission like the one proposed by \nSenator Baucus where there could be amendments and full debate so we \ncould vote to stop the rationing of Medicare and raising taxes on the \nmiddle class.\n  I support the goal of fiscal responsibility. I don't support this \nprocess with its fast-tracking, muffling of amendments and limited \ndebate. This is not the way to address programs touching every American \nfamily. I don't support shifting the burden and risks to seniors and \ntheir families.\n  I will not support this commission or rationing Medicare, raiding \nSocial Security or any backdoor way of raising taxes on the middle \nclass.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree with strong comprehensive efforts \nto eliminate the annual Federal deficit and reduce the national debt. \nRegrettably, the events of the past several decades demonstrate that \nCongress has failed to demonstrate the political will to deal with the \ndeficit and debt.\n  However, I am concerned about legislation to delegate to a commission \nCongress's core constitutional responsibilities on matters like Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and revenue.\n  I was deeply involved in a related issue when I was the lead party-\nplaintiff and personally argued against the closing of the Philadelphia \nNavy Yard in the case of Dalton v. Specter. In a similar context, the \nCongress created a military base closing commission which decided which \nbases to close with only a yes-or-no vote by Congress on the entire \npackage. I argued the case personally in the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States in 1994 and the Court upheld the closing of the \nPhiladelphia Navy Yard in the context that the Court would have had to \noverturn closures of some 300 other bases involved in the same \ncommission report.\n  It is a tough vote to again vote to raise the debt ceiling, but it is \nindispensable if the U.S. Government is to function and retain its \ncredit standing in the world commercial markets. I will continue to \nwork and to press my colleagues to exercise the political will to \neliminate the deficit and reduce the national debt.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time does Senator Baucus and Senator Gregg \nretain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 1 minute. The \nSenator from New Hampshire has 20 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am sorry, what is the time again?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 20 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, would the Senator like me to yield half my \ntime to him?\n  Mr. GREGG. No. I will yield my 20 seconds to the Senator from North \nDakota to complete our presentation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator.\n  Let me go back to where I began.\n  What is this about? This is fundamentally about the economic future \nof the United States. Newsweek magazine, cover story, December 7: ``How \nGreat Powers Fall.'' ``Steep debt, slow growth, and high spending kill \nempires.''\n  Colleagues, is there any doubt we are on a collision course with \neconomic reality? The Congressional Budget Office, 1\\1/2\\ hours ago, \nissued a new report saying the deficit for this year will be $1.350 \ntrillion--$1.350 trillion--and, in coming years, staggering deficits \nfor as far as the eye can see. The debt--which swelled to more than \ndouble its 2001 level during the previous administration's 8 years--the \ndebt is expected to rise by a similar magnitude over the next 5 years \nand then again in 10 years.\n  There is, to me, no question that doing things the same old way that \nhas led to this crisis is unlikely to lead to a different result. \nSenator Gregg and I have a special responsibility to our colleagues \nwith respect to the budget. The budget process--if you look at it--we \nhave done 35 budgets since the Budget Act; 29 of the 35 have been for \nbudgets of 5 years or less. This is not a 5-year issue; this is a long-\nterm issue. In the short term, we have had to take on more deficits and \ndebt to prevent a global economic collapse. But now we must pivot and \nput in place a long-term plan to deal with the crisis confronting this \nNation.\n  That crisis is a debt threat of unprecedented proportion. Never \nbefore in American history have we faced the prospect of a debt that \nwould reach 400 percent of the gross domestic product of the country; \nincreasingly, that debt is financed by borrowing from abroad. Last \nyear, a substantial portion of the debt was financed by foreign \nentities.\n  This is the time. This is the moment. This is the chance for us to \nput in place a process to deal with the debt. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3300\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am happy to learn from the Senator from \nNorth Dakota he favors my amendment or at least he says it would not \ncause any injustice to his central mission.\n  My main point is, the regular order does work here. In 1990, 1993, \n1997, Congress passed reconciliation budget resolutions that worked, \nand I believe, frankly, we have it within ourselves as Senators to do \nthe same again, to pass a budget resolution through reconciliation to \nget the deficit under control, working with the President. I very much \nhope the President, in his State of the Union Message and his budget \nthat is placed in the Congress, starts to get the budget under control. \nVery much of this depends upon the President and working with the \nCongress. It is not just Congress. I urge all of us to remember the \nregular order has worked in the past. It has worked several times.\n  The Andrews Air Force Base agreement was put through regular order. \nRegular order does work, and that is what we as Senators should do. We \nare not bureaucrats. We are Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Baucus amendment No. 3300, as \nmodified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) \nand the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Webb) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Alaska (Ms. Murkowski).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3302, offered by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nConrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time is available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute on each side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will take 30 seconds.\n  I believe this is a defining moment for this Chamber and for this \nCongress. The question before the body is will we adopt a special \nprocess to face up to the debt threat looming over this Nation. We are \nheaded, I say to my colleagues, for a debt 400 percent of the gross \ndomestic product of this country.\n  Senator Gregg and I have proposed, in a bipartisan way, with \nbipartisan cosponsorship, a plan to look at spending and revenues. The \nrevenues are the lowest they have been in 60 years. The spending is the \nhighest it has been in 60 years. It is time for us to take on this \nchallenge, to do it together, to strengthen our Nation.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote aye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there is no doubt that we have to get our \nfiscal house in order. That is not an issue before us right now. So \nlet's take that off the table. All Senators agree we have to address \nour fiscal situation.\n  Second is the question of what is the best way to do it. I remind our \ncolleagues that we have used the regular order to cut budget deficits \nin 1990, 1993, and 1997. The Andrews Air Force Base summit agreement \nwas passed through regular order, through reconciliation. We have done \nit. We have used reconciliation, regular order to get budget deficits \nunder control.\n  In addition, I have an alternative commission amendment. It is the \nsame as the Conrad commission but with one exception, and that is it is \namendable on the floor of the Senate. So if you want to have some sense \nof Senators--we are not going to be bureaucrats, we are going to be \nSenators--my amendment allows a commission where we as Senators can \namend the commission's recommendations.\n  Regular order has worked in this body--new Members do not know that--\nin 1990, 1993, and 1997.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of \nthis amendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask Senator LeMieux be recognized to \nspeak for 10 minutes, and immediately following his remarks the Senate \nstand in recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I rise again to talk about the \nunsustainable spending of this country and the debt that we cannot \nafford. Just a moment ago a proposal by Senator Conrad and Senator \nGregg to put together a commission to tackle the spending of this \ncountry was defeated in this Chamber. I supported the proposal. It was \nnot a perfect proposal. It was a proposal that some Republicans did not \nlike because of the opportunity it might promote to have a tax \nincrease. It was a proposal some Democrats did not like because they \nthought the spending might be too tough on entitlement programs such as \nSocial Security and Medicare. But it was a proposal that both Democrats \nand Republicans, I hoped, would like enough to move forward.\n  The spending problem we have is like a cancer. This Chamber refuses \nto seek any treatment. While I did not like the proposal completely, I \nat least supported it because I knew we needed to do something. Our \nspending is out of control. We have a $12 trillion debt. The deficit of \nlast year was $1.4 trillion, more than the past 4 years in the Bush \nadministration combined.\n  I am new to this Chamber so the bizarre still seems bizarre to me; \nand perhaps the longer you are here, bizarre starts to seem normal. But \nwe cannot spend more than we take in. We cannot continue to amass debt \nfor which our children will have to pay. Right now we have to borrow \nmoney from countries such as China because we can no longer raid Social \nSecurity and Medicare because those programs now need those dollars to \nbe paid out.\n  At some point this country is going to have to pay the piper. At some \npoint we are going to have to dramatically cut spending or dramatically \nincrease taxes. At some point investors from around the world will not \ninvest in this country anymore because we will not be a good \ninvestment. That is already starting to happen. We are already seeing \nfolks from around the world investing in countries such as Brazil \nbecause they see it as a superior opportunity to this country.\n  At some point we will not be a first-rate economic power unless the \npeople in this Chamber and the Chamber down the hall have the courage \nto do something about it.\n  What we should be doing is balancing the budget. We should be \nproposing a balanced budget amendment and a line-item veto for the \nPresident. I put forward this measure. The majority of the States do \nit, the majority of the Governors have that line-item veto, but it is \ntilting at windmills. I know it is unrealistic because this Chamber \nwill not even do what Senator Conrad and Senator Gregg tried to do just \na few moments ago. I will continue to stand up and speak on this \nbecause if we do not sound the alarm, the future of this country is in \nperil.\n  Now we are about to embark upon raising the debt limit.\n  This time, $1.9 trillion. I have talked about this before, and for \nthose who have heard it, it is going to seem like old news. But I feel \nas if I have to continue to stress how much money this is. If you take \n$1 million and lay it edge to edge, it will cover two football fields; \n$1 billion will cover the city of Key West, FL, 3.4 square miles; and \n$1 trillion will cover the State of Rhode Island twice. If you stack $1 \ntrillion from the ground up to the sky, it would go more than 600 \nmiles. This is an enormous amount of money. We throw these amounts \naround, trillions and billions. It is hard to grasp how much\n\n[[Page S222]]\n\nit is. Now our interest payment has become one of the largest payments \nwe make every year, nearly $200 billion alone on interest. We cannot \nput bandaids over this. We cannot say we are going to freeze spending; \nwe have to cut spending.\n  In the State of the Union Address on Wednesday, apparently the \nPresident of the United States is going to offer the idea that we are \ngoing to cut spending in some discretionary spending items, about 17 \npercent of the budget. Leader Boehner over in the House said it is like \ngoing to a pie-eating contest and deciding you are going to go on a \ndiet. It is like that family sitting around the table and trying to \ndecide how they are going to cut their spending. Instead of making \nmeaningful cuts, it is like saying: OK, we will cut our spending on \nbeer and pizza. It is not enough. It is not enough. We are spending \nmuch more than we can afford to. And my three kids--soon to be four--\nare not going to want to live in this country because they are not \ngoing to have the same opportunities as they could in other places in \nthe world. Shame on us if we fail our children in that way.\n  So I stand with my colleagues--Senator Coburn, Senator McCain, and \nSenator Enzi--in support of amendment No. 3303, which is an alternative \nto increasing the debt ceiling. Instead of increasing the debt ceiling \nand borrowing more money when we cannot afford to, we are going to cut \nspending by $120 billion, which is a good start. How do we do it? We go \nacross all of the agencies and say they have to cut 5 percent. Right \nnow, American families are cutting more than 5 percent from their \nhousehold budgets. Small businesses in places such as Florida and \naround the country have to cut more than 5 percent. These are difficult \ntimes. When is the last time a government agency cut anything? I bet \nyou could cut 20 or 30 percent out of these agencies and not have a \nmeaningful impact on the services they render. And this asks for 5 \npercent, a 5-percent cut across the board.\n  It also directs that agencies consolidate more than 640 duplicative \nprograms that have been found. We know there are more than that. That \nis just the 640 that have been found. This requires the Government \nAccountability Office to identify other duplicative programs that can \nbe cut and rescinds unobligated funds--the money sitting out there in \nthe budget for these agencies that they have not spent. Let's take that \nmoney back and put that against the deficit. We are borrowing money \nnow. We should not have money sitting around when we are borrowing \nmoney and paying interest on it.\n  So it is a good proposal, and I hope it passes. But the truth is, it \nprobably will not because there are folks in this Chamber, Democrats \nand Republicans alike, who will not stand up and face the hard truth \nthat we have to cut spending. If we do not make the hard choices and \nstand up as leaders in this country, our future is in peril. When we \nlook back 10, 20 years from now and it is too far gone, the only folks \nwhom we are going to have to blame are ourselves. This is not a \nDemocratic problem, not a Republican program, it is a problem of this \nCongress.\n  Go back to March 2006. The President of the United States, then a \nSenator, said:\n\n       The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's \n     debt limit is a sign of leadership failure, is a sign that \n     the U.S. Government cannot pay its own bills.\n\n  Do not take it from me, take it from the President of the United \nStates. We have to do more. I am disappointed that Gregg-Conrad failed. \nIt was not perfect, but it was something. I hope Senator Coburn's \nmeasure prevails, but I am skeptical.\n  The American people get it. The American people understand this is a \nproblem, and that is why we have these big swings in these elections. \nThe same passion that propelled President Obama into office is the same \npassion that propelled our new Senator from Massachusetts into office, \nfrom two opposite parties, because the American people are frustrated \nthat this body does not work. And if we do not change the rules and \nstart to get serious and if we keep muddling along the path of \ndisaster, we are going to fail our country.\n  We may not get it done while I am here in the Senate. I only have \nthis year. But I am going to keep coming to the floor and I am going to \nkeep speaking out about it because somebody has to sound the alarm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Tomorrow night, the President of the United States will \ncome down the hall and speak in the House of Representatives, \naddressing a joint session of Congress, for the State of the Union, the \naddress Presidents have been giving for decades in this country. He \nwill speak directly to the American people, to people in this country \nwho work so hard, play by the rules, but simply can't get ahead. They \nfeel they can't get ahead, and in so many cases they can't get ahead no \nmatter how hard they work. He will speak to Ohioans who understand that \nit takes more than 1 year to turn around 8 years of failed economic \npolicy.\n  I listened with some amusement to some of the other speakers before \nme and am a bit incredulous about the hypocrisy, not of the Senator \nfrom Florida, who was not here during the first part of this last \ndecade, but when, with such enthusiasm, so many of my colleagues here \nvoted for a war that probably will cost $1 trillion before it is over \nbut did not want to pay for it so didn't find a way to cut spending or \nraise taxes to pay for it, voted for a giveaway to the drug companies, \nthe insurance companies, all in the name of privatizing Medicare--\nhundreds of billions of dollars that we are paying for, that our \nchildren and grandchildren are paying for. Again, though, they did not \ncut spending or raise taxes; they added it to the bill, to the debt for \nour children and grandchildren. And in 2001, 2003, 2005, they voted for \ntax cuts for the wealthy, who pay much less in taxes than they have \nhistorically in this country--again, no spending cuts, no comparable \ntax increases to make up for that. No wonder we went from a budget \nsurplus a decade ago, when President Clinton took office, to huge \nbudget deficits today.\n  President Obama made a decision, as he had to in January--a year ago, \nwe lost 700,000 jobs, the month Barrack Obama became President. And you \nhave to spend. You have to spend to stimulate the economy. All \nreputable economists--literally, all reputable economists say that if \nwe had not given the tax cuts, done the help for the States that kept \nthe States from laying off literally hundreds of thousands of police \nofficers, firefighters, mental health counselors, librarians, teachers, \npeople who serve us as a country, they would have lost their jobs. It \nwould have been much worse. And the stimulus spending that is going to \nhelp companies such as BASF in Elyria, OH, where the President visited \nlast Friday, that helped create jobs with new lithium battery \ntechnology.\n  The President, as I said, was in my home county, in Elyria, OH, \nLorain County Community College, this past Friday. This was the first \nPresidential visit since 1948 when Harry Truman came to Lorain County, \nOH, and spoke about how Congress was not doing any of the things that \nmattered to fight the problems of that day. And the President was not \npartisan, but the President made it clear that Republicans' reluctance \nto help get this economy back on track, help with job creation, is \nreally what set us back. That is why the President was in Lorain County \nto talk about job creation, talk about helping small businesses, \ntalk about helping with exports, talk about helping unfreeze credit \nbecause so many companies cannot get credit.\n\n  The President also, though, has thrown his support behind what many \nof us in Ohio are seeing as our State becoming the Silicone Valley of \nalternative energy. Toledo, OH, has more solar energy manufacturing \njobs than any city in America. I was in Cincinnati this week--just \nyesterday, in fact--and in Cincinnati there is a steel company that was \nmaking steel drums for oil fields, and it is now making steel \ncomponents for wind turbines. I could take you around my State and show \nyou what they are doing in Cleveland, in Mansfield, in Youngstown, and\n\n[[Page S223]]\n\nin Akron and Dayton and Columbus, all kinds of job creation with \nalternative energy.\n  But we need a better national economy. That is why yesterday in \nCincinnati the President and Chairman of the Export-Import Bank, Fred \nHochberg, came to that city at my request and did a roundtable with \ncommunity bankers on how we can help them help their customers to \nexport more and met with a group of entrepreneurs, a group of \nbusinesspeople in Cincinnati who were there in order to learn how to \nget help so they can export.\n  The big companies, such as Procter & Gamble and GE, both major, \nimportant citizens in Cincinnati, don't need all that much help to \nfigure out how they are going to export products, but smaller companies \nof 5, 10, 50, 100, and 200 employees need some assistance. When they \ntry to export, when they are working in another country trying to find \ncustomers and trying to export their products, sell their products, so \noften other companies with which they are competing usually have their \ngovernment standing right side by side with them in partnership.\n  That is what we need to do for our small businesses, especially our \nsmall manufacturers that are trying to sell more products abroad, \ncreating jobs in this country. We know that for $1 billion we export, \nit creates--whether it is in Albuquerque or whether it is in Ashland, \nOH, whether it is in Santa Fe or whether it is in Sidney, OH, we know \nthat $1 billion in exports creates about 15,000 jobs.\n  Right now, we have a huge trade deficit, hundreds of billions of \ndollars in trade deficit. We know that costs us jobs. That is why what \nhappened in Cincinnati yesterday is so important, so the Export-Import \nBank can help these smaller companies that want to export, help them \nfind financing, help them figure out how you license products if you \nwant to sell them in Hungary or you want to sell them in Bangladesh or \nNigeria or France, help them figure out how to get through the rules \nand deal with language barriers and deal with all kinds of problems \nthat larger companies have a staff to do. Smaller companies need some \nassistance, need a partnership with their government. That is what that \nmeeting was all about yesterday. That is what the President \nunderstands.\n  We need to help small business, we need to unfreeze credit, we need \nto do direct spending for infrastructure to prepare for the future, and \nwe need to export more. Those are some of the keys to job creation. The \nPresident, when he speaks down the hall in the joint session of \nCongress tomorrow night for the State of the Union, will address a lot \nof those issues. It is time that the obstruction in this Chamber stops, \nand we can move forward and begin to do those kind of things we need to \ndo.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/26/senate-section/article/S223-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The amendment is proposed by myself and Senators \nMcCaskill and Kyl.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself, Mrs. \n     McCaskill, and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 3308 \n     to amendment No. 3299.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, our fathers and forefathers made heroic \nsacrifices so that we one day might enjoy the blessings of liberty and \nprosperity. Indeed, we have had prosperity through much of our \ncountry's history. Their courage during World War II changed the world, \nmaking possible the greatest run of economic growth in history. The \ncharacter and courage they displayed remains an inspiration to us. And \nthere are important lessons to be learned from the way this ``greatest \ngeneration'' faced adversity.\n  We have recently been put to the test ourselves. We were--and in many \nways continue to be--faced with a national crisis in the form of a \nhistoric and severe recession. So what did we do? We could have learned \nfrom President Reagan and Paul Volcker, a Democrat who was then Federal \nReserve Chairman and is now working with President Obama. They took the \npolitical heat in the short run so the free market could correct itself \nand emerge stronger on the other side.\n  Instead, I think we flinched. We tried to limit the immediate pain by \nmortgaging our children's future. We borrowed hundreds of billions of \ndollars to finance our standard of living today. We took money from the \nfuture so we can spend it today. We tried desperately to mitigate the \ndownturn of a huge economy, even when we know economies are cyclical \nand do have booms and busts.\n  Every penny we spent on the stimulus package--$800 billion--and other \nspecial spending was borrowed and must be paid back. In truth though, \nthere is no plan to pay the debt back--only to pay the soaring interest \nfor as far in the future as we can see. So this is not an academic \nproblem, nor is it just a question of public financing and governmental \nroles.\n  As former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said about our debt \nin December--and I think it is a stunning statement--\n\n       The challenge to contain this threat is more urgent than at \n     any time in our history. Our Nation has never before had to \n     confront so formidable a fiscal crisis as is now visible just \n     over the horizon.\n\n  The policies adopted by Congress and the President have set the \nNation now on a dangerous course of spending and borrowing. The budget \ncrisis we face is so severe, the mountain of debt so high, that it \nthreatens to undermine the foundation, as Mr. Greenspan said, of our \neconomic strength and our prosperity. This is reality.\n  For the first time in our Nation's history, our generation stands to \nbequeath to our children a nation that is less economically sound, less \nfundamentally strong, and less secure than that which we inherited. And \nit is not necessary. We can do better if we act today.\n  It would be an unthinkable tragedy and really a moral failure for us \nto pass on a less strong country. We have responsibilities not just to \nour own people today but to those who will follow us in the years to \ncome, and we would have no one else to blame but ourselves.\n  The numbers tell a grim story. In fiscal year 2009, our government \nspent $1.4 trillion more than it took in through revenues. That is the \nlargest deficit in our Nation's history, dwarfing those of previous \nyears. Scaled to the budget of a typical family, the government \noperated like a household making $50,000 but spending $83,000. That is \nhow much more spending we carried out than we had revenues.\n  Common sense tells us this is unsustainable, and almost every expert \nyou ask would use that very word:\n\n[[Page S224]]\n\n``unsustainable.'' Yet we expect to run deficits over the next decade \nthat average nearly $1 trillion annually--averaging that and not going \ndown. According to the Congressional Budget Office, in the 8th, 9th, \nand 10th year, the deficit continues to increase.\n  By 2019, we will owe our creditors, including nations such as China \nand Japan, more than $15 trillion--three times the total debt of \nAmerica that existed last year. In 2019, the interest payments we will \nmake on the debt we owe outside the government--the public debt to \nforeign countries and individuals--will be $799 billion, almost $800 \nbillion in one year. That will be up from $202 billion in interest \npayments last year. $800 billion is about $200 billion more than we \nspend on defense, and 20 times more than we spend on roads or \neducation. We currently spend about $40 billion a year on roads, and \nthis interest on the debt will cost us $800 billion a year in 10 \nyears--a basis of a tripling of our debt.\n  That growing interest payment will crowd out our ability to fund \nother important government services, and it will crowd out private \nborrowers who will need to borrow to create jobs.\n  Given that we have embarked on such a spending spree, is it any \nsurprise that the first item on the Senate agenda this year is the \nnecessary bill, they say, to raise the debt limit to allow us to borrow \nmore money? We have hit the limit. The government has a limit on the \namount of debt it can hold by statute, such as a maximum amount on a \ncredit card. America's credit card has a $12.4 trillion limit on \ninternal and external debt and, incredibly we have maxed it out again. \nIt should be a dramatic thing to boost that debt limit, but, \ninterestingly, it has become routine.\n  This will be the seventh time we have done so in 5 years, and it is \ntroubling Americans. The public is rightly angry with Washington's \ncavalier attitude toward spending. They know ``buy now; pay later'' \ncatches up with you eventually. They know nothing comes from nothing. \nThe American people know that what Stanford University economist \nMichael Boskin wrote in the Wall Street Journal is true. He said:\n\n       The explosion of spending, deficits, and debt foreshadows \n     even higher prospective taxes on work, savings, investment \n     and employment. That not only will damage our economic future \n     but is harming jobs and growth now.\n\n  The American people know that taxes are going to go up, a fact \nconfirmed by David Walker, former Comptroller General and GAO head. He \ntestified recently that taxes would need to double by 2040 to keep up \nwith our current commitments.\n  The American people have made it clear they reject the philosophy of \never increasing debt. They reject taking on such a burden. Why? Because \nthey know it threatens the strength of the American economy. They know \nit is a cloud over our efforts to rebound economically, and they want \nus to stop. They want us to stop.\n  To my colleagues, I ask: How much clearer does that message have to \nbe? I do not think anyone doubts it. The good news is, many Senators \nare worried on both sides of the aisle. They are concerned about what \nwe are doing, and they know we need to do better, and they are \nlistening to their constituents. They will have an opportunity this \nweek to do that by supporting this bipartisan legislation I have \noffered.\n  I see my colleague Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri in the \nChamber, who is a cosponsor of this legislation that will limit the \ngrowth of spending. So it is a simple amendment. There are no strings \nattached. It as a rare opportunity to impose budget discipline on a \nCongress that is notorious for not having any.\n  That is what makes people angry. Politicians talk a good game but \nnothing seems to change. But when it comes down to it, the politicians \nalways seem to find a way to spend more, and the taxpayers end up \nholding the bill. So this amendment would help change that. It would \nimpose, first, binding limits on the 40 percent of Federal spending we \ncontrol each year, discretionary spending. The amendment would put into \nlaw the spending levels approved in the fiscal year 2010 congressional \nbudget, which a majority of the Senate supported. It is basically the \nDemocratic Congress's budget. It had certain limits over 5 years.\n\n  What we are saying is if you exceed those limits, then you would be \nviolating this amendment, which seeks to control and avoid that. Those \nspending levels include only our budget increases that are averaging \nabout 2 percent a year annually over 5 years. Contrast that with the \n12-percent increases we saw last year in nondefense discretionary \nappropriations, and the 10 percent the year before.\n  Factoring in the stimulus, government spending on nondefense accounts \nactually soared by 57 percent, while State and local governments were \ntightening their belts, some cutting expenses.\n  Each year we increase spending it gets built into the baseline of our \nbudget for the next year, and when we have an increase in the next \nyear, it is an increase on a higher baseline, and it goes up \nexponentially.\n  For example, last year, on one bill, the defense bill, there was \ntacked on an $18 billion expenditure for various projects that were not \npaid for within the budget. It was added, paid for with debt--money we \nhad to borrow. If we do that each year, if we add another $18 billion \nthrough that kind of budget-busting activity, it would cost the \ntaxpayers an extra $1 trillion over a decade. It is hard to believe, \nbut that is true. Mr. President, $18 billion one year goes into the \nbaseline; the next year you add another $18 billion, and it is not $18 \nbillion, it is $36 billion more than you would have spent had the first \none not been spent.\n  I am convinced we can do better. This amendment is an important step.\n  Second, the amendment would require 67 votes--two-thirds of the \nSenate--to waive the binding caps. In other words, if we set these \ncaps, we can waive them if there is an emergency. But it takes two-\nthirds to do so. Two-thirds of the Senate is a strong threshold that \nwill keep these caps in place except in times of true emergency.\n  Finally, this amendment complements efforts to rein in mandatory \nspending programs that are expected to be insolvent in coming years. \nSocial Security runs a surplus now. Medicare did so until the last few \nyears. Those surpluses are being spent in our discretionary accounts. \nSo these programs have little to do with our record deficits. It is \ndiscretionary spending, up until recently, that has driven the entirety \nof our debt.\n  Deficits for the most part come from discretionary spending, and this \nstatutory caps idea I have proposed is tested and proven. The Budget \nEnforcement Act of 1990 included similar provisions that kept the \ngrowth of Federal spending low for 12 years. Its provisions were \nextended in 1997 because people found they were working. Congress felt \nthey were working.\n  All in all, these budget rules helped to achieve four balanced \nbudgets for 4 consecutive years, from 1998 to 2001. The key component \nof that, I truly believe, was these statutory caps on spending that \nwere passed during that period.\n  Many currently serving Senators were in this Chamber in the 1990s and \nrecognized the necessity. In 1997, 28 currently serving Democrats, for \nexample, voted for these provisions, including many of the Democratic \nleaders in the Senate today. I submit that those budget rules are even \nmore needed today.\n  As Mr. Greenspan said, we have never faced such a fiscal crisis \nlooming just over the horizon.\n  I am pleased a number of organizations known for their knowledge and \nconcern about deficits have recognized the merit of this proposal, \nincluding the National Taxpayers Union, Committee for a Responsible \nFederal Budget, the Heritage Foundation, and the Concord Coalition.\n  Budget experts Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who served under a Republican \nadministration; Alice Rivlin, who served under the Clinton \nadministration at CBO; and Alan Viard also back the plan. President \nObama, we learned today is now talking about a 3-year freeze on some \ndiscretionary spending. This legislation would only help him achieve \nthat goal because he can make a speech and he can propose it to \nCongress, but it doesn't necessarily become law. If he supports this \nand works to support the statement that we understand he will make in \nthe State of the\n\n[[Page S225]]\n\nUnion Address, this legislation would be a firewall to make sure his \npromise isn't broken.\n  I say this to my colleagues: We have a budget crisis. It is a \ncalamity so profound that it threatens our economic security. Americans \nacross the country--in red States and blue States--get it. They are \ndeeply concerned about the direction in which we are headed. They know \nthe crushing debt we are incurring will weaken our country, and it will \nrestrict the opportunities our children will have. They are making \ntheir voices heard.\n  A vote against this amendment would be a suggestion that a Senator is \nnot serious about maintaining our budget caps but is looking for ways \nto bust the budget, get around the budget, and spend more.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation as a strong act of \nfiscal responsibility that will have a good impact. In fact, I am \nconfident it would send a message to the financial community that we \nare beginning to get our house in order.\n  While I would like to go further and be more frugal in some of our \nbehavior around here--and I do believe we are going to have to go \nfurther than this--this amendment will ensure that the limits on \nspending made last year in the budget passed by this Congress will not \nbe exceeded. It will be a firewall that will save us from our excesses. \nIt will begin to restore financial responsibility to our Nation, a \ncommodity of which we are in desperately short supply.\n  I see Senator McCaskill. She has cast a number of tough votes to \nquestion reckless spending since I have observed her in the Senate. I \nappreciate her leadership and courage in speaking out on this issue. If \nwe do this, it will not solve all our problems, but I think it will \nmake a positive difference for us. It will allow increases as the \nbudget allows for some increases before the firewall kicks in. But it \nalso would make it very difficult to break the budget in any \nsignificant way, unless we face a true emergency.\n  I yield the floor and I thank my colleague for her leadership on this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I acknowledge my colleague, Senator \nSessions from Alabama, and welcome the opportunity to join him in an \nattempt to restore some sanity in Congress about spending.\n  I come from a State where there is a requirement of a balanced \nbudget, although, over the last couple years, I am not sure how they \nwould have done that without incredible pain if it hadn't been for the \nhelp the Federal Government sent them. There is no question that the \nfact that we don't have to balance the budget in Washington has led to \nsome very bad habits.\n  I was thinking about spending over the weekend, as this week there \nare a number of provisions we will debate that I have sponsored or am a \nbig supporter of, including the fiscal task force amendment which went \ndown this morning by a narrow vote, and obviously pay-go, which I have \nbeen the lead Senate sponsor on over the last several months. These are \nall things with which we are trying to fight something that you \nencounter all the time as a parent. How much easier it is to say yes \nthan no. My kids hate when I give them that lecture because they are \nalways wanting me to say yes. I always say the easiest thing to do is \nto say yes--yes, you can have that outfit; yes, you can take my car; \nyes, you can go see your friends, even though I am not sure you \nfinished whatever chores you had around the house. It is always easier \nto say I will go along with it, it is a good cause.\n  That is what happens around here. It is not like we are spending on \nevil stuff. We are spending on stuff we believe in--education, \nhighways, our parks, our military--and we are spending on things that \nmake it even harder to say no.\n  The time has come that we all have to feel the pain of saying no. We \nall have to be willing to suffer the political consequences of saying \nno. That is why this amendment is such an important step in the right \ndirection.\n  I want to be honest about this because we have a tendency to make \nthings bigger than they are. This isn't going to make a dramatic change \nin the deficit or the debt. I am not sure how many Americans have \nfocused on the difference between the two, but they are two different \nthings, and it will not make a huge difference. People need to remember \nthat if we took out all discretionary spending and decided we were not \ngoing to spend another dime on education, highways or any of the things \nwe decide on spending every year, we will still have a massive deficit \nproblem. We don't fix the deficit by passing this amendment. We don't \nfix the deficit by saying we are not going to even do discretionary \ndomestic spending anymore. So this is not a fix-all. Do you know what \nit does? It begins to get us well. It is a little like earmarking. Is \nearmarking the huge problem? No. But it is similar to a fever; it is a \nsymptom of a disease. This will help us get well.\n  It will be a step toward recovery if we can pass this amendment to \nfreeze our discretionary spending. I am so pleased the White House has \ncalled for a freeze. I think this is a wonderful bipartisan moment. I \nthink we are all hankering for a good bipartisan moment right now. I \nhope we are all hankering for a good bipartisan moment. I got worried \nthis morning on the vote on the fiscal task force because it seemed \nlike there might have been some political games being played. I don't \nknow about anybody else, but I am hankering for a good bipartisan \nmoment. This ought to be one, where Republicans and Democrats set aside \nwho looks good and who looks bad, who gets credit and who gets the \nblame, and do something we need to do.\n  We used to have a freeze and we used to have pay-go. They were both \nallowed to expire in 2002. I wasn't here. I am not sure why they were \nallowed to expire. Did Congress all of a sudden think we don't need \npay-go anymore or we don't need limits on discretionary spending \nanymore because we are out of the woods when it comes to the deficit or \ndebt? I am not sure why that happened. I know most of the folks who let \nthose things expire wish they could take it back. I bet most of the \nfolks who did voting for major entitlement programs without paying for \nthem during that time--I bet they wish they could take it back because \nnow we are in a real mess.\n  The first and most important step to get out of this mess is to vote \nto control our spending. I am hopeful this will be passed by a wide \nmargin. Some of my friends on the left have said the last thing in the \nworld we should do now is limit spending, that government is the answer \nin this difficult recession. I voted for the stimulus, and I think the \ntax cuts in the stimulus, which don't get talked about enough, and the \nhelp to the States, which doesn't get talked about enough, and the jobs \nthat will be created this year are very important to the progress we \nhave made in terms of climbing out of the economic hole we found \nourselves in a year ago.\n  But we will not get out of this recession on the back of government \nspending. If we decide it is just about government spending during this \nrecession, we are dealing a very bad hand to our grandchildren.\n  I hope this amendment passes. I hope it is not even controversial. I \nam so pleased the President is on board, and I am pleased that so many \nmembers of the Republican party are on board. Let's take this important \nstep, and then let's live up to it during the appropriations process. \nLet's realize that pet project at home that we know we can get because \nwe can get an earmark--maybe this is the year to say no and push back \nfrom the table and say all those pet projects, those earmarks, are not \nthe right signal we need to send to the American people this year.\n  I thank my colleague from Alabama and Senator Kyl, who were \ncosponsors on this. I look forward to wide bipartisan support. I look \nforward to enthusiastic applause tomorrow night in the President's \nState of the Union Address, when he lays out his freeze on spending. We \nare all on board now. Let's make it happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nJudd Gregg, former chairman of the Budget Committee and ranking member, \nbe added as a cosponsor to this legislation.\n\n[[Page S226]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namended be set aside and I send up amendment No. 3303.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3303 to Amendment No. 3299.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Monday, January 25, 2010, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be divided in the \nform which I now send to the desk.\n  I ask at this time that division I of the original amendment be made \nthe pending amendment.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from Oklahoma \nstill has the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, while the Parliamentarian is doing the \nwork that is necessary at this time, I thought I would spend a few \nminutes talking about this amendment in the interest of saving some \ntime.\n  We have a significant problem in front of us as a Nation. We have \nbefore us an underlying bill that raises the debt that nobody in this \nroom, save the pages, will ever pay a penny toward reducing--nobody \nexcept the pages and their generation will pay a penny toward reducing.\n  This request for increasing the debt limit of $1.9 trillion, I remind \nmy colleagues, is $200 billion more than the entire Federal Government \nspent in the year 1999, 10 years ago. So we, in one fell swoop, in 1 \nyear, we are going to increase the debt by $200 billion more than what \nthe entire Federal Government spent 10 years ago.\n  The whole purpose behind this amendment is a wake-up call to say: \nWait a minute, the Congress, in the last 2 years, under its leadership, \nhas increased spending 11.4 percent in 2009 and 11.4 percent this year, \nnot counting a stimulus bill and not counting omnibus bills that were \nnot paid for because they were declared an emergency.\n  If we add all that up, excluding the stimulus bill, we had a 28-\npercent increase in the size of the Federal Government in the last 2 \nyears--just in the last 2 years. At that rate, the size of the Federal \nGovernment doubles over a 5-year period.\n  What these amendments are designed to do is to get us doing what \nevery American family is doing today; that is, starting to make some of \nthe hard choices about where we have excess, where we have \ninefficiency, where we have duplication, and eliminate it because we \nshould not ask the American people to take on more debt when we know we \nhave at least $387 billion worth of waste, fraud, and duplication every \nyear in the Federal Government. Yet that is exactly what we are doing \nwith the underlying bill. We are taking on more debt and not doing \nanything about the excessive spending or the waste, fraud, or \nduplication.\n  The whole purpose behind coming to the floor is to say: Can we not, \nin light of a 28-percent increase, cut 5 percent in terms of \ndiscretionary spending that we just jacked up five times that amount \nover the last 2 years? Can we not find 5 percent worth of waste? We \nhave identified specifically 640 programs that are duplicative of one \nanother in the Federal Government. We have identified waste. When we go \nto find out, when we ask the GAO or the Congressional Research Service \nto help us with this, do you know what they tell us? We cannot; it is \ntoo big. We cannot tell you where all the duplication is. That is our \nown research bodies saying they cannot tell us where it is too big.\n  This amendment puts a stop to that. It mandates that we in the \nfuture, every year, will get a report from the GAO on every program \nwithin the Federal Government that duplicates another program and what \ntheir recommendations are to streamline or change it.\n  The reason it is easy to borrow or easy to raise taxes is because we \nfail to do the hard work of eliminating the spending waste. We just had \nthe Senator from Alabama wanting to put on some caps. That is not going \nto be adopted. We know it.\n  The reason I divided this amendment is because my colleagues will \ntake one segment of it and say: Oh, I was for cutting 5 percent out of \nthe Federal budget, but I just did not agree with this one segment, \nwhether it be education or somewhere else, that we should not cut, and, \ntherefore, I voted against the whole amendment.\n  This puts the American people in the driver's seat, as far as their \nSenators are concerned. We are going to get to see whether they agree \nthat we ought to continue to waste money; that we ought to steal it \nfrom these pages and their generation and not do the hard work of \nmaking a choice and putting things in terms of priority like every \nAmerican family is doing.\n  Every American family is doing that right now. They do not have an \nunlimited credit card. They do not have the privilege of going to the \nbank when they are tapped out and say: Just give me more money, like we \nare getting ready to do on extending the debt limit.\n  The other thing that is in this is leading by example. The Senators \nincreased their budget by 5.8 percent this year. We reverse that. Most \nof us can easily live within the budget we had last year--easily. So we \nreverse the increase for the Senate back down to what it was last year.\n  We should not ask the rest of this government to make a sacrifice \nthat we are not willing to demonstrate by leading on the same issue.\n  This bill can be the first step in a reality check of getting the \nCongress back aligned with where the American people are, as far as \nspending.\n  Just a year ago, in January of 2009, the national debt was $10.6 \ntrillion. Today the national debt is $12.2994 trillion. Forty-three \ncents of every dollar we spent last year we borrowed, and we are going \nto do exactly that or worse this next year unless we wake up, unless we \ncome to our senses.\n  You can have all the arguments you want, but nobody in America \nbelieves the Federal Government is not wasteful. Nobody believes it is \ngood enough to just freeze a small portion of discretionary spending. \nWhat Americans believe is we need to cut spending. We need to cut out \nthe waste, cut out the duplication, and cut out the fraud. We need \nefficiency where we can generate efficiency. We need to eliminate \nduplication where there is duplication.\n  My friend, President Obama, when he was campaigning said: I promise \nto spend taxpayer money wisely and to eliminate wasteful redundancy. We \nare going to help him with that. That is what this amendment does. In \n640 programs where there is duplication, we are going to allow an \nincentive for each department to get rid of it. We are not mandating \nthey have to get rid of it. We are saying: You should do the review. \nYou should take this money, and you should eliminate the duplications. \nWhat you need from us to do that, we will give you. But we are giving \nyou the authority to do that with these amendments.\n  Let me quote from President Obama:\n\n       Too often Federal departments take on functions or services \n     that are already being done or could be done elsewhere within \n     the Federal Government more effectively. The result is \n     unnecessary redundancy and the inability of the Federal \n     Government to benefit from economies of scale and integrated \n     streamlined operations.\n\n  He is right. So now we are going to give the Senators a chance to \nsupport his statement and his position.\n  Nothing has been done in the last year to accomplish that. As a \nmatter of fact, the President sent program after program that he wanted \nto get rid of. He said they are not effective, they do not work, they \nare duplicative, and they are not efficient. What did we do?\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\nWe did not eliminate a one of them. We just kept funding them. So we \ncannot claim that the problems lie with the President. The problems do \nnot lie with the President. The problems lie with the elected body of \nCongress in not making the hard, difficult choices of putting a \npriority on what is most important and taking the time to do the \noversight and explain to the American people why we ought to have the \nprograms consolidated. We may have a goal we want to accomplish and \nhelp the American people with, but we certainly ought to do it in the \nmost efficient and effective manner we can.\n  The other reason to consider this amendment is to think about what is \ngetting ready to happen to us. What is getting ready to happen to us \nover the next 10 years is we are going to accrue another $9 trillion in \ndebt if we do not start this process with this amendment today. We are \ngoing to accrue another $9 trillion. Of that $9 trillion, $4.8 trillion \nof it is going to be interest. It is going to be interest costs on the \ndebt. We are going to borrow money to pay the interest on the money \nthat we borrow. It does not have to be that way.\n  My colleagues will come down and say: The big problem is the \nentitlement programs. There is no question that is two-thirds of our \nproblem. But the easy thing to fix now and saves billions, if not \ntrillions, of dollars on is the discretionary portion of the budget \nthat we do have control over.\n  We always hear the excuse: That is not the big problem. The reason it \nis not the big problem is because politicians enamor themselves with \npeople at home by spending money we do not have on things we do not \nneed that are not truly a legitimate role of the Federal Government.\n  The family budget is getting smaller, and the Federal Government is \ngetting bigger. That is just exactly the opposite of what ought to be \nhappening in this country today. Inflation is near zero, but yet we are \nincreasing spending, like I said, 11.7 percent last year. That does not \ninclude the supplemental emergency spending and does not have any \nconnection at all with the stimulus bill. That is what we did with the \nindividual budgets across the Federal Government.\n  When I come down and make the case for cutting back 5 percent of \nthat, which ends up being $120 billion, nobody should be opining: My \ngoodness, we are going to tear things up. But we are going to hear \nthat. We are going to hear all the reasons we cannot do what I am \nproposing to do.\n  America is not going to buy that anymore. They are not buying it \nanymore, and they should not buy it.\n  The other thing this amendment will do is it will give us 30 days to \ncome back and assess other areas where we can cut more spending. People \nin this body think that is hard. It is not hard. Let me give an example \nof where we can save $80 billion a year in one program.\n  At a minimum, there is $100 billion of fraud in Medicare a year. We \ndo not have an effective strategy, like any other organization outside \nof government, to limit the defrauding that goes on in Medicare. We \npay, and then we try to chase people we should not have paid.\n  Senator LeMieux from Florida and others have multiple ideas on how we \ncould take that $100 billion and over the next 6 months save $30 \nbillion or $40 billion of that. That is $30 billion or $40 billion each \nyear over the next 10 years. That comes out to $\\1/2\\ trillion, which \ncuts down that $9 trillion in additional debt we are going to be \nencumbering upon our children. Last year, this country's debt grew $4.2 \nbillion a day. We didn't do anything about that except spend more \nmoney, so this year it is going to accrue at $4.3 billion a day. That \nis how much we are going to spend that we don't have.\n\n  Isn't it time that we start facing the situation as it is rather than \nthe way we would like it to be? The cold hard facts are that we have a \nshort timeframe--4 to 5 years at most--to get our house back in order. \nNow is the time to start. It is not next year, it is not next month; it \nis right now--right now, when the American people may or may not be \nfocused on the fact that we are going to authorize an additional $1.9 \ntrillion worth of borrowing. You can't even write that many zeros down \nand have a comprehension of how much it is. At the same time, we don't \ndo anything about solving the problem.\n  Quite frankly, Congress has a dependency issue. We are addicted. We \nare addicted to spending. We are addicted to the age-old adage that if \nI spend enough money, I can go home and tell people how great I am, not \never telling them I am spending their money and their kids' money but \nclaiming I am looking out for them.\n  The only way you really look out for America is to secure America \ninto the future, and we have not been doing that. It hasn't been done \nunder the Republican watch, hasn't been done under the Democratic \nwatch. What has happened is the same old same old of continuing to \nignore the problem and not taking the heat for making the tough choices \nthat will put our country back on the track on which it belongs--a \ntrack that will secure a future for our children and grandchildren, \nthat will embrace the heritage that made this country great. What was \nthat heritage? That heritage was sacrifice. In this country, all of \nus--many--are sacrificing now, and many in the future are going to have \nto sacrifice.\n  Others will come down to the floor and they will say: Well, Coburn, \nall you want to do is cut spending; you don't really want to solve the \nproblem. Well, the first part of solving the problem is cutting the \nspending and recognizing that the walls don't fall down if you cut 5 \npercent out of the discretionary spending in our budget. As a matter of \nfact, very few people will ever notice $120 billion coming out of the \nFederal Government on these discretionary programs because they will \njust go to a different grant program that does the same thing and get \nit there.\n  Let me go into some of the facts because many of us don't understand. \nHere are some examples:\n  There are 14 programs administered by the U.S. Department of \nEducation related to foreign exchanges and designed to increase \nopportunity for students to study abroad. There is nothing wrong \ninherently with wanting our students to study abroad, to gain that \nperspective and to gain that education, but why 14 different programs? \nWhy not one? Why not 1 program and save all the administrative costs of \nthe other 13? Why not do that? Because somebody may not have their name \non a program? The fact is, nobody knew that until we discovered it in \nthe last 4 weeks.\n  There are more than 44 job-training programs administered by 9 \ndifferent Federal agencies across the bureaucracy, costing $30 billion \na year. Forty-four Federal job-training programs? Tell me why we need \n44. Maybe 4 to hit different areas in different situations but not 44 \nand not through 9 different Federal agencies that are all trying to do \nthe same thing and competing to throw out money.\n  What about 69 early education programs administered by 9 different \nFederal agencies. Sixty-nine, why would we tolerate that? Why would we \ncontinue with the status quo? Now is the time to make changes.\n  One of my favorites is that we have 105 Federal programs supporting \nscience, technology, engineering, and math--105 different programs \nwhere we support that--funding over $3 billion a year. I agree we ought \nto encourage it, we ought to stimulate it, we ought to support it \nbecause we know we have to be competitive in the future, but do we \nreally need 105 different Federal Government programs? The answer is, \nabsolutely not. We don't. But because we don't know what is there, we \ncontinue to do the same.\n  As a matter of fact, there is going to be a Judiciary markup on \nThursday that has a new program in it--supposedly new--and the authors \nof the bill have no idea that we already have a Federal program that \ndoes the same thing. That is why the important key component of this \nglobal amendment is to make sure the GAO tells us what is out there, \nwhat we need to do, and how we need to go about it. We may need some \nredundancy, but we don't need 105 times redundancy, we don't need 30 \ntimes redundancy, we don't need 44 times redundancy, and we don't need \n69 times redundancy. As a matter of fact, when we have all these \nprograms, the States have to hire all these different people to \nunderstand all the different programs so they can make sure they get \ntheir fair share. We could actually save the States a ton of money if \nthey\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\nonly had one-stop shopping--if, in fact, it is a truly legitimate \ngovernment function.\n  The amendment also rescinds unobligated discretionary funds that have \nbeen available for more than 2 consecutive fiscal years. So it doesn't \nhurt the agencies if the money has been there and they haven't spent \nit. As a matter of fact, we are giving them so much money, they can't \nspend it all. We have seen unobligated balances go up because they \ncan't get it out the door. And when we are pushing them to get it out \nthe door, guess what happens to efficiency and accuracy and \neffectiveness of those programs. It goes way down.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, at year end 2009, \nthat is, September 30, there was $657 billion sitting in unobligated \nfunds. Some of that is military, some of that is war funds, some of \nthat is VA. We exempt war funds and we exempt VA. We exempt DOD, but we \nshouldn't because there is $50 billion a year in waste in the Pentagon \nthat can easily be demonstrated.\n  So we direct the GAO to identify those duplicative programs and \nreport to Congress on the findings.\n  Madam President, may I make an inquiry of the Chair? Has the status \nof our division been decided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment is not divisible as a \nmatter of right because the Senate has entered into a unanimous consent \nagreement limiting the universe of amendments on this measure.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the Senators from Alabama and Oklahoma \nhave offered that amendment to the debt limit resolution. As these \namendments address matters primarily for the jurisdiction of the \nAppropriations Committee, I will defer to the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee to address those amendments momentarily.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Ben Bernanke\n\n  Madam President, in the meantime, on another matter, I wish to say I \nstrongly support the nomination of Chairman Ben Bernanke to his second \nterm as Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n  Last August, President Obama announced his intention to renominate \nChairman Bernanke for a second term. There is little debate that our \nfinancial system has been through one of the most tumultuous times \nsince the Great Depression. I strongly support President Obama's \ndecision to renominate Ben Bernanke and believe he has the expertise to \ncontinue to lead this country out of one of the worst economic \ndownturns in history.\n  Chairman Bernanke graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University, \nearning a bachelor's degree in economics. He continued his studies at \nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received a Ph.D. in \neconomics. He then had the good sense to head to Stanford, my alma \nmater, where he taught economics for several years at the Graduate \nSchool of Business. After heading back to Princeton University, he \nquickly rose through the academic ranks to become chairman of the \nPrinceton Economics Department. His groundbreaking economic work on the \nGreat Depression helped increase our understanding of that calamity and \nprepared him well to tackle our recent disaster. He has a strong record \nof public service, including work as a visiting scholar at several \nFederal Reserve banks.\n  In 2002, President George W. Bush appointed him to serve on the Board \nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In 2005, President Bush \nappointed him Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. \nIn 2006, President Bush appointed him Chairman of the Federal Reserve. \nThe Senate confirmed his nomination by voice vote. After his \nappointment to three posts by President Bush, Ben Bernanke was \nrenominated as Federal Reserve Chairman in 2009 by President Obama.\n  At this point, I might point out that if any Senator had any problems \nwith the reappointment of Chairman Bernanke, they certainly knew when \nhis term expired and they should have conveyed those views to President \nObama, and conveyed them strongly if that was their view, so that \nPresident Obama would have had an opportunity to appoint somebody else \nif that was his choice. It is my understanding that virtually no \nSenator complained to President Obama about the renomination of \nChairman Bernanke before the nomination was sent to the Senate.\n  In his nearly 4 years as Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke has \ndemonstrated he is worthy of another term. Facing the worst financial \ncalamity in nearly 70 years and relying on his keen insight into the \norigins of financial panics, he successfully worked with the previous \nand current administrations to ensure that the economy of the United \nStates and the world survived the crisis of 2008.\n  Again, his dissertation was on the Great Depression. This is a man \nwho understands the Great Depression and probably had some pretty good \nideas of how to prevent that from occurring. Averting disaster is not \nsomething that usually earns you accolades or parades. ``It could have \nbeen worse'' is not your typical commendation. But there is no doubt \nthat without Chairman Bernanke's leadership, our economy would have \nbeen much worse off.\n  Time will tell how the history of this crisis is written, but \neconomists and experts believed then and still today that the Federal \nGovernment could not stand by and let the financial system collapse. \nLiquidity in the markets evaporated. Small businesses could not obtain \nthe day-to-day cash to buy inventory or make payroll. Foreclosures \nincreased from hundreds to hundreds of thousands. Americans across the \ncountry witnessed their retirement savings dwindling before their eyes. \nConfidence in the system as a whole vanished.\n  Beginning in 2008, Chairman Bernanke began to take a series of steps \nto walk us back from the brink of disaster. The Federal Reserve cut \ninterest rates early and aggressively in an attempt to inject liquidity \ninto the markets. I might point out that there were some who counseled \nthe opposite action; that is, those most concerned about inflation. \nPerhaps Bernanke went too far in trying to inject liquidity back into \nthe markets, but that is what he believed was necessary in order to get \nthe economy back on track. The Fed established lending facilities to \nprovide much needed funding. Last year, the Fed, in conjunction with \nthe Department of Treasury, established the Term Asset-Backed \nSecurities Loan Facility, TALF, to finance more than 4 million consumer \nand small business loans. That is sometimes forgotten, but that is \nsomething he did. At a time when conditions were changing daily and \nsometimes hourly, Chairman Bernanke did not hesitate to take bold and \nnecessary steps to avoid total collapse of our economy.\n  Madam President, 20/20 hindsight will always reveal things we would \nhave done differently. With such aggressive and unprecedented action \ncomes criticism and judgment.\n  Without a doubt, the Federal Reserve System deserves a share of the \nblame for fostering the conditions that led us to the precipice, but as \nthis crisis was systemic, so, too, were its flaws.\n  On that point, I might say there are a lot of agencies that probably \nshould be blamed or held accountable for some of the missteps or \nfailure to foresee the crisis occurring. One that comes to my mind is \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange \nCommission either did not have jurisdiction or didn't ask for \njurisdiction or did not exercise jurisdiction over a lot of the \nnonbanks that were creating a lot of these fancy derivatives and other \ninstruments. I can name many of them. I think we all know who they are. \nIt was a lack of effort by the SEC. I think the SEC was derelict in not \nbeing much more aggressive at that time.\n  There are a lot of areas where fingers can be pointed. One can be the \nCongress. Where were the oversight committees at that time? What were \nthe questions they were asking? What were they doing?\n  I think, frankly, that mistakes were made, many of them, beginning \nwith the subprime mortgage crisis and working all the way up to \nmortgage\n\n[[Page S229]]\n\nbrokers packaging and reselling loans and securitizing those loans and \nthen all the other instruments that were developed at the time, and \nvery high leverage. That was a big mistake made before Ben Bernanke was \nhead of the Fed.\n  It is more apparent than ever that we must pass strong and \ncomprehensive regulatory reform, to crack down on risky financial \nderivatives, properly regulate the shadow banking system, and ensure \nconsumers are adequately protected. In his confirmation hearing, \nChairman Bernanke stated that such a crisis ``must prompt financial \ninstitutions and regulators alike to undertake unsparing self-\nassessments of their past performance.''\n  Chairman Bernanke is doing just that. The Federal Reserve has already \nundergone significant regulatory changes, and he is committed to \nworking with me and my colleagues in Congress to put in place proper \noversight and transparency to see that we are never again faced with \nthe peril we have witnessed over the past 2 years.\n  But as Emerson once said, ``[b]lame is safer than praise.'' I commend \nChairman Bernanke and his team at the Federal Reserve for acting in a \ntime of such uncertainty. There is still much that must be done to get \nour economy back on track and Americans back to work. I believe that \nChairman Bernanke and the Federal Reserve will continue efforts to \ncreate jobs and help middle class families. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting Chairman Bernanke's nomination for his second \nterm, as he works to restore confidence and prosperity in our economy.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3303\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Coburn \namendment to eliminate wasteful and duplicative spending. Before my \ncolleague from Oklahoma leaves the floor, I know he has to go, but I \nhave to pose a question for the Senator from Oklahoma. We have a \nlisting in the Senator's amendment of the many duplicative programs.\n  Have we had a study that would indicate how many government employees \nare engaged in administering these duplicative programs?\n  Mr. COBURN. No. To answer the Senator's question, we do not even know \nhow many duplicative programs there are out there. These are the 640 we \nfound looking over a 4-week period.\n  But when we asked GAO or the Congressional Research Service about \nthis, what they say is the task is too big. They do not even know if \nthey can accomplish the task, which goes to the enormity of the problem \nwe face.\n  I mentioned on the Senate floor earlier, we have a markup tomorrow in \nthe Judiciary Committee for a new program, and it is duplicative of an \nexisting program. But those offering the amendment do not even know it. \nSo it shows we have to stop and reassess. Part of this amendment is \ncreating a mandate that the GAO has to advise us on that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do believe that at least we ought to, over time, make \nan attempt to ascertain the numbers of employees who are in these \nduplicative government programs. It is really startling--if the \nAmerican people knew of the fact that there are so many duplicative \nefforts and different agencies of the government trying to accomplish \nthe same mission.\n  Before I go much further, I would like to mention, I have the \ninformation that tomorrow night the President will propose a spending \nfreeze for discretionary spending with the exception of defense, \nveterans affairs, and homeland security. I applaud that move on the \npart of the President.\n  I think, from the conclusions I have reached so far, it would save \nsome $15 billion next year and perhaps $200 billion over time. We are \ntrying to ascertain exactly what that is.\n  But I do not see how the President, at the same time that he is \nrecommending a spending freeze that would save some $12 or $15 or $20 \nbillion next year, at the same time to be proposing a stimulus package, \nanother one, that could be $80 or $100 billion. That is not fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  The House, the other body, passed, before we went out of session, a \njobs bill that was somewhere around $100 billion, as I understand it. I \nunderstand the other side of the aisle is working on a package of about \n$80 billion. Well, look, let's stop the spending now. Let's stop the \nspending now.\n  So if we want to be sincere about stopping the spending that is \nunnecessary and unneeded, then we certainly should discard the idea \nthat we need another massive stimulus, particularly in light of the \nfact that by any estimation, including the prediction of the \nPresident's economic advisers that if we passed the last stimulus \npackage, unemployment would be at 8 percent.\n  So this proposal about a spending freeze would have a lot more \ncredibility with me if we said we are going to stop additional spending \nthis year that would also add to the burgeoning national debt.\n  The Coburn amendment is an important one. The Coburn amendment is \nbest appreciated by the fiscal situation in which we find ourselves. In \na recent editorial in the Houston Chronicle, they noted:\n\n       Our spending excesses, as most every American knows, are \n     increasingly financed by foreign sources led by China. In \n     all, about $4.5 trillion in U.S. debt is held by foreigners \n     and nearly $800 billion of that is held by the Beijing \n     government.\n\n  So we will increase the debt limit, and who is going to buy that \ndebt? Apparently, the Chinese are buying a lot of it since they own, \naccording to the Houston Chronicle, about $800 billion, and foreign \ncountries own about $3.5 trillion.\n  On December 16, the Wall Street Journal wrote:\n\n       Our view is there is good and bad public borrowing. In the \n     1980s, Federal deficits financed a military build-up that \n     ended the Cold War leading to an actual peace dividend in the \n     1990s of 3 percent of GDP, as well as tax cuts that ended the \n     stagflation of the 1970s, and began 25 years of prosperity. \n     Those were high-return investments. Today's debt is financing \n     what exactly? The TARP money did undergird the financial \n     system for a time, and is now being repaid. But most of the \n     rest has been spent on a political wish list of public \n     programs ranging from unemployment insurance to wind turbines \n     to tax credits for golf carts. Borrowing for such low-return \n     purposes makes America poor in the long run.\n\n  So if we are increasing the debt limit, and the Chinese and other \ncountries are going to buy that debt, and we are spending money in the \nstimulus package that has shown very little return on the massive $787 \nbillion investment, then should we not try Dr. Coburn's method and \nsupport his amendment which would basically prevent us from having to \nincrease the debt limit?\n  This amendment of Dr. Coburn's would rescind $120 billion in \nspending, 5 percent from each agency of government, other than the \nDepartment of Defense and Veterans Affairs; directing the agencies to \nconsolidate more than 650 duplicative government programs; rescind \nunobligated discretionary funds available for more than 2 consecutive \nfiscal years. Most Americans would be astonished to know that there are \nstill tax dollars sitting out there which have been appropriated and \nnot been spent for more than 2 years, sometimes several years.\n  Directing GAO to identify duplicative government programs and report \nthe findings to Congress would render the debt limit increase in the \nunderlying bill null and void. It is $1.9 trillion.\n  Let's just look at a few of the duplicative Federal programs that are \nout there. A 2004 report by a nonprofit research group listed 21 \nFederal programs across multiple agencies, many at Health and Human \nServices that funded childhood obesity programs either as the main \nfocus or as one component of the Federal program.\n  Child obesity is a serious issue in America. Do we need 21 separate \nprograms to address the issue? Would not we be more efficient if we had \na single program instead of spreading them out amongst different \nFederal agencies?\n  There are 14 programs administered by the U.S. Department of \nEducation related to foreign exchanges and designed to increase the \nopportunities for\n\n[[Page S230]]\n\nstudy abroad, 14 programs. According to a 2003 GAO report, the Federal \nGovernment funds more than 44 job training programs administered by \nnine different Federal agencies across the Federal bureaucracy at a \ncost of $30 billion.\n  According to data from the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, 14 \ndepartments within the Federal Government and 49 independent agencies \noperate exchanges and study abroad programs.\n  A 2009 GAO report found 69 early education programs administered by \nnine different agencies. There are over 30 Federal programs that \nprovide financial assistance to students to support postsecondary \neducation at a cost to the taxpayer of over $30 billion every year.\n  According to a May 2007 report in the Academic Competitiveness \nCouncil, there are 105 Federal programs supporting STEM education with \naggregate funding of $3.2 billion in 2006. You will note that I am not \neven talking about millions or hundreds of millions; we are talking \nabout billions.\n  Here is one. There are at least 17 offender reentry programs across \nfive Federal agencies, different Federal agencies, costing the \ntaxpayers over $250 million annually.\n  A 2005 GAO study found there are a total of 23 Federal housing \nprograms targeted or have special features for the elderly, 23 Federal \nhousing programs that target or have special features for the elderly.\n  There are at least nine programs at the USDA tasked with researching \nand developing biofuels, costing taxpayers nearly $300 million \nannually. Over $800 million was included in the stimulus bill for these \ninitiatives.\n  The Federal Government oversees at least 15 different preservation \nprograms costing taxpayers nearly $100 million annually.\n  There are at least 28 Federal programs totaling over $5 billion that \nsupport job training and employment.\n  Here we are, with an outstanding public debt well over $12.3 \ntrillion. The estimate for this year is the largest in history. The \nestimated population of the United States is over 307.6 million people. \nTherefore, each U.S. citizen's share of this debt is approximately \n$40,100. That is $40,000 for every man, woman, and child in this \ncountry. That is shameful, shameful spending that has laid this debt on \nfuture generations of Americans. The greatness of America is based on \nthe tradition that one generation has passed off to the next generation \na nation that is better off than the one they inherited. What kind of a \nnation are we going to hand off to the next generation of Americans \nwith a debt to the Chinese of $800 billion, a debt of over $3.5 \ntrillion held by foreigners, and the debt goes on and on and on with no \nend in sight.\n  Why should we not try Dr. Coburn's method? Why should we not attempt \nto do something different rather than raising the debt limit every time \nwe have spent so much we have to raise it again?\n  Let's look at what we spent last year alone: $787 billion on the so-\ncalled stimulus bill which amounts to $1.1 trillion, if you calculate \nthe interest; $700 billion in TARP to bail out the banks and other \nailing financial institutions; $410 billion for the Omnibus \nappropriations bill, a package of 9 appropriations bills rolled \ntogether, which contained over 9,000 unrequested, unnecessary, run-of-\nthe-mill pork-barrel earmarks; $450 billion for the 2010 Omnibus \nappropriations bill, a package of 6 bills rolled together, containing \n5,000 unrequested earmarks. Let's put them together. In two bills last \nyear, one for 2009, the other for 2010, were at least 14,000 earmarks. \nThe Democratic leadership worked with the President to ram through a \n$3.5 trillion budget resolution. We have spent $83 billion to bail out \nthe auto companies. There is still a chance that a $2.5 trillion health \nreform bill may be passed by the other side.\n  Overall, domestic spending has increased by 14 percent over the last \nfiscal year. Inflation has been practically zero for all intents and \npurposes. But the spending has increased by 14 percent. Don't we get \nit? Don't we see what we are doing to future generations of Americans? \nDon't we see that a debt for $40,100 for every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica is unconscionable? Why don't we try the Coburn amendment before \nwe willy-nilly increase the debt limit by another $1.4 trillion? Why? \nWhy can't we at least make an effort?\n  One thing I know about Dr. Coburn, he researches his information \ncarefully. He has shown us we don't need to raise the debt limit and \ngive ourselves a green light to spend even more. We have before us an \nopportunity. We can turn things around today. We can pass this \namendment and begin the hard work and make the tough decisions \nnecessary to put us on the path to fiscal solvency and national \nprosperity.\n  Here we are with a bill before us to increase the debt limit which \nwould increase, then, the debt that every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica has, as we continue this almost unrestrained spending spree.\n  I have said to my colleagues for a long time--and I think it was \nauthenticated in Massachusetts recently--the American people are mad. \nThey are angry at the spending. They do not want to lay a huge debt on \nfuture generations of Americans. They do not believe there is a shred \nof fiscal responsibility in the Congress or the administration. I will \nfairly note that this out-of-control spending was not invented with \nthis administration. Republicans, when they were in charge, let \nspending get completely out of control. We betrayed our fiscal base. We \npaid a heavy price for it, but we deserved to pay that price. Now is \nthe time to say stop, stop borrowing against our children and \ngrandchildren's futures. Stop putting ourselves in a precarious \nsituation, where the Chinese own so much of our national debt that they \nhave their hand on the throttle of the American economy.\n  I hasten to add, it is not in China's interest to hurt the American \neconomy. But it certainly can't be in our interest, in any way, to be \nin that kind of fiscal jeopardy. We cannot do that--not to mention the \n$3.5 trillion in debt held by foreigners.\n  I say to my colleagues, let's look at the Coburn amendment. It is \nwell thought out, well researched. Let's put the brakes on the \nmortgaging of America's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Christmas Day Terrorist Attack\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I had the benefit last week of attending \ntwo different hearings on the attempted terrorist attack that took \nplace on Christmas Day. The first was in the Homeland Security \nCommittee and the second was in the Commerce Committee. One thing \nbecame clear: There is a definite disconnect in this administration \nabout how to handle terrorists once they are captured. Over this last \nweekend, Osama bin Laden claimed responsibility for the foiled \nChristmas Day bomber terror attack. He has, once again, inserted \nhimself into the national security dialog in the United States.\n  I fear al-Qaida will have another opportunity to attack the United \nStates because of the fumbling of intelligence information that could \nhave been gathered on the Christmas Day bomber before his attempted \nattack and subsequently from this terrorist after he was captured. But \nthis administration clearly dropped the ball. We know the Director of \nNational Intelligence, Dennis Blair; FBI Director Mueller; National \nCounterterrorism Center Director Michael Leiter; and the Homeland \nSecurity Secretary, Janet Napolitano, were not consulted about the \ndecision to read Abdulmutallab his Miranda rights and try him in \ncivilian courts. We know that as soon as this terrorist was told of his \nright to remain silent, that is what he did. He stopped talking.\n  It is unfathomable that these individuals were not even consulted \nbefore this hugely important decision was made. After the hearings \nconducted last week and interviews over the weekend, it appears it was \nultimately the Attorney General who made the decision to read the \nMiranda rights and place Abdulmutallab in the civilian court system. \nHowever, there is a lot of ambiguity to show how this decision came to \nbe made. Were there any deliberations or meetings that occurred prior \nto this decision? Was the President brought into this discussion? All\n\n[[Page S231]]\n\nthese ambiguities need to be cleared up so we do not make the same \nmistakes again.\n  As a member of one of the committees charged with oversight of \nhomeland security, I will be asking for a written response from the \nadministration on this issue.\n  Additionally, because the heads of government agencies charged with \nmaking the decisions do not seem to be talking, I have joined with \nseveral of my Senate colleagues to cosponsor legislation authored by \nSenator Collins and Senator Lieberman, the distinguished ranking member \nand chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. This legislation would \nrequire the Attorney General to consult with the Director of National \nIntelligence, the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, and the Secretary of Defense prior to \nthe initiation of giving any terrorist Miranda rights or the initiation \nof civilian criminal charges against a foreign person detained by the \nU.S. Government on suspicion of any terrorist activities. The \nlegislation would also require, in the event of a disagreement amongst \nthese folks on whether such action should be initiated in civilian \ncriminal court, that the Attorney General not initiate such action \nunless specifically directed by the President. I ask my other Senate \ncolleagues to join me in cosponsoring this vital legislation.\n  A second thing we learned from last week's hearings was there is \nconfusion about when the high-value interrogation group or the HIG \nshould be convened to decide on whether to interrogate terrorists such \nas Abdulmutallab or to interview them with their lawyers present. \nDirector of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told the Homeland \nSecurity Committee:\n\n       This unit was created exactly for this purpose--to make a \n     decision on whether a certain person who is detained should \n     be treated as a case for Federal prosecution or for some \n     other means.\n\n  The intelligence chief said the interrogation group was created by \nthe White House last year to handle overseas cases but will now be \nexpanded for domestic cases.\n  He said:\n\n       We did not invoke the HIG in this case. We should have.\n\n  Subsequently, we heard from the administration that this HIG unit \nisn't even up and running yet.\n  My question is, How does the individual who is in charge of our \nintelligence infrastructure not know the policy and procedures for \ninterrogating terrorists? Based on the testimony given last week, it \nwould seem we do not have a fully integrated and comprehensive method \nfor interrogating terrorists, whether they are captured abroad or here \nat home. The capture and subsequent handling of terrorist Abdulmutallab \nwas bungled from the get-go. It is continuing to be bungled.\n  A week ago, I signed a letter to President Obama with a number of my \ncolleagues indicating that the decision to prosecute this terrorist in \ncivilian court has resulted in a missed opportunity to collect timely \nintelligence. In order for the U.S. Government to fully understand \nwhere we failed on Christmas Day, it is imperative we examine the \nmethods and means Abdulmutallab used to avoid detection.\n  As many of my colleagues have pointed out, our ability to gather this \ninformation has been severely hampered by the decision to put this \nterrorist almost immediately into the civilian court system. He now has \nall the rights, protections, and privileges of American citizens. Make \nno mistake about it, this decision to try Abdulmutallab as a U.S. \ncitizen, which he is not, as opposed to an enemy combatant will be a \ndetrimental impact on our ability to learn more about this failed \nterrorist attack. Taking it a step further, this decision may very well \nweaken our national security. Last week, the Republican leader \nmentioned that a year ago the President, immediately after taking \noffice, decided to revise the Nation's interrogation policies and to \nrestrict the CIA's ability to question terrorists.\n  This was done by Executive order. While questioning the Director of \nNational Intelligence, I specifically asked if the Director believed \nthe classified interrogation methods used previously by our own \ngovernment were more effective than the current methods found in the \nArmy Field Manual that is publicly available for the terrorist to train \nto.\n  One statement the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence, made \nduring the Q-and-A portion of the hearing particularly caught my \nattention. In response to a question from Senator Burris regarding al-\nQaida's ability to exploit open source intelligence, Admiral Blair \nstated this--I am quoting, once again:\n\n       [T]he public discussion of the specifics of the defensive \n     measures we take are making it that much easier for people to \n     evade our defenses and come in . . . I think they are just \n     making the job of those who are working hard to try to defend \n     us that much harder. It costs the taxpayer that much more \n     money. And I wish people would just shut the hell up.\n\n  That is what he said.\n  So if keeping some of our airport security measures a secret makes it \nharder for terrorists to evade them, shouldn't that same logic also \nhold that keeping some of our interrogation measures classified also \nmakes it harder for the terrorists to beat those interrogation \ntechniques? But this administration does not seem to be on the same \npage.\n  As I am sure you can imagine, those who wish to do us harm can simply \ntrain to the methods that are publicized in this public document. By \nlimiting our intelligence community to only those techniques in the \nArmy Field Manual, we have removed one important tool the intelligence \ncommunity has to use against al-Qaida; that is, fear of the unknown.\n  Terrorists now know exactly what our interrogation methods and \nlimitations are, and based on that knowledge they can train and prepare \nthemselves to successfully resist our interrogation efforts.\n  I am also concerned that the administration may begin to bargain or \npropose a plea deal to this terrorist, Abdulmutallab, in order to \nobtain additional information. I believe this would set a very \ndangerous precedent for would-be terrorists in order to potentially \nhave their jail time reduced. It is my understanding the policy of the \nUnited States is not to negotiate with terrorists.\n  We should comprehensively and effectively interrogate terrorists to \ngain the information we need, not to negotiate with them for it. The \nonly true way to gather this information is through an extensive \ninterrogation of the terrorist by highly trained intelligence \npersonnel. The definition of an ``extensive and comprehensive \ninterrogation'' is not a 50-minute questioning while the terrorist is \nbeing prepped for surgery, as was the case with Abdulmutallab.\n  Extensive interrogations are conducted over a sustained amount of \ntime, with members of various government agencies included. They \nincorporate individuals from defense intelligence and have elements of \nuncertainty and surprise. This means those conducting the \ninterrogations are not limited to a set of interrogations which the \nterrorist has trained against. In short, a proper and extensive \ninterrogation should not solely consist of the interrogation methods \nlisted in the Army Field Manual.\n  We have in our custody an individual who has been trained by al-\nQaida. He has met with some of its most senior leaders and has not been \nproperly and comprehensively interrogated. How is this possible? He \ncould give us information on the al-Qaida command-and-control \nstructure. It is possible he could give us information on funding \nmechanisms, ongoing operations, safe houses, personnel and leadership \nprofiles, al-Qaida's governmental connections in Yemen and maybe other \nMiddle East nations, and what the enemy views as weaknesses in our \nairport security.\n  What happens if, say, new information comes to light; say, Osama bin \nLaden releases a new tape like he just did, or if we intercept some \ncommunication coming out of Yemen? As it stands now, we have lost the \nability to interrogate Abdulmutallab on those issues.\n  Over the weekend, we heard a preposterous statement from the \nPresident's spokesman when he said the FBI got all the information they \ncould get out of him. That is a preposterous statement. I do not \nbelieve that to be the case, and I do not believe most Nevadans or \nother Americans believe it either.\n  It is for these reasons we must transfer Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to \nthe\n\n[[Page S232]]\n\nmilitary and remove the Executive order restrictions that requires our \nintelligence community to follow only the Army Field Manual when \ninterrogating a terrorist. It is in the best interests of the security \nof the United States to do so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3303\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to an \namendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma. Once again, we find \nourselves debating an amendment that at first blush sounds like a good \nthing. But when Members take the time to actually read the amendment \nand understand the programs it impacts, they will discover this \namendment causes harm to our national and international security and to \nour economy.\n  Let me begin by discussing the last section of the amendment, section \n16. Section 16 of the Coburn amendment is based on assumptions that \nreflect a lack of understanding about both what constitutes \ndiscretionary unobligated balances as well as about Federal funding and \noversight for certain critical procurement programs.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma claims that $100 billion would be rescinded \nfrom an estimated $657 billion in unobligated balances. First, this \namendment assumes a rescission amount based on erroneous assumptions. \nSpecifically, the majority of the $657 billion in unobligated balances \nwould not be eligible for rescission under criteria outlined in the \namendment because they are either mandatory funds or they are not older \nthan 2 years.\n  Second, because of the small amount of unobligated funding eligible \nfor rescission, this amendment indiscriminately rescinds prior year \nunobligated funding from certain critical programs, jeopardizing our \nnational defense, our homeland security, our economy, and the well-\nbeing of our citizens.\n  For example, we require the Department of Defense to budget up front \nfor all the costs required to procure military equipment, such as ships \nor aircraft. But I think all of us are aware it takes several years to \ncomplete construction.\n  For shipbuilding specifically, funds provided to the Department of \nDefense are available for obligation for 5 years. Rescinding \nunobligated funds would now require the Navy to cancel contracts for \nships under construction and lay off thousands of workers across the \nNation's shipyards.\n  In terms of our veterans who have returned from war or have fought \nbravely in past wars, section 16 also severely impacts the construction \nof new hospitals by the Veterans' Administration.\n  Like for defense procurement, the VA requests full funding for the \nconstruction project in the first year. As a result, the Veterans' \nAdministration has 43 active major construction projects at various \nstages of completion, totaling over $1.6 billion in unobligated \nbalances. Over 49,000 construction jobs would be terminated with the \nloss of this funding, further delaying critical services to our brave \nmen and women who have served us.\n  Rescinding unobligated balances in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity would stop the construction of the Coast Guard National \nSecurity Cutter and would rescind funding for the purchase of explosive \ndetection systems.\n  Rescinding unobligated balances in NOAA would create a minimum 6-\nmonth gap in coverage for the geostationary weather satellite system, \nwhich focuses directly over the United States, and constantly and \naccurately monitors storm conditions. Over 200 employees would lose \ntheir jobs.\n  The reasoning for the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma is a \ncatch-22 for those of us on the Appropriations Committee with \nresponsibility for overseeing our taxpayers' dollars. We are criticized \nfor having funding that is unobligated for more than 1 year. Well, a \nship is not built in a year, a hospital is not built and equipped in a \nyear, and the next generation satellite is not built in 1 year.\n  The Coburn amendment proposes to rescind an additional $20 billion \nfrom programs he perceives to be redundant. We can go around and around \nabout what is redundant and what is not because one's perception of \nwhat is or is not a duplicative program is based on subjectivity. It is \nthat simple, and this amendment reflects what the Senator from Oklahoma \nalone believes is redundant. But what is clear is that this amendment \nproposes to cut $20 billion in funding that the Congress voted on and \nagreed to provide just months ago.\n  The impact of these cuts has significant consequences for many \ncritical services. For example, the Senator's amendment proposes that \nthe intent is to consolidate duplicative programs serving the homeless. \nHowever, in reality, this language simply calls on the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development to implement a 5-percent reduction across \nthe Department's programs. The bulk of the funding increase recently \nprovided by Congress to HUD covers the increasing cost of providing \naffordable housing to our Nation's low-income citizens. According to \nHUD's Annual Homeless Assessment Report, on any given night there are \nover 650,000 people who are homeless. However, HUD's resources fund \n183,000 beds. During this difficult economic time, it is not the time \nto cut housing for the Nation's poorest individuals.\n  This amendment also takes aim at nursing education programs, claiming \nthey are duplicative, when in fact they are not. While there are \nseveral programs that promote nursing education, each of these programs \naddresses different needs in our Nation's effort to address a profound \nnursing shortage. We have a loan repayment program to get nurses to \nrural areas, a program to incentivize nurses to teach, and a program to \nexpand nurse training in geriatric care.\n  The amendment instructs the Secretary of the Interior to consolidate \nprograms for dealing with the impacts of climate change. The truth is, \neach of the three agencies named by the Senator deal with a different \naspect of climate change, and each brings a special expertise to the \nproblem. They are not duplicative; they are complementary based on \nspecific expertise.\n  For the Department of Energy, the Building Technologies Program is \nnot a grant program to weatherize existing residential and commercial \nbuildings in the same fashion as the weatherization program does for \nresidential homes. There is a difference between a residence and a \nbuilding. It is a research and development program aimed at new \ntechnologies. There is simply not overlap or duplication in these \nprograms.\n  The amendment proposes to rescind funding for the 2010 census. Any \nreduction in funding for the constitutionally mandated 2010 census at \nthis critical time would jeopardize the completion of a timely and \naccurate count, which is necessary, sir.\n  The amendment proposes to cut $2.2 billion from critical Department \nof Homeland Security programs.\n  The attempted destruction last month of Northwest flight 253 near \nDetroit is our most recent reminder that terrorists continue to \nthreaten our homeland and the security of all Americans. This amendment \nwould reduce funding for the purchase of explosive detection equipment \nat the very time the Department of Homeland Security Secretary has \nasked us to address the need for further increases in airport security.\n  In closing, the author of this amendment arbitrarily rescinds funding \nwith no true justification. The rescission of $100 billion from the \n$657 billion in unobligated balances, as we know, would wreak havoc on \nongoing procurement. The rescission of $20 billion is based on the \nclaim of redundancy in programs where no redundancy exists.\n  This is a bad amendment with bad consequences. It is time for Members \nto act responsibly. We have a well-established process for funding the \nFederal Government. It involves a Budget Committee that sets our \nallocations and involves the consideration and approval by the Senate \nof every appropriations bill. It is not passed in the dark of night.\n  I can assure my colleagues in this Chamber that the Appropriations \nCommittee takes its responsibilities seriously, and every agency budget \nis reviewed and oversight is provided throughout the year. Each year, \nthe Appropriations Committee recommends rescissions of funds that are \nnot needed. But those rescissions are based on detailed oversight and \nunderstanding of the programs, not indiscriminate action.\n  This amendment is not based on careful review and would harm many\n\n[[Page S233]]\n\nworthwhile programs, and it fails to meet the test of proper oversight. \nI urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3308\n\n  I will also speak on another amendment. I will speak in opposition to \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions.\n  We are all concerned with the growth of the deficit and the need to \ncontrol the debt of the United States. I support that goal, as I \nimagine all of us in this Chamber support the goal. None of us disputes \nthe ultimate threat to the standard of living of our citizens posed by \nlong-term deficit spending.\n  However, the amendment offered by the Senator from Alabama is not the \nappropriate way to attack the issue, for several reasons. As I \nunderstand the amendment, it would have the effect of freezing any \nincreases in nondefense discretionary spending for the next 5 years.\n  In addition, the amendment would impose caps on emergency spending \nthat could potentially cripple our ability to respond to emergencies, \nsuch as hurricanes, earthquakes, or terrorist attacks.\n  The amendment also contains unrealistic spending caps that would \nrestrict funding needed to support our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Let's start with the facts. For fiscal year 2010, the government \nspent $2.9 trillion, of which about $1.2 trillion was discretionary. \nThe remaining $1.7 trillion we declare as being mandatory. Of the $1.2 \ntrillion that was discretionary, approximately $526 billion, or less \nthan half, was for nondefense purposes. Therefore, this amendment \nattempts to reduce the deficit of the United States by constraining 18 \npercent of total government spending. If the goal is to reduce \ngovernment spending, I am unclear on how constraining growth on just 18 \npercent of that spending will be at all effective.\n  In addition, if we examine the actual numbers involved here, it \nbecomes even clearer that this amendment will simply not achieve its \nstated goal. From fiscal years 2006 to 2009, the Federal debt was \nincreased by approximately $4.4 trillion. During that time, the total \nincrease in nondefense discretionary spending was approximately $93 \nbillion, as compared to $4.4 trillion.\n  Doing the math, for the past 4 years, the increase in nondefense \ndiscretionary spending has accounted for 2 percent of the increase in \nthe national debt--just 2 percent.\n  What do we get for this 2-percent savings? Aside from the obvious \nchallenge of funding vital government programs without even an \nadjustment for inflation, we also put our country and our citizens at \nrisk.\n  Arbitrary spending caps would impede the delivery of resources needed \nto keep Americans safe from terrorist attacks and violent crime. Such \nsubjective across-the-board restrictions would hinder our ability to \nprotect our homeland and secure our borders. As more and more of our \nservice men and women are returning from the battlefield, this measure \nwould restrict our ability to provide our military personnel and \nveterans with the medical care and support they need.\n  These are only a few examples of the damage that would be done to \nvital programs, all for a projected savings of 2 percent.\n  Even more troubling, this amendment would impose a roughly $10 \nbillion annual cap on emergency spending. Emergency spending is, by its \nvery nature and definition, impossible to predict. To deliberately \nimpede the government's ability to respond to natural disaster or major \nterrorist attack I say is deeply irresponsible.\n  Recent history clearly demonstrates the folly of attempting to affix \na set price to future emergencies. More than 4 years later, the gulf \ncoast is still recovering from destruction wrought by Hurricane \nKatrina. Over $100 billion in Federal resources has been needed to \nrespond to this one disaster alone.\n  We have all seen the horrible suffering that has resulted from the \ndevastating earthquake in Haiti. What if a city in California were to \nexperience a similar disaster? This reckless amendment could delay or \nblock the timely delivery of resources needed for an appropriate \nFederal response.\n  The recent Christmas Eve airline bombing attempt serves as a stark \nreminder of the grave threats that continue to face our Nation. In the \nevent of a major terrorist attack on our soil, the Federal Government \nmust not be constrained by an emergency spending cap.\n  Remarkably, this amendment would also restrict funding needed to \nsupport our men and women in uniform fighting overseas. Based on \nearlier budget projections that no longer reflect fiscal reality, this \namendment provides $130 billion for the current fiscal year and $50 \nbillion per year thereafter for ``overseas deployments and other \ncontingencies.'' The President's recent decision to increase troop \nlevels in Afghanistan will almost certainly require additional \nresources from Congress.\n  I find it very difficult to imagine that the Senator from Alabama \ngenuinely believes that $50 billion would suffice to cover the cost of \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  If this amendment were adopted, with defense and overseas caps, in \nstatute, are we expecting Congress to cut defense to pay for these \noperations? That is what this amendment authorizes.\n  Spending restraints that would deny funding needed to support our \ntroops are not fiscally prudent; they are deeply irresponsible.\n  Finally, I remind my colleagues that we already have a 60-vote \nthreshold to overcome budget points of order to appropriations bills. \nAs we all know, 60 votes is not a minor hurdle to overcome. By \nincreasing that threshold to 67 votes, we turn over decisionmaking to a \nsmall portion of the Senate. We should not let those who represent only \none third of this body exercise control over bona fide emergency \nspending.\n  This country must face the challenge of reducing our deficit. We all \nagree to that. But we must do so in a meaningful and effective way. I \ndo not believe this amendment does either.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against the Sessions \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Uganda\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a lot of times attention is drawn to \nterrible things going on around the world. We hear a lot about Sudan, \nand we hear about Zimbabwe, with a president who has taken that country \nfrom the breadbasket of the world to one of the most impoverished \nnations around.\n  But there is one area nobody talks about. I have been trying for \nquite some time to get attention drawn to this area. We have a bill \nthat is introduced by Senator Feingold, myself, and others, which is \ncalled the LRA Disarmament in Northern Uganda Recovery Act. This \nessentially does one thing. It directs the administration to develop a \nresearch strategy to apprehend a guy named Joseph Kony and the top LRA \ncommanders throughout the country and protect the civilians.\n  The reason this is important--and I have been dealing with this issue \nfor 10 years, or perhaps more. I have had occasion to spend time with \nPresident Museveni of Uganda, President Kagame of Rwanda, and President \nKabila of Congo, and others in that area. Twenty-five years ago, Joseph \nKony--he is kind of a spiritual leader in that eastern African area. He \nis a deranged person. He decided to start a thing that some people have \nheard of, called the ``child's military'' or the ``children's army,'' \nwhere he goes out and abducts little kids. For more than 20 years, he \nhas led this Lord's Resistance Army. He has done it primarily in the \narea of northern Uganda.\n  I have been there several times to Gulu, which is the headquarters \narea. Many of the kids who have survived him are up there now in \nhospitals. His way of doing things is to go into villages and abduct \nchildren, young children--I am talking about 11, 12, 13-year-old \nchildren--and teach them to be soldiers, with AK-47s, the whole \nthing. Then they have to go back to their villages and murder their \nparents and all their siblings. If they do not do that, they cut their \nears off and cut their noses off and cut their lips off, as we can see \nin this picture. Here are these young, little guys. That little boy is \nabout 10 years old with an AK-47.\n\n[[Page S234]]\n\n  The tribes in that part of Africa, Hutus and Tutsis, have been \nfighting forever. We are all familiar with the genocide that took place \nin Rwanda and the millions of people who lost their lives and the \ntorturing that went on. The things that have happened are just mind-\nboggling. Yet all the time that was happening, nobody realized what was \ngoing on in that area.\n  Millions of people have fled their homes over time and have been in \ndisplacement camps in the areas I just described. A vast nation in the \nheart of Africa, the DRC--the Democratic Republic of Congo--has strived \nto recover from lengthy civil wars. It goes back to many years ago, \nback when Congo got its independence from King Leopold II. Anyone with \nan interest in Africa at all should read a book. It is called ``King \nLeopold's Ghost.'' When you read this book, you will find out what \nreally happened, what the true story is not just of the Congo but all \nof Africa.\n  This area was in the Congo. The wars started back in 1960 and then \nthe most recent started in 1990. Joseph Kony would go into these areas \nof displaced people and capture the young people. We made an effort, as \nwe tracked him from one area to another just about 6 months ago, to \nGoma--that is a fairly large city in Eastern Congo. That is where he \nwas last seen. He left before we got there. As he went north up toward \nthe Sudan, he mutilated 900 people, most of them young people, on that \nroute.\n  One might ask the question, Why is it these countries are not able to \neradicate this person, to do something about him? The problem is that \nwe have a very fine President in Uganda, President Museveni. Museveni \nused to be a warrior. I think there is a reluctance of the warriors who \nbecome Presidents of African nations to want to say: We cannot handle \nthe security ourselves; we are going to have to depend on other \ncountries, the United States or other countries, to do it for us. He \nhas been somewhat resistant.\n  President Kagame from Rwanda is--I think everyone agrees--one of the \ngreatest leaders in Africa. He is the one, in the genocide of 1994 that \nwiped out most of his population, who was able to go back. As you go \ndown from the airport to the capital area of Rwanda, you would think \nyou are in an American city. In fact, it is much cleaner than many \nAmerican cities. He has been able to bring it back up. He also came \nfrom the bush as a warrior. Again, he is a great person. As I said the \nsame thing about President Museveni, there is a reluctance to admit \nthey cannot handle these problems themselves.\n  President Kabila is President of Congo. Congo used to be called \nZaire. It is a gigantic area. We remember the stories of explorers who \nwent over there and were able to get all the way across the Congo, \ntaking months and months to do so, many of them losing their lives. \nBack when the Congo was having serious problems, President Kabila, Sr., \nwas there. He was actually killed, and his son Joe Kabila took the \nreins of the country. Joe Kabila also has a military background.\n  So we have three Presidents. They respect each other. They are not at \nwar with each other. They all have one thing in common; that is, they \nwant to eradicate this monster called Joseph Kony. They have not been \nable to successfully get that done.\n  What we are doing with this legislation is recognizing, because we \nnever hear anyone talking about it, that there is this serious problem \nthat is taking place. We all want to do things to help people who are \ndowntrodden, but this is one that has been overlooked.\n  Finally, this bill would give everybody throughout the world an \nunderstanding that this is now a U.S. priority and that we are going to \nfinally do something to get rid of this Joseph Kony.\n  It is easy to say that is another part of the world until you get \nover there and see. These are kids from 10 to 12 years old being forced \nto murder people in their own village. They brutally torture these \nchildren and maim them for life. That is what this guy has been doing \nfor 25 years.\n  We have an opportunity to do something. We never had an opportunity \nbefore. We tried to introduce it. This bill is one that is out of the \nForeign Relations Committee now. It is sponsored primarily by Senator \nFeingold. I did not support it at first because it does require about \n$30 million to $35 million. He had it offset by taking money out of the \nAir Force. I did not like that. I think this President is going to go \ndown as the most anti-defense, anti-military President in history. We \npunished the military enough, and I am not going to take any more money \nout of that budget. They agreed to pull that out in committee. The \nmoney should come from USAID, from existing State Department funds. We \ndo not know that yet, but we do know this is going to come to the \nfloor. We want it to come to the floor. There is a hold on it now. In \nfact, the hold is by my junior Senator. I hope we are able to get this \nbill.\n  When we look at how many years something like this has been going on, \nthis unspeakable type of behavior--we don't know of anyplace else in \nthe world. It is a very small price to pay, a small effort to let us \ntake the lead with other nations. I can assure my colleagues that other \nnations will follow. I have given talks in Canada and some of the other \nplaces about the problems we have with Joseph Kony.\n  People say we just need to have somebody come in and say: If you can \nget together the Presidents of these countries of Rwanda, Uganda, \nCongo, Sudan, and the Central African Republic, these five countries, \nthen we will come in if you lead the way. That is what we want to do.\n  There are so many things going on right now. We have people who, when \nwe had the PEPFAR bill--that was a bill to send money to countries, \nprimarily African countries. That bill was on the floor of the Senate. \nIt had been funded previously at $15 billion. Just 6 months ago, that \nbill was down here. They raised it from $15 billion to $50 billion. \nThey raised it $35 billion. That is going to go to Africa with very few \ncontrols on it. We do not know where the money is going to go. This is \nless than one-thousandth of that amount to defend these kids.\n  There is a group I ran into up in Gulu in northern Uganda. It was \nabout 3 years ago. I wish I could remember their names. Young college \nkids recognized this was going on. They went up there with camera crews \nand took pictures. They have been here and rallied the support of \nliterally thousands of college kids who have become familiar with these \natrocities that are taking place. I applaud them for doing it. They \nwonder why we cannot do something.\n  If you can increase your PEPFAR funding for Africa by $35 billion and \nyou don't want to spend one-thousandth of that amount, $35 million, to \nsave those kids--30,000 kids over the years have been mutilated like \nthis--then there is something wrong with this country.\n  We are going to make every effort--Senator Feingold is one of the \nmore liberal Democrats, and I am one of the most conservative \nRepublicans. This crosses all these concepts.\n  I know my time has expired, but I only want to say I want to do \neverything I can to get this legislation through. I am going to ask our \nconservative friends to listen and do something that is right on this \nlegislation. I believe, with the 51 cosponsors we have right now, we \nought to be able to get the bill passed if we can get it to the floor.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, a little over a year ago this country \nstood on the brink of economic disaster. Banks and financial \ninstitutions wavered on the verge of collapse. The foundation of our \neconomy was shaken to its core. But that is when this Congress took \nbold action. In the face of public discontent, many of my colleagues \nsummoned the courage to cast a difficult\n\n[[Page S235]]\n\nvote--a vote that set aside hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up \nour failing financial institutions, a vote that was not popular with \nthe American people but that I feel history will judge as the right \nthing to have done.\n  These are the moments that define us--as individuals, as public \nservants, and as a nation. The American people called upon their \nrepresentatives to make tough choices, to exercise their best judgment, \nand rise to every occasion that may impact the quality of life of the \npeople of this country.\n  I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who lived up to \nthese expectations and made the decision to do what was right, not what \nwas popular. As a result of their courage and their ability to reach \nfor something larger than the small politics of the moment, our \neconomic foundation has been stabilized. That vote brought us back from \nthe brink of disaster and restored confidence in the financial \ninstitutions that threatened to undermine our entire system. It did \nwhat was necessary to prevent a complete economic meltdown.\n  But make no mistake, this emergency legislation did not solve every \nproblem. It was not a cure-all. And as many hard-working Americans will \ntell you, we are not out of the woods yet. There are still miles to go. \nOur country remains on the road to recovery. If we want to continue \ndown this road, this Congress needs to take the next step. So at this \npoint, we must turn our attention to the ordinary Americans who are \nstill suffering. It is time to help Main Street. It is time to take \nbold action to create jobs, help small businesses, and stabilize \ncommunity banks. It is time to shift our focus to the innovators, \nentrepreneurs, and local institutions that drive our economy on a daily \nbasis. In some places, things have already started to turn around and \nwe need to continue that progress, but especially among poor and \nminority communities, these groups are falling further and further \nbehind. As a former banker, I understand the vital roles these \ninstitutions play in local communities and our economy as a whole, and \nI understand the challenges they face in tough times such as these.\n\n  That is why we need to embrace a new economic program which will \nencourage banks to start lending, make capital available for small \nbusinesses, and mitigate the foreclosures. Let's stop shutting down \npeople's homes and putting them out in the streets. If we work together \nto tackle these priorities, we can have regular Americans get back on \ntheir feet without spending another dime on Wall Street.\n  Let us come together right now to send a strong message to Main \nStreet: Help is on the way. The cavalry is coming to help them. We can \ndo this right now. We can do it without passing a new round of \nemergency appropriations. We can do it without increasing the deficit \nor the national debt and without writing another 100-page bill.\n  When the original economic stimulus was passed more than a year ago, \nthis Chamber set aside roughly $700 billion to aid in the recovery \neffort. These efforts have been effective and, as we speak, there is \nstill $320 billion that has not been spent. So rather than begin the \nprocess again, as some have suggested, let us simply change the focus \nof the existing program. Let us draw from the money we have already set \naside to help small businesses, local banks, and ordinary folks. At the \nmoment, we don't have the resources or the time to start over with a \nnew round of stimulus legislation, so let us seize this opportunity to \ndirect funds we have already designated for this purpose.\n  Every Member of this body has seen the devastating effects of the \neconomic crisis in their home States. Everyone in this Chamber knows we \nneed to act with urgency. We can't wait another moment. Thankfully, if \nwe decide to embrace these priorities, there is no reason to wait. We \ncan restore hope and optimism to Main Street, we can help the minority \ncommunities, small businesses, and local banks that are still in grave \nneed of our assistance. We can do this, and I believe we must do it. \nThe resources, the funds are there, and the commitment should be there. \nLet us use those resources now to put them into Main Street and help \nordinary folks. Constituents come up to me all the time wondering: \nWhere is my piece of the stimulus package? Well, it could be in Main \nStreet. It could be in our local banks. So let's do it.\n  I call upon my colleagues to use those dollars that are now in the \nstimulus package to put them into Main Street, into the local banks, \nand start helping the local communities.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3308\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share some thoughts on an \namendment that Senator McCaskill and I offered earlier today. I note \nthat a number of people are anxious to vote and finish up. If and when \nthat time comes, I will be pleased to yield the floor. The amendment we \noffered, which would place statutory caps on spending--and that cap \nlevel that we picked was in our budget. It is what the Senate passed in \nthe budget last year. It represents an increase each year, which is 1 \nto 2 percent annually. This is a budget number basically passed by our \nDemocratic colleagues.\n  So what we are saying is, let's adhere to that. If we adhere to that \nlevel of spending, then we can begin to make progress.\n  A similar type of statutory cap was placed in 1990, renewed in 1997, \nhelped lead us to the only 4 years of budget surpluses in recent \nmemory, from 1998 through 2001. After that, the statutory caps were \nallowed to expire. We find this was something that actually worked to \nhelp us contain excessive spending. This amendment would say that \nnumber that is in the budget for the next 5 years would be firm. We \nwould put it in statutory language, but, of course, it can be exceeded \nby a two-thirds vote of the Senate, and the statute itself can be \nreversed by 60 votes of the Senate. It is not something that \nconstitutionally would be firm over managing our system. It is \nconsistent with previous actions of the Congress. It worked, and I \nbelieve it will work again.\n  It has been contended today, I understand, that these caps would \nimpose limits on emergency spending that could potentially cripple our \nability to respond to emergencies, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and \nterrorist attacks.\n  Well, I just want to say that hurricanes and earthquakes and things \nof that nature have had huge bipartisan votes for emergency spending. \nFor example, after Katrina, there were two supplemental emergency bills \npassed. The first was passed by unanimous consent. Nobody objected to \nit. It was unanimous. The second was passed on a rollcall vote, 97 to \n0. There is no doubt in my mind that if we have a serious emergency, we \nwill have a lot of support for responding to that emergency.\n  Also, one week after September 11, the Senate unanimously passed \nsupplemental appropriations in response to that terrorist attack. So \nthe allegation that somehow this would cripple the ability of Congress \nto respond to emergencies is inaccurate.\n  Second, it was contended earlier today that the amendment contains \nunrealistic spending caps that would restrict funding needed to support \nour forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  That is not accurate. The amendment includes specific provisions that \nprevent the caps from restricting funding for our troops in a time of \nwar. It would not block us from doing that. We are in a time of war. It \njust would not apply in a time of war.\n  We hear it said that everybody is concerned with the growth of the \ndeficit and the need to control debt in the United States, but this \namendment--the McCaskill-Sessions amendment--is not the appropriate way \nto attack this issue.\n  Let me respond to that. For fiscal year 2010, the government spent \n$2.9 trillion, of which about $1.2 trillion was for discretionary \nspending. The remaining $1.7 trillion was mandatory spending. That is \nwhat we call entitlements. That is when you get 65 and you are entitled \nto Medicare, and the government has to pay it whether it has any money \nor not. You are entitled to Social Security payments, and the \ngovernment has to come up with the\n\n[[Page S236]]\n\nmoney. We don't vote on it again. We already voted on Social Security \nto set up how much money you are entitled to get. We have to have that \nmoney. That is why it is called an entitlement.\n  Now entitlements--Medicare and Social Security--exceed the \ndiscretionary account, which includes defense. So of the $1.2 trillion \nthat is in the discretionary account that we actually vote on each \nyear, approximately $526 billion, or a little less than half, is for \nnondefense purposes.\n  This amendment attempts to reduce the deficit by constraining just 18 \npercent of total government spending. It can make a much larger \ndifference than many people realize. Five-year discretionary spending \ncaps were passed--what we are proposing today--in 1990 and 1997 with \nstrong bipartisan support. In 1997, 44 currently serving Senators \nsupported the caps, and 26 of them were Democrats. It made a \ndifference. We balanced the budget in 1998 through 2001--4 years. The \ncurrent majority leader and chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nboth voted, in 1990 and in 1997, for the 5-year caps, which restricted \nannual discretionary spending to approximately 1 to 2 percent \nincreases. That is basically what our legislation would do. It would \ncontain this discretionary spending to 1 to 2 percent.\n  We know we are out of control. We know that last year discretionary \nspending increased by 10 percent, and this year it will increase by 12 \npercent. That is unsustainable. At 7 percent growth, your money will \ndouble in 10 years. At 12 percent growth, the amount of money we would \nbe spending in our discretionary account would double in 6 years--\ndouble. We are on an unsustainable growth here. Some say: Where do you \ncome up with this money, Sessions? This limit of 1 to 2 percent is too \ntough.\n  It is not too tough. It is the budget we voted on. Actually, I didn't \nvote for it, our Democratic colleagues voted for it. It was their \nbudget, and it passed with almost unanimous Democratic support. It \ncalls for a 1- to 2-percent increase in spending over the next 5 years. \nThat is all Senator McCaskill and I are suggesting we should do. We \nwould make that harder to bust, harder to break it. We put in a firmer \ncap. If we stay on that level, and if we have an emergency, we will \nhave to meet it. But if we stay at that level, we could end up \nsurprising ourselves how much good we can do in the years to come.\n  From fiscal year 2006 to 2009, the Federal debt was increased by \napproximately $4.4 trillion. That is a lot. That is almost the total \ndebt of America. We had about $4 trillion in debt in 2006, and we \nadded, in those 3 years, $4.4 trillion. During that time, the total \nincrease in nondefense discretionary spending was approximately $93 \nbillion. This means the increase in nondefense discretionary spending \nhas accounted for 2 percent of the increase in the national debt, our \ncritics say. So it doesn't make much difference, they would say. They \nare correct about the surging debt, but not that this would make no \ndifference. If it made little difference, then why are they worrying \nabout passing it?\n  Restraining discretionary spending, like we did in the nineties, is \nthe bear minimum Congress can do to be fiscally responsible, in my \nview. For fiscal year 2010, nondefense, nonveteran discretionary \nspending increased by 12 percent and in 2009 by 10 percent. Those are \nhuge increases, not including the stimulus package. If we included the \nstimulus package, nondefense discretionary spending has increased 57 \npercent since 2008, in 2 years.\n  That is a stunning number. We actually increased discretionary \nspending by 57 percent in 2 years. The Sessions-McCaskill amendment is \nsimilar to the proposal offered by President Obama or what we are \nhearing he is going to offer--to freeze nondefense discretionary \nspending for 3 years. This would place a cap on excess. If we break \nthrough the President's suggestion and don't freeze and go above that, \nwe hit this cap, and it would take a two-thirds vote to go above that.\n  Apparently, President Obama's suggestion is less spending than this \nbill would cap. But that is fine, we can always do less. The danger, \nfrom my experience, is that we get carried away and do more.\n  Some have said the arbitrary spending caps would impede the delivery \nof resources needed to keep Americans safe from terrorist attacks and \nviolent crime. Such subjective across-the-board restrictions would \nhinder our ability to protect our homeland and secure our borders.\n  Well, it does allow for an increase, first and foremost. Second, our \ncongressional process and appropriations process and authorization \nprocess should have helped us set priorities within that. It would be \nunthinkable if this Congress were to somehow take all that money that \nwe need from areas to keep us safe from attack. Surely, we can make \njudgment decisions about that.\n  Another allegation is that more and more of our service men and women \nare returning from the battlefield, and this would restrict our ability \nto provide them the medical care and support they need.\n  This measure provides all the funding in the 2010 budget resolution. \nIt would allow that. If additional resources are needed to care for our \nreturning service men and women, and that has bipartisan support, and \ncertainly if we need to be able to take care of injured and wounded, we \ncould get 67 votes. We can do like most people do when they have a \nnecessary expense. They trim spending somewhere else and fund the more \nnecessary item.\n  Some have said it would impose a roughly $10 billion annual cap on \nemergency spending. Emergency spending is, by its very nature, \nimpossible to predict. The critics say, to deliberately impede the \ngovernment's ability to respond to a natural disaster or major \nterrorist attack is deeply irresponsible. But that is not what we do. \nIn the legislation we proposed as an amendment, Senator McCaskill and I \nset up a $10 billion a year emergency fund--every year. That would be \nincorporated in the budget resolution, it would be contained in our \namendment, and it would be restricted only by the normal 60-vote \nrequirement on a budget point of order for emergency spending. That \nmoney would not be subject to a higher point of order, and it would not \nchange up to the first $10 billion--which is a lot of money.\n  Alabama's budget, including education, is about $7 billion. So we are \nsetting aside $10 billion for emergency funds every year, and if we \nwent above that, we would have to have a supermajority for the kind of \nemergency that would justify that.\n  I do not think that criticism is valid. Also, some have said that \nrecent history clearly demonstrates the folly of attempting to fix a \nset price for future emergencies.\n  More than 4 years later, the Gulf Coast is still recovering from \nHurricane Katrina. Over $100 billion in Federal resources has been \nneeded to respond to this disaster alone.\n  Our amendment would have no effect on Hurricane Katrina. The fact is, \nas I have said before, we have had virtually unanimous votes supporting \nfunding for Katrina. I do not think that is a valid criticism. If we \nhave an emergency, I am confident this Congress will meet it.\n  The recent Christmas Day airline bombing--I see my friend, Senator \nLeahy. Is he seeking the floor to speak? If so, I will try to wrap up.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am going to speak for just 3 or 4 \nminutes, but I do not want to interrupt my friend from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will wrap up. I do not want to delay the vote. It \nwill be perfectly appropriate for him to make his remarks at this time.\n  But first, I will point out this chart. Why do we need to contain the \nreckless growth in spending? This chart shows how much interest we pay \non the debt. When we passed a stimulus package of almost $800 billion, \nwe did not have that money. Where did we get it? We borrowed it, and we \nhave to pay interest on it.\n  When we have an emergency, such as Hurricane Katrina--by definition, \nan emergency is an expenditure for which we do not have the money and \nit is above our budget. Our budget puts us in deficit. Emergency \nspending is always deficit funded, funded with borrowed money.\n  In 2009, the interest we paid on our debt was $200 billion. That is \nthe public debt. We have more debt than that. We have internal debt. \nUnder the 10-year proposal President Obama gave us early last year, the \nCongressional\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\nBudget Office concludes that our deficits will surge and that in 10 \nyears, the interest for 1 year would be $799 billion. That is why \neverybody says we are on an unsustainable path. How do we get off it? \nBasically, we have to contain our spending. We cannot have $800 billion \nstimulus packages every year or two. We cannot have spending increases \nof 10 percent and 12 percent in basic discretionary accounts.\n  If we start taking firm action now, this will not happen. The debt \ntends to compound. Our deficits tend to compound. They go into the \nbaseline, and then we have an increase over that the next year and the \nnext year, and it compounds a lot more than some of our Members \nrealize. That is why we are getting into the area that threatens the \nvery financial viability of this Nation, as Mr. Greenspan said in \nDecember with a statement so strong about the danger we face that it \nwould curl your hair.\n  That is why Senator McCaskill and I think we need to take some \naction. This is a proven way to do so with statutory caps. I encourage \nmy colleagues to see it for what it is: a bipartisan attempt to be sure \nwe do not rise above the budgetary caps that are in our budget. This \namendment would make it hard to go above those levels in our spending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend from Alabama for \nyielding time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3303\n\n  Among the $120 billion in funding cuts that would be required by the \nCoburn amendment is a $1.3 billion rescission from the State \nDepartment. Section 13 of the amendment specifically directs the \nSecretary of State to eliminate two programs--the East-West Center and \nthe Asia Foundation--saying this would produce savings.\n  Even if it made sense to eliminate these programs which have a long \nhistory of achievement for our Nation and strong bipartisan, bicameral \nsupport, to do so would produce savings of only $42 million--a long way \nfrom the $120 billion about which he spoke. The Senator's amendment \ndoes not say where the balance of the $1.3 billion cut would come from.\n  The Senator's Web site mentions two other small programs within the \nState and Foreign Operations budget that he believes should be cut \nwhich total $25 million, and $20 million of that, incidentally, is for \nthe Tropical Forest Conservation Act, something that gets us praise \naround the world and actually protects the well-being of everybody in \nthis country. It has long been supported by the senior Republican on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee.\n  The explanation of the Senator from Oklahoma for eliminating these \nfunds is that other nations should be responsible for the conservation \nof their own tropical forests. Would that it were so. But when they get \ncut down, they affect those of us in Vermont, Colorado, Oklahoma, or \nanywhere else. In fact, it is like saying to other nations, no matter \nhow impoverished--for example, Haiti--that they should take care of \ntheir own health needs. That ignores the fact that deadly viruses, such \nas HIV and TB, are as oblivious to national boundaries as are carbon \nemissions from the destruction of tropical forests. It is a \nshortsighted and unworkable approach to global problems that affect the \nAmerican people directly.\n  In defense of his proposal to rescind $1.3 billion from the State \nDepartment, Senator Coburn cites more than $13 billion in funding for \nIraq reconstruction that has been wasted, stolen, or lost. I see my \ngood friend from Oklahoma on the floor. I say in that regard, there is \nno doubt there was deplorable waste, fraud, and abuse of U.S. taxpayer \nfunds by contractors, such as Halliburton, that received no-bid, \nsweetheart contracts under the last Republican administration. It was \nprobably the most poorly implemented nation-building program in \nhistory. At that time, the Republican Congress rubber-stamped those \nfunds that were wasted--probably not wasted if you were a shareholder \nof Halliburton; you thought it was a good idea because they walked off \nwith so much of it. The White House even opposed efforts by some of us, \nincluding Republicans, to create the Office of the Special Inspector \nGeneral for Iraq Reconstruction that discovered the misuse of funds.\n  I also remind everybody that it was the Republican Congress, with a \nRepublican President, that inherited the largest surplus in America's \nhistory, created by a Democratic administration, that of President \nClinton's, that left a surplus that was paying down the national debt, \nleft a huge surplus to the incoming Republican President. The \nRepublican Congress not only voted to use that surplus to pay for an \nunnecessary war in Iraq but even cut taxes when we were fighting what \nended up being two wars. It is the only time in our Nation's history we \nhave done that--spend the surplus, cut taxes, and somehow these wars \nthat have been going on now for 8 years would pay for themselves.\n  I think to use the last Republican administration's waste of taxpayer \ndollars in Iraq as a rationale to rescind funds today that have \nbipartisan support for the security of our embassies and our diplomats \noverseas and for programs in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, the Middle \nEast, Indonesia, Mexico, Central Asia, Israel, and Egypt, where the \nthreats to U.S. national security interests are beyond dispute, would \nbe foolhardy.\n  Every one of us should agree that not every Federal program deserves \nto be funded and certainly not because it was funded in the past. I \nhave voted to cut programs in the Appropriations Committee and on this \nfloor because they have gone beyond their useful life span or were \nineffective. Some programs are effective. Those that are not should be \neliminated.\n\n  But the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, \nwith leadership between myself and the senior Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg--we spent the better part of last year making \ndifficult choices of what to fund and what to cut. The Appropriations \nCommittee approved those choices, Republicans and Democrats, all 29 \nmembers, with one dissenting vote, and that was on another issue \ninvolving abortion. This amendment would cut funding to combat HIV, TB. \nCountries receive help from us, from Colombia, to Israel, to Egypt, to \nMexico. The Senator from Oklahoma, with one strike of the pen, would \narbitrarily slash 5 percent of that funding. Should we look for places \nwhere we can save money, where programs are not meeting their goals? Of \ncourse. But to do it this way, willy-nilly, picking a percentage out of \nthe air with no concern for the consequences, does not protect the \nsecurity of the American people.\n  There is another section of the amendment about which I would like to \nspeak. Section 5 of the amendment directs the Secretary of Education to \nwork with the Secretaries of other relevant agencies to consolidate and \nreduce the cost of administering the student foreign exchange and \ninternational education programs. These exchanges are some of the most \nstrongly supported programs by both Democrats and Republicans in the \nforeign aid budget.\n  This amendment takes aim at the Benjamin Gilman International \nScholarship Program, as well as several Department of Education \ninternational education and research programs, some of which are \nadministered by the State Department, and a National Science Foundation \nprogram.\n  The Benjamin Gilman Program, created by Congress, provides \nscholarships to American undergraduates to study abroad, including \nstudents in nontraditional destinations, or to study critical \nlanguages, such as Arabic, Persian, and Chinese. Our military, and our \nintelligence agencies, say there is an unmet need for Americans who can \nspeak these languages. Senator Coburn would cut funding for it.\n  The Department of Education's Foreign Language and Area Studies \nFellowship Program provides funding for foreign language study at U.S. \nuniversities, and several of these programs focus on strengthening \nstudy in international business and education, at a time when we are \nbecoming more and more aware we cannot compete just within our borders. \nOur businesses have to be able to compete with other countries around \nthe world or we lose jobs in America. We should be strengthening our \nstudy of international business and education, not cutting these \nprograms.\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\n  The amendment would cut other successful exchanges, such as the \nFulbright-Hayes programs for teachers, high school students, graduate \nstudents, and business professionals. These exchanges bring foreigners \nwith a range of economic, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds to the \nUnited States and they send Americans overseas. At a time when America \nshould be reaching out around the world for our security, for our \nbusinesses, we should not be cutting these programs which have been \nwoefully underfunded as both Republicans and Democrats have pointed \nout.\n  The Institute for International Education is one example of an \norganization that effectively administers these programs. It provides \ncitizens of other countries with a chance to learn firsthand about \nAmerican culture, our values, our government, and our way of life. \nThese are among the most effective ways of countering the \nmisrepresentation and false stereotypes about the United States that we \nsee perpetrated by extremists. Some of these programs and their \npredecessors I saw during the Cold War period. I remember one of the \nearly meetings I had, along with several others, with President Ronald \nReagan. He had spoken about the evil empire, and he said: What would \nyou suggest we do? Of the suggestions that several of us made, I said \nthis: Why don't you visit the Soviet Union and invite their leader to \ncome to the United States next year and visit here?\n\n  He said: Why?\n  I said: Because you really don't know much about them. I pressed him \na little on that, but he heard me out, and I said: But they do not know \nmuch about you either, and it would force them to learn about you and \nyour staff, and it would force us to learn about them and their staff.\n  Later, in his second term, President Reagan told me that was some of \nthe best advice he ever got. We know how triumphant his visit was to \nthe Soviet Union and how triumphant it was when Mr. Gorbachev came \nhere, and the two of them learned about each other and worked together \nto lower the threat of nuclear war.\n  That is just one example.\n  Mr. COBURN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. No problem there.\n  Is the Senator aware that the foreign ops appropriation increased by \n11 percent in 2009 and 33 percent last year? Yet the Senator is saying \nwe can't trim 5 percent from that budget? Am I hearing the Senator \ncorrectly? We increased it 46 percent in 2 years, and we can't cut 5 \npercent?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would tell the Senator from Oklahoma that if you look \nover the last 10 years, there have been significant shortfalls in many \nof these programs, and in personnel. The increases began first at the \nrequest of former President George W. Bush, and then followed by \nPresident Obama because they realized the need for us to have these \nprograms for our own security.\n  My response would be: Where do we make cuts? Your amendment does not \nsay. Do we start with individual countries--Israel, Egypt, and so on? \nDo we start with programs to combat HIV, or malaria, or programs to \neliminate childhood diseases in Africa? These exchanges enable \nAmericans and foreigners to conduct scientific research to increase \nunderstanding and cooperation.\n  Rather than cut funding, Senators on both sides of the aisle have \nconsistently urged the Appropriations Committee to increase funding to \nexpand our efforts to promote better understanding of the United \nStates. If we had funded all the requests for increases, it would be \nconsiderably more than it was. Senator Gregg and I stayed within our \nallocation. Also, I think it was the only appropriations subcommittee \nthat reported a bill with no earmarks.\n  If there are ways of consolidating to reduce some administrative \ncosts without harming the effectiveness or reducing opportunities to \nparticipate in these exchange programs, I am for it. But rather than by \namendment to the debt ceiling bill, rather than giving carte blanche to \nthe administration--or any administration--let's consider this in the \nnormal appropriations process in a deliberative way.\n  Mr. President, we actually work hard on these bills. We make \ndifficult choices. Some things get funded, others do not. We vote up or \ndown. We have to stay within our budget, and we did, and we did it \nwithout earmarks. So I believe the amendment should be rejected.\n  It sounds nice we should just eliminate $2 billion in waste. Who \nwould not want that? Let us be specific. Let us make the hard choices \nand say where the cuts are going to come from. The Senator's amendment \ndoes not do that. I recall a Republican President who gave great \nspeeches about a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and \nthen during his administration tripled the national debt. I have heard \ngreat speeches by people who have voted to cut taxes during two wars, \nby people who instead of using the surplus left by the last Democratic \nPresident squandered it in a year's time.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished majority leader on the Senate \nfloor, so I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator from Vermont, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the \nCoburn amendment, No. 3303, to be divided into four divisions, as \nfollows, and modified to strike sections 17 and 18: section 1, division \nI; section 2, division II; sections 3 to 5, division III; and section \n16, division IV; further, that once the Republican leader or his \ndesignee has offered his amendment, a copy of which is at the desk, no \nfurther amendments or motions be in order; that Senator Coburn be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes; that upon the use or yielding back of \nthat time, the Senate proceed to vote with respect to the following \namendments in the following order; and that prior to each vote, there \nbe 6 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform--that is, there be 3 minutes on each side: Coburn division I, \nCoburn division II, Coburn division III, Coburn division IV; that on \nThursday, January 28, after any leader time, the Senate then resume \nconsideration of H.J. Res. 45; that no further debate be in order \nexcept as provided for in this agreement; that prior to each of the \nfollowing votes with respect to H.J. Res. 45, there be 4 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided and controlled in the usual form: Brownback \namendment regarding commissions, which is at the desk; Sessions-\nMcCaskill amendment No. 3308; Reid amendment No. 3305; Baucus, for \nReid, substitute amendment No. 3299; passage, H.J. Res. 45; further, \nthat the cloture motions filed with respect to H.J. Res. 45 be \nwithdrawn; with the vote threshold requirement still in effect as \nprovided in the order of December 22, and that the Baucus amendment No. \n3306 be withdrawn; further, that upon disposition of H.J. Res. 45, the \nSenate then proceed to executive session, and there be 60 minutes of \ndebate prior to the cloture vote on Executive Calendar No. 641, the \nnomination of Ben Bernanke to be Chairman of the Board of Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve System, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between the leaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to modify my consent request. I said \nsections 3 to 5, but it is sections 3 to 15 be division III.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, but I want to convey my appreciation to the leader and his \nstaff for allowing division in the four areas on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3303), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n       TITLE __--ELIMINATION OF DUPLICATIVE AND WASTEFUL SPENDING\n\n     SEC. 1.

The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we just heard the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, who is also chairman of the appropriations \nsubcommittee, give the typical Washington talk on why we can't cut \nspending. In light of the fact there has been a 45-percent increase in \nhis area of appropriations, we now can't come back and give 5 percent \nof that back to the American people.\n  Forty-five percent growth in 2 years, and we are picking winners and \nlosers? We are not picking winners. The only winners we are picking are \nthe American people.\n  The fact is, there hasn't been a major program eliminated by the \nappropriations subcommittee in 5 years. What they do is, once they are \nthere, they are there forever, and nobody is willing to make the hard \nchoices. That is typical of all the talk we will hear about why we \ncan't cut $120 billion from the expenditures for this year--$120 \nbillion out of $3.4 trillion, and we can't come up with 5 percent. We \ncan't find it.\n  We are giving you a way to do that. Everybody is going to get to \nvote, and we are going to send a message to the American people. At the \nrate we are growing the government, it will double in the next 5 years, \nand we can't find 5 percent, when they are having to make 10, 15, 20, \nand 25 percent cuts in their own budgets.\n  What we heard was the typical appropriations response: We work hard, \nlet's save this for appropriations. The problem is it never happens \nbecause every bill, somewhere, has a small constituency--every program. \nWe listed 640 programs that have duplication, redundancy, and \ninefficiency. Yet we hear an appropriations subcommittee chairman say: \nOh, no, we can't.\n  Well, the American people don't get that. We ought to be about \ntrimming the waste out of this government, and at a conservative \nestimate there is at least $387 billion in waste, fraud, or duplication \nthis year.\n  So we have the tremendous opportunity to come down here and deny the \ntruth the American people know: This government is wasteful, it is not \nefficient, and most of the time it is not effective. When we try to \nmake a commonsense, small cut after a tremendous growth over the last 2 \nyears, we hear: No, we can't. No, we can't. We hear a sob story. We \ncan't do it.\n  The fact is, we don't have a future unless we start cutting spending. \nThe President even asked his staff to give him an option on the budget \nof a 5-percent across-the-board cut. We will hear tomorrow night about \nfreezing discretionary spending. It is easy to freeze discretionary \nspending. We have just jumped it 27 percent across the board. But the \nfreezing doesn't start until 2011. We are not going to freeze it until \n2011. Our problem is today. The problem that our children are going to \nface is being manifested and made significantly harder because we are \nfearful to make commonsense cuts.\n  Mr. President, $100 billion out of this $120 billion comes from $660 \nbillion that is sitting in agencies that haven't expended it over the \nlast 2 years--the $660-some billion. We are saying, of those that \nhaven't been spent, that hasn't been rolled out over the last 2 years, \nsend $100 billion back. It is easy. We are spending money so fast that \nthe agencies can't even get it out the door. When they do get it out \nthe door, it is ineffective and highly inefficient and loaded with \nfraud.\n  Why in the world would we reject making commonsense efforts just like \neverybody else in this country is having to make today? Why would we \nput in the perspective: Oh, we can't do these little things, from the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee, when in fact our country is drowning \nin debt and the future for our children is in doubt? We cry crocodile \ntears over some little program somewhere that in the whole realm of \nthings is either duplicated or highly ineffective. We want to keep \nevery last one of them.\n  We just heard the chairman of the foreign ops subcommittee say we \ncan't do any of this. They are way too valuable; we can't do it.\n  Well, what is more valuable, taking care of the next generation, \nembracing our heritage of sacrifice to create opportunity or satisfying \na small interest group that is dependent on a government program that \nis both ineffective and inefficient and also has three or four other \nprograms that do exactly the same thing?\n  The first component that we are going to vote on is a mandatory \nrequest of the GAO to tell us the duplication; tell us across agency \nlines where we are failing. What do we need to know? Nobody can tell us \nthat today. When we asked the GAO--personally asked the GAO--they said \nthe task is too big. Well, that ought to be our first signal that \nsomething is really wrong, when the Government Accounting Agency says \nthe government is so big and convoluted that they can't tell us where \nwe have duplication. They cannot give us recommendations on what to \neliminate.\n\n  That ought to be our first signal to say time out, stop, cut some \nspending and let's see who squeals, and we will put back if we have \nmade a mistake.\n  The American people understand, more than we do, what is at risk in \nthe future. They want a secure future. They want the ability to plan \nfor their children and their grandchildren. They do not want a fiat \ncurrency, which is what is coming if we do not rein in spending.\n  Most of my colleagues know that is the problem before us. The \nquestion is, will we have the courage to go after it. It would be \ndifferent had we not had significant increases over the last 4 or 5 \nyears in this country, in terms of the budget of the Federal \nGovernment. But it has doubled. We are going to have an increase in the \ndebt limit for 1 year that is $200 billion more than the entire \ngovernment spent in 1999. In 10 years we are going to borrow $200 \nbillion more than we spent--just to operate 1 year--than we spent in \nthe entire budget in fiscal year 1999. Of every penny we spend this \nnext year, 44 cents of it is going to be borrowed--$4.4 billion a day.\n  What this amendment says is let's not make that so. It does not have \nto be so. Let's cut it to $3 billion or $3.3 billion of that. Let's \nsave the future for our children.\n  I am reminded that hard things are hard. Habits are hard to break. \nThe habit of Washington is to never have to make a hard choice. We \nheard a stellar representation by the Senator from Vermont about why \nthings cannot change here--because everybody has a special little \nproject, they want to protect. While they are protecting their special \nlittle project, they are forgetting about the country as a whole. That \nshould not be the legacy we want to embrace. The legacy we ought to \nembrace is that we had the courage to make the hard, tough decisions at \na time when it was called for. Now is that time. It is not 2011, it is \nnot next month, it is not when the appropriations bills come, it is \nnow.\n  Just think what would happen to the dollar tomorrow if the Senate \ncuts $120 billion of discretionary spending that is wasteful and \nduplicated and is not going to make a difference in nary an American \nlife. The signal it will send to the world is we are back on track. The \nvalue of the dollar will rise, the cost of oil will go down, the \nstandard of living of consumers will go up, and every family this year \nwill benefit to the tune of $794, if we agree to this amendment.\n  I think the citizens of America are worth that. I know their children \nand grandchildren are worth it. The question is, will we curry up the \ncourage? Will we meet the challenge that faces this country or will we \ncontinue the status quo because we have always done it this way? Doing \nit this way is exactly what put us $12.4 trillion in debt; by this time \nnext year $14.2 trillion in debt. It is mortgaging and stealing the \nfuture of our children.\n  I look forward to seeing the outcome of the votes, and I know the \nAmerican people do. This is the first time in a long time we have had a \ntrue vote on the floor to make a difference in what is going to happen \nin the finances of this country. My hope is we will not disappoint, \nagain, the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma \nthat there is waste within government, that there is duplication or \noverlap of programs across some government agencies, and that the \namount of spending approved for fiscal year 2010 was higher than it \nshould have been given our Nation's fiscal situation. That is part of \nthe reason why I opposed the fiscal year 2010 budget resolution.\n  But, I am not enamored of the approach that Senator Coburn has taken\n\n[[Page S242]]\n\nin this amendment. It is an abdication of our constitutional duties as \nelected Members of Congress to cede such vast decisionmaking power to \nthe executive branch. If there is $120 billion to be cut from the \nbudget, we should identify those cuts and vote on them. We should not \nlet the President, a commission, or some other entity make those \ndecisions for us.\n  Throughout the past year the Senator from Oklahoma and other Members \noffered amendments to cut spending from the budget resolution, \nappropriations bills, and other measures. Some of these amendments were \nadopted and some were not. I supported some of the amendments and \nopposed others. In each case, however, Senators knew what they were \nvoting on and had some idea what the effect of the amendment would be. \nWith this amendment we have no idea what its effect will be. The \nsponsor of the amendment says the impacts will be negligible but offers \nvirtually no specifics. Perhaps he is correct. It is also possible that \nthe President--whose priorities in many respects differ significantly \nfrom most Senators on my side of the aisle--will take the reductions \nmandated by this amendment from programs that my colleagues and I feel \nto be high priorities. It is possible that the President will fail to \ntake the reductions from those programs we feel are most duplicative or \nwasteful.\n  We will likely never know the answers to these questions. This \namendment will not be enacted. I agree that Federal spending must be \nconstrained. As we go forward, however, I hope the Senate will take a \nmore transparent approach to deficit reduction so that Senators, \nconsistent with their constitutional responsibilities, can make \ninformed decisions about the operations of the Federal Government.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN.

There will now be 6 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, on Coburn division No. II. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this amendment rescinds our increase for \nour operations. We increased our budget 5.8 percent at a time when \nthere was no inflation last year, zero. The year before that, we had \nincreased our budget in excess of 10.9 percent, which means we \neffectively increased our own budgets to run our own operations 17 \npercent in the last 2 years, with less than 1 percent inflation over \nthat period. If, in fact, we can't lead by example to cut our own \nbudgets to help the country move out of the problem it is having, it is \nprobably because we are not very good managers of our own budgets, \nwhich belies the problem we now face. I appreciate support on this \namendment. The American people would sincerely appreciate support on \nthis amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the amendment being offered by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma affects the legislative branch. It is true it affects \nMembers of Congress in their offices, but it affects much more. We just \nhad an overwhelming vote to give new responsibilities to the Government \nAccountability Office. The next amendment up calls for cutting their \nbudget. I would say to the Senator from Oklahoma, you can't have it \nboth ways. You give new responsibilities to these agencies and then \nsay: We will give you less money to do it.\n  Let me suggest something else. When you start to leave this evening \nto go home and you drive by the gate out here and you see, in the dark, \nmen and women in uniform risking their lives for us and for the \nvisitors to the Capitol, remember this vote. This vote cuts funds for \nthe Capitol Police and security in the Capitol. When the Senator from \nOklahoma was asked earlier, are you asking for too much in cuts, he \nsaid: I want to keep cutting until they squeal. What will be the squeal \nwe hear when it comes to security from the Capitol? I am sorry to say \nit might be an incident that none of us wants to see.\n  We want this to be a safe place. The Capitol Visitor Center has more \nand more people coming in. Cutting security for the Capitol at this \npoint in time with the threats facing our Nation and the fact that we \nwork in one of the biggest targets in America is very shortsighted. \nThat is what happens when you cut across the board and you don't take a \nlook at the individual agencies involved. Please, for the security of \nthe Capitol and for the security of the people who visit it, vote no on \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is remarkable what length we will go to \ndefend our budgets. The fact is, the assumption Senator Durbin made is \nthat we are efficient. The fact is, we are not. Everybody in here could \nturn back at least 10 percent of their budget if they ran their office \nefficiently. We know that. Nothing in Washington is run efficiently. So \nto say we can't do it without putting ourselves at risk is poppycock. \nIt is time for us to lead. Now is the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. One thing I forgot to mention. Members of Congress \nvoluntarily forgo every cost-of-living adjustment each year. We decided \nnot to ask for a cost-of-living adjustment because we are in hard \ntimes. To suggest that sacrifices are not being made is not accurate. I \nurge my colleagues, vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the Coburn Amendment, Division \nNo. II.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S243]]\n\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, we are going to hear why we cannot do \nthis, kind of along with the debate we just heard from the majority \nwhip. But here are some examples for you. This is what the GAO found.\n  In 2005, 13 different Federal agencies spent $3 billion to fund 207 \nprograms to encourage students to enter the field of math and science. \nMr. President, 207 different programs, and we are going to vote against \neliminating them here in just a minute.\n  In 2003, $30 billion was spent on 44 job-training programs \nadministered by 9 different Federal agencies. Fourteen departments \nwithin the Federal Government, 49 independent agencies operate exchange \nand study abroad programs. So 14 departments, 49 independent agencies \noperate exchange and study abroad programs; 69 early education programs \nadministered by 9 different agencies; 23 Federal housing programs that \ntarget or have special features for the elderly operated by 6 different \nagencies.\n  That is just a minimal number.\n  We are going to hear why we cannot do this. The American people are \nwanting to know when we are going to do what is right, what is \npossible, and what is best for the long term, not the short term.\n  With that, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma proposes to cut \n$20 billion from programs which he describes as being redundant. Well, \ntake, for example, nursing. There are three different programs. They \nare not redundant. One is for education; another is to train women and \nmen to go to rural areas, rural America, to serve; and the third is for \nresearch. Yes, three different agencies handle that. It is for three \ndifferent purposes.\n  Then you have HUD. One of the sad facts of life is that tonight \n658,000 American men, women, and children are going to go to bed \nhomeless, some of them with empty stomachs, some without blankets, and \nwe are going to cut 5 percent from housing for the homeless? This \namendment does that.\n  Then you have cuts for foreign operations. Senator Leahy spent some \ntime this afternoon explaining why this is foolish. We had an \naccounting change because now we cover State Department activities in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  I think it is ill-advised to do what the Senator proposes because \nthese are not redundant. These are not wasteful. I think we could be \nspending more for the homeless, but yet we are cutting this by this \namendment. I hope we reject this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what the American people are asking is, \nWhy aren't the three nursing programs combined so you have one set of \noverhead to administer all three programs? That is what they are \nasking. This does not cut any money for the homeless. What it says is, \nput all the homeless programs under one set of administration where we \nsave money and are much more effective at what we are doing because we \nare concentrating it within one area. We can have all sorts of reasons \nwhy we cannot do it. Let's find the courage to do it for the American \npeople and the kids who follow.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the Coburn amendment, Division \nIII.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last year Federal agencies ended the \nfiscal year with $657 billion in unobligated balances. There is no \nquestion a great deal of that is associated with the war efforts and \nother things, but according\n\n[[Page S244]]\n\nto OMB and CBO, approximately $100 billion of that has been sitting for \n2 years or longer, never having been obligated for what we have \ndirected it to. So we have $100 billion sitting out there that the \nagencies have not been able to spend. Obviously, if they haven't been \nable to spend it in the last 2 years, it is not a priority. If, in \nfact, we rescind that money to the Treasury, we will cut our deficit \n$100 billion, and then we can reappropriate what is necessary for this \nyear. The rule in the Federal Government is after 2 years it is \nsupposed to go back to the Treasury anyway, which is not being enforced \nfor everybody except the Treasury Department. They are under that \nobligation.\n  So here is an opportunity--it doesn't affect anything because the \nmoney hasn't been obligated--to put it back in and start over and \nreprioritize. That is all it is about. It will actually move $100 \nbillion back and then our appropriators can decide whether they want to \nput that back this year.\n  I appreciate your consideration on this amendment, and I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this is a very serious amendment. \nPotentially it could be damaging. It says, very simply, if the funds \nare not obligated for 2 years, then it is rescinded. It sounds \nreasonable, but I think it is no secret it takes longer than 2 years to \nbuild a battleship. It takes more than 2 years to build an aircraft \ncarrier. It takes more than 2 years to build a hospital. Right now, \nthere are 43 VA hospitals being built. Are we going to cut them out? \nWhat about the shipbuilding industry? Are we going to rescind that?\n  This amendment has potentially very dangerous consequences. I hope my \ncolleagues will vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the dangerous consequences facing this \nNation aren't as outlined by the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. The dangerous consequences facing this Nation are continued \nspending and borrowing from the next generation and a creditworthiness \nthat is not going to even be BBB. There is no question there is danger \nbefore us. It is not this amendment. It is the continuing efforts on \nthe part of those who are in Washington to not recognize the fact that \nwe are wasting money hand over fist and, in fact, we appropriate yearly \non many of these projects. So it will not eliminate any as outlined by \nthe chairman. It will give us a chance to reprioritize, which every \nfamily in America is doing today.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is such a \nsecond.\n  All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Coburn amendment, Division IV.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I think under a previous agreement I was to call up an \namendment. I ask that my amendment be callled up, No. 3309, which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendments are set aside and the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3309 to amendment No. 3299.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the \nfollowing members as cosponsors to the amendment: Senators Chambliss, \nEnsign, and Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as I understand, there are no further \nvotes this evening, and there will not be votes tomorrow. We will have \nthis up Thursday, and we will debate it then and vote on it. I will put \nin somewhat of a statement tonight and then talk about it further on \nThursday.\n  This is a commission that has been in front of this body several \ntimes. We voted on it. It passed this body twice before in the budget \ndebates. It is CARFA, the Commission on the Accountability and Review \nof Federal Agencies.\n  It is modeled exactly after the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission, the BRAC, that has been so successful on closing military \nbases and consolidating assets and put the military in a better \nposition. This is the same thing. It is to all of government. It has \nbeen voted on by this body twice before. It has passed this body. It is \ndone in the budget agreement. It is time it became the law of the land.\n  That is the process whereby we can actually cut government spending. \nIt is a simple process--eight members on the Commission, four appointed \nby this body, four appointed by the House. For any recommendation to \nmove forward, it has to pass by six of eight members, so either party \ncannot dominate or determine it. It has to be six of eight. It will \ntake one-fourth of the government each year for 4 years and review that \nfourth of the Federal Government and make recommendations for closure \nduring that year's period of time.\n  The report for that year then is submitted to the appropriate \ncommittees of jurisdiction for a period of 30 days. They can review the \nreport. They can hold hearings on the CARFA commission recommendations \nfor a period of 30 days. They can look it over and see which ones they \nlike, which ones they do not like, but they cannot amend it.\n  At the end of that 30 days, it is then subject to a privileged motion \nto come in front of this body so it has to be voted on by this body \nwith a limit of 10 hours of debate prior to going to the motion, 10 \nhours of debate on the bill itself. It cannot be amended. Then it is an \nup-or-down vote, with a 50-vote threshold of passage. It is a \nprivileged motion that comes in front of this body, with a majority \nvote for it to pass through this body.\n  This is the way we will get spending under control and done. This is \nan agreeable way. It is a way that has proven itself in the past. Now \nis the time we have to do this.\n  I wish to show one chart that is new out today. It is no new news, \nunfortunately. This one is new out today. This\n\n[[Page S245]]\n\nis the projection of our Federal debt as a percentage of GDP. That is \nthe one to watch, the projection of the Federal debt as a percentage of \nGDP.\n  We can see what the January 2008 estimate of the Federal debt as a \npercentage of our economy was supposed to be. Here is the percent of \nthe economy. We are pushing up 38 percent or so at this point in time. \nIn January 2008, this starts bending back down and moves to 20 percent \nby 2020. Then we had the January 2009 estimate come in. We see there we \nwere getting up to mid-50 percent, and then it was going to bow back \ndown to 41 percent. That was last year's 2009 estimate.\n  This year, just out today--this is the estimate--2010 as a percent of \nthe economy, we are looking at our Federal debt as being midsixties, 67 \npercent, and staying at that level for the debt as a percentage of the \neconomy. These are terrible numbers. They are way too high. They are \nstifling the economy. It is a nonsustainable position, and it is \nsomething we have to fix.\n  Earlier today, we considered a commission that had both spending and \ntaxes in it. The American public is not for more taxes. They think they \nare taxed out, and I believe they are too taxed. They should not be \ntaxed more. They do want us to cut spending. There is no question about \nthat. They want us to cut it prudently. They want us to cut in \nwasteful, duplicative areas. That is what they want to get at. They \nwant core programs clearly taken care of. That is why we put it to a \nbipartisan commission of individuals to look at. The recommendation has \nto clear six of eight members so no party can control--four appointed \nby Republicans, four appointed by Democrats--examined by the committees \nand then put forward for a vote. This can work. This is what the public \nwants us to do. It is time to do it.\n  We have to start bending this down, the debt to GDP. This is \ndangerously high. It has not been this high since World War II. We \ncannot sustain it. We have to pull it back down. I would love us to \nstart to cut spending and go through the committees and say we are \ngoing to cut here, we are going to cut there. We have not been able to \ndo that under Republican or Democratic control of either branch of \ngovernment. We have not been able to go at that on an individual basis.\n  This is a system that has worked in the past. This is a system that \nthis body has approved in the past. It has been in budget agreements. \nWe have not made it all the way through in the budget agreement, but \nMembers in this body have voted on this system for controlling \nspending.\n  If people want to come back later and say: We want to look at other \nprovisions or we want to add something back, they can do that in future \nconferences. But this gets that culling process going.\n  I wish to point out one issue to my colleagues about the problem of \nrunning high debt and its impact on the economy. If the Federal \nGovernment runs a high debt level, it has a drag on the economy. There \nis a recent study just released at an American Economics Association \nmeeting. The title of the study is ``Growth in a Time of Debt.'' It \nsaid, according to the study, that the sharp runup in public sector \ndebt will likely prove one of the endearing legacies of the 2009 \nfinancial crisis in the United States and elsewhere. The study looked \nat debt levels of 44 countries and included data over the last 200 \nyears in order to get the most comprehensive picture possible, the \npicture of debt on economic growth.\n  What does this big lug do to the overall economy? Does it have an \nimpact? They said, clearly, yes.\n  The conclusion is clear: Very high government debt, classified as 90 \npercent or more of gross domestic product, results in average growth \nrates a full 4 percent below countries with lower debt levels. Since \nannual growth rate and GDP is averaged considerably less than 4 percent \nover the last 10 years in the United States, carrying high national \ndebt can mean the difference between a growing economy and a \ncontracting economy.\n  After the recent binge of Federal spending, our Nation's gross debt \ncould well surpass the 90 percent of GDP mark and go even above that, \nto the point that could be the lug on the economy that keeps us from \ngrowing and actually puts us in a contracting economy.\n  I urge my colleagues or members of the Senate staff to look at these \nstudies and look at the impact of debt on economic growth. This could \nend up being the real lug of what happens during this period of time.\n  CARFA is a bipartisan mechanism that can work us out of this \nsituation. It pushes at the places we actually can cut and need to cut. \nEverybody in this body believes, and I believe, there are clear places \nin the Federal Government we can cut. For one reason or another, they \nhave become sacred cows and we have not been able to cut them. This is \na process that has worked on military bases before.\n  I will talk more about this amendment when we vote on it on Thursday. \nI ask my colleagues, in the interim day, when we have a chance to look \nat some of these things, to examine this process. It is one they have \nseen before. I have proposed this bill for 10 years. They voted on it \nbefore, as I stated earlier. I urge them to look at this and think: Now \nis the time to do this. Maybe they had reservations about it in the \npast or thought: I don't think we want to go into that sort of \nmechanism now. But there is not another mechanism that works. This \nchanges the mechanism for spending in a way that has worked in the past \nand, clearly, with these sort of debt numbers, the time has come to do \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are now debating a resolution that would \nraise the Federal debt ceiling, allowing the Federal Government to \nborrow enough money to meet its obligations. I doubt anyone in this \nChamber is happy at the prospect of approving another such increase. I \nknow I am not. Yet we must approve it. Failure to pass this resolution \nwould do incalculable harm to our government's standing with financial \nmarkets and endanger nearly every activity the government undertakes. \nIt would throttle the faint, fragile signs of recovery from the deepest \nfinancial crisis in 75 years. Refusal to pass this resolution is not an \noption. It would be irresponsible and dangerous to the jobs and income \nof every American.\n  Yet the magnitude of this action is staggering. If successful in this \nnecessary endeavor, we will authorize the Treasury to carry more than \n$13 trillion dollars in debt. That is more than $42,000 for every man, \nwoman, and child in the United States.\n  While the debt itself is enormous, the rate to which we have been \nadding to it in recent years is equally staggering. The year President \nClinton left office, the government ran a $236 billion surplus. Yet, \nafter 8 years of Republican leadership, that surplus evaporated into a \nmind-boggling $1.3 trillion deficit the day President Obama took \noffice.\n  The message of these numbers is simple: We cannot go on as we are. If \nwe do not change our budget policies, and change them a great deal, we \nwill plunge our economy into deep depression.\n  Discretionary spending and nondiscretionary spending alike must be \naddressed. While some have successfully politicized earmark spending \nand discretionary spending programs, good and bad alike, the simple \nfact is that merely addressing these issues will not balance our \nbudgets.\n  In addition to meaningful spending reforms, we must also engage in \nmeaningful revenue reforms. The Bush-era tax cuts have already added \ntrillions to our debt. Most should not be renewed. We also should end \nloopholes that allow corporations to hide income in offshore entities \nand people to hide their assets and income overseas.\n  But the fact is that most of our budget choices are not easy. And it \nis precisely because these choices are so difficult that we find \nourselves where we are now. So it is worth considering how we got into \nthis situation and how we might get out of it and whether the amendment \nto this resolution to be offered by Senators Conrad and Gregg presents \na possible solution.\n  First, let me respond to those who seem to have just recently \ndiscovered the importance of the Federal debt. Many of the people \nbemoaning budget deficits today are the same people who advocated a \nseries of policies under the previous administration that added\n\n[[Page S246]]\n\ngreatly to our deficits, including enormous tax cuts mainly for the \nwealthiest. No effort was made to pay for that policy or the two wars. \nThey were financed by debt.\n  In fact, to the extent that our budget outlook is significantly worse \nat the end of this decade than it was in the beginning, decisions by \nthe previous administration are by far the biggest contributor to the \nproblem. In parceling out the blame for our massive deficit, one expert \nsaid, the Obama administration ``is like a relief pitcher who enters a \ngame in the fourth inning trailing 19-0 and allows another run to \nscore. The extra run is nothing to cheer about, of course, but fans \nshould be far angrier with the starting pitcher.''\n  However we reached this point, it is our responsibility now to \naddress the consequences of failing to act. That is why I believe the \namendment offered by Senators Conrad and Gregg is worthy of \nconsideration.\n  Briefly, they propose to establish a task force to recommend changes \nto our budget policies to address our long-term fiscal crisis. The task \nforce would consist of 18 members: 16 Members of Congress, equally \ndivided between House and Senate and majority and minority, and 2 \nadministration officials, the Treasury Secretary and another \nPresidential appointee. Recommendations would require approval of 14 of \nthe commission's 18 members. Those recommendations would be referred to \nthe Budget Committee and other committees of jurisdiction in each \nChamber and then move automatically to floor votes in each Chamber, \nwhere passage would require a three-fifths vote.\n  There is much to recommend this approach. Our fiscal problem is so \nlarge partly because it is so politically difficult to address. \nRepairing our finances will require some combination of spending cuts \nand tax increases, and spending cuts and tax increases are rarely \npolitically popular. The use of a task force to recommend difficult but \nnecessary choices for the common good has been successful in the past, \nin several rounds of military base closings and with the Greenspan \nCommission on Social Security reform in 1983.\n  But this approach is not without flaw. One is the structure of the \ntask force, which would include two executive branch appointees.\n  Some have argued that the legislative commission must include members \nfrom the executive branch to achieve Presidential buy-in on the \ncommission's proposal. And I agree that gaining the support of the \nadministration is vital in this effort. But in seeking that buy-in, I \ndo not believe it is either necessary or proper to give executive \nbranch officials votes, which are potentially decisive votes, on \nrecommendations that would bypass the Senate's rules and procedures. \nThe proper way to achieve Presidential buy-in is through Presidential \ncommunication and consultation and the threat of an actual Presidential \nveto of a task force proposal, if passed by the Congress, if it is \nobjectionable to the President. The appropriate buy-in before Congress \nacts could also be advanced with ex officio membership for the two \nexecutive appointees.\n  I was pleased that the task force proposal we are voting on today no \nlonger gives the task force power to recommend changes to the Standing \nRules of the Senate. That is a welcome change from its prior \niterations. Successfully tackling our fiscal crisis will require far-\nreaching legislation, and procedural hurdles in both chambers make \npassing any far-reaching legislation extraordinarily difficult. But any \npermanent procedural changes in our rules should be made by the Members \nthemselves in each Chamber and not through this process.\n  Despite my reservations, particularly about voting membership for \nexecutive branch officials on a congressional commission that has the \npower to bypass the normal rules of our body for consideration of its \nrecommendations, I believe Senators Conrad and Gregg have offered a way \nforward. Their 60-vote requirement for positive congressional approval \nof the task force's recommendations does significantly protect \ncongressional prerogatives. It also is clear that our current political \nclimate and ways of doing business have been unequal to the task. \nAddressing our deficit requires bold action. The consequences of \nfailure to act are too severe for us to miss this chance to act. I will \nvote for the Conrad-Gregg proposal.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Ms. Delia Martinez of \nHenderson, NV, who on January 19, 2010, passed away at the age of 61. \nMs. Martinez was a dedicated public servant who volunteered countless \nhours of service to communities around the State of Nevada.\n  Ms. Martinez was born in Mexico City to U.S. Foreign Service officer \nCharles Coop and his wife Concepcion Martinez. When Delia was 7 years \nold her family moved to Nevada, where she would spend the rest of her \nlife. After graduating with honors from Rancho High School in Las \nVegas, Ms. Martinez went on to receive a degree in business management \nfrom the University of Nevada Reno in 1972.\n  From an early age, Delia was attracted to the ideals of justice and \nequality for all. As a high school student, she became actively \ninvolved in the civil rights movement, and worked diligently to this \nend all throughout her life. Ms. Martinez later enjoyed the opportunity \nto act on the passion for equality she had obtained earlier in life, \nwhen she became the first Hispanic female executive director of the \nNevada Equal Rights Commission. In\n\n[[Page S247]]\n\nthis position, which she held for over 10 years, Ms. Martinez honorably \nserved the citizens of Nevada by overseeing the State's pursuit to \nensure equal employment opportunities.\n  After her retirement from the professional world Ms. Martinez began \nserving in several organizations including the Henderson Democratic \nClub, Si Se Puede, the Clark County Hispanic Democratic Caucus, Clark \nCounty By-Laws Committee and the Clark County Democratic Black Caucus. \nMs. Martinez understood the necessity of improving her community \nthrough public service and advocacy. For this reason, it is no surprise \nthat she went on to serve in various leadership positions in many \ncommunity-based groups. At the time of her passing, Ms. Martinez was \nserving as the president of the Henderson Democratic Club, treasurer of \nthe Clark County Democratic Hispanic Caucus, and corresponding \nsecretary for Si Se Puede.\n  Along with her dedication to serving her community, Ms. Martinez will \nalso be remembered for the overwhelming love she had for her family. \nMs. Martinez was married to Glenn Phillips with whom she raised their \nbeloved son Benjamin. Prior to the birth of her child, she mentored \nfour nieces and nephews, inspiring them to become active community \nleaders in Nevada. Ms. Martinez is preceded in death by her parents and \nis survived by her husband, son, sister, and a large extended family \nthroughout southern Nevada and across several States.\n  I am humbled today to offer my profound gratitude to Ms. Martinez for \nher life of service to the citizens of the great State of Nevada, and \nwith equal humility offer my deepest condolences to Ms. Martinez's \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/26/senate-section/article/S247-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE EFFORTS OF PROJECT C.U.R.E.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to speak in recognition of \nPROJECT C.U.R.E. and its efforts to improve health care infrastructure \nin developing countries. PROJECT C.U.R.E. has been bringing customized \nmedical relief to those in the developing world since its inception in \n1987. In 2008 alone, PROJECT C.U.R.E. delivered nearly $40 million \nworth of supplies to more than 100 health care facilities throughout \nthe world.\n  PROJECT C.U.R.E. representatives conduct needs assessments at \nprospective sites to determine unique, appropriate medical supply and \nequipment needs. Follow-up accountability assessments provide necessary \ntraining and ensure that donated medical supplies and equipment are \noperating and being used properly. The organization focuses more than \n98 percent of funds on program delivery. For every nickel given to \nPROJECT C.U.R.E., they provide a dollar's worth of services; that is an \nimpressive 20-to-1 return on investment.\n  PROJECT C.U.R.E. would not be successful if it were not for the \ngrassroots efforts of volunteers throughout the United States, \nincluding participants in my home State of South Dakota. Doctors, \nmedical professionals, housewives, businessmen, and average citizens in \nthe Black Hills have come together to donate supplies and used medical \nequipment to be reprocessed, re-sterilized, and sent to where there is \nthe greatest need. The local Wal-Mart facilitated these efforts by \ndonating the transportation of the goods from Rapid City, SD, to the \nPROJECT C.U.R.E. warehouse in Centennial, CO.\n  In 2004, the Rapid City Regional Hospital had an ultrasound machine \nthat was 1 year past meeting U.S. standards but was still perfectly \nfunctioning. The hospital was weeks away from sending it to the \nlandfill when they heard about PROJECT C.U.R.E. Rather than waste away \nin the landfill, this $75,000 machine was sent to Malawi where it is \nstill being used today. There are many similar success stories and \ncountless individuals that have benefited from these efforts.\n  Once again, I commend the volunteers and staff of PROJECT C.U.R.E. \nfor their generosity, dedication, and hard work. I wish them well as \nthey continue their mission ``to identify, solicit, collect, sort and \ndeliver medical supplies and services according to the imperative needs \nof the world.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/26/senate-section/article/S247-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S247-S248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VISION REHABILITATION\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I rise today to recognize the importance of vision \nrehabilitation services for vision-impaired Americans.\n  There are more than 25 million Americans who have trouble seeing--\neven when aided by glasses or contact lenses. Over 1 million are \nlegally blind and over 3 million have low vision or partial sight.\n  This disability strikes Americans from all walks of life: the young \nand old, the poor and rich, urbanites and rural-dwellers.\n  Among Ohioans over the age of 40, there are more than 40,000 blind \npeople, more than 90,000 suffering from age-related macular \ndegeneration, more than 170,000 suffering from diabetic retinopathy, \nand nearly 100,000 with glaucoma.\n  Vision rehabilitation services help vision-impaired Americans restore \nfunction and live independent lives.\n  Whether it is learning to read Braille or use assistive computer \ntechnology, travel safely or take care of the home, meet career \nobjectives or enjoy leisure activities, vision rehabilitation services \nhelp vision-impaired people cope with and overcome their disability.\n  These critical services are provided by occupational therapists--who \ncan earn a specialty certificate in low vision--and vision \nrehabilitation professionals--who include low vision therapists, \norientation and mobility specialists, and vision rehabilitation \ntherapists.\n  These health care providers are uniquely qualified to serve the \nvision-impaired and have made a profound difference in millions of \nlives.\n  Take, for example, Laurine, an 84-year-old from the Cleveland area in \nmy State of Ohio.\n  Laurine went blind 5 years ago due to macular degeneration. After \ndecades of living independently, Laurine suddenly needed help with \nbasic activities of daily living and had to go into an assisted living \nfacility.\n  Laurine wanted to regain her independence, so she took advantage of \nservices from the Cleveland Sight Center, a nonprofit organization \nproviding vision rehabilitation.\n  She had orientation and mobility training, and relied on Susie Meles, \na vision rehabilitation specialist, to learn how to cook her own meals, \ndo her laundry, and even sew.\n  Today, Laurine is living happily and independently in Strongsville, \nOH.\n  There is also the story of Nicole, a 32-year-old from Ohio.\n  Nicole has been totally blind since she was 2 years old.\n  Like Laurine, she came to rely on the orientation and mobility \nspecialists and vision rehabilitation therapists at the Cleveland Sight \nCenter for help learning how to travel to school and later to work, how \nto read Braille, and how to use special computer software and adaptive \naids.\n  Today, Nicole is a self-employed music therapist living with her \nhusband in South Euclid, OH.\n  These are two of the many success stories produced every year at the \nCleveland Sight Center.\n  However, the work of the Cleveland Sight Center and other vision \nrehabilitation organizations across the country is hindered by a lack \nof reliable funding.\n  Clients are often unable to pay for the services themselves. And \nwhile some disability and workers' compensation insurance policies \ncover the costs, very few health insurance policies do.\n  Public insurers like Medicare and Medicaid do not reimburse for \nvision rehabilitation services when they are performed by a vision \nrehabilitation specialist, despite the fact that they are accredited by \nthe Academy for Certification of Vision Rehabilitation and Education \nProfessionals, a national body.\n  Medicare is currently testing a low-vision demonstration project in \nfour States and two cities that allows vision rehabilitation \nprofessionals to be reimbursed for their services when supervised by a \nphysician.\n  I am hopeful that this demo will illuminate the importance of making \nvision rehabilitation services--and the diagnostic evaluations by \noptometrists and ophthalmologists that prompt it--a guaranteed Medicare \nbenefit.\n  I am also supportive of including vision rehabilitation services in \nthe health plans that will be offered in the new exchange set up by the \nhealth reform bill.\n  These are long-term goals. As an original member of the Congressional\n\n[[Page S248]]\n\nVision Caucus, I realize that we will not achieve all of these \nobjectives overnight. But I know supporting the work of vision \nrehabilitation practitioners and providers like the Cleveland Sight \nCenter is the right thing to do. And I am confident that we will \nsucceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/26/senate-section/article/S248-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NEGRO LEAGUES BASEBALL MUSEUM'S 20TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in \nhonoring the 20th anniversary of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in \nKansas City, MO.\n  This Friday's Legacy Awards, honoring Major League Baseball's \nbrightest stars, kicks off what promises to be a season's worth of \nevents marking the 90th year of the establishment of the Negro Leagues, \nand the 20th anniversary of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum. As a \nMissourian, I am proud that Kansas City is home to what is not only a \nlocal jewel but a National treasure which honors the Negro Leagues, its \nlegendary players, and its place in the American civil rights movement.\n  In 1920, Andrew ``Rube'' Foster established the Negro Leagues at the \nPaseo YMCA in Kansas City. The Leagues flourished from 1920 through \nwell into the 1950s. Once forward-thinking baseball executives signed \nsuch standout African-American players as Jackie Robinson and Roy \nCampanella, interest in the Negro Leagues began to wane. By 1960, as \nthe civil rights movement gained momentum and the best players found \ntheir rightful place in the Major Leagues, the Negro Leagues finally \nfolded.\n  In its heyday, the Negro Leagues was a firmly entrenched and beloved \npart of African-American culture in Kansas City and throughout the \nupper Midwest, Northeast, and Southern regions of the United States. \nThe museum's Bob Kendrick tells us that many ministers would start \nchurch services early on Sundays when the Kansas City Monarchs had a \nhome game on the calendar. Men, women, and children would leave right \nafter church just in time to get to the ballpark, dressed in their \nSunday finest, to watch the game. It was the highest level of \ncompetition, and players like ``Cool Papa'' Bell, ``Satchel'' Paige, \nand Josh Gibson always made the game exciting.\n  Kansas City's beloved Buck O'Neil, a former Negro Leagues player, \nMonarchs' manager and Major League Baseball's first African-American \ncoach, helped establish the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in 1990. Back \nthen it was a tiny one-room office in the historic 18th & Vine District \nin Kansas City. Its mission--the same as it is today--was to preserve \nand celebrate the history of African-American baseball.\n  As chairman of the board, Buck O'Neil and his crew took the job \nseriously, working hard to raise money, acquire what curator Dr. \nRaymond Doswell has turned into an amazing collection of original \nmemorabilia, and bring worldwide attention to the museum. By 1997, the \nmuseum was robust enough to move into its current 10,000 square foot \nhome at 18th & Vine, where today the story of the Negro Leagues comes \nto life through its exhibits.\n  Over time, the museum has had the privilege of welcoming visitors \nfrom around the world, and such dignitaries as U.S. Presidents Bill \nClinton and George W. Bush. The museum's National Advisory Board is \nflush with prominent individuals from the worlds of sports, politics, \nand the media, all of whom have come to recognize the important role \nthe Museum plays in telling the story of civil rights, sports, and \nculture in 20th century America. George Will, Ernie Banks, Colin \nPowell, Lou Brock, former U.S. Senator Alan Simpson, and noted \ndocumentary producer Ken Burns are all members of this amazing group of \nsupporters.\n  In many ways this museum is Buck O'Neil's legacy. Buck, 94 years \nyoung at the time of his death in 2006, left a permanent inspirational \nmark on the game of baseball and all who were fortunate enough to have \ncrossed his trailblazing path. Kansas City--and America--are fortunate \nto call him our own.\n  On this the 20th anniversary of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, I \nask that we pause for a moment to pay tribute not only to Buck O'Neil, \nbut to the many unsung African-American baseball heroes who helped the \nNegro Leagues flourish until the better instincts of baseball \nexecutives ultimately made the need for such a league obsolete. This \nremarkable chapter of American history will be preserved forever thanks \nto the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in recognizing the 20th \nanniversary of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, a truly American \ntreasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/26/senate-section/article/S248-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/26/senate-section/article/S248-3", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/26/senate-section/article/S248-4", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:26 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2949.

A bill to establish funds to rapidly create new jobs in the \nprivate and public sector; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, today I want to talk about jobs. Lately \nit seems that everyone says they want to talk about jobs and that we \nwill get around to tackling jobs next week or the week after. I would \nlike to kick off the discussion today, right now, and follow it up with \nwhat I plan to do about jobs. I would not be the first to observe that \ntimes are tough right now. Our Nation is still reeling from the most \ndisastrous economic collapse in a generation. Failed regulatory \npolicies--or really, just deregulation--bad lending practices, and Wall \nStreet recklessness all contributed to the current crisis, double-digit \nunemployment for the first time in 25 years. Millions of American \nfamilies are relying on their unemployment benefits to put food on the \ntable and to pay their rent. Some are looking down at their final \nunemployment check, wondering what they are going to do next. For every \nsingle job opening, there are six unemployed workers. Too many people \nare left without options or hope in this dismal job market.\n  In the fall of 2008, when Wall Street's financial institutions \nstarted falling like dominos, our regulators told us: Congress has to \npass TARP now or we face total economic ruin. This seemed to get \nCongress moving. It passed legislation in a matter of days. My feeling \nis that the American people, especially those folks out of work, need \ntheir advocates to say: We have to do this now. Every Senator who has \nheard from their constituents about the depressing job market, about \nthe day-to-day struggles of being unemployed, should be on the floor \ninsisting that we act now; that if we don't act now and act boldly and \nbroadly, Main Street will continue to suffer, and that this \nunemployment crisis we are in will drag on and on.\n  The House has already acted. They passed a robust jobs package last \nDecember that provided needed funds to States and localities to keep \nteachers, firefighters, and police officers on the job. It provided \nfunds for public infrastructure projects. These are all vital elements \nto a successful jobs creation package.\n  In addition to these fundamentals, the Senate has the opportunity to \nput forward new ideas for job creation. Today I am introducing my \nproposal, the SEED Act, Strengthening our Economy through Employment \nDevelopment, SEED. We have seen Cash for Clunkers. We have talked about \nCash for Caulkers. Now I am proposing cash for jobs. The SEED Act is \nmodeled after a program we used for several years in Minnesota during \nthe recession of the 1980s. By all accounts, it was extremely \nsuccessful. Minnesota's program got over 7,400 people back to work in \nits first 6 months and created nearly 15,000 permanent, long-term jobs. \nIt did that at a much lower cost per job than the stimulus package this \nbody passed last year.\n  The SEED Act will incentivize rapid job creation by offering small \nand medium-size companies and nonprofits a direct wage subsidy to hire \nnew workers and expand their operations. Small businesses are the \ndriving force behind our economy. We all know that. They want to grow. \nBut many of them need an added infusion of capital since TARP hasn't \ntrickled down to them. Administered on a first-come-first-serve basis, \nthese subsidies will provide 50 percent of wages of newly hired workers \nand will be disbursed through the already existing Workforce Investment \nAct system. Using this existing system will minimize the bureaucracy \nthat plagues so many new initiatives. Additionally, employers who hire \nrecently returned Iraq and Afghanistan vets would be eligible for a 60-\npercent subsidy. The subsidy would be available for a 12-month period, \nand the employer would commit to keeping the worker on for an \nadditional 3 months after the subsidized year.\n  This model proved highly effective and efficient in Minnesota. Jim \nGlowacki is one of my constituents. He used Minnesota's program in the \n1980s. After he lost his job, he decided to start his own business. He \nhad few resources and little ability to borrow money. He used \nMinnesota's program, which was called MEED, to hire his first two \nemployees. Now his company, the JPG Group, employs 17 full-time workers \nand has an annual payroll of over $800,000. His story epitomizes the \nincredible potential for this approach to spur job creation.\n  The second component of the SEED Act is to direct grants to States, \nlocalities, and tribes to fund green jobs; Providing funds to retrofit \npublic buildings. In addition to creating green jobs, these retrofits \nwill increase energy efficiency, decreasing our dependence on foreign \noil and saving taxpayers money. These are public buildings. Too many of \nour public buildings, public housing, libraries, and schools are \nbecoming outdated and don't utilize the green technologies available\n\n[[Page S253]]\n\ntoday. There are many skilled workers currently on the bench who \nalready have the training they need to immediately get to work on these \nprojects. These new projects will increase demand for energy-efficient \nwindows and doors and heating systems and insulation, providing a boost \nto our Nation's stalled manufacturing sector. Some of you may not know \nthis, but Minnesota is the Silicon Valley of windows. We are home to \nthe Nation's leaders in energy-efficient windows which makes some sense \ngiven our winters. Retrofitting public buildings is a win for \neveryone--for workers, localities, taxpayers, manufacturing, and the \nenvironment. This is a win-win-win-win-win, I think. Windows, too. If \nwe reallocate $10 billion from the TARP program and pass this proposal \ninto law, we have the potential of creating up to 500,000 jobs, and \nquickly.\n  Getting people back to work will ease the burden on public benefit \nprograms like such as employment and COBRA subsidies. Many employers \nwill convert their participating workers into permanent employees, \nsetting them up for a long-term career. Minnesotans have stressed to me \nhow efficiently this program worked in our State and that it provides \nan excellent return on investment. They have worked tirelessly to \ndemonstrate the benefits of this type of bold proposal. I thank them \nfor collaborating with me on this important piece of legislation. More \nthan 50 Minnesota organizations, companies, and chambers of commerce \nhave come out in support.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of these \norganizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The following Minnesota organizations support the SEED Act:\n\n       Northwest Private Industry Council; Rural Minnesota CEP \n     Workforce Council; Northeast MN Workforce Council; Duluth \n     Workforce Council; Central MN Workforce Council; Southwest MN \n     Workforce Council; South Central Workforce Council; Southeast \n     Minnesota Workforce Development Board; Hennepin-Carver \n     Workforce Council; Minneapolis Private Industry/Workforce \n     Council; Anoka County Workforce Council; Dakota-Scott County \n     Workforce Council; Ramsey County Workforce Solutions; \n     Washington County Workforce Investment Board; Stearns-Benton \n     Employment & Training Council; Winona County Workforce \n     Council; Minnesota Hmong Chamber of Commerce; Minnesota Black \n     Chamber of Commerce; JPG Group; VAST Enterprises, LLC.\n       A Minnesota Without Poverty; Accessability, Inc.; Anoka \n     County Human Services Job Training Center; Anne Marie's \n     Alliance, St. Cloud; Anoka County Community Action Program; \n     Arrowhead Economic Opportunity Agency; Children's Defense \n     Fund-MN; CLASP; Department of Social Work, Augsburg College; \n     Employment Action Center; Joint Religious Legislative \n     Coalition; Heartland Community Action Agency; HIRED; Kootasca \n     Community Action; Lifetrack Resources; L.I.F.T.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na temporary payroll increase tax credit for certain employers; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \nestablishing a temporary jobs tax credit to help businesses expand \ntheir payroll here in the U.S. by hiring more employees, expanding work \nhours, or raising pay. The measure is modeled on a proposal by the \nEconomic Policy Institute that would create an estimated 5 million jobs \nover the next two years.\n\n[[Page S255]]\n\nAs we should not undermine the long-term prospects of our economy for \nthe sake of a short-term problem, the legislation is fully offset to \nensure that over the next 10 years it will not increase the deficit.\n  Briefly, the legislation provides firms a tax credit of 15 percent of \nthe increase in their eligible payroll in 2010, and 10 percent in 2011. \nEligible payroll includes that portion of a firm's wages subject to \nSocial Security taxes. For 2010 those are wages of $106,800 or less. \nThus, pay hikes for very highly salaried workers would not be eligible \nfor the tax credit.\n  The jobs tax credit is designed to avoid seasonal employment spikes \nby calculating it on a quarter over-year-ago-quarter basis. For \nexample, wages for the first quarter of 2010 are compared with wages \nfor the first quarter of 2009; wages for the third quarter of 2010 are \ncompared with wages for the third quarter of 2009. To limit possible \ngaming of the credit the last quarter of 2010 would be measured against \nthe last quarter of 2008, rather than 2009.\n  Only increased wages for employees here in the U.S. would be eligible \nfor the credit.\n  President Obama was handed the worst economy since the Great \nDepression. While he has taken significant steps to turn the economy \naround, employment continues to be a problem.\n  The official unemployment rate is a tragically high 10 percent. But \neven that high level understates the true employment picture, for if \none adds in the millions of people working part-time who want full-time \nemployment, and the millions more who are discouraged and have given up \nlooking for work, the rate is 17.3 percent, one of the highest levels \nsince 1994.\n  We must take steps to help businesses put people back to work and \nthis bill will do that.\n  No tax credit can be perfectly targeted. Any tax incentive we provide \nfirms will provide some businesses with a windfall for behaving in ways \nthey would have anyway, but a recent report by the Congressional Budget \nOffice on various policy options to spur employment found that a tax \nbreak similar to this proposal would be among the most efficient and \neffective policies we could enact. The CBO report estimated a similar \njobs tax credit would boost Gross Domestic Product by as much as $1.30 \nfor every dollar spent, and would increase employment by as much as 18 \nnet full-time equivalent jobs for every million dollars invested \nthrough the credit. In laying out the jobs tax credit proposal on which \nthis measure is based, the Economic Policy Institute projected an \nincrease of more than 5 million jobs over the next 2 years.\n  As I noted earlier, it is essential that we not aggravate the long-\nterm problems facing our economy, and for that reason my legislation \nincludes provisions that will offset the estimated cost of the jobs tax \ncredit, which the Economic Policy Institute estimates to be $27 \nbillion. Specifically, the proposal includes provisions originally \nproposed by the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, in S. 506, the Stop \nTax Haven Abuse Act.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Levin, the Homeland Security \nCommittee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that \noffshore tax evasion costs the taxpayers of this country an estimated \none hundred billion dollars every year. Because of this abuse, ordinary \ntaxpayers are bearing more than their fair share of the cost of their \ngovernment, and our children and grandchildren will be paying an even \nbigger bill for the increased deficits and debt that result from this \npractice.\n  The legislation Senator Levin developed as a result of his \nSubcommittee's work would go a long way to shutting down this abuse, \nand I am pleased to include it in a measure to help firms put people \nback to work.\n  The economic pain caused by the current recession is real. More than \nfifteen million people are considered officially unemployed today, and \nif we include those who want to work more hours and those who have \ngiven up looking for work, that number rises to over 26 million. As we \nknow, losing one's job means more than losing income. It is one of the \nmost traumatic events we can experience, and can be devastating for the \nmillions of families that have been affected.\n  We must take action to address this employment crisis. As the Senate \nbegins to debate possible responses, a jobs tax credit should be at the \ntop of the proposals we consider. While the precise terms of such a \ncredit can be debated, the need for it is clear.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this approach.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2956. A bill to authorize the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission \nIndians Water Rights Settlement, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Pechanga \nBand of Luiseno Mission Indians Water Rights Settlement Act. This \nlegislation will implement a settlement concerning the water rights of \nthe Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians, who have been engaged for \nseveral decades in a struggle for recognition and protection of their \nfederally reserved groundwater rights.\n  Since 1951, the Pechanga have been involved in litigation initiated \nby the U.S. concerning water rights in the Santa Margarita watershed. \nThe Pechanga's interest has been in protecting their groundwater \nsupplies, which are shared with municipal developments in the San Diego \nregion. Beginning in 2006, the Pechanga worked with local water \ndistricts to negotiate a cooperative solution and put an end to their \ndispute.\n  The Pechanga Settlement Agreement is a comprehensive agreement \nnegotiated among the Pechanga, the U.S. on their behalf, and several \nCalifornia water districts, including the Rancho California Water \nDistrict and Eastern Municipal Water District. The settlement \nrecognizes the Pechanga's tribal water right to 4994 acre-feet of water \nper year and outlines a series of measures to guarantee this amount. It \nis a win-win solution that protects the rights of the Pechanga while \nensuring that other communities in Southern California will also have \nsufficient water supplies.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Feinstein in introducing this \nlegislation. We have worked with our colleagues in the House, including \nRepresentatives Bono Mack, Grijalva, Richardson, Calvert, Baca, and \nIssa, to craft this legislation. Our bill not only provides the \nPechanga with long-overdue assurances of their water rights, but also \nexemplifies all the good that can be accomplished when parties put \naside their differences and come to the table to negotiate a reasonable \nsolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/26/senate-section/article/S255-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S255-S256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 397--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF CHARLES McCURDY \n (``MAC'') MATHIAS, JR., FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF \n                                MARYLAND\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Cardin, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Begich, \nMr. Bennet, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, \nMr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burr, Mr. Burris, Mr. Byrd, Ms. \nCantwell, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Coburn, Mr. \nCochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Crapo, \nMr. DeMint, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \nFeingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Graham, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Gregg, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Hutchison, \nMr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nKaufman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kirk, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. LeMieux, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nLieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lugar, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. \nMenendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of \nNebraska, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Risch, Mr. \nRoberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mrs. \nShaheen, Mr. Shelby, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Tester, \nMr. Thune, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. Vitter, \nMr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, Mr. Webb, Mr.\n\n[[Page S256]]\n\nWhitehouse, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, this resolution concerns a civil action \nfiled by two individuals against five Senators, two Representatives, \nand the Federal Election Commission. Plaintiffs' challenge rests on \ntheir claim to a right that Congress pass health care legislation that \nwould benefit them. Plaintiffs' legal claim is that the Federal \nElection Campaign Act's designation of Members of Congress as agents of \ntheir\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\ncampaign committees violates the Constitution's prohibition on Members \nof Congress holding any other office under the United States while \nserving in the Congress.\n  Plaintiffs' complaint over the legislative actions of Senators is not \ncognizable before the courts.
