Mr. President, 60 miles outside Las Vegas is a rural \ncommunity called Pahrump. It originally had a series of artesian wells, \nhad lots of water, and for many years they farmed cotton. But it has \nnow become a retirement and business community with golf courses there. \nIt is a beautiful community less than an hour from Las Vegas.\n  Last night a man who had just returned from Afghanistan--his name is \nIan Deutch. It was his second day on the job as a police officer. He \nwas murdered by a man who had a domestic dispute with a woman, and he \nwas proceeding to a place of business with lots and lots of people when \nhe shot Officer Deutch.\n  The officer who was with him, Thomas Klenczar, killed the gunman \nsaving untold lives. This is a tragic story. The slain man had a \nteenage child, a 7-year-old, and just returned, as I have indicated, \nfrom Afghanistan in our military. It was his second day on the job--not \nkilled in Afghanistan, not wounded in Afghanistan, killed in Pahrump, \nNV.\n  This is the way peace officers find themselves all over America every \nday protecting us from these criminals and crazed people. I express my \ncondolences to the entire Nye County Sheriff's Department and \nespecially to Sheriff Anthony DeMeo and especially to the family of Ian \nDeutch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/27/senate-section/article/S2673-7", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, part of our required reading, as I was going \nthrough college, was to read George Orwell's book, ``1984,'' which was \nlooking into the future. Of course, looking at 1984 now, it is looking \nin the rearview mirror. But when I was in school we looked at ``1984.'' \nIt was George Orwell's classic book.\n  The main focus of the book is how societies would be in the years to \ncome, in 1984. It appears he was fairly prophetic because one of the \nthings that George Orwell talked about is that there would come a time \nwhen people would stand and talk, and whatever they said, the direct \nopposite would be true. That is what we have going on from my friends \non the Republican side of the aisle as it deals with Wall Street \nreform, as it deals with what we have been doing legislatively.\n  We have a situation where people sometimes forget where we were. \nLet's talk about where we were for just a short time. During the 8 \nyears of the Clinton administration, 24 million new jobs were created. \nDuring that period of time, we were paying down the national debt. We \nwere being criticized for paying it down too fast, too quickly.\n  Now comes 8 years of George Bush. Let's remember where we were. \nPrivatization of Social Security was the cry of the Bush \nadministration. Then we had a war of choice--and, by the way, there is \na new book out by Evan Thomas of Newsweek. He talks about the rush to \nwar, and I heard him interviewed.\n\n[[Page S2674]]\n\n  That war was a war of choice. We are all glad to be rid of Saddam \nHussein, but in the process we know the toll on our National Treasury \nand our men and women. That does not take into consideration what has \nhappened to the Iraqi people, hundreds of thousands of them killed \nduring this war. All of that war was unpaid for; the tax cuts to the \nwealthy, unpaid for. No longer was there any concern about paying down \nthe debt too quickly.\n  The Bush administration turned that on its head. In fact, they got \nrid of all of the rules that allowed us to do that, including pay-go; \nthat is, we pay for things as we go along.\n  So let's understand a little bit where we were. In the last 2 months \nof the Bush administration 1\\1/2\\ million jobs were lost. Obama came to \nthe Presidency with this huge hole having been dug. I mean it was a \nhole that was a sight to behold. We have worked out of that hole. We \nstill have a long ways to go, but we have come a long ways out of that \nhole.\n  We know we stopped a worldwide depression with the stimulus bill, the \nrecovery bill. Now that is of little consolation for people who have \nlost their homes or who are afraid they are going to lose their homes \nor who have lost their job or are afraid they are going to lose their \njob. But we have stopped the bleeding. Now we have to get back to a \nvibrant economy, and we can do that. We are not there yet.\n\n  We have been able to accomplish a lot. We have been able to stop that \nworldwide depression. We were able to pass the most significant \nenvironmental legislation in more than a quarter of a century. We \ncreated more than 2 million acres of wilderness, 1,000 miles of wild \nand scenic rivers, hundreds of miles of trails, and many other things \nin that bill.\n  We passed the Lilly Ledbetter legislation to more equalize pay \nbetween men and women. We have passed legislation to stop mortgage \nfraud. We passed legislation to stop children from being addicted by \ntobacco companies. For the first time in the history of this country, \nthe FDA now controls tobacco, stopping people from being addicted, as \nall of my family was when they were teenagers.\n  Credit card legislation--we were able to move forward on that and \nstop many of the abuses of credit card companies. National service \nlegislation, something that Senator Kennedy wanted for 30 years, we \nwere able to pass, and many other things, in spite of the Republicans \nfighting us every step of the way. We have had dozens of filibusters. \nThey have certainly established themselves as the party of no.\n  Of course, we passed health care legislation, one of the most \nimportant things ever done in the history of this country. Four million \nsmall businesses across America, 24,000 of them in Nevada, are now \neligible for health care. They will be able to get a 35-percent subsidy \nfor their health care premiums--4 million of them, 24,000 in Nevada.\n  Children with preexisting disabilities can no longer be denied \ninsurance if they have diabetes or other problems. We put $5 billion in \nthat bill to allow States that already have programs to work with the \npeople who have preexisting disabilities. Those who do not, they have \nthat $5 billion so that adults, until we get the exchanges up, can \napply to have insurance for preexisting disabilities.\n  We also raised the age for young men and women who are not getting \nmarried as early as they used to. They can now be on their parents' \nhealth insurance policy until they are 26 years old. We filled the \ndoughnut hole created during the Bush administration. So that health \ncare legislation is extremely important and good legislation and \nimportant law in this country. Each day that goes by, part of the 4 \nmillion businesses will be able to have insurance for their employees \nthat they have never had before. People will no longer suffer as a \nresult of the doughnut hole. People can stay on their insurance policy \nuntil they are 26. Preexisting disabilities will not be the problem it \nwas, and we have done other things.\n  We are now moving to Wall Street reform. Here is where George Orwell \ncomes into the picture. Everything the Republicans have said about what \nwe are trying to do with Wall Street reform is just the opposite. \nWhatever they say is just the opposite.\n  I talked to one Republican Senator last night.\n  I said: We should get on the bill and then you can offer all of the \namendments you think are appropriate.\n  That Senator said: No. We want all of the problems worked out before \nwe get on the bill.\n  I said: You know, that is not really the way the Senate was set up \n230 years ago. The Senate is to be a body where we proceed to \nlegislation, then offer amendments, and then there is a debate that \ntakes place.\n  But the Republicans have a new standard; that is, they want to \nnegotiate. That is the new banner. I wonder when the end of \nnegotiations takes place? The ranking member and the chairman of the \ncommittee negotiated for months on this legislation. Then when that \nfell through, one of the junior members of the committee stepped \nforward and negotiated for a month, and that fell through.\n  There comes a time when we have to start legislating and stop \nnegotiating. We have a bill that is on the Senate floor. It received \nall Democratic votes except one, and none of the Republican votes. It \nis not as if we are asking anyone to approve the legislation. We are \nsimply asking to be able to get on the legislation.\n  But the Republicans said no. Now we know, from looking at the \nnewspapers and all of the accounts on electronic media, that the \nAmerican people support the legislation that is now being asked to be \ndebated. They believe being too big to fail should be in the \nlegislation as we have it. They believe in having a failsafe method to \nmake sure that when these big companies have a funeral, they pay for it \nthemselves.\n  So I cannot understand why we cannot go to the bill, have amendments \noffered. The end of negotiations should terminate sometime. I was a \ntrial lawyer by profession. Of course, it is good to negotiate, but \nthere comes a time when you have to say: OK. We have had enough of \nthis. Let's let the jury decide.\n  That is basically what we have done. The jury is the American people. \nThey decided they want us to move forward. The American people, \nundeniably demand we protect them from Wall Street, which has run wild.\n  Two-thirds of the American people support us cracking down on big \nbankers' reckless risk taking. I direct everyone within the sound of my \nvoice to read the book, the best seller--and it is a best seller for a \ngood reason--called ``The Big Short.'' This book, written by the same \nman who wrote ``The Blind Side,'' talks about what has happened on Wall \nStreet. I am from a State that is famous for gambling. But the people \nwho come to Las Vegas to gamble do so with their own money. Wall Street \ngambled and caused this problem with our money. They are gambling now \nwith our money. The rules are the same today as they were when this \ndebacle occurred.\n\n  A majority of the American people support us asking banks to pay for \ntheir own funerals. I already mentioned that. That is the fund financed \nby the big financial firms to cover the cost of their liquidation--not \nto bail out banks that threaten the larger economy, as some \ncharacterize it, but to shut them down for good. The American people \nalso demand that their leaders discuss these details and improve on \nthose ideas. They have two simple requests--this is the American \npeople: One, that their leaders look out for their economic security, \nand two, that their legislators will legislate. In other words, they \nwant us to protect their job, and they want us to do our own job. Right \nnow, Senate Republicans are refusing to do either. Yesterday, they \nstood together en bloc to block us from moving this bill to the floor. \nThey did not even want the Senate to talk about legislation as part of \nthe normal legislative process.\n  More than 2 years after the financial collapse that sparked a \nworldwide recession, Senate Republicans are claiming we are moving too \nfast--too fast. They are claiming that only a fully negotiated and \nagreed upon bill can come up for debate. That is absurd, stunning, \nunheard of. They want all the details to be worked out beforehand, \nbehind closed doors, and out of view from the public. That is \nunprecedented in the more than 200 years we have been a Senate. As we \nall learned in civics\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\nclass, that is not how the legislative process should work.\n  We want to bring our bill to the floor so we can discuss it, debate \nit, amend it, and improve it. We want to do it in the open. After all, \nif we are not debating, if Senators refuse to let the Senate do its \njob, what are we doing here?\n  It is very interesting, Mr. President, that the Republican Senators \nare willing to talk about financial reform with press conferences and \nother media events. Why weren't they willing to talk about it here on \nthe floor?\n  What purpose does the Senate serve? Why do we have rules for debate \nand the opportunity to offer amendments?\n  President Kennedy once said:\n\n       Let us not be afraid of debate or discussion--let us \n     encourage it.\n\n  That is what he said. So I ask my Republican colleagues, why are you \nafraid? What are you afraid of? All we want to do is move to the bill.\n  If something untoward happens after the bill gets to the floor, they \ncan still stop us from getting 60 votes. There are 41 of them. Why in \nthe world can't we go to the floor and debate this bill? They have that \nprotection.\n  The right response to disagreement is not dismissal; it is \ndiscussion. For far too long, there has been too much secrecy and too \nlittle transparency on Wall Street. The American people have paid the \nprice in their job and their life savings, and they demand we fix what \nis broken. As long as Republicans insist on secrecy and resist \ntransparency here in the Senate--and if they do not let us address the \nproblems we were sent here to resolve--we will never fully recover.\n  Remember, this debacle on Wall Street took place starting more than 2 \nyears ago. Why aren't we here debating the issue? Because the \nRepublicans want more negotiations. They refuse to legislate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/27/senate-section/article/S2675-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, last night the Democrat majority \nforced a vote on a bill that was not ready for prime time. We know this \nbecause every day it seems another one of its flaws comes to light. And \nit is noteworthy that there was bipartisan objection to going forward \nwith the bill last night in its current form.\n  You have every single member in my conference--from one end of the \nparty spectrum to the other--united in calling for more bipartisan \ntalks. We have heard from a couple of Democrats who think we should \nmake some improvements as well.\n  You had the National Federation of Independent Businesses yesterday \nsaying the bill hurts America's small business job creators. We heard \nfrom the organization that represents military officers yesterday \nexpressing their concerns about the impact the bill will have on nearly \n400,000 Active-Duty, retired, and former servicemembers, their \nfamilies, and survivors. Community bankers from across the country say \nthis bill, as currently written, hurts Main Street. The New York Times \nthis morning reported that the maker of M's and Snickers is concerned \nabout the bill's impact on the cost of sugar and chocolate. Harley-\nDavidson is worried about the effect it is going to have on business, \nand eBay is worried about the consequences for its business.\n  Clearly, this bill is not ready. It falls short of our constituents' \ndemands to prevent future bailouts, and it is expected to hurt \nAmerica's job creators at a time when we need jobs most. Does anyone \nreally believe the people who make Harley-Davidsons and Snickers bars \nare responsible for the financial crisis? Does anyone think that? Then \nwhy would we want to punish them in our effort to hold Wall Street \naccountable? These are just the kinds of unintended consequences you \nget from rushing legislation. If we are aware of them, why wouldn't we \nwant to address them? In many cases, all it would take is a simple fix. \nThe Military Officers Association says all it would take is a simple \ntweak in the language to address their concerns. In other places, we \njust need to close a loophole. Unfortunately, the Democratic majority \nseems less interested in fixing this bill than in some political win \nthey think they are scoring by not fixing the bill. It is a total waste \nof the people's time.\n  Americans do not understand why we would vote on a bill that does not \nmeet the basic test of reform. They do not see the point. In what other \nline of work is it acceptable to show up to a big meeting with an \nunfinished product? Don't we have an obligation to make sure the bill \nwe bring to the floor is in good shape before we vote on it? Isn't that \njust basic? This bill is not ready yet. It needs work. That is what \nlast night's vote was about.\n  This morning, I saw that the junior Senator from Virginia--a Democrat \nand a man who knows what it is like to create jobs--is acknowledging \nwhat Republicans have been saying all along. This is what he said:\n\n       There are parts that need to be tightened.\n\n  That is certainly true. So let's stop the show partisanship and fix \nthe bill. Let's tighten the parts that need to be tightened, as Senator \nWarner suggests. Let's get back to the business of reforming Wall \nStreet and proving to the American people that the days of Wall Street \nbailouts are indeed over.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/27/senate-section/article/S2675-4", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to urge my Republican \ncolleagues--to urge the Republican leader--to drop their filibuster of \nthe Wall Street reform bill.\n  I wish I could say this is the first time we have seen efforts to \nblock moving forward to even debate a critical issue before the Senate, \nbut, as the Presiding Officer knows, the party of no has now 171 \ndifferent times either filibustered or threatened to filibuster \ncritical legislation that is important for moving America forward. \nHistoric--171 times; never heard of before.\n  With all due respect, the idea that the bill has to be perfect before \nwe begin to debate it makes absolutely no sense. There have been \nnumerous times, because of the importance of a piece of legislation, \nthat I have supported and everyone on this floor has supported moving \nforward to proceed to a bill knowing it would need to have changes \nbefore we would support the final outcome of the bill. We do that all \nthe time.\n  Personally, there are changes I want to see and will work hard for in \nthe legislation that is before us. There are\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\nprovisions, there are amendments I will support in order to make sure \nthis does not have unintended consequences. I would guess the majority \nof us are in that situation. But to simply say: No, we will not proceed \nto the bill--and just to make that clear for everyone, this is not a \nvote on final passage; this is a vote on whether to proceed to the \nbill--says to the American people that changing the unregulated, \nunaccountable practices on Wall Street is not worth even bringing up, \nto get to the floor to debate. That is what this says. That is what is \nso shocking to me.\n  I have to say, on behalf of the people of Michigan, who have been hit \nso hard by the gambling and unregulated processes, I am extremely \nconcerned that we are seeing another filibuster. We will have an \nopportunity to change that today, tomorrow, the next day. I hope \ncolleagues will decide that rather than just blocking the ability for \nus to fix this problem, they will join us and that many of us will join \ntogether in amendments that will make sure this bill is the right kind \nof bill moving forward.\n  But we have seen what happened when Wall Street did not have \naccountability and oversight. I can tell you, the people of Michigan \ncannot afford to go through that again. Eight million Americans, many \nof them--too many of them--in my great State of Michigan, have lost \ntheir jobs, through no fault of their own, because of the secret, \nunregulated deals on Wall Street. We have seen small business owners, \nwho had worked so hard to build their part of the American dream for \ntheir families, forced to close their doors because they did not have \naccess to capital. This has to stop. Families around my State have \nwatched as money in their pension funds and 401(k)s vanished before \ntheir eyes because other people were gambling with their money. The \nmost heart-wrenching time for us in Michigan was GM and Chrysler being \nforced into bankruptcy because of the economic crisis caused by Wall \nStreet's recklessness.\n  So I am shocked and deeply concerned that my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle would choose to filibuster this bill, which puts in \nplace commonsense regulations and puts consumers back in control of \ntheir finances. I am deeply concerned for our community bankers, who \nhave also been victims of the crisis, who need help so they can get \ncredit flowing again back to our small businesses and our manufacturers \nto create jobs. But mostly I am deeply concerned for the hard-working \nmen and women in my State who work hard every day, who play by the \nrules, and who were hurt by the reckless behavior on Wall Street and \nwho want to know this will not happen again.\n  The bill we have will hold the big banks accountable and put \nconsumers back in control. It is time to stop the unregulated gambling \non Wall Street of other people's money. I strongly urge colleagues to \nstand up to the special interests and the lobbyists, to drop the \nfilibuster of this bill, to work with us to make sure it is done right \nbut, most of all, to make sure we put in place rules and accountability \nfor our families, our small businesses, and our manufacturers so they \ncan have the capital they need and the accountability and the trust in \nthe system they need to move forward and create jobs and create \ninvestment in this country.\n  Again, 171 times--unprecedented--more than any other time in our \nhistory we have seen efforts to block and to filibuster. It has to \nstop. Too much is at stake, and certainly the people in my State have \ngone through too much to allow this to continue.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I appreciate my colleague from \nMichigan being out here, as she has been repeatedly, to talk about how \nour process oftentimes breaks down and what the consequences are \nbecause there is probably no bigger consequence than what has happened \nto the State of Michigan, and she fights every day to make sure we are \naware of what will help our economy and help Main Street. So I thank \nher for that. I thank her for being out here to urge us to get off of a \nfilibuster and on to important legislation that I think will help our \ncountry.\n\n  I am here also to talk about something that I wish to make sure, as \nwe enter this floor debate, people aren't confused about; that is, that \nwe have made choices in the past that have helped accentuate the \nsituation we are in, and if we are going to get out of this situation, \nwe have to be honest with ourselves that this is a time when we need to \ndo our job and make sure we understand the opportunity to make sure \nconsumers are protected.\n  I wish to start by talking about the Commodities Exchange Act. There \nhas been a lot of debate about what various committees have oversight \nand what the important issues are. For me, there is no more important \nissue than making sure the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, \nwhich has oversight of financial indexes, has the authority to regulate \nwhat are called derivative markets. The reason I say this is so \nimportant is because of the fact that we allowed legislation to pass in \n2000--the Commodities Futures Modernization Act--that literally \nderegulated these derivatives. More specifically, it prevented us from \nregulating. We had a Commodities Futures Trading Commission Chair, a \nwoman named Brooksley Born, who saw what damage was happening in 1998 \nwith these derivatives because they were unregulated. She tried to do \nsomething about it. She tried to do something about it because the \nCommodities Exchange Act provided oversight to deter and prevent price \nmanipulation or any other disruptions to the market and to ensure \nfinancial integrity of all transactions and avoid systemic risk and to \nprotect participants from fraudulent or abusive practices.\n  That is what their charge was. When she saw in the marketplace that \nthere were these products that were being used that basically thwarted \nthis act, she proposed regulating derivatives. That is in the 1998 \ntimeframe. So this problem has been around for a long time.\n  As we saw the demise of long-term capital management and incurred a \nfinancial crisis at that time, she said: Let's make sure we are \nregulating these products. What happened was, she was basically run out \nof town for her views. She was the Chair of the Commission at the time, \nand a bunch of people, basically influenced by Wall Street, came down \nto Washington, DC, and said: That is the wrong idea. We don't need to \ndo this. This issue isn't going to be a problem for us. So not only was \nshe prohibited as the Chair of the Commodities Futures Trading \nCommission to fulfill this act, to make sure we regulated this market--\nnot only that--legislation was passed by the Congress prohibiting us \nfrom regulating these derivatives. Imagine that. You actually had the \nChair of the Commission doing her job; you actually had her calling out \na problem in the market, fulfilling her responsibilities of oversight, \nand not only was she told she couldn't regulate those, Congress \nprohibited her from doing that in the Commodities Futures Modernization \nAct.\n  How did we get to that situation? I get it because I had to live \nthrough the Enron crisis in our State and a lot of people cooked up \noff-book accounting and people said: Oh, it is a bunch of \nenvironmentalists not allowing us to have an energy supply. That is why \nwe have an energy crisis--or people said: Oh, we are having an energy \ncrisis because we don't have enough refineries. We found out it was \npeople manipulating supply and demand with various schemes called Death \nStar and Get Shorty, a variety of things that all came down to this: \noff-book accounting. How could you fool the accountants into believing \nthat your scheme was legitimate?\n  So it should be no surprise that in 1994, in a little retreat \neffort--some of us go on retreats and talk about our policy issues. \nHere, some of the titans of Wall Street went down to Boca Raton, about \n80 J.P. Morgan bankers, and started to wonder if there was a way to \ncreate derivatives that could bet on whether bonds or loans would \ndefault. That is what they did. They were down in Boca Raton saying, \nbasically: How can we do off-book accounting to figure out ways in \nwhich we can bet on these things?\n  So that is what happened. That was the start of this. A few years \nlater, Brooksley Born, after she saw them,\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\ncalled them out on it, said: Let's stop it and basically was prohibited \nfrom doing it.\n  So what happened when we prohibited the derivatives from being \nregulated? Well, one of the CFTC personnel, at that time, basically \nsaid all the fundamental templates we have learned from the Great \nDepression are needed to have markets function smoothly are gone. These \nare things we had put in place after the last fiscal crisis. We put \nthem in place because we knew we had to protect things.\n  The other side of the aisle led the charge on that deregulation, led \nthe charge on the deregulation of derivatives and said: Let's keep our \nhands off. I would say at least four times we have had votes on various \nderivative measures and the majority of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle have said: No, let's don't reregulate them.\n  I am all for hearing what they have to say today, but this is an \nimportant issue. Let me explain why.\n  When we look at capital markets, we have to have transparency. If we \ndon't have transparency, people don't know what is going on and \nproducts can be manipulated. So after the 2000 Commodities Futures \nModernization Act, basically on derivatives we had no transparency, no \ncapital requirements, no prohibition on fraud, no prohibition on \nmanipulation, no regulation of intermediaries. Why are we surprised we \nended up in this situation? Because if we basically took what had been \nthe fundamentals of the last fiscal crisis and put them in place in a \nlaw and then basically were warned and we deregulated them, why are we \nsurprised we ended up in this situation? Because after deregulation, \nwhat it meant if you were doing trading, at least on these \nderivatives--on other products you had certainty and you had \npredictability, but on these products--let me be more specific.\n  We had what were called dark markets and that meant because you \ncouldn't see into these dark markets, you didn't understand what was \nbeing done. I know our colleague, Senator Levin, is holding a hearing \ntoday, and he is going to get to the bottom of exactly what was going \non in those dark markets and who was trying to manipulate them. But the \nfact that they were dark and not traded meant we couldn't see the price \nthat somebody was paying and thereby couldn't understand what was going \non in the market. So we had no transparency. We also had no requirement \nto keep records, no large trader reporting, which would have been \nthings that the CFTC would have looked at and said: Oh, I can look at \nthat and see whether manipulation is happening. We had no speculation \nlimits. Another thing that happens on the stock market or on trades \nthat happen now--we hear about it all the time--is that if somebody \nthinks somebody is messing around with the market, we can have limits. \nWe can come in and on an exchange--or an agency can come in and say: We \nare going to stop that kind of trading because we have concerns about \nwhat is going on. We also know there was no capital behind these bets \nas well, which is very alarming to a lot of people. The synthetic CDOs \nwere cooked up and had no capital behind them. I know my colleague, \nSenator Dorgan, has been on the floor talking about an amendment he is \ngoing to be offering on the Senate floor to make sure we close that. \nBut what it created was just a high risk for fraud and manipulation and \nexcessive speculation. That is what happened.\n  So when we deregulated the derivative market, what happened? Well, it \nshould be no surprise, again, to find out that when we deregulated it, \nthe market exploded. Here is where we were in 1999. There were some \nderivative products, but now look at it. It peaked at $700 trillion. It \nhas leveled off now somewhere around $600 trillion. A $600 trillion \nmarket in derivatives grew because we created a dark market opportunity \nin which most people couldn't--not everybody could understand what was \ngoing on, and certainly the regulators who used to have a day job of \noverseeing this were prohibited from doing their day job. I should add, \nnot only were the regulators prohibited from doing their day job, in \nthe Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000, we also had a \nprovision in there that said States aren't able to use their authority \nto look into these markets and market activities as well. So we did two \nthings. We prevented the Federal regulators from doing anything and we \nprevented the State regulators from doing something as well and now we \nhave this unbelievable--unbelievable--unbelievable market of activity.\n\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to talk about \ninnovation. Well, I know a little bit about innovation. I worked for a \ncompany that was a startup company. When I look at that issue, I see we \nhave to have financial markets on Wall Street that help those companies \nget financing through their very early stages. That is what is so \nimportant about our financial markets operating effectively. But one \ncan see from this chart--or maybe not. Maybe you can't see from this \nchart because it is so hard to see, but at the very bottom there is a \nlittle yellow line, and that yellow line represents assets. It \nrepresents the loans these banks are making, the amount of money that \nis in loans in capital going to businesses that are the true ideas of \ninnovation. There is a lot of innovation in derivatives. Now we know \nwhat it is: dark market derivatives that cooked up things like CDOs and \nsynthetic instruments to basically bet against bonds because somebody \nhad securitized loans to banks that were risky bank loans anyway and \nthen tried to make somebody believe it was a great way to cover them \nfinancially. So all of it was just a risky game, and that is what we \nare doing. So we are not helping the American economy in investing in \nDetroit or investing in software or investing in other things, not the \nway we used to. We are basically investing--and people are making a ton \nof money--in dark market derivatives. So that is why it is so important \nwe fix this in the legislation.\n  Just to give an idea of where people are making the money--because I \nknow some people like to say: Well, let's get out here and make sure we \ndo something for small business. I think it is incredibly important to \ndo that, but we are not going to get the big banks to make a bunch of \nloans to small businesses, as that last chart showed us, when they can \nmake money in dark market derivatives. This chart shows the increased \nprofit they have had since 2008. So we have actually had a decrease in \nlending. We have actually had a decrease in the amount of capital going \nout to the tune of something like $574 billion and an increase in \ntrading profits. So we know where the money is going. Wall Street is \nnot putting money into Main Street; Wall Street is putting money into \nWall Street dark markets, and we have to get on this legislation to fix \nthat.\n  So what would we do in this legislation? Well, if my Agriculture \nCommittee colleague's mark is put into this legislation, as I believe \nthe leader is going to do, then we have a choice of having an \nunregulated market or, with this legislation, a truly regulated market \nwith exchange trading. People say: What does that mean, exchange \ntrading? I don't understand. What is that going to solve for us? Well, \njust as I said how dark the market was and no one knew what was going \non, when we have a product that is traded on an exchange, we actually \nhave transparent pricing so people can see what the pricing is, just as \nthis situation is being described right now in the Senate Oversight \nCommittee hearing about how people didn't know what was going on or who \nwas paying what or who was behind what bets. We have to have \ntransparent pricing, and we have to have real-time trade monitoring. \nBecause someone is monitoring those trades, we know exactly what is \nhappening in the market and who is moving what and how they are moving \nit and we have a transparent valuation.\n  If my colleagues have time and they read this latest book out by \nMichael Lewis, ``The Big Short,'' he talks about how people didn't know \nexactly what was going on with the valuation of this because it was \nbeing hidden from them, so they had no way of understanding exactly \nwhat the value of these products were. That is why this scheme was able \nto be perpetrated on people, because they didn't know what the true \nvaluation is. If we have exchange trading, we actually have speculation \nlimits and we have public transparency.\n  So when we are on the floor debating this--and I hope my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle will support exchange trading. I heard \none of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle\n\n[[Page S2678]]\n\nsay: Well, I don't think that is the solution. Well, in my book, it is \nabsolutely the solution. It is absolutely the solution, just as it is \nfor the stock market. Who would buy stock on the stock market if we \ndidn't have oversight of the exchange?\n  If you didn't have these kinds of things--transparency in pricing, \nreal-time trade monitoring, transparent valuation, speculation limits, \nand public transparency--who would buy stocks? Why do you think \nderivatives can operate in the dark? They cannot.\n  The other thing we will be talking about on the floor is that \nunregulated trading doesn't have any capital behind the trade. If we \nactually had a clearinghouse--exchange trading and a clearinghouse--\nthen you would have capital behind these trades, and people would know \nsomebody has the ability to deal with this transaction they are betting \non. These are the things we need to do. These are the things that are \ncritical to the type of reform we need to get done.\n  I am concerned that we are not going to get to this legislation, that \nthe dark market is going to continue to operate that way or that people \nare going to propose loopholes to basically water down this \nlegislation. We have had a lot of conversation about loopholes. One of \nthem is the end-user loophole. Basically, any kind of loophole in the \nlegislation is kind of like water; the money is going to flow where it \ncan. If it is a dark market, that is where it will flow.\n  We had a hearing of the Commerce Committee in 2008, 6 or 7 months \nbefore the big bubble burst, and George Soros came to testify. He said \nwe are basically inside of a bubble and it is going to cause great \nconcern. He knew then, because he knew what kind of activity was going \non. He talked in his testimony about how important it was that you \napply regulation and apply it to both the regulated and unregulated \nmarket. If you don't apply it to the unregulated market, then all the \nmoney moves over to the unregulated area.\n  I appreciated this New York Times editorial that said:\n\n       If [end users] are exempted, potentially trillions of \n     dollars worth of transactions could avoid the exposure--and \n     stability--that comes with exchange trading.\n\n  That is what we are going to debate about, whether you are going to \nhave that kind of oversight and make sure that we end up putting the \nkind of regulations we need in place.\n  As another New York Times editorial said:\n\n       Strong derivatives reform is a matter of putting taxpayers \n     first--ahead of the big banks and corporate America that are \n     fighting hard for a return to the risky business as usual.\n\n  We don't need risky business as usual. We need to reform these \nmarkets. Let's get capital flowing again and get innovation in products \nand services in important areas of our economy and know that having \nfundamental rules in markets and capitalism is to have transparency, \nand the legislation we are considering will do just that. Hopefully, \nthe Republicans will say what true reforms they are for and realize \nthat, in the past, they have been against some of the derivatives \nreforms that would have stopped us from having this crisis.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/27/senate-section/article/S2678-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2678-S2680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CMS REPORT ON HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor as someone who \npracticed medicine in Casper, WY, for 25 years. I was an orthopedic \nsurgeon for the people of Wyoming, as well as medical director of the \nWyoming Health Fair Program, which reached across the State with low-\ncost health care screenings, aimed at giving people the opportunity to \ntake more responsibility for their own health and essentially keep down \nthe costs and get down the cost of their medical care.\n  Today, I come to the floor with a second opinion on what this Senate \nhas passed, what the House has passed, and what has been signed into \nlaw by the President. I come today because I continue to believe that \nwhat is now the law of the land with health care reform is going to be \nbad for patients, bad for providers, the nurses and doctors, and those \nwho take care of our patients, and bad for payers--the American \npeople--who end up paying the bill for health care in this country--the \ntaxpayers of this Nation, people who pay for their own care. I believe \nfundamentally, as this bill has been passed into law, it is going to \nresult in higher costs for patients, as well as for taxpayers, less \naccess to care for people all across America, and unsustainable \nspending at a time when we are running record deficits.\n  That is not just my opinion. If you ask what the public believes, in \npolling across the country the American people have overwhelmingly \nrejected this bill that is now signed into law by the President, \nbecause they believe the cost of their own personal care is going to go \nup and the quality of their own personal care is going to go down. \nFundamentally, they believe this bill was not passed for them but for \nsomeone else.\n  The reason I come to the floor today to talk about it is because the \nreport has just come out by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices Actuary, Richard Foster, the Chief Actuary. He has come out \nwith a report to go through methodically, page by page, what is \nactually in the health care bill. You will remember that when the bill \nwas in front of the House, the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said \nyou will have to pass the bill before you get to find out what is in \nit. In a rush by this body to pass the bill--which to me was \nirresponsible--they have missed the things the Actuary has outlined now \nin a very thorough report to the American people. I want to go through \nthat with you.\n  Fundamentally, this says that health care costs are going to be \nhigher, access to care is going to go down, and the spending is \nunsustainable. It is fascinating, because this is in light of a speech \nby President Obama in June of 2009, when he said if any bill arrived \nfrom Congress to his desk that is not controlling costs, ``that is not \na bill I can support.'' He said it is going to have to control costs.\n  Well, the Actuary tells us that the bill now signed into law by the \nPresident, as well as the additional bill, because there are actually \ntwo new laws--one the initial bill and then the fix-it bill--will \nincrease costs, raise Federal spending, threaten access to care for \nseniors, and will result in higher insurance premiums.\n  That is not a Republican Senator saying that; that is the Chief \nActuary for the United States in charge of Medicare and Medicaid in a \nwell-documented report that came out April 22, 2010.\n  What is actually in the report? Let's go through it page by page. The \nfirst thing is, it says this is going to bend the spending curve--the \nrate at which we are spending on health care in the country. The \nPresident said we want to get the spending cost curve down. This says \nthe opposite, that the cost curve is going to go up. That is on page 2.\n  Turning to page 4, What about overall national spending on health \ncare over the next 10 years? Between 2010 and 2019, national spending \non health care is going to go up by $311 billion. The President said he \nwanted a bill that was actually going to get the cost of care and \nspending down on health care.\n  Turn to page 7. The President said he wants to make sure if you have \ncare you like, you can keep it--keep the care you like. We all heard \nthat. We heard it time and time again. Yet, on page 7 in this report by \nthe President's agency, it says about 14 million people will lose their \nemployer coverage by 2019. Again, the President said if you like what \nyou have, you can keep it. His Actuary, who actually did the numbers on \nthe bill, said, sorry, 14 million people will lose their employer \ncoverage by 2019.\n  Let's turn to page 8. An estimated 23 million people will remain \nuninsured by 2019. This is at a time when the President said he wanted \nto provide coverage for all these people. But even 10 years out, 23 \nmillion people will still remain uninsured in the United States. Many \nof them are going to have to pay a penalty because of that. They will \nbe\n\n[[Page S2679]]\n\nfined because that is how the rule and that is how the law has been \nwritten.\n\n  I talked with a lot of seniors. I was home this past weekend in \nWyoming visiting with a number of seniors around the State. I was in \nTorrington, WY, and Casper visiting with folks. They are concerned \nabout their Medicare.\n  What does the report say about Medicare? Turn to page 9: \nUnsustainable. The cuts we are looking at are going to become \nunsustainable even within the next 10 years. With the cuts to Medicare \nof over $500 billion, one would think at a time when we are looking at \nmore and more seniors coming of age to be on Medicare that we would \nhave used that specific Medicare money to keep it in Medicare, use it \nto save Medicare, not to start an entirely new government program.\n  As you work your way through this, you say: What does this mean for \nseniors on Medicare? That gets us to page 9 and page 10 of the national \nreport of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. These are the \npeople who know. They looked into the numbers. They said they did not \nhave time to do it while the House and the Senate were rushing to pass \nthe bill. They said we should have given more thought and time to this \nbill.\n  What happened when they actually looked at what has been signed into \nlaw? They talk about cuts to providers, to the people who take care of \nthe patients on Medicare. They are expecting many providers, medical \nprofessionals to ``end their participation in the program.'' This is \ngoing to jeopardize access to patient care.\n  The report says 15 percent of all the hospitals in this country, all \nthe nursing homes in this country, and similar providers--we are \ntalking about home health care agencies, that link, that lifeline to \npeople who are at home needing care; hospice, for people who are in the \nfinal days of their lives--about 15 percent of all of them, as a result \nof the way this bill has been put together, are likely to be operating \nat a financial loss by 2019.\n  Are they going to be able to stay open? Are they going to be able to \nprovide care for people? Absolutely not. Are they going to close down? \nVery likely. Is that going to impact a lot of rural communities across \nthis country? Absolutely.\n  As we go through this actuary report, it brings to light what Nancy \nPelosi meant when she said we have to pass the bill to find out what is \nin it. What a shame it is that the American people, although they \nsensed what was in it, had to wait until this point so they could \ncontinue to express their concerns to those who voted in favor of it.\n  Let's take a look at some other provisions. Those who supported this \nbill said there are other Medicare savings provisions in the bill that \nwill help save money and that will help control future health care \ngrowth. No--the report on page 13--they said those things people in \nthis Chamber said would help control future health care costs would \nhave a ``negligible financial impact over the next 10 years''--\n``Negligible financial impact over the next 10 years''--even though \nMembers of this Senate stood on the other side of the aisle and \nabsolutely swore that this was going to improve care, as well as get \ndown the cost of care.\n  Let's turn to page 15 of the report, the CLASS Act. That is the long-\nterm care insurance program that so many in this Chamber thought was \ngoing to be a wonderful thing, and those on my side of the aisle said: \nThis cannot work. The numbers are not going to work for our country. \nThey are not going to work for this bill. Who are you trying to kid?\n  The Democrats who supported the CLASS Act were not able to kid the \npeople at the Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services. No, they saw right through it. But, of course, the \nreport came out after the bill had been signed into law by the \nPresident.\n  What the report says is that the CLASS Act faces ``a significant risk \nof failure''--``a significant risk of failure.'' It says there is a \nvery serious risk that the CLASS Act program will be unsustainable. \nPeople on this side of the aisle said that. We said it before the vote. \nWe heard from the other side of the aisle: Oh, no, you have it all \nwrong. People who looked at it and know--and these are the President's \nown people--said: Unsustainable.\n  What about premiums for insurance? Last year the President said he \nexpects to lower the health care premiums for the average family in \nthis country by $2,500. That is an incredibly admirable goal, something \nall Americans would support because, after all, early on the President \nsaid: My goal is to get down the cost of care, clearly something he \nabandoned early on.\n  What this says on page 17 of the report from the Actuary is that the \nnew laws, fees, and excise taxes, higher drug prices, device prices--\nthis is all going to result in higher insurance premiums for American \nfamilies, the exact opposite of what the President promised.\n  Let's go to page 16 because we have talked about funds allocated for \nthe new high-risk insurance pools. I think it is important to have \nthese pools. They work well in various States. A number of States have \nthese pools. It is a commitment by the State. We want to involve the \nFederal Government, have people working together with folks with \npreexisting conditions, people who absolutely need care.\n  The CMS report says what this body has done is insufficient. It says \nthe amount of money they decided to put in this program is going to be \nexhausted by the year 2012. Once again, this body who said they knew \nbetter than the folks who studied the bill, those who said we just have \nto pass it to get something done, have created a monster, and the \nAmerican people are going to be paying the price for a long time.\n  Let's look now to page 20. So many of the people who are going to be \ncovered under this program, how are they going to be covered? The \nPresident said: I want to cover all these people. What he decided to do \nand what this body decided to do is to cram another 18 million people \non to Medicaid, a program we know right now is fundamentally flawed. It \nis broken. Half the doctors in the country do not want to see patients \non Medicaid because the reimbursement to them is so low. Hospitals tell \nyou they lose money when those patients are in the hospital. Doctors \nsay they cannot keep their offices open if they take more and more \nMedicaid patients. The only way they are allowed to see them is by \ncharging other patients more--the cost shifting that happens in health \ncare in America.\n  What does this say about Medicaid? Eighteen million more people are \ngoing to be put on Medicaid by the year 2019. Is that going to be care? \nThe President talks about coverage, but he does not talk about care. \nThese people are very unlikely to get care.\n  This is what the report says on page 20: A significant portion of the \nincreased demand for Medicaid services, because there are all these \nmillions more people on Medicaid, the increased demand for Medicaid \nservices could be difficult to meet. All these patients are going to be \nput on Medicaid, and they are not going to be able to get care.\n  I say it is hardly fair and it is misleading to the American people. \nEverybody in Canada has coverage. They have coverage but they cannot \nget care. Madam President, 33,000 Canadians came to the United States \nlast year to pay for their own health care because even though they had \ncoverage in Canada, they could not get care there. So they came to the \nUnited States and paid for care.\n  About a year ago when the President of the United States was talking \nabout health care, he always held up the Mayo Clinic for excellent care \nin America, and it is a model for excellent care. The Mayo Clinic said: \nWe do not want more Medicaid patients, because they lose too much money \nby taking those people, and they want to keep their doors open to \nfulfill their mission.\n  Here we have the Actuary who is looking at this page by page--and, \nobviously, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services knows what \nthey are talking about. They looked at the numbers and item after item, \npage by page and said: This is not working.\n  One of the things we talked about at the Health Care Summit was the \nissue of Medicare fraud. I sat at the table and discussed the issue \nwith the President. This law does almost nothing--almost nothing--to \nlimit actual fraud and abuse.\n\n  Last year, Medicare paid $47 billion in claims that were suspect. We \nknow in Florida, drug dealers have been moving from dealing in drugs to \nMedicare\n\n[[Page S2680]]\n\nfraud. One may say: Why? Why would they do that? They are doing it for \na couple of reasons: One, it is more profitable; two, it is less likely \nthey will get caught; and, third, if they do get caught the penalty is \nless. They say: More profit, less chance of getting caught, less \npunishment. I think I ought to go into Medicare fraud. That is what \nthey are doing.\n  What does the Actuary say when he looks at the new bill? He estimates \nthe fraud provision in the law will save only about 2 percent, only $1 \nout of every $50 of Medicare fraud.\n  As we look at this, it is no surprise the American people want a \nsecond opinion about this bill. It is no surprise the American people \nare saying it is time to repeal and replace the bill. That is why I \ncome to the floor of the Senate with my second opinion, with 25 years \nof practicing medicine.\n  On the way over, I picked up USA Today. It is so interesting, a big \nstory in the paper today: ``Next Phase In Health Care War: Applying The \nLaw.'' The subheadline is ``Cabinet''--we are talking about the \nPresident's Cabinet, the Cabinet of the United States--``Cabinet Braces \nFor Lobbying Blitz By Industry Advocates.'' The Cabinet is bracing for \na lobbying blitz. I thought the President of the United States said he \ndid not want lobbyists in the White House, did not want lobbyists \nimpacting on his Cabinet. They are weighing right in. Absolutely.\n  The President did have them in the White House, obviously behind \nclosed doors, cutting the deals. That is the way we ended up with a \nhealth care bill that is bad for patients, bad for providers, and bad \nfor payers, the American payers, the taxpayers of this country, and the \npeople who are paying for their health care. That is why I come to the \nfloor to say it is time to repeal this legislation and replace it with \nlegislation that is actually patient centered, that gives more \nresponsibility and opportunities for individual patients, just what I \ntried to do through the Wyoming health fairs where we give people more \ninformation so they can use that information to get their cholesterol \ndown, get their blood pressure under control, find out if they are \ndiabetic and if they are, get their blood sugar under control, give \npeople incentives to stay healthy and keep down the cost of their care.\n  We need a patient-centered health care bill. We sure do not have one. \nWe need a health care bill that allows people to buy insurance across \nState lines. That increased competition will drive down the cost of \ncare.\n  The University of Minnesota did a study: 12 million more Americans \nwould have insurance today without this bill if all we did was allow \nAmericans to buy insurance across State lines and allow small groups to \njoin together to get better opportunities to buy insurance to get the \ncost down.\n  Then, of course, we need to deal with abusive lawsuits that exist in \nthis country which drive up the cost of care for patients because all \nthe tests that doctors routinely order are not to help the patient get \nbetter but to make sure the doctor does not miss something.\n  That is why I come here today to tell you, Madam President, that \nthere are things that will work to get down the cost of care. There are \nthings that will work to provide additional treatment for more people \nin America; more patients, better care. But they are not in this health \ncare bill that passed the House, passed the Senate, and was signed into \nlaw by the President.\n  That is why today I offer my second opinion that it is time to repeal \nthis bill and replace it with what will work.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, all time until 12:30 \np.m. and from 2:15 to 4:30 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled \nbetween the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the business we \nhave in front of us here in the Senate, financial regulatory reform. \nBut I did want to note that we meet in an hour of real economic trauma \nfor many families across America and across the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania.\n  I know the Presiding Officer sees this as well in his home State of \nNew Mexico. We have lots of people out of work. And although there is \nno question in my mind that our economy has begun to recover, and has \nrecovered substantially, we still have a way to go. So even as we \ndebate financial reform and the intricacies of that, it is important \nthat we remember there are still a lot of people out of work.\n  The latest numbers nationally are that 15 million people are without \nwork across America, and in Pennsylvania it is 582,000 people. I was \nlooking at the numbers for the month of March, region by region in \nPennsylvania. We have 14 labor markets, the numbers of which are \ncharted on a monthly basis. Looking at the areas of the State where it \nis above our unemployment rate, we have several parts of Pennsylvania \nwhere, if it is not 10 percent, it is very close to that. In Erie, PA, \nup in northwestern Pennsylvania, it is a 10-percentage point \nunemployment. I realize for some States they have been in double-digit \nfigures for a while, but for places such as Erie, it is 10 percent.\n  The Lehigh Valley, on the eastern side of our State, is getting close \nto 10. It is 9.8. My home area of northeastern Pennsylvania is 9.8. \nJohnstown's numbers, an area in southwestern Pennsylvania, which has \nalways had higher numbers of unemployment, are getting close to 10. So \nthroughout our State the numbers are very high.\n  When people in any State see those high numbers and they see the \njoblessness, they see people who have lost their homes or job or both, \nwhen they see that people have lost their hopes and dreams in this \nprocess, when they see all that around them, either in their own lives \nor the lives of their families and neighbors, they look to Washington \nto see what we are doing about it. They want to know: How can you \nrespond to that? How can you take action to help us?\n  I think we have, in some measure, but this Wall Street reform is \ngoing to be part of it as well. We passed the Recovery bill, which is \nhaving an impact. We passed the HIRE Act a couple of months ago, and \nthat is having an impact, and will have more of an impact as time goes \nby. So there have been a series of jobs bills that have helped \nsubstantially, and will continue to help, but one of the most urgent \npriorities and questions most Americans have is, who is going to be on \nour side? Who will fight for us when it comes to whether we will \nempower local communities to create jobs and have some security?\n  Will we continue to empower Wall Street and the dealmakers, the scam \nartists who have ripped people off to make a profit? And not just a \nprofit, what we used to think of as a lot of money--$1 million. We are \ntalking about profits we cannot even begin to comprehend. A very small \nnumber of Americans, a very small number of institutions, such as these \nmegabanks, are getting these profits purely out of greed and purely out \nof a willingness to cast aside people's lives and their futures, \nwithout worry as to whether the actions they take on Wall Street will\n\n[[Page S2681]]\n\ncause people to lose their jobs. That is what people across the \ncountry, who are not on Wall Street, are asking us to consider.\n  Of course, part of that is happening in this debate. But I think it \nhas become more apparent to the American people on this question of \nwhose side we are on, that there is one side--this side of the aisle--\nthat is trying not only to get the policy right and get a bill \nprepared, but that we are trying to move that bill forward. One of the \nways we move a bill forward is to have a debate. Why shouldn't the \nSenate be having a debate, unless there is a question about whether you \nare on one side or the other?\n  I think our friends on the other side of the aisle are going to have \nto ask themselves whether they are on the side of the people; if they \nare on the side of communities and small businesses, who are telling us \nto get something done about these Wall Street problems that have caused \n15 million people to lose their job--and in Pennsylvania we have lost \n582,000, as said I before. People are wondering, whose side are you on? \nIf you are not on the side of debate and getting the bill passed, then \nyou are on the side of Wall Street. It is very simple. I know some of \nthe policy gets complicated, but this isn't complicated at all.\n  If you are on the side of the megabanks and Wall Street, here is what \nyou are on the side of: You are on the side of continuing what has \nhappened for a generation now, with our usual and more familiar banking \nsystem that has been altered in a way so that it has become almost \nunrecognizable to people who used to walk down the street, \nfiguratively, but almost literally, or walk or drive not too very far \nin a community and go to a bank. They knew the institution. They knew \nthe people who worked there. They knew who was in charge. They dealt \nwith a banker in a very personal way.\n\n  A lot of that is gone. If we do the right thing here, I think we can \nbring some of that sense back. But at a minimum, put the brakes on, put \nrules in place to govern what the scam artists on Wall Street do every \nday of the week to make a profit, to rip people off, and to destroy our \neconomy and to cause record-high unemployment.\n  In that scenario I talked about before, what we used to have was that \npeople knew their bankers. They knew each party was invested in the \nother. The banker wanted to make a good loan, obviously. That was part \nof his or her business. But he or she knew that making that loan had to \nbe on good terms, in a way that borrower could pay it back. Obviously, \nthe borrower--going to the local bank as a local business, to people \nthey knew--was invested in their success as well. The borrower wanted \nthe bank to do well. It was part of their community. But now we have a \nsystem where, if you enter into a mortgage transaction, that flies off \nto Wall Street, and then on Wall Street they slice and dice it so a lot \nof wealthy people make record profits, and they laugh--laugh all the \nway to the bank, not worrying about whose life was destroyed back in \nthat community.\n  These megabanks have prospered in ways we cannot even begin to \ndescribe or appreciate. We continue, so to speak back home, grappling \nwith the results of that, the aftermath of that: high unemployment--\nrecord-high numbers--and a ballooning deficit. Why are we even having a \ndebate--trying to have a debate, I should say, if our friends get to \nthe point of allowing us to have a debate--why are we having this \ndebate? Because Wall Street put the American people into this position.\n  We need to reinvent this megabank model, change it substantially, and \nmove it toward a system of smaller banks and more competition. I \nthought that is what our friends were for. I thought they were in favor \nof competition.\n  Many people know community bankers. The Independent Community Bankers \nof America say there are almost 8,000 community banks operating across \nthe country. Even with this problem we have with megabanks and Wall \nStreet, those 8,000 community banks are still 97 percent of our banks. \nThat is the good news, that that number is high. These institutions, as \nwe know, have boards of directors made up of people in the community, \nas it should be, who are invested in the community and the success of \nthose borrowers. They are also institutions that are a lot smaller in \nterms of size. In terms of asset size, 91 percent of community banks \nhave assets of less than $1 billion. They are nowhere near a big bank \nand nowhere near, obviously, a megabank.\n  The largest of our megabanks is Bank of America, which, by September \n2009--and I am sure the number is much higher today, but as of \nSeptember 2009, it had assets of $2.3 trillion. It is hard to describe \nthat. That is most of the Federal budget. We have a Federal budget that \nis several trillion. That is a big share, if you equate it to the \nentire Federal budget--not the full budget but certainly a big share of \nit, $2.3 trillion.\n  Consumers do not reap huge benefits from these banks. We know that. \nIf anything, they are harmed by the unchecked power of these banks.\n  As I said last week, three of our largest megabanks have cut \nparticipation in a key Small Business Administration lending program by \nbetween 85 percent and 90 percent from one year to the next. Just at \nthe time we have a bad economy--that they caused, in large measure--and \njust at the time we need help for small businesses, these same big \nbanks that got the benefit of all of that wealth and all of that scam \nartistry and fraud, in some cases, are not helping us create jobs in \nsmall business. To say that is perverted and disturbing does not even \nbegin to capture the sentiment. But I will not dwell on that.\n  Then we get to the question of fees, bank fees. We have heard a lot \nabout these. We all have experienced it. Fees for checking accounts and \nother services are lower at community banks than at the megabanks, the \nbig institutions. According to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of \nDallas, in one quarter last year, the four largest megabanks raised \nfees related to deposits by an average of 8 percent. In the same \nperiod, community banks lowered their fees by an average of 12 percent. \nSo in one quarter last year, the four big banks raised their fees by an \naverage of 8 percent and the smaller community banks lowered those same \nfees. That is another reason community banks make a lot more sense for \nmost Americans.\n  The reason for the big difference in fees charged by the smaller \ncommunity banks versus the big mega Wall Street banks is not just that \nthey want to try to be consumer or customer friendly, it is because \nthere is competition injected into the system of community banks. \nEconomist Simon Johnson said:\n\n       With low interest rates, the [big] banks could raise money \n     from depositors virtually for free; they could borrow cheaply \n     from each other; they could borrow cheaply at the Fed's \n     discount window; they could sell bonds at low interest rates \n     because of FDIC debt guarantees; they could swap their asset-\n     backed securities for cash with the Fed; they could sell \n     their mortgages to Fannie and Freddie . . . and so on.\n\n  It is like dot, dot, dot. We have heard all about this. They had all \nthe opportunities in the world. Their plate was full: I am a big \nmegabank, and I need a little extra help here to make some more \nmillions for this guy or that guy or to make billions for the bank or \nfor individual bankers. I need a little help, so I will go to the Fed \ndiscount window. That was one option. I just charge a little more over \nhere.\n  They had all these options to make more money--because of the \ngenerosity of the Federal Government, by the way, in large measure. The \nFederal Government helps a lot of institutions every day of the week, \nincluding banks. The same folks who complain about government want \nbankers to get all the help in the world from government.\n  The big banks had all these options at their disposal if they got \ninto a period where they needed a little extra help. What about the \nborrower who got into a bad mortgage because some local scam artist or \nmaybe a scam artist on Wall Street put them into a mortgage they \ncouldn't afford? What happens when they can't pay their mortgage? What \nhappens when they lose their job and then can't pay the mortgage and \nlose health care? Do they have a menu, a list, a full plate, or a full \ntable of options? No. They have very few options. For a lot of \nAmericans who lost their job because of Wall Street or who lost their \nhouse because of what Wall Street was doing or lost their livelihood \nbecause of some fraud\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\non Wall Street or some scam artist on Wall Street, they have very few \noptions. But the big banks have lots of options.\n  This is not just about what is fair and what is right and making sure \nwe have competition in our banking system. It is more than that. It is \nabout a gross disparity of power residing on Wall Street and injuring \nthe ability of people just to make ends meet, just to have a job, or \njust to be able to borrow money in a way that will allow them to \npurchase a house or do something else in their lives.\n  What this means is, despite offering better and cheaper consumer \nproducts, our community banks at the local level are struggling to get \nby, while their big brothers, their megabank brothers are on Wall \nStreet making more money than we can even compute or comprehend. The \ncommunity banks, which used to be the foundation of our system and the \nplace where people could go to borrow, are having trouble, are \nstruggling to get by.\n  One of the ways to confront this is not just to pass a bill that \nsounds good here and there and looks like reform but to have a final \nproduct after debate. Again, I hope our friends will get to the point \nof debating this bill. It makes sense that if something is very \nimportant and the American people say do something about it, you ought \nto debate it and pass it--just a little free advice to the other side.\n  But we have to do more than just pass something; we have to pass \nsomething that works. We have to pass something that will be meaningful \nin the lives of real people. If we allow these megabanks to retain \ntheir power and their influence and their wealth, to the detriment of \nworking families, small businesses, and our economy in general--if we \nallow them to have that power, it will be nice to pass a bill, but we \nwill not be getting to the root cause or one of the root causes of our \nproblem.\n\n  That is why I and Senator Kaufman, Senator Brown, and others are \nsupporting the SAFE Banking Act. I thank those two Senators for their \nwork on this over a long period of time. This will be an amendment to \nthe act we are working on, the Restoring Financial Stability Act of \n2010. This part of it, this will be a new element to it if we can get \nthe amendment agreed to--I think we can--to the SAFE Banking Act. This \nis what it will do--basically, four things. I will go through them \nquickly. First of all, impose a 10-percent cap on any bank share of the \ntotal deposits of government-backed depository institutions, so placing \na cap on that. Place a 2-percent-of-GDP limit on all nondeposit \nliabilities, so limiting and circumscribing what these megabanks can \ndo. Third, place a 3-percent-of-GDP limit on all nondeposit \nliabilities, including any off-balance-sheet provisions as well as any \nsystemically significant nonbank financial institution. Fourth, we \nwould put into law a 6-percent leverage limit for bank holding \ncompanies and selected nonbank financial institutions.\n  So instead of leaving size limitations in the hands of regulators--\nand I know regulators work hard and they always try to do the right \nthing in almost every instance--this amendment would at long last put \nsome clearly defined rules in place about the size and the leverage of \nfinancial institutions. We can't just say: OK, megabank, you can do \nwhatever you want, you can get bigger and do whatever you want, and \nafter the fact we will have some regulators try to mitigate the damage \nyou are causing or try to rein you in a little bit. Sometimes that \nworks, but our recent history tells us it is not going to work the way \nit should. So we need some clearly defined rules that apply to these \nmegabanks and would only impact a handful of institutions, a very small \nnumber of institutions--these large megabanks that are at the heart of \nthe problem.\n  The alternative to placing these limitations on the big banks, on \ntheir size and the leverage they have, is a continuation of the system \nwe have right now, the so-called too-big-to-fail system. So a bank gets \nso big and has so many tentacles out into our economy and across the \nworld that we say: Gosh, if they are in trouble, we can't let them go. \nThey are too big and have too much of an impact if they fail. We have \nto help them.\n  In addition to passing a law that ends bailouts, we also have to end \nthis too big to fail. It is kind of a straitjacket our system has been \nin: it does not allow us much freedom, but it gives a soft landing to a \nlot of these megabanks that really should be cut down in size. We know \nwe need to change that.\n  I commend the efforts to increase the ability of regulators to \noversee and enforce discipline, but candidly--and I think our history \nshows this--it is not enough. It is not enough to just give regulators \nmore power or more resources. We need to pull apart or deconstruct in \nsome measure these megabanks because they are too big, too powerful, \nand they have caused too much damage. Having a regulatory system in \nplace will not be enough. That is why we need the SAFE Banking Act.\n  We also need to take other steps to address this root cause as well \nas other root causes. We know community banks are banks that are better \nfor families and for small businesses--the two parts of our society, \nthe two parts of our economy, our families and our small businesses. \nThey are saying to us: Do something that is real. Do something that not \nonly makes sense in terms of policy but will help at the local level in \nterms of improving our economy.\n  So more banks mean more competition, and they also mean more \ncustomer-friendly products. It also means more loans for small \nbusinesses that get them from community banks and will continue to if \nwe do the right thing. It means a retail banking system that more \nclosely resembles our Nation's community banks than the Wall Street \nmodel that has indeed failed us--and that is an understatement--and \nfailed us significantly.\n  So that is why I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto support the SAFE Act amendment to our financial reform legislation. \nIt is about that we took a step that has real meaning and real impact \non one of the biggest problems we have in America, where you have \nmegabanks that are doing quite well, and if we allow them to continue \nto do well, they will have a few individuals in a few institutions \nacross America who will benefit from that.\n  But most of the rest of us, most people, especially those out of \nwork, most small businesses, will not benefit from these megabanks. We \nneed to change this, and we need to do it in the course of this debate.\n  I would once again say to my colleagues, if we debate it, it will \ntell us very clearly whose side we are on. If you continue to hold up \ndebate, I think the American people know whose side you are on. It is \nnot their side.\n  I ask unanimous consent that any time in quorum calls on the motion \nto proceed to S. 3217 during today's session be divided equally between \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n[[Page S2683]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wanted to rise to speak further about \nthis financial reform bill. Yesterday, I talked at some length about \nthe problems I saw with the bill relative to section 106 in the \nderivatives language. Today, I want to talk about things that are not \nin the bill that should have been in the bill.\n  The reason I am rising to talk about this bill, which is a very \ncomplex bill, and intricate, is because we on our side feel very \nstrongly that we should be involved in the negotiations of a better \nbill. We are not asking that there be no bill; just the opposite. We \nare saying there is a lot in this bill that just plain needs to be \nimproved.\n  For example, in the area of too big to fail, we have to make \nabsolutely sure, if a company is large and it gets into trouble and it \noverextends itself, that it fails; that the American taxpayer doesn't \ncome in and support that company in the financial sector, or anybody \nelse, as a matter of fact, such as the automobile sector. So that \nlanguage in the bill needs to be tightened up. It doesn't accomplish \nthat as effectively as we think it should.\n  The derivatives language has some serious problems. I talked \nyesterday about one of them, but there are a whole series of problems. \nThe purpose of the derivatives part of this bill should be, No. 1, to \nreduce systemic risk and make sure that, prospectively, we do \neverything we can to make these instruments--which are critical to the \nability of the economy to be liquid and produce credit--are as safe and \nas sound as possible, while at the same time making sure we do not \noverreact and create a situation where this market--which is so crucial \nto manufacturers across this country and especially to Main Street, \nwhich basically benefits from the credit generated by derivatives--\ndoesn't artificially contract due to excessive regulation, or that it \ndoesn't go overseas. So we lose the fact that we are today at the \ncenter of capital and credit. We want to be the best place in the world \nto create capital and to create credit, and we should have a bill that \naccomplishes that.\n  I have been outlining concerns I have in the derivatives area--\nyesterday I talked about section 106--and I could highlight a number of \nother areas. For example, the immediacy with which derivatives are \npushed from a clearinghouse into an exchange situation, which I don't \nthink will work under this bill. I think, basically, it would contract \nthe market dramatically.\n  But what I want to speak to specifically are the things left out of \nthis bill that should be addressed in order to make sure we don't have \nhappen again what happened in September of 2008 and on into the rest of \nthat year, which was that tremendous trauma that our Nation went \nthrough and is just now coming out of--and for some people it is still \na trauma because they don't have a job, which is the worst trauma of \nall for somebody. That trauma was caused by some very distinct and \nspecific events that occurred, and a lot of them were the \nresponsibility of the Congress.\n  If we want to look for who is the cause of the downturn and the \ncrisis in the subprime market, we can look at ourselves in the mirror \nand say: We are, to a large degree. Easy money was also a problem. But \nI think right at the center of the problem was the collapse of \nunderwriting standards in this country.\n  It used to be, up through the 1990s, you couldn't get a loan for much \nmore than 85 percent of the value of the home. You had to put some \nmoney down, and you had to be able to show to the person who was \nlending you the money--the mortgagor--that you could pay the money \nback. Well, we went into this huge expansion in lending which was \ndriven in large part by two things: One, the monetary policy of the \nFed, which basically allowed for easy money to flow out there very \nquickly into the market; and, secondly, the Congress, specifically \ninsisting everybody should be able to have a home whether they could \nafford it or not or whether the home was properly valued. Those two \nfactors lead to an explosion in home ownership, equally leading to an \nexplosion in mortgages which, first, did not meet the value of the \nunderlying asset and, in fact, in some instances were actually valued \nat more than the asset even at the time they were issued.\n  Almost all these subprime mortgages presumed there would always be an \nappreciation of real estate prices, so they could loan at 100 percent \nand at some point you would be down to 85 percent or 90 percent of the \nvalue. That didn't happen, of course. The value went down, and so the \nmortgages went underwater in terms of their basic value. Secondly, the \nmonies were lent to individuals who, because of the way they structured \nthese loans for the first 2 or 3 years, could pay the interest or the \nmortgage payment, but as soon as these loans reset to a realistic \ninterest rate, they couldn't pay it. Everybody knew it when they did \nthe loan.\n  Now, why did people do that? Why was there this collapse in \nunderwriting standards? Well, there were a lot of reasons. I happen to \nthink probably the primary one was that we separated the owner of the \nloan from the actual loanmaking process. Therefore, the people who were \noriginating the loans weren't interested in the underlying security. \nThey were not even interested in whether the person could pay it back. \nThey were only interested in the fees they were generating. So we had a \ncollapse in the underwriting standards. We had an inverted pyramid, \nwith this person down here borrowing money from this entity over here \non a piece of property which wasn't worth the value at which money was \nbeing borrowed. The person borrowing the money couldn't pay it back, \nbut nobody cared because that loan was then taken and sold and \nsecuritized and subdivided and syndicated and sometimes put into a \nsynthetic instrument, or had a synthetic instrument mirroring it. So we \nhad this loan down here, and this massive structure from the churning \nof that loan on top of it, and the loan wouldn't support all that \nstructure over it. So it all collapsed on us in late 2008.\n  This bill, however, doesn't address that issue of underwriting \nstandards in any effective way. Senator Isakson and I have spoken about \nthis on the Senate floor a number of times, and we are going to offer \nwhat we hope is a bipartisan proposal. But it will improve the bill \nbecause it will basically be taking us back to the underwriting \nstandards that used to be in place in the 1990s, not only for the \norigination of the loan but also for the securitizer of the loan. This \nis critical. If we are going to fix this problem--and the purpose of \nthe bill should be to fix the problem that created the crisis and make \nsure it doesn't occur again--if that is the real goal, then there \nshould be underwriting standards.\n  The second issue in this bill that is not addressed is Fannie and \nFreddie. These two entities have trillions of dollars of outstanding \nliability, outstanding notes, and it is estimated that the taxpayer has \na $400 billion to $500 billion--that is $\\1/2\\ trillion--of liability \nbecause a lot of these notes aren't ever going to be paid back. Yet \nFannie and Freddie are still operating almost in a business-as-usual \nmindset, pushing money out the door, buying up bonds and notes and \nmortgages, and doing it almost as if there is no end to the taxpayers' \npocketbook.\n  In fact, we don't even put Fannie and Freddie on the Federal balance \nsheet. We know, since we own 80 percent of those companies that the \ntaxpayer is on the hook for this debt--this $400 billion to $500 \nbillion of debt. This bill acts as if it doesn't even exist, and yet \nthat was one of the primary drivers of the economic collapse of 2008, \nfrom which we are all suffering and have suffered. So this bill should \nhave at least an initial step into the arena of how we are going to \nhandle this issue of straightening out the GSEs, as they are called.\n  The first step is that we ought to bring their liabilities onto our \nbooks so that the taxpayers aren't being lied to; so that we are \ntelling the truth to the American people as to how much it will cost to \nstraighten this out and we have started thinking about how we are going \nto straighten it out. Yet this bill doesn't do that. That is a place \nwhere we, as Republicans--and I think a lot of other people--would like \nto see this bill improved, and that is why we are opposing going \nforward with the bill in its present form until we are allowed to \nparticipate in the negotiations on improving it. That is what this is \nall about.\n\n  The third issue, of course, is the credit rating agencies. We know \nwithout\n\n[[Page S2684]]\n\nany question that the credit rating agencies failed miserably, and \npeople relied on their information, their credit rating of varied \nsecurities. That is one of the primary reasons people were willing to \nbuy a lot of the instruments that were floating around. They believed, \ngenerally, when the credit rating agency said it was a triple-A rated \nsecurity, that they had done their due diligence and it was a triple-A \nrated security. It turned out it wasn't, in many instances.\n  As a result, it was sloppy underwriting again, by people or financial \nhouses that were willing to buy these securitized products, the CDOs \nand various other products. They didn't do the heavy lifting of \neveryone going and looking at the actual assets which were backing up \nthese products. They relied on the rating agencies, and the rating \nagencies didn't do their job either.\n  So we have this serious issue with rating agencies that needs to be \naddressed. It is not effectively addressed in this bill. But we cannot \ncorrect the problems which created the 2008 crisis and caused this very \nsevere recession and put this country through this tremendous trauma \nunless we address that issue, along with underwriting standards, GSEs, \nand credit rating agencies. So Republicans are saying: Let's look at \nthat and try to fix that. That is why we don't want to go forward until \nwe are brought to the table and allowed to address that issue.\n  Another question: They have filled this bill with all sorts of \nextraneous things that had absolutely nothing to do--absolutely nothing \nto do--with the housing crisis and the economic meltdown that followed. \nA lot of corporate governance rules that have been kicking around this \ncity for a long time and that are the agenda of certain groups in this \ncity that have a political agenda dealing with wanting to have control \nover corporations--a lot of it influenced by organized labor--have been \nthrown into this bill willy-nilly. They had nothing, and they have \nnothing, to do with the overarching issues that affect protecting the \nmarket and making and giving us a sound financial system. Yet they are \nin this bill. They shouldn't be in this bill or, if they are going to \nbe in the bill, they should be significantly adjusted.\n  So these are some of our concerns. People ask: Well, why are the \nRepublicans stopping this bill at this point? Because we want a better \nbill, and we have specific proposals for accomplishing that. We want \nlanguage which does accomplish too big to fail and ends that policy. We \nwant language which makes the derivative market not only safe and not a \nsystemic risk but a sound and strong force for credit in this country. \nWe want language which addresses better underwriting standards. We want \nlanguage which addresses the issues of the GSEs. And we want language \nwhich addresses the failures of the credit rating agencies. We don't \nwant a lot of extraneous language which is simply brought along because \nthe train was leaving the station and it was thrown on it, and which, \nin many instances, in my mind at least, undermines rather than becomes \na constructive force for a better financial system in this country.\n  So those are our concerns, and that is why we are continuing to \ninsist that we be allowed to be at the table to negotiate these very \ncritical issues on this very complicated bill.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for showing me the courtesy of \nallowing me to go first, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, change is very hard in this country and in \nthis Chamber. Change is always hard. I was thinking, as we have been \nblocked from proceeding on the Wall Street reform bill, which is a very \nimportant issue, about what probably was the case on another big change \nat the turn of the last century, when Upton Sinclair wrote about the \nmeatpacking houses in this country.\n  He wrote a book called ``The Jungle'' and described his visit to the \nmeatpacking houses in Chicago and the unbelievably unsanitary \nconditions in those meatpacking houses--rats all around those \nmeatpacking houses. But that was all right because they poisoned the \nrats. They took loaves of bread and soaked them in poison, laid them \naround and then there were dead rats and all the other things that \nexisted in those meatpacking houses that went down the same chute, and \nout the back side came meat right to the grocery store and to the \nAmerican people, an unsuspecting public--the most unsanitary conditions \nin the world.\n  As a result of publishing the book, ``The Jungle,'' there was a \npublic outcry demanding that something be done. The Congress finally, \nat last, at long last, beat back the opposition of a very strong \nmeatpacking industry and passed safe food laws, creating the Food and \nDrug Administration. Change is so very hard. But people knew then \nsomething had to be done about that, and the American people know now \nsomething has to be done about this.\n  It is interesting to hear people come to the floor of the Senate and \nsay: Well, we are blocking a motion to proceed to go to a Wall Street \nreform bill because we want to make it better. Does anybody really \nbelieve that? They want to weaken it. They do not even want it in the \nfirst place, to the extent they can avoid it. That is why they didn't \ndo anything in the committee. There were negotiations for weeks in the \nBanking Committee. I was not there, but I am told by all involved there \nwere negotiations for weeks in the Banking Committee. Then they had a \nmarkup, and the Republicans didn't offer one suggestion.\n  If they have a whole backpack full of suggestions on how to improve \nthe bill, why was there not one amendment offered in the committee? So \nnow we have the spectacle of the desperate need for reforming Wall \nStreet finance in this country and the entire Republican caucus in the \nSenate votes no--every single one of them.\n  Well, let me describe what we are facing, if I might. This economic \ncollapse is not a stranger to most Americans. Somewhere around 15 or 16 \nmillion got out of bed this morning jobless, looking for work and can't \nfind work. They understand the cost of this economic collapse.\n  Here is what it has cost the taxpayer. By the way, we don't have all \nthese numbers. This was from an enterprising reporter at Bloomberg who \ndid good work. But the Federal Reserve bailout commitment, $7.8 \ntrillion; FDIC, $2 trillion; Treasury, $2.7 trillion; HUD, $300 \nbillion--that is $12.8 trillion, think about that, the amount of money \nlent, spent or committed on behalf of the American taxpayer to try to \nget out of this deep hole.\n  Even as we found ourselves in this deep hole--here, by the way, is \nwhat has happened to the biggest financial institutions in the country. \nGoing back 10 years ago, the Congress decided--in my judgment without \nany wisdom at all because I voted against it--to say let's homogenize \nall our big financial institutions. Congress said let's put them all in \none big basket, investment banks, FDIC-insured banks, real estate, \nsecurities, throw them all into one big old holding company and things \nwill be great. It will allow us to compete with the Europeans and \nothers much better.\n  They created these giant houses of cards. This is what happened the \nlargest financial institutions in the country got bigger and bigger. In \nfact, that is what has happened even during this collapse. Even in the \ngreatest recession since the Great Depression they have continued to \ngrow.\n  Let me again describe some of the origin of this, this cesspool of \ngreed that has existed in recent years, resulting in one person--I have \ntalked about him in the past--making $3.6 billion in just one year, \nbetting against America, selling short.\n  By the way, if you are wondering, that is $300 million a month or, if \nthis person's spouse asks: How are we doing, sweetheart, he can say we \nmade $10 million a day every single day.\n  This is on the Internet right now and this is the origin of all this \ngreed. It goes up from here, to a security, to a hedge fund, to an \ninvestment bank, and they are all making obscene profits right on up \nthrough the collapse. By the way, they are doing it again today. This \nis on the Internet. This is a company called EasyLoanForYou:\n\n       Get the loan you seek fast and hassle-free. Our lenders \n     will approve your loan immediately regardless of your credit \n     score or history.\n\n\n[[Page S2685]]\n\n\n  You need a loan? It doesn't matter how bad your credit is. Here is \none on the Internet. SpeedyBadCreditLoans. It says: Bad credit, no \nproblem. No credit, no problem.\n  How about bankruptcy? That is not a problem either. Come to us, ``Get \na guaranteed bad credit personal loan today.''\n  Yes, this is on the Internet today. Bad Credit Personal Loans, ``a \nChristian Faith Based Service.''\n  Previous bankruptcy? That is all right. No credit, bad credit, recent \ndivorce, need more money? No problem.\n  This is the origin of what was going on in this country and it is \nstill going on. By the way, you don't have to make interest payments or \nprincipal payments for the first 12 months, we will make them for you, \nand you don't have to document your income to us.\n  We wallpapered this country with this sort of nonsense, fundamentally \nignorant banking practices, and then turned them into securities and \nsold them up, up, up the chain. The fact is, everybody was making big \nfees. The rating companies were with their pom-poms, approving \neverything with AAA. Meanwhile, they were creating an entire house of \ncards. Unbelievable.\n  Today, there is a hearing going on and one of the largest investment \nbanks is under siege at that hearing because our friend, Senator Carl \nLevin, actually has the goods. He has the memos, the internal memos. He \nsubpoenaed them. It shows that investment banking company is making \nrecord profits now but actually was betting against its customers, was \nactually selling short, betting against the American economy. So the \nquestion is, When all that was going sour and the American taxpayers \nwere told these companies that are doing that are too big to fail, that \nwe have a moral hazard here, we have systemic risk with grave \nconsequences to this economy and therefore the American taxpayer has to \nbe told you bail them out. The Federal Reserve, on behalf of the \nAmerican taxpayer, decides we are going to provide unlimited funding \nand unlimited money and a new loan window for the first time in history \nto investment banks. Then we go to the Fed and say: How much did you \nactually put out there? And they say: You have no business knowing. We \ndon't intend to tell you, and we don't intend to tell the American \npeople. That is where we find ourselves right now. It is unbelievable.\n  There is an old country saying: The water is not going to clear up \nuntil you get the hogs out of the creek.\n  This issue we are trying to get to the floor of the Senate on a \nmotion to proceed so we can actually do Wall Street reform is all about \ngetting the hogs out of the creek. But we will vote again today at \n4:30--I believe it is 4:30. We voted yesterday. We will vote, I \nsuppose, tomorrow. Every single Republican has said we don't intend to \neven allow you to proceed because we want to strengthen the bill. \nReally? When two of the top Republicans go to Wall Street about 19 days \nago to meet with two dozen Wall Street executives in a closed session \nand then come back and say we are going to stop Wall Street reform \nbecause we want to strengthen it--I don't think so. It doesn't sound to \nme like that is the case.\n  If you want to strengthen it, I say to my colleagues--you say it is \nnot strong enough in too big to fail--I am going to be offering an \namendment on ending too big to fail. But you can't offer an amendment \nunless you get the motion to proceed to get the bill on the floor. But \nI am wondering how many Republican votes I will get for an amendment \nthat says if you are too big to fail, if you pose a moral hazard, \nsystemic risk with grave consequences to our economy, it seems to me we \nshould back you away through divestitures to a point where you are not \ncausing that moral hazard, if that is the case.\n  Those who say they are trying to strengthen this bill--and I doubt \nit--I wonder if they will join me on that.\n  They come to the floor and say: We haven't had a chance to negotiate \nor discuss this, when, in fact, there were negotiations for months in \nthe Senate Banking Committee, and before that there were hearings that \nwent on for a year in the Senate Banking Committee. When they finally \ngot to the point of writing the bill, the Republicans decided we don't \nhave one suggestion for an amendment, not one, not any. Now they are \nsaying: We are going to take a stand. We are not going to even allow \nthe Senate to consider Wall Street reform because we think it needs to \nbe improved. Oh, really? I think they think it is too strong. I think \nthey have a lot of friends who want them to weaken it. That is my \nbelief.\n  The question is, Will we be able to see, at some point, perhaps at \nlong last, the other side stop making excuses and allow us to begin \nlegislating? Is there any American who has suffered the consequences of \nthis deep decline in our economy, the deepest decline since the Great \nDepression--is there any American who says: You know what. Hands off \nthe big investment banks. Hands off the big finance companies. Yes, we \nknow they were trading things we don't understand. They were trading \nthings such as credit default swaps that were naked.\n  I asked the other day: How did that get naked? A credit default swap \nthat is naked means it has no insurable interest in any case on either \nside. It is not investing, it is simply waging. I said before: Why \npretend? Why not put a keno pit or a craps table in the lobby of those \ninstitutions because all it is, is making wagers or bets.\n  We have a couple of very large communities and many other areas of \nAmerica where you can do that, Las Vegas and Atlantic City. But in the \nlast decade, and especially with the growth of these unbelievably \nexotic instruments, we have seen that happening increasingly in the \nlobbies of some of America's biggest financial institutions because \nthey have decided, if they bet and lose, at least the record is the \nAmerican taxpayer going to be standing behind them to pick up the tab.\n  No more. The legislation brought to us by Senator Dodd and Senator \nLincoln dealing with financial reform and derivatives is not perfect. \nSenator Dodd is on the floor. He would be the first to say that. But \nnone of us can offer any amendments unless we have a motion to proceed \nto get to the bill. I think the work done by Senator Dodd and \nthe Banking Committee is work that needs to be commended. It stretches \nmy imagination, and I think others', for the excuse for voting against \nthe motion to proceed to allow us to get to the floor on this and \nactually have a debate and offer amendments, to allow as an excuse that \nthe other side truly wants to strengthen this.\n\n  You know what. We are going to get to the bill at some point, \nsomehow, over the opposition of a determined minority that wants to \nprotect Wall Street's interests here. Even as we are holding these \nhearings today and discovering some pretty pathetic behavior on behalf \nof some big economic players, we are going to get to this bill. When we \ndo, we will see who is on the floor of the Senate on the side of the \nAmerican people. We will see who truly wants Wall Street reform that \ndoes the right thing.\n  There are many things we need to do. Let me just say I mentioned too \nbig to fail--I am going to introduce an amendment that bans naked \ncredit default swaps that have no insurable interest. Again, that is \nbetting, not investing. So there are a lot of things for us to do, but \nwe cannot even begin to do that until we get a motion to proceed, and \nwe would expect, perhaps even by accident, we would get one vote or \nperhaps two votes on the other side. We will see. Maybe this afternoon \nwill be the time.\n  The American people deserve much better. As I said when I started, I \nknow that change is hard and big change is exceedingly hard. But this \nis a big issue. This isn't some small potatoes. This is trillions and \ntrillions of dollars. The American people lost $15 trillion in wealth \nwhen the economy hit rock bottom. So they require us, they demand of \nthis Congress to take action--not to take action just for the sake of \nhaving done something but to take action for the sake of fixing this, \nto make sure this sort of nonsense and behavior cannot ever happen \nagain in a way that threatens this country's economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by commending my friend from \nNorth Dakota, expressing my agreement of virtually everything he said. \nI\n\n[[Page S2686]]\n\nalso commend Senator Dodd for the very hard work he has done in \nbringing forth a very strong piece of Wall Street reform legislation \nwhich is long overdue.\n  Let me also say that my good friend and neighbor from New Hampshire, \nSenator Gregg, took to the floor yesterday to express his outrage that \n10 Senators on the Budget Committee voted for an amendment I offered--\nwhich lost, by the way, 12 to 10--to begin the process of breaking up \ntoo-big-to-fail financial institutions that pose a catastrophic risk to \nour economy. Frankly, after listening to Senator Gregg's statement, I \nwonder, with all due sincerity, what planet he is living on. \nApparently, he has missed the fact that due to the greed, the \nrecklessness, and the illegal behavior of Wall Street, the American \npeople continue to suffer through the worst economic crisis since the \nGreat Depression. The damage done by Wall Street in bringing this \neconomy to a grinding halt is incomprehensible--millions of people \nhaving lost jobs, their homes, their savings, young people trying to go \nout into the job market to begin a career in their lives unable to do \nthat because of the greed of Wall Street. The fact that just yesterday \nwe could not get one Republican vote to proceed to begin the debate on \nhow we finally reform Wall Street is beyond my comprehension. This \ndebate needs to be going forward, and we need to pass strong--underline \n``strong''--legislation that makes sure that what happened a year and a \nhalf ago never, ever happens again.\n  I also find it interesting that we have some of our conservative \nRepublican Senators, such as Senator Gregg, who day after day tell us \nhow much they dislike big government--they don't like Social Security, \ndon't like Medicare, don't like big government--but apparently have no \nproblem with huge financial institutions which control a very \nsignificant part of our economy. In the last 15 years, the six largest \nbanks in this country have more than tripled in size and now have \ncombined assets equal to 63 percent of the gross domestic product. Let \nme say that again. The six largest banks in this country now have \ncombined assets equal to 63 percent of this Nation's GDP.\n  I ask all my conservative friends who come down saying: Oh, \ngovernment is too big, government is awful, what about banks that have \ntrillions of dollars in assets? Why aren't we talking about that \nreality? The truth is that today what we are seeing with these huge \nfinancial institutions is not only the ongoing problem of what happens \nwhen they fail and whether the taxpayers will be having to bail them \nout again, but when you have that kind of concentration of ownership, \nyou have a very dangerous situation.\n  The four largest banks in this country, four banks, issue two-thirds \nof the credit cards. What do we think about that? Everyone in the world \nhas a credit card. Four banks issue two-thirds of that.\n  How does that tally with the rhetoric I hear from my conservative \nfriends about a competitive economy? Competition is what drives prices \ndown.\n  Well, maybe one of the reasons millions of Americans today are paying \n25 or 30-percent interest rates on their credit cards is you have got \nfour banks that issue two-thirds of them.\n  The four largest banks in this country provide half of the mortgages \nin America. I think that is a real problem. The four largest banks \ncontrol nearly 40 percent of all bank deposits in this country.\n  Over 100 years ago, we had some good Republicans, William Howard Taft \nand Teddy Roosevelt. When they saw the concentration of ownership and \nwealth that existed in their time, they, as good Republicans, said: \nLet's start breaking it up.\n  I think what they did over 100 years ago is a lesson we should learn \ntoday. If a financial institution is too big to fail, that financial \ninstitution is too big to exist and the time is now to start breaking \nit up.\n  This idea of starting to break up large financial institutions is not \njust an idea that Bernie Sanders has, it is not just an idea, an \namendment offered by Senators Brown of Ohio and Kaufman are going to \nspeak to. It is an idea that is spreading all over this country.\n  I would point out to you that the presidents of three regional \nFederal Reserve Banks also support the need to start breaking up large \nfinancial institutions. These are: James Bullard, who is the president \nof the Fed in St. Louis; Thomas Toenig, the president of the Fed in \nKansas City; and Richard Fisher, the president of the Fed in Dallas, \nTX. They are all in agreement that we have got to start breaking up \nthese large financial institutions.\n  Senator Dorgan made this point, and I want to make it again; that is, \nthat during the bailout, the Fed decided it was going to lend out \ntrillions of dollars in zero or almost zero-interest loans. When \nChairman Bernanke came before the Budget Committee, on which I serve, I \nasked him what I thought was a pretty simple and straightforward \nquestion: Mr. Chairman, can you tell me and the American people who \nreceived these loans?\n  I mean, we are talking about trillions of dollars in loans. I do not \nthink it is too much to ask who received the loans and what the terms \nwere of those loans. Well, Mr. Bernanke disagreed. I offered an \namendment that day that begins to bring transparency to the Fed. That \namendment is called the Federal Reserve Sunshine Act. I am happy to say \nit has 32 cosponsors. Interestingly enough, 22 of them are Republicans, \n10 are Democrats. They are: Senators Barrasso, Bennett of Utah, Boxer, \nBrownback, Burr, Cardin, Chambliss, Coburn, Cochran, Cornyn, Crapo, \nDeMint, Dorgan, Feingold, Graham, Grassley, Harkin, Hatch, Hutchison, \nInhofe, Isakson, Landrieu, Leahy, Lincoln, McCain, Murkowski, Risch, \nThune, Vitter, Webb, Wicker, and Wyden.\n  That is quite a cross section of political views in favor of bringing \ntransparency to the Fed. What my amendment will do--and we intend to \nbring that amendment to the floor during this debate--is, in fact, it \nwould require the Federal Reserve to release all of the details about \nthe more than $2 trillion in zero-interest loans the Fed provided to \nlarge financial institutions. Also it would call for a GAO audit of the \nFed.\n  The bottom line there is it is imperative that the GAO conduct an \nindependent and comprehensive audit of the Federal Reserve within 1 \nyear. That is what our amendment does. It requires the Federal Reserve \nto disclose the names of the financial institutions that received over \n$2 trillion in virtually zero-interest loans since the start of the \nrecession.\n  This is an amendment that I think millions of people want. What is \ninteresting about it is if you talk about bipartisanship or \ntripartisanship, this amendment, both in the House and the Senate, \nbrings together some of the more conservative members and some of the \nmore progressive members. In the House, this language is supported by \nmy former colleague Ron Paul. I am introducing it here in the Senate. \nThat, my friends, is a very significant disparity in political views. \nBut we do agree that the Fed needs transparency.\n  Let me conclude by simply saying this: The time is now for the Senate \nto begin to deal with the greed, the recklessness, and the illegal \nbehavior on Wall Street. The American people have demanded action since \nthis crisis began, and we owe it to them to deliver. As we proceed with \nSenator Dodd's piece of legislation, which I think has many very \npositive attributes, I think our goal is as we debate it, to make it \neven stronger.\n  In that regard, as I mentioned, I will be bringing forward an \namendment dealing with Fed transparency. I will be bringing forth an \namendment which will put a cap on the interest rates that banks can \ncharge. I think it is not acceptable, not moral, that banks are now \ncharging 25, 30-percent interest rates. We are going to have a cap \nsimilar to what exists for credit unions.\n  As I mentioned also, we are going to have legislation, an amendment \ndealing with Fed transparency. So my hope is our Republican friends \nwill join us in beginning this debate and, in fact, going forward so \nthat finally, finally, we can hold Wall Street accountable and bring \nforth the legislation to make sure that never do we see a repetition of \nthe disaster we saw a year and a half ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n[[Page S2687]]\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I understand I have 10 minutes in which \nto make my remarks. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I appreciate that.\n  Over the past 2 years, Americans have seen an unprecedented \ngovernment reach into the private sector, some of which may be \nnecessary. They are angry about it, as they should be.\n  For many, the overreach of government began with the bank bailout or \nTARP. The $700 billion TARP that I opposed was passed in the fall of \n2008 when every day we awoke to see a new financial crisis headlining \nthe front page.\n  TARP was initially intended to purchase troubled assets and get them \noff the books of the troubled banks. Yet, over time, the program \nevolved into a fund--some would call it a slush fund--to include \nbailouts for the auto industry and the housing market. The term \n``bailout'' will never be the same again.\n  I think the American people are right to demand that they are never \nagain put on the hook to bail out a failed company. They are right to \ndemand that those who got us into the financial mess not be allowed to \ndo so again. Unfortunately, the financial regulatory reform bill that \nthe Senate is set to take up and debate does not achieve these goals.\n  I know both sides are now involved in discussions, and the next 48 \nhours are going to be absolutely crucial to determine if, in fact, we \ncan get a bipartisan bill. But with any business, if it is mismanaged, \nif its leaders make poor decisions, the business should be allowed to \nfail. Success and failure have, until recently, been the cornerstone of \nwhat has made our economy one of the strongest in the world. The \nbailouts of financial and auto companies have turned that philosophy on \nits head. I think it is a dangerous road to go down. We need to set a \nnew course. It is what the American people want.\n\n  This bill does not end bailouts. Instead, it allows some of the \nlargest financial institutions to contribute to a bailout fund, to be \nused if a company were again to fail.\n  Well, this does nothing to deter companies from taking risks that \ncould lead to failure and the need for a future bailout. In fact, it \nsends a signal that the government will bail out institutions, just as \nit bailed out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two troubled mortgage \ngiants that have received $125.9 billion, might as well make it $126 \nbillion, in direct government funding and now have an unlimited U.S. \ncredit line.\n  Yet there is no mention, no mention, of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac in \nthis bill. Failure to deal with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac keeps \ntaxpayers on the hook for more bailouts of these entities.\n  The bill also allows the FDIC and the Federal Reserve to come to the \naid of failing financial firms, which means that financial markets will \nbe fully aware of the government's authority and inclination to prop up \nlarge failed financial institutions.\n  The very existence of this authority undercuts the claim that the \ngovernment will actually ever wind up with such firms. Those firms, \nalong with their creditors and shareholders, will take more risks and, \nyes, put the financial system into even greater danger.\n  There has also been much attention paid to the creation of something \ncalled a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, BCFP. I would hate to \ntry to pronounce that acronym.\n  This sounds like a good idea at first. We all want, everyone in this \nSenate wants, to ensure strong consumer financial protection. That is \nnot the issue. Yet, rather than working with regulators to strengthen \nexisting consumer protection rules and crack down on unfair deceptive \nand abusive practices, this provision adds another layer of bureaucracy \nand financial regulation that will ultimately be harmful for consumers, \nand I mean all consumers, by raising their costs for financial \nproducts, and eliminating the types of financial products and services \nthat are available to choose from.\n  Not only that, this bill increases the regulatory burden for banks, \nincluding our community banks, that are already subject to 1,700 pages \nof regulations in the consumer area alone. Under this bill, our \ncommunity banks would have to comply with an additional 27 new or \nexpanded regulations, including new burdens on small business loans. No \ntelling how many pages these new regulations will add or how much they \nwill increase the cost of lending to small business. Finally, this bill \nharms the very innovation and entrepreneurship that has made our \ncountry so successful and created one of the strongest economies in the \nworld. It does this by limiting the ability of small startup companies \nto raise seed capital. Currently, angel investors--that is quite a \nname--but angel investors, those higher income individuals who wish to \ninvest in a promising startup company, to take the risk, must have a \nnet worth of at least $1 million or income of $250,000.\n  This bill increases those requirements to $2.3 million and $450,000, \nrespectively. Estimates are that this provision, along with a provision \nin the bill that would subject startups and investors to 50 different \nsets of State regulations, would disqualify about 77 percent of current \ninvestors.\n  In 2007, these individuals invested $26 billion in more than 57,000 \nventures across the country. We are talking about companies such as \nAmazon, Google, Facebook. All benefitted from angel investors. Yet this \nbill makes it harder for promising young companies to get the capital \nthey need to get started to grow and become successful.\n  At a time when the unemployment rate is 9.7 percent, I think the last \nthing Congress should do is to make it more difficult for small \nbusinesses to start up and be successful. Small businesses are, as the \nPresident has acknowledged, the leading job creators in the country.\n  Everyone--everyone--all of us agree we need better regulation of our \nfinancial system. However, the financial regulatory reform bill that \ncame out of the Banking Committee does not achieve that goal. I dearly \nhope the chairman of the committee and the ranking member can reach \nsome accommodation to produce a better product.\n  It does not address the problems, as written, that led to the \nfinancial turmoil but, instead, imposes additional regulatory burdens \non our community banks and financial institutions that did not \ncontribute to that turmoil.\n  It does not discourage risk taking by large financial institutions. \nIt does nothing--nothing--to address Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, which \nhad a central role in the collapse of the housing markets that helped \ntrigger the financial crisis.\n  It does not ensure that taxpayers never again have to bail out a \nfailed company. However, it does increase the Federal bureaucracy and \nmake it more difficult and costly for consumers to obtain credit for \ntheir families and small businesses.\n  This approach will not benefit consumers or community banks or our \neconomy. We need to work to improve this bill. It is vital for our \neconomy we get it right when addressing financial regulatory reform \nbecause the consequences will be seen for years--for years--to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I will take a few minutes, if I can, \nrecognize myself for 10 minutes, if I may, and ask the Presiding \nOfficer to notify me when that time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I have great affection for my friend from \nNebraska and I appreciate his comments about the bill. He wants to fix \nthe bill. That is a noble goal. And the way to fix the bill, of course, \nis to begin debating the bill. So I am delighted to hear he would want \nto fix the bill. The problem I have is I cannot seem to get enough \npeople on the other side to get us to the point where we might give \nthem an opportunity to do exactly what they claim they want to do.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, will the chairman yield for a second?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield, just for a second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am very privileged to represent the State of Kansas.\n  Mr. DODD. Kansas. Excuse me. I am sorry.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Nebraska is fine, but they----\n\n[[Page S2688]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. I apologize to my colleague.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I mean, their football teams are a completely \ndifferent----\n  Mr. DODD. But in basketball, you do very well, so it is OK.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. So it is Kansas.\n  Mr. DODD. Kansas, not Nebraska.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my friend.\n  Anyway, my point is, we want to get to the bill. And whether it is my \nSenator friend from Kansas or Nebraska, we want to get to the bill, if \nwe can. That is all this is about now. I am going to talk about the \nbill a bit here in the brief moments I have before we actually get to \nthe vote this afternoon on this matter.\n  The American public is sitting there in sort of stunned disbelief. \nHere we all acknowledge this huge problem that needs to be addressed \nfor the 8.5 million people who have lost their job, the 7 million who \nhave lost their homes, their retirement income. We know from all of the \nstatistics what this financial crisis has caused.\n  Over the last year and a half, we have been busy trying to come up \nwith the answers on how to solve this problem in the future. Here we \nare, with about 14 weeks left to go before the close of this Congress, \nwith a bill on the floor of the Senate that we put together over many \nweeks and months--on a bipartisan basis, I might add. Here it is, Madam \nPresident. Now we are being told, despite the fact that 58 of us \nbelieve we ought to at least begin the debate--I am not asking anyone \nto vote for the bill. I am not asking you to vote for an amendment on \nthe bill. All I am asking you is, Can we begin discussing this bill \nhere? It is the job of this body to do so.\n  So I am delighted to receive all the lectures I have received from \npeople from about whether they like the bill or do not like the bill or \nwhat they want to add to it or subtract from it, and that is all very \ninteresting conversation. But the fact is, until we actually move to \nthe bill--which will be the matter once again before us this \nafternoon--all that talk is nothing but talk.\n  If you have an idea on what you want to change in this bill, tell me \nabout it. But, more importantly, let's debate it, discuss it, and then \nvote on whether to add it to this piece of legislation, or to take \nanything out you wish to take out as well. But I cannot even begin that \nprocess if, in fact, you continue to object to us getting to a debate.\n  So that is what this is all about.\n  I guess it does not pay to get your hopes up in this town, but I was \nstill disappointed yesterday when we ended up coming up short with the \nvotes necessary to proceed to the bill.\n  To be honest, I am still mystified by the reaction of our colleagues. \nYes, we have heard all the rhetoric from the minority leadership. We \nhave seen the thundering horde of Wall Street lobbyists descending on \nthis community, having been paid millions of dollars to do everything \nthey can to stop this, including the motion to even proceed to debating \nthe bill. They had a victory yesterday. Congratulations to the Wall \nStreet lobbyists. You had a great day yesterday. The American people do \nnot even have a chance to hear a bill discussed that might avoid the \nkind of catastrophe that has befallen them over this past year and a \nhalf.\n  And, yes, we are all familiar with political considerations that seem \nas inevitable as the sunrise in this community. But still, I cannot \nbring myself to believe that every single member of the minority caucus \nwants to stand with the large Wall Street financial institutions that \nare the major objectors to this bill going forward.\n  This morning, as Goldman Sachs executives were testifying--including \nthis afternoon--before a Senate committee, we all got another chance to \nunderstand why they feel so deeply wronged by this legislation.\n  As Frank Rich said in the New York Times this weekend--and I quote \nhim--\n\n       [S]omething is fundamentally amiss in a financial culture \n     that thrives on ``products'' that create nothing and produce \n     nothing except new ways to make bigger bets and stack the \n     deck in favor of the house.\n\n  Our prosperity in the country was built on the hard work of \ngenerations of Americans. It was grown in the cornfields of Nebraska \nand Kansas, engineered in the laboratories of Massachusetts, forged in \nthe foundries of Chicago, and manufactured, if I may say so, in textile \nplants such as in my home State of Connecticut.\n  It is deeply ingrained in the American ethos that, in this land of \ngreat opportunity, you build wealth by creating something: an idea, a \nproduct, a service.\n  This economic crisis was not caused by the creators, the producers, \nthe small businesses, and the working men and women who abide by that \nguiding principle. It was caused by some on Wall Street who wanted to \nget rich without contributing a thing, by executives who simply come up \nwith ways to circulate money around in a large circle, taking a piece \nfor themselves every time that circle spins.\n  Operating in the shadows of our economic structures, in the places \nwhere regulators were not equipped to do their job, firms such as \nGoldman Sachs found ways to game the financial system, reaping unheard \nof profits and rewarding their executives with huge bonuses.\n\n  Understand exactly what these bankers were doing. They were not just \ntrying to predict the future; they were betting on the failure of the \nmortgage market, a failure they themselves were in a position to cause.\n  Earlier this month, National Public Radio and the nonprofit \njournalistic organization ProPublica reported on another firm, a hedge \nfund named Magnetar. This hedge fund, according to the report, saw the \nhousing market begin to decline in the year 2005, bought up enormous \namounts of doomed bonds composed of bad mortgages--thus, keeping the \nmarket artificially inflated--and then made huge bets on the failure of \nthe very bonds they had bought, now knowing how worthless they were.\n  Thanks to this scheme, the housing bubble grew bigger and collapsed \nharder. Magnetar walked away with billions of dollars in profits. Other \ninstitutions saw an opportunity to run the same scheme. The American \npeople ended up paying the price, of course, as we all painfully are \naware.\n  I am the chairman of the Banking Committee. I believe in the vibrant \nfinancial sector of our Nation. Small businesses need capital and \ncredit. There are many honest people on Wall Street who, I believe, \nhave helped others to build wealth in our country. So the problem is \nnot that these executives got rich without contributing to America. The \nproblem is that these executives got rich betting against America. They \ndid it in secret where no one could see what they were doing, let alone \nstop them, until it was too late. They took outrageous risks with money \nthat did not belong to them because they could, in their view. By the \ntime anyone realized what was going on, they had managed to destroy \nmuch of the prosperity Americans had built over the course of \ngenerations.\n  Maybe I am naive, but I do not believe any Senator wants to be on \ntheir side in this debate. And do you know what. I have seen firsthand \nthat there are Republicans who deeply want to get to this bill and get \nit done. That is why the legislation we want to bring to the floor \nreflects broad bipartisan agreement. This bill was not written by this \nSenator alone or a handful of Democrats on the committee. This bill was \nwritten in large part with the cooperation of my colleagues, both \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  The bill creates an early warning system so we can see and stop the \nnext wave of dangerous financial products and practices before it \nthreatens the economic stability of our Nation. It brings derivatives \nout of the shadows and into the sunlight so that Wall Street is held \naccountable for its actions. And finally, it puts a cop on the consumer \nprotection beat so Americans can make smart decisions based on full \ninformation when they are planning for their financial futures and \nthose of their families.\n  To listen to the minority leader, the main point of contention, over \nthe last week or so, the reason he has given for his caucus to try and \nkill this bill as a bloc, is a disagreement over the provisions of our \nbill that end too-big-to-fail bailouts.\n  But I have to tell you, I do not believe that is the case. No fair \nreading of this bill allows you to claim with a straight face that it \nperpetuates taxpayer bailouts. It is not true. I have debunked that \nidea before on this floor, and I will do it again.\n\n[[Page S2689]]\n\n  The morning after the minority leader made that claim, McClatchy \nNewspapers wrote:\n\n       McConnell--\n\n  Speaking of the minority leader--\n\n     had accused Dodd of drafting partisan legislation, even \n     though the Banking Committee chairman has worked for roughly \n     half a year with key Senate Republicans and incorporated many \n     of their ideas into his bill. McConnell also said the bill \n     continues controversial bank bailouts, but it doesn't.\n\n  If you do not believe the press reports, here is what our friend, the \nhead of the FDIC, Sheila Bair, had to say. She, as I said, is the head \nof that organization, the Federal Deposit Insurance Organization--\nformer legal counsel to the minority leader Bob Dole, a Republican in \ngood standing, I might add, as well. She shuts down, by the way, failed \nbanks for a living. She is a Republican. She said:\n\n       The status quo is bailouts. That's what we have now. If you \n     don't do anything, you are going to keep having bailouts.\n\n  Further, talking about our bill, she said:\n\n       It makes [bailouts] impossible, and it should.\n\n  Sheila Bair says:\n\n       We worked really hard to squeeze bailout language out of \n     this bill. The construct is you can't bail out an individual \n     institution--you just can't do it.\n\n  Madam President, I will speak a little bit more. I know my other \ncolleagues will want to be heard. I ask unanimous consent for 2 \nadditional minutes, if I can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. How in the world the minority leader can come up with that \nargument does not make any sense at all. He quoted, of course, from the \ninfamous Frank Luntz memo. The memo, of course, by Frank Luntz was \nwritten before the bill was written. Frank Luntz's political memo said \nthe following:\n\n       The single best way to kill any legislation is to link it \n     to the Big Bank Bailout.\n\n  So he provided political recommendations and strategies even before \nthis bill was written. The memo, of course, confirms that because of \nthe date of it. So no matter what he wrote, that was going to be their \npolitical argument here. So the minority leader blindly followed the \npolitical memo here: Make that argument. Whether it is true is \nirrelevant, just say it often enough. And the old adage goes: If you \nrepeat it often enough, people will begin to believe it, despite what \nthe facts are. So again, that is the language of others.\n  But let me, if I can--because sometimes talking about it is not \nenough--let me quote from sections of the bill.\n  Section 204 of the bill says:\n\n       (1) Creditors and shareholders will bear the losses in the \n     financial company;\n       (2) Management responsible for the condition of the \n     financial company will not be retained.\n\n  Let me translate: You get fired.\n\n       (3) The Corporation and other appropriate agencies will \n     take all steps necessary and appropriate to assure that all \n     parties, including management and third parties, having \n     responsibility for the condition of the financial company \n     bear losses consistent with their responsibility, including \n     actions for damages, restitution, and recoupment of \n     compensation and other gains not compatible with such \n     responsibility.\n\n  Section 206 of the bill:\n\n       In taking action against this title, the (FDIC) shall \n     determine that such action is necessary for the purposes of \n     the financial stability of the United States, and not for the \n     purposes of preserving the covered financial company; ensure \n     that the shareholders of covered financial company do not \n     receive payment until after all other claims and the Fund are \n     fully paid; ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in \n     accordance with the priority of claim provisions in section \n     210; ensure that management responsible for the failed \n     condition of the covered financial company is removed--\n\n  Again, fired, if you didn't understand those words--\n\n     and not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of \n     any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary.\n\n  Lastly:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Corporation, as receiver for a covered financial company, \n     shall succeed by operation of law to the rights, titles, \n     powers, and privileges described in subparagraph (A), and \n     shall terminate all rights and claims that the stockholders \n     and creditors of the covered financial company may have \n     against the assets of the covered financial company or the \n     Corporation arising out of their status as stockholders or \n     creditors, except for the right to payment, resolution, or \n     other satisfaction of their claims as permitted under this \n     section. The Corporation shall ensure that shareholders and \n     unsecured creditors bear losses consistent with the priority \n     of claims provisions under this section.\n\n  We seem to agree on the problem, and we seem to agree on how to solve \nit. So, again, I quote from the legislation.\n  Let's get to this bill. We have written the provisions that stop too \nbig to fail forever. There are other very important provisions in this \nbill that deserve consideration.\n  Again, I am not asking anyone to vote for the bill at this juncture \nor to vote for the amendments that come up. For the life of me, I don't \nknow how we explain to anyone in this country, in light of what we have \nbeen through, that we can't even begin the debate and the discussion.\n  By the way, no two Senators are going to write this bill. There are \n100 of us who serve here, and every single Member of this body has a \nright to offer amendments and be heard. As chairman of the committee, I \nwill insist upon that. Every Member who has an idea and has an \namendment will be heard. But, please, let's get to it.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 8 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Chair will notify me when I have reached 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes so I may come to a blazing close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it has been over 2 years since Bear \nStearns failed. It has been over 18 months since Wall Street collapsed \nand the economy teetered on the brink of depression. It has been almost \na year since the administration offered a detailed proposal to reform \nWall Street. It has been 4 months since the House passed its version of \nWall Street reform. Yet, unfortunately, the minority party, the \nRepublicans in the Senate, still want to delay any Wall Street reform. \nThey want to put off Wall Street reform for another day.\n  Yesterday, the Republicans in the Senate had a chance to vote to end \ntheir filibuster on Wall Street reform so that we could start to debate \nthis issue and consider amendments from both sides of the aisle, almost \nthe way we remember learning about the Senate in school: a real place \nwhere there is a real debate, differences of opinion, votes, winners, \nlosers--an amazing concept. We don't see much of it anymore, do we?\n  There are a lot of empty chairs here. There is very little actual \ndebate leading to a vote. So yesterday we said to the Republicans: \nAfter all this time since this started, after 2 years since Bear \nStearns failed and all we have been through, isn't it about time for us \nto roll up our sleeves and get down to work? Shouldn't we bring some \nreform and transparency to Wall Street so we don't have to go through \nthis ever again? Wall Street got away with murder and the taxpayers \nended up holding the bag, remember?\n  The previous administration asked us to send almost $800 billion to \nWall Street to save the institutions that made some of the greediest, \nstupidest decisions in the history of American business. I was in those \nmeetings. I can remember sobering moments--I will bet the chairman of \nthe Banking Committee can remember them as well--when the Treasury \nSecretary, Mr. Paulson, and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. \nBernanke, looked us in the eye and said: If we don't put $85 billion in \nAIG today, it will fail and the American economy will fail with it. It \ntakes your breath away. We do a lot of important things here but \nnothing like that. Then, it wasn't 2 weeks later that they came back \nand said: It is not enough. We need up to $800 billion to buy toxic \nassets with something called TARP.\n  Well, let me tell my colleagues, I am a liberal arts lawyer. I have \nspent a lifetime in politics. I can't really start\n\n[[Page S2690]]\n\nquibbling and arguing about puts and calls and derivatives and CDOs and \nall the rest of it. At some point, you take the word of the people who \nare in charge, and I voted for it. The alternative was unthinkable.\n  So where are we today? Sadly, some of those same firms we rescued \nwith taxpayers' dollars sent us a thank-you card which had a postscript \nthat said: Incidentally, we have just declared that we are going to \ngive one another $10 million bonuses for our wisdom. How do you buy \nthat? How do you sell it to the American people?\n  So we have come here with the leadership of Senator Dodd on the \nBanking Committee and Senator Lincoln on the Agriculture Committee, \nwhich has a piece of this, and said: We are going to change this story. \nWe are going to have more accountability, we are going to have more \ntransparency, and, frankly, we are going to put a cop on the beat when \nit comes to Wall Street. We are going to make sure they don't get \ninvolved in this mess again.\n  I don't often come to the floor to plug a book, but I am going to: \nMichael Lewis, ``The Big Short.'' I recommend it if you can stand it. \nHe tells the inside story of what happened on Wall Street. These so-\ncalled great, wise men didn't know what they were doing other than \nmaking a lot more money every single day. They were building this house \nof cards, and eventually it fell. He tells the story about the folks \nwho profited when it fell. They were completely out of favor for years. \nPeople said: Shorting the housing market? Are you crazy? There is no \nway to go but up when it comes to housing. Well, they made a lot of \nmoney, shorting the market, and the folks who came up with these crazy \nvehicles to package all these mortgages left us and America holding the \nbag.\n  This recession we are in took $16 trillion to $17 trillion out of the \nAmerican economy. I don't need to tell anybody about it. If you look at \nyour savings account before and after, you know what I am talking \nabout--savings, retirement, the business down the street that closed, \nthe neighbor who lost his job. You know the story, as we all do. It \ntook $16 trillion to $17 trillion. That is more than the total value of \nall of the goods and services produced in the United States of America \nin any year--the total value--yanked out of the economy because of the \nstupidity of these folks.\n\n  Now we come before the Senate and say: Do you want to risk going \nthrough that again? Shouldn't we learn something in the process here \nthat avoids that problem? The Republicans yesterday said: No, thanks. \nWe don't care to vote on this.\n  Well, in an hour they are going to have another chance. I hope they \nhave come to their senses. I hope the people they represent have led \nthem to their senses. We have given them ample opportunity, and will, \nto offer their amendments. Let's hear their ideas. I am going to be \nopen to them. I certainly don't want to water down this bill. I think \nit is a good bill. I want to try to make it stronger. If they want to \nwater it down, we will have a vote, debate and vote, almost like the \nU.S. Senate. It will be amazing.\n  There is a second provision in here for consumer financial \nprotection. Right now, strung out across our government are all of \nthese agencies that are supposed to be watching out for us. We have \nagencies that make sure the toaster you bought over the weekend doesn't \nexplode, catch fire, and burn down your house. We expect that, don't \nwe? That is the Consumer Product Safety Commission. But we don't have \nan agency that makes sure the mortgage you signed doesn't explode and \nyou lose your house. That is what happened: stuck in mortgage \nprovisions.\n  Have you ever been through a real estate closing? There is a stack of \npages turned at the corner; sign as fast as you can; at the end of 15 \nor 20 minutes, you have writer's cramp; a check; a key to the house, \nand you are out the door. Oh, you didn't check that line, the middle of \nthe page, the 35th document that you signed? It had a prepayment \npenalty in there for your mortgage. Prepayment penalty, so what? Well, \nit just says that when the interest rate goes up, you can't refinance \nit. Oh, I didn't know that. Of course you didn't. Lawyers don't catch \nthose things.\n  So we want to create the strongest consumer financial protection law \nin the history of the United States not to create a massive agency--it \nwon't be--but to empower consumers so that when you sit down at that \nclosing or you decide to take out a credit card or a student loan or an \nauto loan, you know what you are getting into. The basics are in front \nof you in plain English. Wall Street hates this idea like the Devil \nhates holy water. The notion that there would be some agency there \nlooking over their shoulder sends fear into their hearts. I think it is \na good idea. If someone wants to come here and debate it, I am ready, \nbut I think we ought to have a debate. What are the Republicans afraid \nof?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me go to my blazing close.\n  Let me just say that at the end of the day--currently, lobbyists are \nbeing paid $120,000 a day by Wall Street to stop this bill. So far, \nthey have Republicans on their side and they have been successful. In \nan hour, I hope that all changes. Let them join us in a bipartisan \neffort to make this economy stronger, make the rules work for average \npeople, and to put some protection in there for the consumers of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am told there are others who want to be \nheard, so I would at this juncture note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I see my friend and colleague from Oregon. I will yield 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee for the time to address an issue that I think is essential in \nthis bill and for all of the good work he has done to bring this reform \nbill to the floor of the Senate.\n  It is time that we have an open debate on the floor of the Senate \nabout provisions that affect the financial foundations of our entire \neconomy. I know the chairman has been working hard. We held the vote \nyesterday to try to proceed with an open debate. We will hold another \nvote today and one tomorrow to say let's have this conversation about \nreforming Wall Street.\n  Today, I wish to address a particular point, which is limiting the \nability of high-risk investments to blow up our economy.\n  My colleague and friend, Senator Levin, did a monumental service to \nthis institution today by holding a hearing with the executives of the \nlarge investment firm Goldman Sachs, discussing practices that misled \nclients and bundled huge risks into our financial system.\n  The SEC currently has an investigation underway. The courts will \ndetermine the merit of that case. But today I want to address what the \nSEC could not charge Goldman Sachs with: they could not charge them \nwith the clear conflict of interest for holding a financial stake in a \nposition completely opposite to the very security that they themselves \nput together and were selling to their clients. The reason the SEC \ncould not address this issue is because there is currently no law that \nsays such a conflict of interest is unacceptable.\n  This gets to the heart of what is wrong on Wall Street today. The \nexecutives at Goldman Sachs are insisting up and down that they were \nnot making high-risk bets themselves; instead, they were only ``market \nmakers'' underwriting these deals. Well, no matter how often someone \nrepeats something, that doesn't make it so. As others have said, facts \nare stubborn.\n  Goldman was holding positions for its own benefit--large positions. \nThey were betting the market would go one way or another. But that is \nnot making a market, where you bring buyers and sellers together; that \nis proprietary trading, plain and simple.\n  Proprietary trading, or high-risk investing, cost investment firms \nand commercial banks billions of dollars in losses because they bet big \non housing securities, and the bets went bad.\n\n[[Page S2691]]\n\nThose losses were eventually covered, in large part, by the taxpayers \nthrough TARP. This isn't a side issue to the financial meltdown; it is \na core issue. That is why we need to begin debate on Wall Street reform \nright now. We cannot let Goldman and other firms continue to pretend \nthey weren't placing high-risk bets. We cannot let financial firms \ncontinue to get away with selling bad products to unsuspecting clients \nwhile betting against those products.\n  This issue goes to the heart of the integrity of the system, and \nintegrity is essential for folks who have capital and want to put that \ncapital at risk. They need to know they have a fair market into which \nthey can invest that capital. This goes right to the core of the role \nof Wall Street in aggregating capital and allocating that capital to \nthe places where it would have the highest return.\n  The bill before us is a very good bill. I think we can make it even \nstronger by including an amendment that Senator Levin and I have \nsponsored on high-risk investments and conflicts of interest. But to \nconsider that amendment, we have to begin the debate; and that debate \nshould begin now.\n  Let's not let lobbyists confuse the issue. They will try to argue \nthat high-stakes investing was not implicated in this crisis, or that \nthe sky will fall if we move high-risk investing outside of the banking \nsystem--I am talking about those banks that take insured deposits and \nmake loans--but that is not the case.\n  I wish to read from a letter sent to me and Senator Carl Levin by \nJohn Reed. John Reed is former chairman and CEO of Citigroup. He speaks \nto those false arguments. This is what he wrote:\n\n       I write to support your efforts to rein in the high risk \n     activities that helped cause the collapse of the world's \n     financial system. The recent financial crisis demonstrated \n     all too clearly the twenty year deregulatory experiment in \n     combining critical commercial banking with equally critical, \n     but riskier investment banking, failed.\n       In 2007 and 2008, losses from risky proprietary trades in \n     the major financial firms quickly decimated the availability \n     of credit and seriously damaged the economy far beyond the \n     concrete canyons where those bets were made.\n       When a firm is focused on market gain through proprietary \n     trading, it too often will employ every available device to \n     achieve those gains--including taking advantage of clients \n     and putting the firm at risk. As recent cases in the media \n     demonstrate, risk management and conflicts of interest \n     systems do not alone accomplish those goals.\n\n  John Reed, the former chairman and CEO of Citigroup, concludes with \nthis:\n\n       I strongly support your efforts to put the provisions that \n     Chairman Paul Volcker has advocated firmly into law. I \n     believe that the PROP Trading Act (S. 3098) and your proposed \n     Floor amendment based on that does that. The legislation \n     provides reasonable exceptions for client-oriented services \n     while including the necessary safeguards to protect against \n     the dangers of high-risk assets and high-risk trading \n     strategies. Putting these restrictions firmly into law will \n     be good for our economy and good for our financial services \n     industry--even though they may now argue to the contrary. \n     Refocusing our financial firms on client services will help \n     them restore the global leadership position that has been \n     seriously undermined by the recent crisis.\n       Certainly, we need many other important reforms, including \n     creating a strong consumer protection agency, imposing the \n     duty of care to customers on financial providers, and \n     reestablishing a well-regulated market for derivatives. But a \n     strong Volcker Rule is one of the most important provisions \n     to prevent ``too big to fail'' financial institutions, stop \n     conflicts of interest, and support credit in our economy.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter from \nJohn Reed be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 23, 2010.\n     Hon. Jeff Merkley and Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Merkley and Levin: I write to support your \n     efforts to rein in the high risk activities that helped cause \n     the collapse of the world's financial system. The recent \n     financial crisis demonstrated all too clearly the twenty year \n     deregulatory experiment in combining critical commercial \n     banking with equally critical, but riskier investment \n     banking, failed.\n       In 2007 and 2008, losses from risky proprietary trades in \n     the major financial firms quickly decimated the availability \n     of credit and seriously damaged the economy far beyond the \n     concrete canyons where those bets were made.\n       When a firm is focused on market gain through proprietary \n     trading, it too often will employ every available device to \n     achieve those gains--including taking advantage of clients \n     and putting the fine at risk. As recent cases in the media \n     demonstrate, risk management and conflicts of interest \n     systems do not alone accomplish those goals.\n       In fact, the incentives of management and traders at \n     today's massive, publicly traded banks are geared towards \n     short term profits--both the firm's and their own--and not \n     towards the long-term well-being of their employer or their \n     clients. Boards of directors have obligations to maximize \n     shareholder value, and no matter how much they and management \n     attest to the contrary, they too naturally focus on short \n     term performance. As one competitor's risky trading boosts \n     its earnings and relative short term performance, others will \n     be pressured--by the markets, and their own economic self-\n     interest--to follow suit.\n       Without strong rules on risk, leverage, and conflicts of \n     interest, we will see another race to the bottom, as traders, \n     management, directors, and even shareholders will seek to \n     attain the supersized rewards made possible by high risk \n     investments. The incentives need to be more properly \n     aligned--which can only best occur if proprietary trading is \n     out of the banks, and restricted at the systemically critical \n     non-banks.\n       I strongly support your efforts to put the provisions that \n     Chairman Paul Volcker has advocated firmly into law. I \n     believe that the PROP Trading Act (S. 3098) and your proposed \n     Floor amendment based on that does so. The legislation \n     provides reasonable exceptions for client-oriented services \n     while including the necessary safeguards to protect against \n     the dangers of high-risk assets and high-risk trading \n     strategies. Putting these restrictions firmly into law will \n     be good for our economy and good for our financial services \n     industry--even though they may now argue to the contrary. \n     Refocusing our financial firms on client services will help \n     them restore the global leadership position that has been \n     seriously undermined by the recent crisis.\n       Certainty, we need many other important reforms, including \n     creating a strong consumer protection agency, imposing the \n     duty of care to customers on financial providers, and \n     reestablishing a well-regulated market for derivatives. But a \n     strong Volcker Rule is one of the most important provisions \n     to prevent ``too big to fail'' financial institutions, stop \n     conflicts of interest, and support credit in our economy.\n       I congratulate your efforts and urge others to join you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John S. Reed.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, it is very helpful to have a former CEO \nof a company such as Citigroup weigh in on the challenges before us. \nJohn Reed, as former chairman and CEO of Citigroup, is in a position to \nreflect on the deregulation and the combination of the roles of lending \nbanks and investment houses and how it contributed to creating the \neconomic catastrophe that became the great recession.\n  I speak now to my colleagues to say that we need your help in \ncreating a firewall between highly risky proprietary investments and \nthe basic lending functions of banks. It is like storing fireworks in \nyour living room. Fireworks are wonderful, and there is no problem with \nutilizing them on the Fourth of July or New Years. But you don't store \nthem in your living room where they might end up burning down your \nhouse.\n  Second, we need clear conflict of interest rules that make sure that \nthe investment houses maintain integrity with their customers, so that \nif they are promoting a security to their customers, they are not doing \nso while separately and secretly betting against it. These reforms are \nimportant. They are an important part of the financial rules of the \nroad that will be healthy for Wall Street and for the foundation of our \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to our colleague from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, yesterday afternoon, we attempted to \nbring a bill to the floor that finally holds Wall Street accountable. \nIt is a bill that includes the strongest protection for consumers that \nhas ever been enacted. It is an end to taxpayer bailouts, and it gives \ntools to individuals, the resources they need to make smart financial \ndecisions. It is a bill that ends Wall Street's ``anything goes'' rules \nthat have meant everybody else pays.\n  Unfortunately, the ``no'' vote from the other side yesterday told us \nthey\n\n[[Page S2692]]\n\ndon't want strong new protections that can't be ignored. It appears \nthey don't want to hold Wall Street accountable for years of \nirresponsibility and taxpayer-funded bailouts. Instead of fundamentally \nchanging the financial rules of the road, the other side wants to build \na speed bump and pass a bill that neither reforms Wall Street nor \nprotects Main Street.\n  I fear that the obstruction and unwillingness to allow us to bring a \nbill to the floor is simply their push to get a watered-down bill that \nbig banks can simply step aside from and ignore. It has been \nrubberstamped by Wall Street lobbyists and special interests. This is \njust an effort to figure out how they can preserve the status quo and \ntalk their way out of change.\n  I fear the delay is about allowing special interests in Washington \nand bankers on Wall Street and big money donors to write a compromise \nbill. I worry that just about everybody has been invited to the table \nto write that bill--except the American people. That is because the \nvast majority of Americans want to see the strong Wall Street reforms \nwe have put forward pass.\n  In fact, just yesterday, the Washington Post released a poll that \nshows 63 percent of Americans want to see stronger regulations of Wall \nStreet enacted. But do you know what. There is still a widely held view \non Wall Street--as yesterday's vote shows--with many in this Chamber \nthat the voices of the people can be drowned out by big money and \ntwisting words about the truth about what is in this bill. Wall Street \nthinks they can get away with highway robbery because, unfortunately, \nthey have. They think they can pull a fast one on Main Street. I am \nhere to tell you they cannot. They are flatout wrong. I know because I \ngot my values from Main Street. I grew up in Bothell, a small town of \n1,000 people. The values we learned on Main Street are good ones that \nare also good for your business and for your customers.\n  We learned that an honest business is a successful one. We learned \nthat our customers are not prey and businesses not predators. We \nlearned that personal responsibility means owning up to mistakes and \nmaking them right.\n  We believe these values are strong throughout our country today. \nThose values exist in such small towns as the one I grew up in and big \ncities in every State. Everyone who voted against moving forward with \nthis bill yesterday is going to hear from people who hold those values \ntoday. I am sure they will tell you in no uncertain terms that it is \ntime to pass a bill with strong reforms for a system that is out of \ncontrol. It is time to protect our consumers, time to end bailouts, and \ntime to restore personal responsibility and bring back accountability.\n  I am very hopeful in the coming few days all of those who voted no \nwill move forward and listen to the hard-working men and women in this \ncountry so we can put forward a strong reform bill on Wall Street and \nprotect the American people and the millions of people who have lost \ntheir jobs and their security and homes in the last few years from ever \nhaving this happen again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me thank my colleague from the State of Washington. I \nappreciate very much her comments and her leadership.\n  I see my friend, Senator Brownback, as well. Madam President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the last 7\\1/2\\ minutes be reserved for myself \nbefore the vote. Is that the correct time; 7 or 7\\1/2\\ minutes? 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, may I inquire how much time remains \non our side on the debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-five minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair, and I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I thank my colleague from Connecticut, whom I think the world of. He \nis a wonderful family man, whom I saw out walking this morning. He is a \ngreat human being, a great Senator, and of great lineage. I am sorry to \nsee Senator Dodd leaving.\n  I have one particular area of this bill about which I wish to raise a \npoint. Auto dealers are in town today. We have a series of auto dealers \nfrom across the country who are here and they are deeply concerned \nabout the consumer financial products piece of this particular \nlegislation. They are concerned because it is going to hit them. I \nwould point out to my colleagues about this that I have purchased a \ncar--I presume everyone in this body has purchased a car--and probably \na number of us on credit, although maybe not everybody. But nearly \neveryone has gone into a dealership and bought a new or used car and \nasked for financing on that new or used car and have gotten it from the \nlocal dealership. Ninety-four percent of those cars that are financed \nthat way, that paper is actually from some relationship the dealership \nhas upstream. It is from a bank, a major consumer auto lending entity \nor from somebody else who does the financing. The local dealership just \nhas the paper there, and they are the ones that originate it. They sell \nthe car and arrange for somebody else to do the financing. They don't \ndo it--or 94 percent don't do that. Six percent of car dealerships do \ntheir own local financing.\n  I have an amendment that I will put forward, if we get a chance--or I \nwould prefer this actually be built into the base bill--where the local \nauto dealership that doesn't loan their own money isn't required to \ncomply with the consumer financial products requirement of this bill. \nIt will add another level of regulation onto auto dealers that are \nalready struggling to try to get cars to market so people can purchase \nand they can provide financing for individuals.\n  If we add another level of regulation, it will just mean more cost, \nand they are already regulated. This product would be regulated \nupstream already. The financial institutions that are writing the note \nand the paper are already regulated under this bill. Why would we do \nthe double regulation in the bill on top of the local regulation they \nalready have?\n  That is why the auto dealers are here in town today, saying they \ndidn't cause the financial crisis, they are not banks, and they do not \nthink they ought to be a part of this. They are quintessential Main \nStreet auto dealers. They are part of the Main Street fabric. We have \nlost a lot of auto dealers across the country during this financial \ndownturn. We spent $3 billion trying to support the auto industry and \nnow we have this heavy-handed regulation that will cost auto sales. It \ndoesn't seem to make sense that we would penalize Main Street for Wall \nStreet's problems. They are small businesses, the auto dealers are, in \ncities and towns throughout the country. We should be talking about how \nwe can support them and extend credit in the marketplace rather than \nregulate and tamping down on their business.\n  My amendment is simple. It keeps these new banking regulations from \ntouching auto dealers that do not loan their own money. That is all it \ndoes. If they loan their own money, they are subject to it. If they do \nnot loan their own money, if some other major bank, financial house or \ninstitution does it, that financial house or bank or institution is \nsubject to the regulation. But the auto dealer that is simply there \ntrying to get a car sold and providing this instrument that comes from \nsomebody else, they are not regulated, so they do not have the extra \ncost. So it is not double regulation from the same bill.\n  If an auto dealer does lend that money, as I mentioned, they will be \nregulated. This amendment applies only to auto dealers that facilitate \nloans from larger financial companies. Why should we have to amend \nthis? If I am hearing anything across my State--and I am traveling a \nlot across Kansas--people are fed up with heavy-handed, big government. \nThey have had it up to their necks and beyond with heavy-handed, big \ngovernment. Why would we do this on top of everything else?\n  These auto dealers are the retail outlets. They are the storefronts \nthat process the paperwork for various well-known brands with large \nfinance arms. Under my amendment, these finance arms would still be \nregulated, but the dealers that process the paperwork wouldn't. But it \nis still regulated upstream. The auto dealerships themselves have been \ncrippled from sales\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\nthis last year, crippled from the financial crisis we hit. We have been \ntrying to help and support them. This is a break in the cardinal rule \nthat if you want less of something, tax and regulate it. That is what \nthis bill will do. We will have less auto dealerships if you are going \nto tax and regulate them. It doesn't make any sense.\n  Under my amendment, auto dealers would still be regulated by the FTC \nand various State laws, so consumers would still have protection to \nensure that truth in lending still applies. So if you are concerned \nabout auto dealers and what they are doing, the writing and the paper \nretailwise, they remain regulated by the FTC and various State laws and \nconsumer protection laws that are currently in place. I think those are \nthings that should remain in place, and they do remain in place. We \ndon't need another level on top of that. Why do we need to create a \nduplicative regulation for auto dealers, where we regulate each dollar \nof each auto loan twice? This is what frustrates people so much.\n  I have people raise the concern about what happens outside military \nbases and auto loans outside military bases. We have several major \nmilitary bases in the State of Kansas. We are very proud of our \nmilitary bases and our military. They are saying: OK. We want to get at \nauto loans and dealers there. Well, they are regulated. They are \ncurrently regulated. They are currently regulated under the FTC and \nvarious State laws.\n  If somebody is concerned about a small auto dealer that sits right \noutside a military base and tries to get financing for military members \nand they do not like what the financing is, that is currently \nregulated. It is already in many States, where a State's attorney \ngeneral can go at these right now. They know where they are located. It \nis not as if they are hiding and moving around. They are located right \noutside military bases. If you want to hit them and regulate them, go \nto the State attorney general, go to the State consumer products \nagency, go to the State consumer finance agencies and have them address \nit. Why on Earth, with the big financial problem we have had that was \ncreated by Wall Street and international traders, would you want to \nhammer the local auto dealers?\n\n  As I put this amendment forward, it was interesting to me that we had \na number of groups say people who sell recreational vehicles are also \ninterested in being brought into this amendment and being excluded or \nmotorcycle financers or any number of groups because they are seeing \nthe same problem. They are small businesspeople. They are going to be \nregulated by this enormous Federal entity that was targeted at Wall \nStreet and, instead, as small businesses in their local communities, \nthey are going to get hit. They are going to take the hammer, and they \nare not set up to handle it. They do not have huge staffs in these \nareas. They have small staffs to take care of this, and now we are \ngoing to put a big regulatory entity on top of them when it is already \nregulated upstream.\n  This makes no sense, and it will do no good. It will cost a lot more, \nit will make financing less available to individuals, and it will hurt \nthese businesses. It will hurt car sales, it will hurt motorcycle \nsales, and it will hurt the economy for no good reason. I ask my \ncolleagues to focus in on what is happening in this area of the \nconsumer products and their financing. Do we want to hit auto dealers? \nI don't think so. I don't think that was the target of this bill. It \ncertainly wasn't the cause of the financial crisis we had.\n  Why would we have to hit them? We don't. Listen to your local auto \ndealers. They are here in town today. Hear their story about what is \ntaking place. Let's help the auto dealers, as we have been trying to \ndo, and let's not hurt them with a heavyhanded regulation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me begin, first of all, by \ncomplimenting my colleague from Kansas, who has been indefatigable in \nthe argument and the cause that he was espousing just now. He has \ntalked to all of us about this problem, and he has made it very clear \nthis shouldn't be an intention within this legislation. We shouldn't be \ntrying to expand the reach of a bill--that was supposed to deal with \nWall Street--all the way to our local car dealers on Main Street. I \nappreciate the fact that sometimes legislation sweeps with too broad a \nbrush, but this is something we can fix and we need to fix it.\n  In fact, it is not just the auto dealers. The National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses, which bills itself as the voice of small \nbusiness, and frequently does represent small business causes, has \nwritten a letter to us, on April 26, describing this unduly large reach \nof the legislation before us.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks the letter I have just referred \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, another word about what is said in this \nletter. They point out the fact that the consumer protection part of \nthe legislation goes far beyond protecting consumers from Wall Street. \nIt essentially goes to anybody who lends money on an installment basis \nwhere you have more than four installment payments. Let me quote from \nthe letter.\n\n       NFIB is concerned about the overly broad reach of the new \n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Providing consumers \n     with clear and accurate financial information is an important \n     goal, but because of the reach of the Bureau's authority many \n     small businesses will find themselves subject to its \n     regulations. In addition to the many new and duplicative \n     regulatory burdens placed on community banks, the Bureau is \n     charged with regulating any retailer or merchant that \n     finances a purchase subject to a financing charge or written \n     payment plan with more than four payments. Many small \n     business retailers and merchants--such as medical \n     professionals, hardware, electronics, and jewelry stores--\n     struggling through the current economic climate would be \n     subject to these new regulations.\n       These small businesses had nothing to do with the Wall \n     Street meltdown and should not be faced with onerous new and \n     duplicative regulations because of a problem that they did \n     not cause.\n\n  The first concern I have with this legislation is this overbreadth in \nthe consumer protections. Wall Street can take care of itself. It's \nfine to provide protections against Wall Street, but surely we can \nreach an agreement that we don't intend this legislation to reach into \nMain Street, to the extent it does. I would urge my colleagues to \nlisten to the concerns expressed by the NFIB and let's try to deal with \nthose concerns in a way that would enable us to be more supportive of \nthe legislation.\n  The second point I would like to make has to do with the so-called \ntoo big to fail or taxpayer bailouts. There are different ways of \ntalking about this. I find it interesting that some of my colleagues \nhave apparently a great reverence for a pollster and wordsmith by the \nname of Frank Luntz. Frank Luntz is a person whom I know, and he is \nvery good with words. He is a good pollster and so on. At one time, he \napparently wrote a memo that suggested that one way to attack a bill \nsuch as the bill that is before us--I think my colleague, the chairman \nof the committee, has noted this memo was written by Luntz before there \neven was a bill--was to use bailout language. I haven't seen the memo, \nbut I understand that is what it said.\n  No. 2, Republicans have used this bailout language; therefore, No. 3, \nwe are blindly following Luntz. Well, if I suggested that to my \nprofessor in philosophy 101, I would get flunked out of the course for \nthe basic failure in logic. This is a logic fallacy--something followed \nsomething else; therefore, it was because of it. The law that is the \nfamous saying--post hoc ergo propter hoc--obviously, a fallacy.\n  So I defend those of my colleagues who have used language that may be \nsomewhat similar to Luntz on the basis that just because they used the \nlanguage didn't mean that Luntz caused them to use it. It may be Luntz \nfigured out the same thing the rest of us figured out--this bill does \nnot end taxpayer bailouts. That is the problem. Taxpayers are still on \nthe hook.\n  I can understand the sensitivity of those who helped to write the \nbill who are subject to the criticism in this language. But the \nsolution to it is obvious: Get the taxpayers out of this so they are no \nlonger on the hook for any bailouts and then the argument will not last \nanymore, whether Luntz likes it or not. That could be done through a\n\n[[Page S2694]]\n\nprocess of negotiation. The bill was supposed to stop additional \ntaxpayer liability. Let's make sure it does.\n  In this regard, I have to object a little to some of the pejorative \nlanguage used by some Democratic Senators.\n  We have rhetoric about Republicans' motives. I am not going to \nsuggest which Senators are talking about it, but one of them spoke \nspecifically with respect to the Republican leader by name.\n  When you are questioning the motives of someone, suggesting the only \nreason they did it is because they read somebody's memo or because some \nlobbyist from Wall Street has been visiting them or suggesting it was \nbecause of campaign contributions, that gets very close to a violation \nof Senate rules. Senators can take responsible positions on bills \nirrespective of what a lobbyist might have said or somebody might have \nwritten in a memorandum.\n  I would like to have an honest debate about the bill rather than \nsuggesting the motivations of Senators with respect to the positions \nthey have taken.\n  One of my colleagues--in fact, it was the Senator from Illinois--\nasked the question, with regard to the vote we are about to take here, \nWhat are Republicans afraid of? In effect, are we afraid of going to \nthe bill and then having votes on amendments? Let me answer that \nquestion very specifically.\n  One thing at least I am concerned about is that we will not get to \nhave votes on amendments. We were promised, in the health care debate, \nthis 2,400- or 2,700-page bill, that we would get lots of amendments to \ntry to deal with the concerns we had. I believe it was seven--after \nseven amendments, once the leader got his 60 votes, there were no more \nvotes. There was no more amendment process. There was no more debate. \nAt that point, cloture was filed, the vote was taken, and he had his 60 \nvotes. End of discussion.\n  There is nothing to suggest that if we go to this bill, we are going \nto have a fair amendment process. If that were made very clear by the \nmajority leader, by the distinguished chairman of the committee, and \nRepublicans had some sense that we would fare better than we did during \nthe health care debate, then that would be one thing. But with the \nexperience of the health care debate behind us, I think you can \nunderstand why we would be a little bit wary of ``just trust us, go to \nthe bill, and we will let you have all the amendments you want to try \nto fix the bill.'' That is the first point.\n  Let me get back just a little bit to this issue about the bailout \nbecause I made an assertion and I need to back it up.\n  I really don't think any of us want to continue to have taxpayers on \nthe hook. But this is complicated, and it may well be that the \ncontinuing authority, for example, of the FDIC that is specifically \nwritten into the legislation, while not intended to result in taxpayers \nbeing on the hook, it nevertheless does.\n  Let me refer to a couple of articles. One is by a visiting professor, \na Georgetown University business school professor, Phillip Swagel. The \nhead of the article is ``Yes, It's a Bailout Bill.'' He says:\n\n       . . . [T]he discretion given to the government in the \n     Senate proposal opens the door to undesirable actions such as \n     allowing the administration to write checks to favored \n     parties. This concern is not theoretical: such mischief took \n     place in the bankruptcies of Chrysler and General Motors, as \n     the two auto companies were used as conduits to transfer \n     billions of dollars from TARP to the president's political \n     supporters.\n\n  He is talking there about labor unions.\n\n       A better approach would be a resolution regime centered on \n     bankruptcy.\n\n  There is a lot of debate about exactly how to do this liquidation \nprocess, unwinding process, quasi-bankruptcy process, and so on. There \nare a lot of good arguments. It is difficult to do, and I appreciate \nthat the chairman of the Banking Committee has had to deal with a lot \nof different ideas from different Senators about how to do it, as well \nas a lot of columnists, and so on.\n  But it is a fact that under the existing legislation, there is still \nliability for taxpayers here that concerns some of us. We would like to \nsee a genuine discussion about taking that out. If it is a concern of \nall of us and we all agree that should not be, let's have a little good \nfaith here and get it out before we come to the floor and have to try \nan amendment where there are 41 Republicans, 59 people who organize \nwith Democrats, and we are not at all assured of being able to get it \nout of the bill.\n  Here is another article. It is in the National Review Online, April \n26. The article is entitled ``The Case Against the Dodd Bill.'' They \nmake several points in here, but one of them is this resolution \nauthority.\n\n       But the resolution authority designed by the Dodd bill \n     might actually create more moral hazard than it would \n     eliminate, because it would give the FDIC too much \n     flexibility in how it resolves a failed firm.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       As structured, this authority would allow the Government to \n     bail out nonbank creditors, and worse, to play favorites \n     among them, just as we saw when the Obama administration \n     gift-wrapped large stakes in the automakers for its union \n     allies at the expense of secured creditors.\n\n  My point here is simply that there are a lot of people who have \nlooked at this and have come to the conclusion, as I have, that the \nbill is not tightly enough written; that, as written, it has too much \nin it that would allow various Federal entities, including the FDIC, \npretty unlimited authority to use taxpayer money to resolve or \nliquidate or deal with companies that are deemed necessary to deal \nwith. I won't say ``too big to fail'' because allegedly we are \neliminating that.\n  Surely we can get together and try to resolve this issue in a way \nthat leaves no doubt that the ultimate conclusion is there is no more \ntaxpayer liability. I think we would all like to see that. It is a \nlegitimate debate to have, and I don't think we should criticize those \nof us who are raising these questions as somehow doing so because some \nlobbyist told us to. I don't care about the lobbyist or Wall Street \nhere. What I care about is my constituent taxpayers being on the hook \nfor a bailout of one of these entities or the creditors of these \nentities or the shareholders of these entities.\n  This is the final point I wish to make. This is like the Sherlock \nHolmes story of the dog that didn't bark. There is something missing \nfrom this legislation. If you look through the entire bill--and \nprobably the biggest reason for the failure of our financial system was \nthe fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were allowed to go whole hog, \ntake on a bunch of bad loans, and end up with an implicit guarantee \nthat ultimately became an explicit guarantee by the taxpayers of \nAmerica. You won't find any resolution of that problem in this bill.\n  Why is it that, when everybody knows this problem began with a lot of \nloans being made to people who could not afford them--those loans then \nbeing acquired by Fannie and Freddie and then sold off in fancy, \nesoteric instruments on the market here--why is it that there is \nnothing in here about the risk of Fannie and Freddie and the risk they \nstill pose? It is way north, apparently, of $400 billion--I have heard \nin the trillions of dollars--and this would be a taxpayer liability. If \nthat is the case, shouldn't we be focusing reform on the entities that \nactually created the problem, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Why isn't \nthat being done?\n  The former chairman of the Banking Committee has explained. The \nSenator from Alabama, when he was chairman of the committee, tried to \nget more regulatory authority over Fannie and Freddie. Members of the \nthen-minority, now-majority party stopped him and said: No, we don't \nneed any more regulatory authority. I especially remember a quote from \nthe chairman of the House banking committee that was especially \ncolorful in this regard, that he thought we could give them a little \nbit more latitude here, that he didn't think any more regulation was \nnecessary.\n  So the question is, If we knew there was a big problem a-brewing \nhere, we didn't do anything about it at the time and after the fact \ndiscovered, of course, that is exactly what the problem was, why \nwouldn't we want to make sure that it will never happen again and that \nwe somehow resolve the problem?\n  One of the answers given is that it is an awfully big problem to try \nto tackle. This is an awfully big bill. If we can reach into Main \nStreet, to your local car dealer or dentist because your kid's \northodontia takes more than 4 months to pay on installments, surely we \ncan\n\n[[Page S2695]]\n\ndeal with Fannie and Freddie, the biggest culprits of all in this deal. \nWhy aren't Fannie and Freddie dealt with here? Let's not think we will \ndo that next time. I think it is pretty clear that whatever we do here, \nwe are probably going to be stuck with for a long time, and the failure \nto deal with this is a glaring omission in the legislation.\n  Nor do I think that if we grant the motion to proceed to the bill and \none of us offers an amendment to cover Fannie and Freddie, that it \nwould fare too well in this body. I will not specifically ask the \nchairman of the committee or anybody else whether they would support \nsuch an amendment, but the reality is that it is unlikely this body \nwould actually regulate Fannie and Freddie. That is a reason why some \nof us oppose the legislation.\n  Unless there is some ability to negotiate something in advance of the \nbill actually coming to the floor, with very little likelihood that it \nwould be done on the floor, it seems to me that this is another reason \nwhy those of us who have opposed cloture have every basis for coming \nhere and saying that until we get some satisfaction, some suggestion \nthat this problem is going to be dealt with, why would we want to \nproceed to legislation which obviously isn't even going to fix the \nbiggest part of the problem that was created in the first place? That \nis a third reason why I think at least up to now Republicans have said \nwe are not prepared to go to this legislation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                      of Independent Business,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2010.\n       Dear Senator:  On behalf of the National Federation of \n     Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's leading small \n     business advocacy organization, we urge the Senate to vote \n     against cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 3217, the \n     Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010. The \n     current bill is too far reaching and imposes major new costs \n     on small businesses.\n       After the near collapse of many financial firms and the \n     impact this had on the overall economy, small business \n     recognizes the need to ensure that our laws address the \n     problems that can arise from such excess and to protect the \n     broader economy from the failures of one sector. But these \n     changes to financial services industry should be focused on \n     the specific problems caused by Wall Street and the lessons \n     learned from these events. New laws that target industries \n     and businesses on Main Street that did not create the problem \n     would not solve the problems and potentially creates new \n     ones.\n       NFIB is concerned about the overly broad reach of the new \n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Providing consumers \n     with clear and accurate financial information is an important \n     goal, but because of the reach of the Bureau's authority many \n     small businesses will find themselves subject to its \n     regulations. In addition to the many new and duplicative \n     regulatory burdens placed on community banks, the Bureau is \n     charged with regulating any retailer or merchant that \n     finances a purchase subject to a financing charge or a \n     written payment plan with more than four payments. Many small \n     business retailers and merchants--such as medical \n     professionals, hardware, electronics, and jewelry stores--\n     struggling through the current economic climate would be \n     subject to these new regulations.\n       These small businesses had nothing to do with the Wall \n     Street meltdown and should not be faced with onerous new and \n     duplicative regulations because of a problem they did not \n     cause. Further, as the most recent NFIB Small Business \n     Economic Trends (SBET) survey shows, small businesses \n     continue to struggle with lost sales and such regulations \n     could make these problems worse--stifling any potential small \n     business recovery. Placing more restrictions on the ability \n     to attract and keep customers to small businesses will \n     inhibit a strong recovery.\n       NFIB also has concerns with a provision in the bill that \n     reduces the pool of angel investors that can provide start-up \n     capital or invest in a small business. The provision sets \n     higher wage and asset minimum requirements on angel \n     investors, thus eliminating many highly qualified angel \n     investors from providing needed financing. This provision \n     would hamper the entrepreneurial opportunities for angel \n     investment opportunities for many small and start-up \n     businesses, thus adding another road block to finding \n     alternative capital financing when bank lending and other \n     sources of financing remains hard to get in this economy.\n       Small business still has not recovered from the economic \n     downturn and has paid the price for the bad decisions and \n     subsequent bailout of many large financial institutions. \n     Addressing problems in the financial services sector makes \n     sense, but such regulations should not overreach to include \n     small business or leave small business owners paying for the \n     excess of companies deemed too big to fail.\n       Thank you for taking into consideration our concerns, and \n     we ask the Senate to oppose the motion to proceed to the \n     current bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Susan Eckerly,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                                    Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I inquire how much is remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). There is 10\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KYL. There is 10\\1/2\\ minutes on our side? I will yield to the \nchairman of the committee for a moment.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator from Arizona. My intention was--let me \nsay a couple of things.\n  Mr. KYL. What I might do is yield the floor and reserve the remainder \nof the Republican time. In that way, if one of my colleagues comes and \nI have to leave, that time will be remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I have reserved the last 7\\1/2\\ minutes. I think otherwise \nwe might run out of time, I say to my friend from Arizona. I will just \ntake 1 minute, if I may.\n  I want to tell him and say this to him. I have been here 30 years. I \nhave chaired bills on the floor. I never chaired a committee before 36 \nmonths ago when I became chairman of the Banking Committee under our \nsystem. But I want to say this to my friend from Arizona and I want him \nto convey this to his colleagues through this vehicle: I would never \ndeprive another Senator of the opportunity to offer amendments on the \nfloor. I revere this body. I began my service in this body sitting on \nthose steps over there as a page. And how the Senate works is because \nwe all participate in the debate.\n  I know there are those who have this concern and fear. Obviously, you \ndo not have unlimited debate forever. But the point is, amendments \nought to be offered. I have colleagues on my side, politically, of the \naisle who want to make this bill stronger, in their views. I know there \nare people who think I have gone too far with the bill and want to \nwater it down a bit. That debate can only occur if we are on the bill. \nBut I want my colleague to know, as one of the leaders of the minority, \nthat I would never deprive another colleague of the opportunity to be \nheard, offer their amendment and their thoughts in that process.\n  Secondly, on the too big to fail, this goes back and forth. Senator \nShelby and I have worked on this. I see the possibility that--if there \nare some workability amendments that tighten that up, I am all for \nthat. Senator Boxer of California has an amendment that would say that \nnothing in this bill can ever allow taxpayer money to be used. I am for \nthat amendment. I don't know how many different ways we can say it. I \nthink all of us agree we don't want to see our country go through that \nagain. So the only limitations here are, do we think we are finding \nadditional language here that will satisfy us that we have done the job \nwe think we have intended to do? Senator Shelby and I talked about how \nto do this. Again, if that is the holdup, that should not hold us up \nbecause we are both committed to that.\n  Thirdly, I want to say that there is a document circulating with some \nideas of a Republican alternative that includes getting into the \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises. I say to my friend, it is a huge \nissue, the GSEs. It is not just Fannie and Freddie; there are others. \nIt needs a lot of work.\n  But this proposal I have read--and it is not legislative language--a \nlot of it, I don't have any problem whatsoever. I am not sure who the \nauthor of this is, but it has been circulated. Again, I am not \nendorsing everything here because it is just a concept, but if that is \nan amendment, the better part of what I have seen, about 90 percent of \nwhat I have seen here, I have no problem with at all. That can be an \namendment included as part of our bill. But, again, I have to get to \nit. The difficult problem I have is everybody is coming with things \nthey would like to add to or subtract from the bill, but, as my \ncolleague knows, having been a leader around here for a long time, you \nhave to get to the product. That is my frustration here.\n  Lastly, I am not going to bore him with too much detail here, but in \nsection 1027--and I won't read all of it--the last lines on \nlimitations, because of\n\n[[Page S2696]]\n\nthe concerns people have about dentists or other people being drawn \ninto our consumer protection section say:\n\n       Notwithstanding subparagraph (B), the Bureau may not \n     exercise any rulemaking, supervisory, enforcement, or other \n     authority under this title with respect to a merchant, \n     retailer, or seller of nonfinancial goods or services that is \n     not engaged significantly in offering or providing consumer \n     financial products or services.\n\n  And, again, to insulate against the very worry you would have, and \nothers have talked about, the NFNIB, someone who has four installment \npayments--it may be your local grocer, people who show up and buy food \nand do not pay for it, but usually at the end of the month or the end \nof 6 months, you have to be in the business of financial services or \nproducts to be affected by the legislation.\n  Now, again, I know there are Members who have problems with that part \nof the bill. People on my side who want to strengthen it think I have \nnot gone far enough on the bill. One of the difficult jobs is trying to \nreconcile differences that exist. But I cannot even begin to do so if \nwe cannot even talk about it.\n  So that is my frustration as the chairman of a committee, trying to \nget us to a point where all of us want to be, I am sure. We do not want \nto leave here having said we did not really deal with this problem that \neveryone in the country--I know, Arizona, what you have been through in \nyour housing issues is staggering. Florida, California, Arizona, I \nthink Nevada probably rank in the most difficult States where housing \nprices have declined and foreclosures have occurred.\n  I know my friend from Arizona feels as strongly about this as I do. \nBut I assure him, I will not deprive anybody of an amendment to be \noffered at all in the process. Secondly, we will try the workability \nissues on too big to fail and, again, language we have worked on on the \nconsumer protection, and we think we took care of those dentists and \nothers who were worried about it.\n  But, again, others may have amendments and ideas. I will have to \nconsider them on the Senate floor, and all of us will have to vote on \nthem. But I appreciate him giving me a little time to express my \nthought.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. If I may respond very briefly, I appreciate the Senator's \ncomments. I am sure the chairman would acknowledge the basis for some \nRepublican concerns about the ability to offer, not an unlimited number \nof amendments for the purpose of filibustering the bill, but, rather, \nenough to try to solve what are perceived to be the problems of the \nbill.\n  Part of the problem is a lack of trust. There are some on the \nDemocratic side who have said they believe the intent of the Republican \nleadership, or Republicans, is to filibuster this bill so there would \nbe no bill. It is hard to prove a negative, but I do not know how many \ntimes Leader McConnell and I or Ranking Member Shelby have said that is \nnot our intention. Everybody acknowledges that there is work to be done \nin the regulatory regimes that govern the trade in these very esoteric \ninstruments, the derivatives and others, and regulating financial \ninstitutions and dealing with the problem when some of them become \nfinancially troubled. Everybody acknowledges the need to do that.\n  I firmly believe at the end of the day there will be legislation \npassed that deals with that. I do not think there is anything the \nminority could do, even if it wanted to, to stop legislation from \nultimately passing. So to those colleagues on the other side who \nbelieve it is the Republicans' intent to stop the legislation, to have \nno legislation, all I can say is, yet one more time, that is not true.\n  I do not know of a single Republican who believes that, of a single \nRepublican who does not want to see legislation. Nor do I believe this \nis analogous to health care in that there was a strictly partisan \napproach taken there. The lines were drawn, and we do not have to \ndebate how we got there. The reality was, at the end of the day, \nRepublicans were trying to do everything we could to stop the \nlegislation, and the majority did everything within its power to \nultimately get it passed.\n  That is not the same situation I see with this bill because, first of \nall, I think Members are a little closer than was the case on health \ncare. Secondly, there has been at least a negotiating process between \nthe chairman and the ranking member and others that has suggested ways \nto at least approach some of these problems.\n  Republicans are suffering under no illusions that with a 59-to-41 \nSenate lineup we should get 100 percent of the way or even 60 or 50 \npercent of the way. Senator Shelby has made it clear he understands he \nneeds to compromise because the majority has more votes than the \nminority does, but to try to get at least a proportional or \nrepresentative sample of Republican ideas in here.\n  Moreover, as my colleagues' conversations just revealed, there is a \nlot of overlap in intent. I do not think we intend the bill to reach \ninto Main Street to the degree that some of us are concerned it still \ndoes. I do not think there is the intention to see taxpayers still on \nthe hook to the extent some of us think the bill still does. And to the \nextent the chairman of the committee says there have to be ways to \nensure that does not happen, and we can do that, I accept what he says \nin good faith. I also accept in good faith his view that amendments, \nwithin reason, should not be limited.\n  Again, there is no intent on the Republican side to filibuster the \nbill to prevent a vote from ever occurring. I do not think we would \nhave that ability even if we wanted to do that. So we have to get over \nthis problem of trust. Another way to do that is to lead by beginning \nto make a difference in the way that the--not the legislation is \ndiscussed, but the Senators are discussed, the motivations for \ndifferent Senators.\n  It would be easy to come to the floor and talk about motivations. It \nwould also be wrong. I think the leaders in the debate, starting with \nthe leadership and then the chairman and ranking of the committee and \non down, perhaps have had some responsibility to take the lead in \nmaking sure in the discussions on the merits of the bill--when I raise \na particular issue, as the chairman just did, to say: Well, let me go \nto the language and see if I think we do have it already covered, \nrather than: I know why you are saying that, Senator from Arizona. You \nhave some ill motive. The Senator would not say that. So perhaps we can \nbegin to reach a better sense of trust where we can begin to work \nthrough these things in a much more constructive way by taking the \nleadership and getting a more civil conversation.\n  When I say that, I point to nobody in particular as in violation but \nrather point to myself and the other leadership as the place to start \nwith setting that tone. All of these things could begin to build the \ntrust that might enable us to begin to engage each other.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority's time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. How time flies when you are having fun.\n  And to conclude a process that will be constructive and helpful to \nthe American people.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Republican \nleader for his comments. Part of what he just said is worthy of note. \nThis institution suffers. We operate on unanimous consent. That is the \nway it works. And inherent in unanimous consent is trust. It is the \nonly way this institution has ever operated.\n  There has been, I think we would all have to acknowledge, a breakdown \nfor a lot of different reasons. We have to get back to it. This is an \nopportunity to do that.\n  Senator Shelby and I have a very good working relationship. We trust \neach other. We talk to each other. We spent an hour together. We are \nmeeting again at 5:00, after this vote today, to talk about one way or \nthe other where the bill is. There has to be a return to that comity \nand understanding, while we have differences of opinion.\n  If the American people believe we cannot trust each other, when I say \nI will--I was asked at our conference lunch, again, the very question \nthat my colleague from Arizona raised: Will I be allowed to offer an \namendment, Senator Dodd? Absolutely, you will.\n  So it is a concern I know that everybody has about whether they can \nbe heard on these matters. I would never,\n\n[[Page S2697]]\n\nas a person who reveres this institution, want to deprive anybody of an \nopportunity to be heard on a matter as important as this.\n  We have amendments I know are offered. I heard them--the cosponsors--\none Senator today listed the cosponsors of an amendment he wants to \noffer. There are more Republicans than Democrats on the amendment \ndealing with the Federal Reserve System. I have some concerns about \nthat amendment. But the fact is, it has bipartisan support for an \namendment they want to offer. There are a lot of these ideas. I know \nwithin the Republican circle there are divisions as well as to what \nought to be in this bill. We have them on our side as well. It is not \nas if there is some bright line here, and there is one solid thought \nprocess over here, and an alternative one over here. We have about as \nmany different views on this bill as there may be Members in this body.\n\n  But all I ask for is to get to this bill. Let's get to this debate. \nAgain, the leader got up and said this was a partisan bill. I have \nworked very hard to avoid that. Back in November when I introduced the \nbill, there were objections on the minority side as well as on the \nmajority side. We put it aside. We have spent from November up until \njust a few days ago trying to put a product together that would reflect \nall of this different thinking. It is a vastly different bill from the \none I introduced in November. I know it is not yet to everyone's \nsatisfaction, but we need to debate this bill, in my view.\n  It will take a long time. This is not going to be a short debate. I \nknow that. But we need to allocate the time talking about what is in \nthe bill or not in the bill rather than questioning each other's \nmotives as to why we are not on the bill, it seems to me.\n  So my plea is, again, as Senator Shelby has said, I think we are \nabout 80 percent in agreement. I believe that to be the case. If we are \n80 percent in agreement, that ought to be enough of a basis upon which \nto move forward. If we were all in disagreement about everything, well, \nI might still believe we ought to debate it. So, again, I see my \ncolleague--I realize he has to go, and we are going to vote in a couple \nof minutes. But I thank him for spending the time with me and to hear \nme out on these points. I am grateful to him for that.\n  Mr. President, those are sort of the points that I intended to make \nin these closing minutes of this discussion, once again. We had it \nyesterday, and here we are again this afternoon. With all of the things \nthat people are going through in the country, it seems to me, again, \nthis bill, which has been the product of a year and a half of work--\nthis was not drafted over a weekend or some short period of time trying \nto reflect the interests of my colleagues--is deserving of our \nconsideration.\n  I am not asking to vote for this with this next vote. No one will be \nasked to vote for this. No one will be asked to vote for any of the \nvarious amendments I am sure will be offered, and I will welcome, as \npart of this debate, and that Senator Shelby and I as managers of the \nbill will consider them.\n  All we are being asked to do, in the next 7 minutes or less, is to \ngive this product a chance to be discussed. This product reflects a \nyear and a half of effort to answer the question: What went wrong that \ncaused our economy and our Nation to go through the worst economic \ncrisis since the early part of the last century? That is a legitimate \nquestion being asked. What are the gaps? What steps are we taking to \nfill in those gaps? Are there cops on the beat to protect us? Do they \nhave the authority and the resources to do the job? Is there an early \nwarning system? These are all issues upon which I suspect, based on my \nconversations over a year and a half--or more than that now--on which \nwe have a lot of agreement.\n  I do not know of anyone in this Chamber who wants to support a bill \nthat does not end too big to fail. If they exist, I have not heard \ntheir voices. I do not think there is anyone here who does not believe \nwe should not have an early warning system so we can identify problems \nbefore they become the large ones that cost us as much as it has over \nthe last year and a half.\n  I think all of us--I have heard my colleagues say they are for a \nconsumer protection agency. I believe them. We have a consumer \nprotection agency in this bill. There is a debate about how much \nauthority we want to give them, the interface, the interaction with \nprudential regulators. Those are all arguments within the context of \nwhether we ought to have a consumer protection agency.\n  There is not a position over here that I know of--maybe some have \nit--that they are just flatout against a consumer protection agency. \nSenator Shelby has told me, and others on the Banking Committee: We are \nfor a consumer protection agency. They have differences about what \nought to happen within that. That is the purpose for having the debate. \nWe are told again, we heard it a moment ago: We ought to have the \nbright sunshine on derivatives, these exotic instruments that were \nused, went from $91 billion in 1998, to close to $600 trillion--that is \nwith a T--11 years later.\n  That shadow economy contributed significantly to what we went \nthrough. Based on what I have heard, everyone thinks we ought to do \nsomething about that and not leave the situation as it is today, as it \nwas 18 months ago, because nothing has changed since then, putting our \nNation at risk once again. So we agree on that as well.\n  Let's have transparency. Let's have accountability. There are \ndifferences; I would be naive and foolish to suggest otherwise. But \neveryone seems to agree we ought to do something about it. So if we \nlook at the major thrust of our bill--end too big to fail; set up an \nearly warning system to avoid the problems we saw in the past; deal \nwith these exotic instruments out there and have some agency that at \nlong last might keep an eye out for the average citizen in this \ncountry, that watches their credit cards, their mortgages, and so many \nother financial activities they engaged in that became deceptive and \nfraudulent, that they suffered terribly.\n  So we all agree on the basic goals outlined in this bill. Differences \nexist, at least in one or two of the years. Too big to fail, I do not \nthink there is any real disagreement. I do not think there is any \ndisagreement on the early warning system, as I have heard the debate. \nThe differences exist in what happens inside the consumer protection \nagency and what happens in the area of the shadow economy and dealing \nwith the derivatives and other items, but not whether we want to do \nsomething.\n  So that is what we ought to be doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. We have spent the last day debating whether we ought to \nhave this. Let's vote to invoke cloture and begin the long debate we \nneed to have. I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nproceed to the motion to reconsider the motion on the motion to invoke \ncloture on the motion to proceed to S. 3217 is agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider is agreed to.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to invoke cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 3217 upon reconsideration.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Bayh) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Utah (Mr. Bennett).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 57, the nays are \n41. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to upon reconsideration.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, is it appropriate for me to speak on \nthe bill for a few minutes, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed is pending.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, on a big bill, I find this a very puzzling situation \nwhere for the second time the other side of the aisle has essentially \nsaid, We won't let you go to a vote on a motion to proceed to debate \nuntil there is agreement on the bill. How can there be agreement on the \nbill if there isn't debate and if the majority at least isn't allowed \nto present its position? I find on a bill of this size and the \ncomplexity of the bill, to refuse to go to a debate on the bill to be \nan amazing thing. I hope the other side of the aisle will begin to see \nthat and relent.\n  I had a chance today to listen to some of the questions being asked \nin the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of Goldman Sachs, and \nif anything should show the need for this bill, it is what is going on \nin a Subcommittee of this body. Yet, out here, we cannot even begin the \ndebate on the bill. We cannot hear from the chairman of the committee. \nWe cannot hear from the ranking member. We cannot understand both \npoints of view. We are prevented essentially from debating one of the \nmost important bills this Congress will pass.\n  I wanted to come to the floor today to say that, as well as to speak \nin support of the derivatives position put forward on Monday by \nChairman Lincoln and Chairman Dodd as part of the financial and \ncommodities market reform package.\n  I think it is fair to say I have long advocated for more aggressive \nregulation of derivatives which, in the main, are very complex \nfinancial instruments exempted from Federal oversight through loopholes \nin the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In other words, \nprior to the year 2000, we could regulate these. After the year 2000, \nthey floated free, nontransparent, no audit trail, no antifraud, no \nantimanipulation oversight whatsoever. The Dodd-Lincoln bill is the \nmost aggressive and comprehensive proposal to regulate the out-of-\ncontrol derivatives market that has been offered yet in this Congress, \nand I strongly support it.\n  The Dodd-Lincoln bill will require robust Federal oversight. It will \nestablish transparency. It will reduce systemic risk. I believe this \nbill is the best chance to tackle these unregulated markets that were \nresponsible for bringing down Enron, AIG, Lehman Brothers, with \nterrible repercussions for the American economy and millions of hard-\nworking families. This bill will also rein in reckless traders who lack \na moral compass.\n  Today there is nothing more important than restoring faith in the \nAmerican economy, and we cannot do it without this bill. To do that, we \nhave to restore America's faith in our ability to take strong \ncorrective action against the bad actors who perpetrated this crisis. \nYes, this is our moment to act, yet we cannot. The other side of the \naisle will not let it happen.\n  Derivatives were exempted, as I said, from regulation in the \nCommodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000. That law created massive \nregulatory loopholes such as the Enron loophole which prohibited the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission from overseeing electronic \nexchanges; the London loophole, which allowed for unregulated trading \nof U.S. commodities on overseas exchanges, and the swaps loophole, \nwhich allowed for unregulated bilateral trades through brokers, swap \ndealers, and direct party-to-party negotiations. Together, these \nloopholes have been responsible for some of our Nation's worst economic \ncrises. They must be closed.\n\n  I first became aware of the problem of unregulated derivatives during \nthe Western energy crisis. The years were 2000 and 2001, when Enron \ntraders fleeced Californians for approximately $40 billion in \nartificially inflated electricity and natural gas prices.\n  Without Federal oversight rules in place, it took us some time to \nrealize what was going on in California, and then when we did, the \nparty in power would not believe us. We learned the hard way the \ndangers of having no paper trail, no one to raise the alarm, no cop on \nthe beat to enforce penalties.\n  Some experts told us this was just supply and demand. I even remember \ngoing to the White House and hearing these exact words. We didn't know \nthat traders were in it just for greed.\n  That is why I will never forget the day Senator Cantwell, another \nlong-time champion for derivatives reform, handed me a copy of the \ntaped conversations between Enron traders. These tapes from Enron's \nwest coast trading desk demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that \nenergy traders would do anything to make a buck.\n  When a forest fire shut down a major transmission line into \nCalifornia, cutting power supplies and raising prices, Enron energy \ntraders celebrated. Here is the quote:\n\n       Burn, baby, burn. That's a beautiful thing.\n\n  That is what a trader sang about the massive fire, which threatened \nhomes and lives.\n  The tapes also confirmed that in secret deals with power producers, \ntraders deliberately drove up prices by ordering powerplants shut down.\n  When California regulators tried to get money back from Enron, their \ntraders joked this way:\n\n       They're . . . taking all the money back from you guys? All \n     the money you guys stole from those poor grandmothers in \n     California.\n\n  That was the mentality. Another trader responded:\n\n       Yeah, Grandma Millie, man.\n\n  This was an eye-opening experience, to say the least.\n  In 2002, 2003, and 2004, I offered four separate amendments to \nrestore regulation to derivatives markets, and each time the \nPresident's working group on financial markets advocated against the \namendments, and they went down.\n  Our Nation's financial experts argued that private parties would \nprotect the public interest by looking out for their own interests, and \nCongress trusted our experts.\n  But the experts were wrong. They ignored the growing risk these \nproducts posed to our financial system.\n  In 2007, finally, the Senate took action to close the Enron loophole \nwhen it approved bipartisan legislation that I authored with Senator \nSnowe and others. That legislation brought regulatory oversight to \nelectronic commodity exchanges such as the IntercontinentalExchange, \nand it established antifraud and antimanipulation standards for our \nNation's electronic energy futures markets. But then they went offshore \nand traded on the London exchange to avoid the law. We learned that \nsoon there were other loopholes that remained open.\n  Beyond the reach of Federal oversight the derivatives market swelled \nto the size of $600 trillion. There were no rules to prevent systemic \nfailure, fraud, or manipulation. No one ensured that these products \nserved any commercial function beyond gambling, and no one worked to \nmake sure traders understood the products they traded.\n  It turns out traders often use the stockholder value of major \nfinancial institutions to gamble in markets they did not understand--\nwith bets large enough to put the entire financial system at risk.\n  They bet on oil. They bet on natural gas. And with the creation of \nthe credit default swap, they began to bet on each other's demise.\n  New exotic financial products were dreamed up, such as the recent one \nto trade movie box office futures, which was proposed by Cantor \nExchange this\n\n[[Page S2699]]\n\nyear. What public benefit is served by trading box office futures? All \nit does is create a huge problem for the motion picture industry.\n  In 2008, AIG and Lehman collapsed under the weight of unregulated \nfinancial derivatives. But this time it was not only Western energy \nconsumers who suffered. The unregulated derivatives market brought our \nentire economy to its knees.\n  That is why it is so vital that we learn from this experience and \nimplement the derivatives reform proposals that have been put forward \nby Senators Lincoln and Dodd.\n  Let me take a few moments to describe some of the bill's key \npositions.\n  It will require every trade to be reported in real time to the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, so regulators will know for the \nfirst time what is actually going on in these markets. They will be \ntransparent; they won't be dark markets. Everyone will know.\n  It will require standardized high-volume trades to be cleared through \na regulated clearinghouse. This will ensure that everyone in the system \ngets paid even when one trader defaults. Had we had this system in \nplace, AIG's collapse would not have posed a systemic risk.\n  Swap dealers who sell uncleared contracts to end users, which are \nmore risky than cleared trades, will be subject to significantly higher \ncapital requirements enforced by the CFTC in cooperation with bank \nregulators.\n  The bill helps small commercial end users such as utilities or \ntrucking companies hedge their risks, but major financial institutions \nand mutual funds will have to conduct their trading in regulated \nmarkets. That is a good thing.\n  It will require all cleared contracts to be traded on an exchange or \non a swap execution facility. Trading on exchanges or execution \nfacilities provides for pretrade transparency--again, light--which is \nnecessary to fully understand and manage the risks being taken by \nmarket participants, to provide more efficient and accurate pricing, \nand to facilitate more cost-effective risk management.\n  It will require speculative position limits to be set in the \naggregate for each commodity, instead of contract by contract. Position \nlimits provide an important restriction on market manipulation and the \namount of risk that can build up in any one market participant.\n  For the first time, the CFTC will be able to prevent speculators from \nassembling massive positions in a particular commodity, such as oil, by \nassembling large positions in multiple contracts. See how they do that.\n  Traders can now simply buy positions in Brent Crude Oil when they \nhave exceeded limits in West Texas Intermediate crude oil, and that \nmakes no sense. See, it is a way to hide the size of your trading \nposition.\n  Aggregate position limits will prevent manipulative practices, such \nas those deployed by the defunct hedge fund Amaranth in 2006, which \nassembled massive positions in two separate natural gas contracts and \nmanipulated one in order to profit on the other. Let there be no doubt \nabout this, Amaranth settled and paid a huge fine in substantial \nmillions of dollars.\n  Further, the bill will close the London loophole so they can't go \naround American law, by requiring that Foreign Boards of Trade adhere \nto minimum standards comparable to those in the United States and \nreport all trading activity to United States regulators on a timely \nbasis.\n  Finally--and perhaps most importantly--the bill will prevent FDIC-\ninsured retail banks and banks with access to the Federal Reserve \ndiscount window from engaging in the extremely risky practice of swaps \ndealing with a government guarantee. That is important.\n  This innovative and important provision effectively implements the \nVolcker rules and protects taxpayers. So you can see what a big \nprovision this is--remember, it was derivatives that brought the house \nof cards down. Now there will be transparency, clearing, and position \nlimits. I very much thank the chairman of the Banking Committee for \nnegotiating with Senator Lincoln and achieving this. It is a monumental \ngain.\n  I very strongly believe that all swap activities and commercial \nbanking should be distinct, so that taxpayers do not supplement, \nsubsidize, guarantee, or insure the riskiest activities of large \nfinancial institutions.\n  There is no denying that opponents of the bill are trying to come up \nwith new and creative ways to block this bill.\n  With so much at stake, it is not surprising that allies of the big \nbanks and Wall Street lenders have already launched a multimillion \ndollar ad campaign to frame the debate and fight these changes. They \nare cynically twisting the facts to assert that this legislation will \nperpetuate more bailouts in the future. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. The big Wall Street firms that caused this crisis have hired \nlobbyists to portray Wall Street reform as something that is bad for \ntaxpayers.\n  The loudest detractors of financial regulatory reform claim that it \nwill be another government intrusion in the free market. Well, we have \nfound out that the free market is not self-regulating.\n  Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that opponents of \nregulatory reform have adopted talking points distributed by a \nmessaging firm whose clients include Bank of America, Chase Card \nServices, and UBS. The memo suggests that the best way to kill the bill \nis to link it to the big bank bailouts.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have adopted these \ntalking points and are doing everything they can to block this critical \nbill. This is both dangerous and absurd. If we have learned anything \nfrom the recent past, it is that the disorderly failure of massive \nfinancial institutions is extremely destructive.\n  For the first time, with the passage of this bill, we will have a \nprocess in place to ensure the most minimal disruption necessary in \norder to wind down failures on Wall Street. That is what this is about. \nAnd the $50 billion is not government money. The $50 billion is a fund \nthat the companies contribute to, which is held in escrow by the \ngovernment so that if it has to be used, it can be used.\n  I stand behind Chairman Dodd when he emphasizes the level of \nbipartisan negotiations that have gone into the bill before us. But \nbipartisan compromise does not mean withholding support until you get \neverything you want. Financial reform is not a zero-sum game. We need \nsolutions, not threats to block meaningful reform of our financial \nmarkets. Without strong reform, every American who has been blindsided \nby the profit-above-all-else mentality of Wall Street will lose, lose, \nlose, and that is what is at stake in these cloture motions.\n\n  Anyone who has taken basic economics knows markets only function when \nmarket participants have good information--in fact, perfect information \nand when the transactions occur free of fraud, abuse, and manipulation. \nHanding control and oversight of financial markets to the biggest Wall \nStreet banks does not produce a free market with good information, free \nfrom abuse, as has been painfully illustrated over the last few years.\n  Accusations of fraud against Goldman Sachs, announced the Friday \nbefore last, underscore the need for financial reform. Goldman Sachs \nwill have their day in court, but the allegations against the firm cry \nout for greater transparency at giant Wall Street banks.\n  Let me return to where I began. I was 1 of the 40 Senators on the \ntelephone in September of 2008, when both Secretary Paulson of the \nTreasury and Ben Bernanke of the Federal Reserve talked to Senators and \nsaid--and I am paraphrasing, but this is the sum and substance of it--\nwe are a hair's breadth away from a major collapse of the entire \nfinancial marketplace of our country, and it will be worse than the \nGreat Depression if it happens.\n  I never expected to hear that. I never thought these market \nactivities could do that. To some extent, I believed the market was \nself-regulating, but it isn't. We found that out in spades. I think we \nare deleterious in our duty if we do not address this, if we do not \nfully debate it on the floor, if everybody who hears the debate doesn't \nunderstand what the evils are that are out there; that naked swaps, \nthat credit default swaps need oversight, that hedge funds without any \nregulation must have transparency, must be regulated, and that trading \nmust go over an\n\n[[Page S2700]]\n\nexchange. This bill accomplishes that. This bill protects the American \npeople.\n  I can't understand why anyone would not support this bill. If truly \nwhat we believe in and what we came to this office for and what we took \nour oath of office for was to protect the American people, this bill is \nmandatory. Not to do it is malfeasance of duty, in my view. Not to let \nus move forward with a robust debate, to waste time with cloture votes \nday after day--and it looks like they will continue--I believe is \nimproper. To demand that a bill has to be agreed upon by both sides \nbefore it is even debated on this floor as a major bill is something \nthat in this day and age, with the economic troubles of this Nation, I \nthought we would never ever hear.\n  So the bottom line is: Now is the time to act. Now is the time to \nclose the gaps in regulation. It is time to hold the big banks \naccountable to the people they serve. It is time to put a moral compass \ninto trading. It is time to ensure that taxpayers will never again be \nforced to bail out big banks because they are too big to fail. No bank \nis. That is what Wall Street reform will achieve. That is why I feel so \ncommitted to making it happen and why I am asking for the support of \nall our colleagues.\n  Senator Dodd and Senator Lincoln have assembled the strongest \nprovisions of each of their respective bills into a proposal to reform \nthe bilateral swaps and derivatives market that is more effective than \nany proposal to date. So I wish to thank both of them for their \nleadership in bringing this bill to the floor. I am very proud to stand \nwith them, along with my long-time colleagues in this effort, Senator \nSnowe, Senator Cantwell, Senator Dorgan, Senator Harkin, Senator Brown \nof Ohio, and Senator Nelson of Florida. They have worked for a long \ntime to bring about strong regulation of the derivatives market.\n  So the question remains: What will happen? Will this bill be allowed \nto see the light of day? Will this bill be able to regulate fraud and \nmanipulation? Will this bill be able to see that the American taxpayer \nis protected so we can say, truly, in good conscience: Never again will \nthis happen in the United States.\n  So I say to the other side: Stop this nonsense. Let this bill come to \nthe floor. Come down to the floor and debate it. Vote against it, if \nyou don't like it. That is the American way. I don't believe that when \na bill comes out of committee by a majority vote, regardless of how \nthat majority is achieved, whether it is bipartisan or the product of \none party, that it should be refused debate on the floor. We have a \nchance to change that. I hope the Republicans will. I hope we will \ndebate and pass this bill.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I rise for a second to talk about the \nfinancial services bill. I do want to say something in advance of that, \nand I am sorry Chairman Dodd is not on the floor.\n  This Friday is the last day Americans can go under contract on the \nfirst-time homebuyer tax credit and the move-up tax credit. I had the \nprivilege of working with the banking chairman on that legislation in \nthe fall of last year--and its extension--and I felt a sense of reward \ntoday when the announcement came out that for the first time in 36 \nmonths home values in the 20 test markets in the United States actually \nwent up by six-tenths of 1 percent. That is not a lot of money, but it \nis the first time in 36 months. The chairman created an environment to \nallow that debate to take place, and this Senate voted 100 to 0 to pass \nit and the American people have benefited from it.\n  As I tell so many who call me, it is not going to be extended because \ncredits such as that are designed to do what it has done; that is, to \nbring the marketplace back and hopefully stabilize values and move \nforward. I commend Senator Dodd for setting up the environment where \nthat could take place.\n  That brings me to my point on the bill before us. Senator Feinstein \ndid an excellent job of talking about Wall Street and some other people \nwho certainly need to be held accountable where there wasn't any \ntransparency, contributors to the problem, and the terrible problem the \nderivatives caused in the whole mess. But there is another story out \nthere I wish to bring up, because when we do get to the debate on this \nbill, it is my hope we will truly have a debate and an amendment \nprocess because there are some things not in this 1,407-page bill that \nought to be.\n  What I specifically want to talk about is Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, \nMoody's, and Standard & Poor's. When the market began to collapse, a \nlot of those derivatives that were talked about were bets, one way or \nanother, against the housing market, which in many ways had been \noverheated in America because of the approval of something known as a \nsubprime mortgage. But the devil in those details that caused us so \nmuch problem is that there was originally no market for subprime \nmortgage. They were B, C, and D credits. They were downpayment \nassistance loans. They were higher risk loans by their definition, but \nthey got securitized and two things happened: First, Moody's and \nStandard rated them as investment grade, AAA investment-grade \nsecurities; secondly, Freddie and Fannie, at the behest of the U.S. \nGovernment and its Congress--us--started buying those securities to \nmeet the desire to have more affordable housing in America, a noble \ngoal but a goal that was being achieved by loaning people money who \ncould not pay it back, by loaning them the downpayment they didn't \nhave, by not validating their credit, their employment or anything \nelse.\n  So when this thing did collapse, when everything went down and went \ndown fast, it was, in large measure, because Freddie and Fannie created \nthe marketplace that started the buying of these securities around the \nworld, these mortgage securities, No. 1. Equal with that is Moody's and \nStandard's rating them as investment grade when they obviously were \nnot.\n  I would think that as we move toward a debate on this bill, when that \ntime comes, and it will come, that it will be a bill that includes \nFreddie and Fannie and includes Moody's and Standard. I do understand \nthere are some references to Moody's and Standard, but I will submit to \nyou that the best accountability on Moody's and Standard is for them to \nbe paid by the purchasers of the securities, not the creator of them, \nbecause then they are accountable to the people who actually get stuck \nholding the bag, not to the guy who created them and dumped them and \nran, which is some of what Senator Feinstein was talking about.\n  I also wish to talk about the quality of lending. There are \nprovisions in this bill that talk about shared risk and risk retention. \nThere are provisions for a mortgage banker to retain 5 percent of the \nrisk in a loan. That is a well-intended move, but as I said the other \nday on the floor and as I reminded people in this body, when the \nsavings and loans collapsed, when the RTC, the Resolution Trust \nCorporation, was created--and that crisis cost the American people $\\3/\n4\\ trillion--savings and loans in America didn't have 5 percent of the \nrisk, they had 100 percent of the risk. They made those loans with \ndeposits they had of their depositors and they were paid back over \ntime. But when we took away their preference for deposits on $10,000 or \nless against the banking industry, and when--because they began losing \nmoney--we allowed them to form service corporations and get into \nbusinesses they didn't know anything about, they finally collapsed and \nimploded with 100 percent risk, not just 5 percent.\n  So I would submit another thing that needs to be incorporated in this \nis for us to put in some underwriting standards--minimum standards--so \nanything that doesn't meet them has to be an insured mortgage by an \nMGIC or a PMI. We should go back to the good old days of the 1960s, \n1970s, and 1980s, where you had to have a job and a verification to \nborrow money, where you had to get a credit report, where you didn't \nhave a windshield appraisal, where an appraiser drove by on the street, \nbut a legitimate appraisal, where they valued a property, and where you \ncouldn't borrow money that would cause you to spend more than 25 or 30 \npercent on your monthly payment as a percentage of your gross income or \na total of 38 percent on all debts you had, including that payment, for \nat least a year or more in duration.\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\n  The real estate industry, the housing industry in America, with those \nvery standards--which were the standards of the 1960s, 1970s, and part \nof the 1980s--ended up having a vibrant housing market, with 65 percent \nhome ownership--the largest of any country in the world. But when Wall \nStreet got greedy, when our idea of forcing Freddie and Fannie to be \npurchasers of resort, when all those things were created, the rush came \nto make the mortgage, to sell the paper, to produce the income that the \ninvestor wanted, and the quality of the house, the qualification of the \nbuyer, and the legitimacy of the loan came in question.\n  So I look forward to the point in time when we get to this debate \nthat we will talk about three things: No. 1 is that Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae were, in fact, government-sponsored institutions and today \nare a lot more government sponsored than they ever were. No. 2, if we \nexempt them, we leave the potential and the temptation for them to be \nused as a dictated purchaser of certain kinds of paper that will get us \nright back into the same situation. If Moody's and Standard do not have \nan accountability to their rating standards, when something such as the \nsubprime loans happen, we will be leaving open the opportunity for most \nof what happened that was the principal cause of the collapse to happen \nagain. I think we have a responsibility not to do that.\n  I hope to become a part of a debate on that part of this legislation \nthat closes the loophole, that takes away this idea that if you just \nhave a 5-percent shared risk, it is a safe loan, and instead make sure \nthe underwriting to the borrower is what we count on because, after \nall, that is going to be how the money is paid back. We know for a fact \nthat Freddie and Fannie were a major part of the problem, and we know \nthat lack of quality underwriting was a major contributor to the \nquality of the security. Somewhere it ought to be addressed. But in \nthese 1,407 pages, to the best of my reading and looking, it is not. \nThat is unfortunate and it is a mistake. I hope, when we get to the \nfinal debate, we will correct that error or else we will not have \naddressed a major contributor to the problem for our taxpayers and our \nvoters and our citizens.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, while the Senator from Georgia is still \non the Senate floor, I want to say it is great to have him back. He has \nbeen back for a couple of weeks, but he had some pretty serious health \nchallenges and it is good to see him back on his feet and in full \nvoice.\n  He mentioned in his remarks for the first time about 3 days ago the \nhome buyers tax credit, which actually expanded a little bit the second \ntime through, is coming to a halt, and we are seeing this enormous \nvolume in terms of sales of homes in this country in no small part \nbecause of his leadership on this issue over the last year or two. I \nwas pleased as a former member of the Banking Committee to be involved \nin that and encourage my colleagues to support what was a very good \nidea.\n  The other thing I want to say while he is still on the floor is, he \nand I don't agree on everything, but we agree on a lot of stuff. I \nwould like to invoke the 80-20 rule, which Senator Mike Enzi from \nWyoming talks about. I used to say to him: Why do you and Ted Kennedy--\nwhen he, Senator Kennedy, was with us; they were senior Democratic and \nRepublican on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee--I \nwould say to Mike Enzi, he is one of the most conservative Members of \nthe Senate, and Ted Kennedy, arguably one of the most liberal Members \nof the Senate: How come you and he can get so much done in a very \nproductive committee, regardless of whether Ted Kennedy was the \nchairman or Mike Enzi was the chairman?\n  Mike Enzi used to say: Ted and I believe in the 80-20 rule; 80 \npercent of the stuff we agree on, 20 percent of the stuff we don't \nagree on. What we decided to do is focus on the 80 percent on which we \nagree, set aside the 20 percent we don't agree on, and we will come \nback and worry about that another day.\n  I think, hopefully, at the end of the day we will decide to do that. \nThere is a whole lot more on which we agree than we don't agree. My \nhope is we will have an opportunity to bring this bill to the floor and \ndo what we used to do in the Senate; that is, we have people actually \noffer their amendments, we have a chance to debate those amendments, \nand we vote them up or we vote them down; that one side wouldn't line \nup all together to vote against those amendments, and the other side \nline up to vote for them.\n  I think with a lot of amendments Republicans and Democrats have \nactually gone across party lines, and it will depend a lot more in some \ncases on geography, in some cases on the business climate in a \nparticular State or the nature of their businesses.\n  We will have a couple of days voting not for cloture, not to bring \nthe bill to the floor; I would say to my colleagues I will be voting \nwith them, working with them on some of their amendments, and my hope \nis they will do the same on some of mine. But I hope we can get past \nthis sticking point and actually do what we are sent here to do; that \nis, to legislate, to govern, and I know that is what is in their hearts \nas well. I wanted to share that.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. If the Senator will yield, I thank the Senator for his \ngood wishes. I always enjoy working with the distinguished former \nGovernor, now Senator from Delaware, and I look forward to that moment \nwhere we are finding that 80 percent common ground.\n  Mr. CARPER. It is out there. I thank my colleague. I want to take a \nminute or two to have us step back and think about how we got into this \nmess with the housing bubble and all that literally led us almost to \nthe brink of disaster in this country.\n  Part of what happened is market forces were not allowed to work. \nRegulation was not enforced. The regulators were in many cases, too \nmany cases, asleep at the switch. But I will talk a little bit about \nthe housing markets.\n  I am a guy, as a Governor and as a Senator, I always pushed real \nhard--and as a Congressman before that--pushed real hard for home \nownership. I love the idea that people own their own home, own a piece \nof the rock. For a lot of people the biggest part of their life savings \nis the home they own. They use that not just as shelter but to help \nsend kids to school and borrow against for all kinds of things and at \nthe end of their lives to live off of, in some cases, the equity in \ntheir homes. That is a good thing.\n  That is not to say everybody ought to be a homeowner. In some cases \nthere are some folks who ought not to be.\n  As the housing market heated up and the housing prices were going up, \nfolks assumed they would go up forever. They didn't. Few things go up \nforever, and that includes housing prices.\n  We had a number of folks looking around at other people who wanted to \nbecome home owners. People who did not have the ability to become a \nhomeowner, didn't have the financial wherewithal to become a homeowner, \nwere sucked in or duped into buying homes. They took on exotic \nmortgages in the hopes they would somehow be able to pay for those and \nthe value of the homes would keep going up over time and people would \ncome out whole. It didn't work out that way.\n  I think part of what went wrong, aside from the assumption that \nhousing prices would go up, is the fact that regulators were asleep at \nthe switch. The other thing that went wrong is kind of a basic concept \nthat to make markets work, for there to be some market discipline, \nthere has to be skin in the game.\n  Others have talked about this even today on the Senate floor. We had, \nin some cases, mortgage brokers who would say to people who did not \nhave the ability to be homeowners: Don't bother telling us what your \nincome is or showing us what your income is. You tell us you are OK and \nyour income is good, we will take your word for that.\n  In too many cases that happened, and the regulators allowed that to \nhappen. We had mortgage brokers originate a mortgage and pass the \ncustomer on to a bank or mortgage banker. They would write the \nmortgage, allow the mortgage to be done, and the person ended up with a \nhome. They ended up with a mortgage. The mortgage was passed on, maybe \nbought by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and they bundled\n\n[[Page S2702]]\n\nthem together, a bunch of mortgages together, and created an investment \ninstrument through securitization. Those securities were then kind of \nblessed by the credit agencies.\n  The credit agencies, the mortgage brokers, made their fee, and they \nwere out of it. The bankers made their fee, and they were out of it. \nFannie and Freddie got some kind of fee, as I recall, for securitizing \nthe loans, and they were kind of out of it. The credit agencies made \ntheir fee and they were out of it. We ended up with folks owning these \nsecurities, in some cases, all around the world.\n  We sliced and diced these securities and they were acquired by \ndifferent investors. Too many of the players in this business didn't \nhave any skin in the game. At the end of the game, when folks started \ndefaulting on the mortgages, not making the payments, those investments \nin mortgage-backed securities which were out there owned by different \nbunches of investors turned into what I call Swiss cheese. They had a \nlot of holes in them, holes created when folks stopped meeting their \nmortgage payments and eventually, instead of turning into Swiss cheese, \nthey in many cases became illiquid, unmarketable, and they gathered, in \nsome cases, on the books, the balance sheets of financial institutions.\n  Despite all these tricks we tried to create and gimmicks we tried to \ncreate or financial tools we tried to create to deal with the risk, \nthey didn't all work. In the end it came tumbling down.\n  Among things we want to do, we want to make sure in the legislation \nwe are working on regulators actually regulate. Second, one of the \nthings we want to make sure of is we actually, when we are asking \nsomebody what their income is, we want to verify it so some people \ndon't end up taking on risks they obviously can't meet. We want to make \nsure people have skin in the game, the banks, the financial \ninstitutions have skin in the game; that the shareholders of those \ninstitutions are at risk; otherwise, what reason should they have--why \nshould there be any discipline? There will not be in too many cases.\n  There are some people who think we ought to mandate capital standards \nand risky activities, raise the capital standards, and we should do \nthat by mandates or legislative fiat. I don't know if that is a smart \nthing to do because we are working in this international marketplace, \nand our financial institutions, if they have certain capital standards \nthat are dramatically different from the capital standards or \nrequirements for liquidity different from other countries, that sort of \nputs our institutions at a disadvantage, a competitive disadvantage. We \nhave to make sure our regulators are coordinating with other regulators \naround the world and we actually do have standards so financial \ninstitutions, when they are involved in risky behavior, the capital \nrequirements are higher and the liquidity requirements are higher.\n  The last point I want to make, today somebody gave me some--I don't \nknow if you call them talking points, if you will, what our vision is \nas Democrats, the idea we are on the side, not so much of the financial \ninstitutions, certainly not necessarily on the side of Wall Street, but \nwe are on the side of regular people, many of whom have been damaged by \nall this.\n  Among the points I would want to leave us with in terms of the things \nwe are for is, we want to have in place strict new regulations to stop \nWall Street from gambling with money, our money, in the end. We are not \ninterested in more taxpayer bailouts. The idea of creating this $50 \nbillion fund that will be paid for by financial institutions \nthemselves, to contribute to that so later on when these big \ninstitutions get into trouble, we actually have the money literally \nthere, available to use to shut them down and retire them in an orderly \nway that doesn't disrupt the financial system, that is one of the \nthings we are for.\n  We are going to try to end too big to fail. We want to put a new cop \non the beat in terms of consumer protection for consumers, at least \nworking with the largest 100 or so institutions that have over $50 \nbillion in assets among the bankholding companies, and we--I think this \nis important, too, a reminder in the course of this debate--we want to \nput consumers in control with information in plain English.\n  As I listen to this debate and a lot of folks coming to visit with us \nand talk about the issues before us, we can probably use more plain \nEnglish on the Senate floor than not. Sometimes I hear my colleagues, \ncertainly our staffs and folks who visit with us, talking about stuff \nthat reminds me of the old saying--remember Albert Einstein's Theory of \nRelativity? Somebody once asked Mrs. Einstein: Mrs. Einstein, do you \nunderstand your husband's Theory of Relativity?\n  She said: I understand the words but not the sentences. That is what \nshe said: I understand the words but not the sentences.\n  I hear some of the debate on some of what is presented to us. I \nunderstand the words, but some of the sentences I understand but not \nall of them. I want to make sure at the end of the day when we are \nfinished and we bring the bill to the floor and offer amendments, we \nactually understand the sentences and not just the words of the \namendments and actually write defined legislation, go through \nconference with the House, and actually do understand not just the \nwords but the sentences, the paragraphs, the pages, and the whole kit \nand caboodle so at end of the day we will have taken some big steps to \ngreatly reduce the likelihood we are ever going to have to go through \nthis again--certainly not in our lifetimes and certainly not again \never.\n  I know the things I mentioned that serve our Democratic vision--I \nhope the Republicans would share that. I think in many cases--maybe on \nan 80-20 basis--they probably do. If we ever get a chance to get a bill \nto the floor, we will find out. In the end, I think we will find out \nthere is a lot on which we agree; that we will find common ground, we \nwill address this issue and move on to other important issues and \nchallenges that face our Nation.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, again today, for the second day in a row, \nwe have failed to break the Republican filibuster on the Wall Street \nreform bill. The votes are very clear. With one or two Democrats out--\none who is opposed to breaking the filibuster and the other absent--\nthere was not a single Republican vote in support of moving to the \ndebate on the Wall Street reform bill.\n  Tomorrow, there will be another opportunity, and it appears the other \nside, the Republican side, of the aisle is deciding they do not want to \ndebate this issue. The Senate as an institution is designed to give \npeople a chance to express themselves, both by votes and amendments \nthey might offer. That is what we have offered.\n  It is interesting to me, this bill which is before us, the Restoring \nAmerican Financial Stability Act--I am just checking on how many pages \nit is; we count pages around here now--is 1,400 pages. OK. And I am not \nbeing critical of the size of this bill. It is a big challenge to make \nsure we pass the laws that are necessary to promote financial \nstability.\n  But it was not but a few months ago that the Republicans were arguing \nthat the health care reform bill was so big that we had to have it \nright out here in front of us and we should not be negotiating behind \nclosed doors with secret negotiations on the bill; it ought to be right \nhere on the Senate floor; let's have the amendments. Now comes this \nbill on Wall Street reform, and the Republican position is exactly the \nopposite. They say: We do not want to have an amendment process on the \nfloor; we want you to agree ahead of time behind closed doors on what \nthe bill is going to say. I do not know if they have noted the \ninconsistency of their position, but it is fairly clear.\n  I think they probably have some good ideas to change this bill. I am \nanxious to see their amendments. I think we have some good ideas to \nimprove the bill. I would like to offer a few amendments. It is almost \nsounding\n\n[[Page S2703]]\n\nlike the U.S. Senate, isn't it--amendments on a bill and votes and \nspeeches and debate. It really sounds like the good old days here. But \nwe do not have the good old days anymore. We just lurch from one vote \nto an empty floor to the next vote to an empty floor to the next vote. \nPeople who are following this debate on the outside have to be \nwondering what we are trying to achieve.\n  Unfortunately, for some, what they are trying to achieve is \nabsolutely nothing. They want to stop the Senate from acting. They \nbelieve it is in their best political interest--maybe in the best \ninterest of the country, from their point of view--that we do nothing.\n  How could you take that position when it comes to Wall Street after \nwhat we have been through as a nation? How could you take the position \nthat we should do nothing when it comes to the Wall Street banks and \nfinancial institutions? These banks and financial institutions got away \nwith murder when it came to corrupting our economy and leading us into \nthe most painful recession in modern memory. How could you take the \nposition, as some Republicans have, that we should not debate or vote \non a bill to try to avoid that catastrophe from recurring? That, to me, \nis so basic and fundamental.\n  It strikes me that the American people have it right. They understand \nwhat we have been through. They understand that after the great minds \nof Wall Street made the greatest mistakes in modern economic history, \nthey came whining and crying to the Federal Treasury to bail them out. \nThey asked for hundreds of billions of dollars from hard-working \nfamilies across America to get through their individual economic crises \nat their banks and their financial institutions. I will concede that I \nvoted for that idea because the alternative was a disaster in our \neconomy.\n  Well, after sending the money to Wall Street, they showed their \ngratitude by giving one another bonuses, multimillion-dollar bonuses, \nfor their bone-headed stupidity that led us into this mess and then \ndeciding that once they were solvent again and moving forward, they \nwould stop loaning money to businesses across America that are trying \nto survive and get out of this recession. It is the ultimate in \nirresponsibility, and it is what we have come to expect from some of \nthe people on Wall Street.\n  I mentioned earlier that many of us have been reading this book, \n``The Big Short'' by Michael Lewis. He tells the story of how we got \ninto this mess, how these people dreamed up ways to create these \nfinancial instruments, which almost defy description, where they would \ntake thousands of mortgages from all around the United States and \npackage them into a little bundle and put some code name on them that \nonly the insiders could understand and then decide to sell them in \npieces--tranches, they called them. And they were betting that the \nvalue of real estate would continue to go up and the default rate would \nnot. They guessed wrong on both accounts. The default rate on these \nrotten mortgages increased and the underlying value of the homes and \nbusinesses and other entities began to decline and the bottom fell out. \nLewis tells the story about those who saw it coming and ended up making \na lot of money because they shorted the market, as they say. They \nguessed that the real estate bubble was going to burst. How many more \ntimes do we need to go through that as a nation before we change the \nrules on Wall Street in terms of their conduct and what they can do?\n  We think it is time. This bill is a product of the Senate Banking \nCommittee and a lot of hard work. Senator Dodd, the Democratic chairman \nof the committee, met for several months with the Republican Senator \nwho ranks No. 1 on that committee, Richard Shelby of Alabama, and they \ncould not reach an agreement. Senator Dodd then said, I will meet with \nSenator Corker of Tennessee, also on the committee, and sadly that \ndidn't result in an agreement either. Then Senator Dodd said, Let's \nhave a hearing and let's put this bill right on the table and let \npeople offer amendments to it. The Republicans prepared over 400 \namendments to this bill, and when Senator Dodd convened the committee, \nthey refused to call up a single one of them--not one of them--to be \nput on this bill or voted on.\n\n  So the bill comes to the floor in that situation and the Republicans \nrefuse to let us move forward. That is because under the Senate rules \nwe need 60 votes. We only have 59 on a good day here, and we clearly \nneed Republican help to move this bill forward. They have decided as a \nparty caucus to stand by Wall Street and to stand against reform. I \ndon't understand it. I can't imagine that they are hearing anything \nthat is different than what I hear when I go home. When I go home, \nbasically people tell me that they believe it is time for \naccountability from the banks and the speculators on Wall Street and \nthey believe we ought to do it now. They want to see us put a cop on \nthe beat. They want to see the government keeping an eye on these big \nfinancial institutions, establishing standards of conduct, establishing \nmargin requirements so we know they are not overextended again as they \nwere leading into this recession, and they want to make sure we are \ndoing something that is going to avoid a replay of what we have just \nbeen through.\n  There is another aspect of this bill. When I spoke to one of the \nRepublicans during the vote today, I said to him: What is the problem \nhere? Why aren't you joining us in this Wall Street reform? Don't you \nhear the same things at home that we do?\n  He said: My big concern is the consumer financial protection agency \nin here.\n  Well, I am the wrong person to raise that issue with, because I \nhappen to believe in it. We have created safety standards for the \ninspection of certain products across America. When you buy toys for \nyour kids during the holidays, you want to make sure they don't have \nlead paint on them or tiny pieces the kids might ingest and choke on. \nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission is supposed to watch out for \nthose sorts of things, and they do. But when it comes to our financial \ninstruments that we have as part of our daily lives, there is no real \nwatchdog. I am talking about mortgages on our homes and credit card \nagreements, student loans, automobile loans, retirement plans, things \nthat make a big difference in our lives and that can go bad and cost us \ndearly. This bill sets up within the Federal Reserve an agency for \nconsumer financial protection. It will be the strongest consumer \nfinancial protection law in the history of the United States, and it \nisn't a massive bureaucracy. What it basically does is empower \nconsumers across the country so that when they sit down to sign an \nagreement, the basics are explained to them. It also puts that watchdog \nin place to keep an eye on those banks when they start sneaking in new \nterminology, these tricks and traps that can explode on you at a later \ndate. That is the part this one Republican Senator said has to go. We \ndon't want this consumer financial protection.\n  Well, the Senator may not want it; the banks don't want it either. \nThey don't want someone looking over their shoulder, but I think the \nAmerican people not only want it, they deserve it after what we have \nbeen through.\n  I was standing in the airport in Chicago on Monday on my way out here \nand a fellow came up to me, a businessman in Chicago, and said: Oh, \nwhat a coincidence. I am on my way out to see you.\n  I said: Good.\n  He said: I am here so that we can exempt our business from the \nConsumer Financial Protection Agency.\n  I said: Save the money on the airfare, because I am not voting that \nway. I don't think we ought to start carving out all of the different \nspecial interests and business groups that want to come here and say we \nare the good guys, we are not the cause of the problem. The fact is if \nthey are, in fact, good guys and good gals, if they are honest in their \ndealings, if they are treating customers honestly, if they are \nconscientious and ethical, what are they worried about? This is an \nagency we have created to go after the bottom feeders, the predators \nwho are out there taking advantage of consumers in the name of consumer \ncredit.\n  This has happened so many times in the time I have served in \nCongress, where you come in and say, We want to protect consumers from \nthe worst in the financial industry, and the big banks come in and say, \nOh, no, it is just a foot in the door. Pretty soon\n\n[[Page S2704]]\n\nthey will be looking at us too, and they stop any kind of basic \nsurveillance.\n  Right now in Illinois--in fact, a couple of blocks from where I live \nin Springfield, IL--are a couple of operations that take this to the \nextreme--Payday Loans, Title Loans, Same Day Loans. It is an outrage. \nIt is an outrage that my State lets them get away with it. They have \ntried to tighten up the law a couple of times, but these folks are \nslippery. They find a way around it. They charge outrageous interest \nrates. They are rolling over these debts time and time again until \nthese people are absolutely out of luck. They have nowhere to turn.\n  I introduced a bill, a cap on interest rates, a usury bill, and I \nsaid if you want to meet every creepy, crawly, slimy reptile in the \nfinancial industry, introduce a usury bill, and they will all slide \nunder your door to come in and meet with you and tell you how you just \ndon't understand. Yes, they will say to me, it is 108 percent a year \nannual interest, but it is not what you think it is. It is what I \nbelieve it is, and it is a rip-off of consumers that has to come to an \nend. I am joining with Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina to put an \nend to some of these business operations. I don't think they do any \ngood for America.\n  It has been about 10 years ago now that Senator Jim Talent, a \nRepublican from Missouri, put an amendment on a bill that didn't \nattract much attention. The amendment he put on exempted military \nfamilies from being business clients of these payday loan operations. \nWhy would he exempt military families? Because the Pentagon had \nreported to him that in many military installations around the United \nStates, soldiers--Air Force, others--were borrowing money from these \nfly-by-night operations, couldn't pay it back, and got so deeply in \ndebt they had to be discharged from the service. Men and women trained \nin our military, because of the debt they had incurred as a result of \nthese rotten operations, fly-by-night operations, had to leave the \nmilitary service, and the Pentagon was saying to this Senator and \nothers, We invested a lot of money training that person and now they \nare gone.\n  So we said 10 years ago that we were going to provide that these \npayday loan operations could not lend money to military families, and \nit passed and became the law. Well, if we are protecting military \nfamilies and our national interests, why aren't we protecting all \nfamilies? That is my point of view. I think Senator Kay Hagan of North \nCarolina shares that point of view and I want to make sure we move \nforward on that. I also want to make sure interest rates are regulated. \nThere is a limit to how much should be charged. There are people who \nexceed that limit and take advantage of those. Those are the kinds of \nthings that are at issue here.\n  So this week, if you tried to follow what is going on in the Senate, \nsometimes there has been a big yawn, because the floor is empty. No one \nis here, because we are lurching to the next filibuster vote. We are \ngoing to ask the Republicans again tomorrow: Now is it possible for us \nto bring up this bill, a bill that will put consumers in control when \nit comes to some of the most basic decisions they have to make? Now is \nit time to have strict new regulations to stop Wall Street gambling \nfrom happening again in our financial sector? Now is it time to make \nsure that the agreements we enter into are in plain, understandable \nEnglish?\n  Now is the time to end taxpayer bailouts once and for all. Banks and \nfinancial institutions, not American taxpayers, should foot the bill \nfor their own mistakes. If the Republicans object to that, offer an \namendment. Stand up here and say, I think we ought to be ready to bail \nthem out.\n  I don't think they will. Also, it is time for consumers to have the \ninformation they need to compare rates so they can make the financial \nchoices that are right for them and their families.\n  American voters get it overwhelmingly. They want us to pass this \nbill. But the Wall Street lobbyists get it too. This morning an analyst \ncame forward and said the Wall Street firms are spending $120,000 every \nday on Capitol Hill for lobbyists. They are working the phones. They \nare working the corridors. They are doing everything they can to kill \nthis bill. These special interest groups have a lot at stake here. If \nwe do, in fact, come through with this reform, the party is going to be \nover at some of these banks and they know it, so they are fighting it \ntooth and nail. If we have a consumer financial protection agency, they \nare going to change the way they do business. They won't make as much \nmoney. They are going to be held to honest standards and they don't \nlike it. So they are spending a fortune begging the Republicans to \ncontinue this filibuster to stop the Wall Street reform. I hope a few \nRepublicans will break ranks and join us. If they do, I think many \nothers will follow, but it will take a few courageous, forward-looking \npeople to step up and say, That is enough. Two filibusters in a week is \nenough.\n  By Wednesday--by tomorrow--if we can get three or four Republicans to \nstep up, we can start an honest, bipartisan debate that leads to the \nkinds of reforms we need to make our economy stronger, create more \njobs, and protect American taxpayers from ever being soaked again for \nanother bailout.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here because for the second day \nin a row the Republican minority has once again sided with the Wall \nStreet bankers and taken their side in the battle the American people \nwant us to have to clean up Wall Street and see to it that the kind of \neconomic damage that reckless gambling by Wall Street created across \nour whole economy never happens again.\n  We want to bring sensible, firm oversight to these Wall Street banks, \nand we want to create an independent consumer financial protection \nagency so that there is an institution out there that is looking out \nfor the little guy, the person who can't hire a lobbyist or a lawyer \nand who has to take it or leave it when the bank comes calling.\n  The history of what brought us here is instructive. It says a lot \nabout the motivation of what is going on on the Republican side.\n  We began with the most colossal bank failure and economic meltdown \nsince the Great Depression. This body had to appropriate hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to prop up the financial sector and save it from \ncomplete and utter collapse from a global financial meltdown. That is \nhow dangerous the way Wall Street was playing was. It took us right to \nthe brink of global financial meltdown and required unprecedented--and \nunpopular--actions by Congress to keep that from happening.\n  You would think the lesson everybody would take from that experience \nis that Wall Street needs to change, that there needs to be regulatory \nreform. This cannot be allowed to happen to American families again \nbecause wild speculators on Wall Street are playing unregulated games \nwith other people's money. But from then until now, we have seen no \nRepublican bill. Chairman Dodd laid down his first bill on November 19, \n2009, and the Republicans didn't answer with an alternative of their \nown. There was no basis from which to negotiate back and forth. They \njust criticized his bill, and that was that.\n  Negotiations continued--persistent negotiations--to try to get some \nRepublicans to support Wall Street regulatory reform, and they led \nnowhere. Were Senators negotiating in good faith but being reeled in at \nthe end by the leadership? Was it just a way to waste time with false \nnegotiations to keep us from getting to this business? I don't know; I \nam not a mind reader. But what I do know is that there was no \nRepublican alternative.\n  Eventually, Chairman Dodd said: OK, we are going to hearing. We have \nour bill. Bring your amendments. Let's have a public debate in the \nBanking Committee about how we regulate Wall Street.\n  On March 23, Chairman Dodd convened that markup. I know our committee \nmembers came expecting a long haul. They were expecting late nights\n\n[[Page S2705]]\n\nand many days. They were expecting the kind of effort we saw when we \ndid the health care reform bill, and I had the pleasure to serve on the \nHELP Committee with Chairman Dodd. Day after day, week after week, \nhundreds of hours of hearings we went through amendment after amendment \nafter amendment. We accepted 160, I think, Republican amendments in \nthat process. We still didn't get their support, but at least there was \na public discussion.\n\n  But when the Banking Committee took up this bill, with that same \nexpectation that there would be long, arduous hours of hearings, \nargument, public debate, and amendment, what did they get? The ranking \nmember said: We have no amendments. We don't care to discuss this. Call \nup the vote on the bill. We don't want to do anything in the public \nlight of day. Vote the bill out.\n  So the chairman had no choice but to do that. He had no choice but to \nvote the bill out with no amendments. So here we are. We have gone from \nthe worst financial disaster the country has seen since the Great \nDepression until this point, and the Republicans have no bill, no \nreform to offer. When it comes to their first opportunity, when their \nhand is forced in the committee to bring in amendments, they have no \namendments, nothing to say.\n  Now we try to move to the bill, and here we are--stuck.\n  We are not here voting on the bill, we are here trying to get their \nclearance to bring up this bill to discuss it and go through the Senate \nprocess of debate and amendment and they are objecting to that.\n  So what is the common theme of a party that has no bill, that offers \nno amendments, and that wants no floor debate? The common theme of \nthose things is wanting to cut deals in the dark, wanting to have their \ndeals not see the light of day until they are already buried in a bill. \nSome of them would probably even turn around and object to some of the \nthings they argued to get in.\n  We should be prepared to do the public's business in the light of \nday. In fact, after the most public process we have ever seen on health \ncare, we took criticism from the other side for a couple occasional \nmoments when people got together and cut a deal. But those were the \nexceptions in a hugely public process, ranging across several \ncommittees that took weeks and months, in which everybody knew where we \nwere going, what we were doing, and what our priorities were to help \nthe American people. This is the exact opposite. They do not want to do \nanything in the light of day. They do not have a bill where they are \nprepared to show the American people what their ideas are. When you say \nto them: OK. Our idea is, how would you change those, they have nothing \nto say. They do not want to debate, discuss or amend.\n  When we call them to the floor to say: OK. Here we go, let's have \nthis discussion for the American people, they say: Nope, we don't want \nto have a discussion, not until we have cut our deals, not until we \nhave gone into backrooms and cut our deals, not until we have delivered \nfor Wall Street in backroom deals we wouldn't bring to this floor \nbecause we know what they would look like in the bright light of day.\n  That is where we are. Frankly, it is unfortunate and it is a shame \nfor the American people because every day we continue with this is \nanother victory for the Wall Street mischief. Every day we are delayed \nis another day that the champagne corks are flying out the window of \nthe investment banks on Wall Street as they celebrate the fact that \nmore highly leveraged gambles can go through because we haven't \nregulated them, more mortgage brokers can go out and sell junk \nmortgages to folks and take advantage of them with conditions that are \nburied deep in the fine print that they do not see. More people can get \nstuck in credit card tricks and traps that are unregulated by an \nindependent consumer financial protection agency to stand up for them. \nOf course, the CEOs continue to get huge bonuses without the kind of \ngovernance this bill would put over executive compensation.\n  Why do they do it? Well, the relationship between the other party and \nWall Street is pretty well known. It has been publicly reported that \nleaders of the other party went running up to Wall Street not too long \nago to have their favorite closed-door, private meetings in the \nshadows, no publicity, no press. They would not discuss what took place \nin those meetings, but you know they went up there to offer their \nservices to Wall Street to help defeat this legislation. They just \ndon't want to talk about it.\n  So that has been pretty well established, and it runs afoul of the \ndesires of the American people. Two-thirds of Americans want us to take \naction. As those of us who have spent time in public life know, usually \npeople care about issues that relate to them very immediately. They \ncare about pocketbook issues. They care about their family, the roof \nover their head, their paycheck. For a lot of folks in America, Wall \nStreet is a long way off, and it is almost a kind of hypothetical \nconcern for a lot of Americans. But they have it, just as strongly as \nthey care about the economy right now. Because they know Wall Street \nhas been taking advantage of America for too long; that the risks of it \nfor ordinary families, when it gets out of control, are too great; and \nthat Wall Street needs to be reined in. They know that, and that is why \nthey want us to act.\n  That is why it is a shame that the minority party is refusing to \nallow us to even go to the bill and have a public debate in the light \nof this Chamber, in the light of day, about our ideas. We have told the \nAmerican people what our ideas are. They are in the bill. Here are our \nideas: Our ideas are a strong Consumer Financial Products Safety \nCommission--an independent consumer financial products protection \nagency to look out after the little guy.\n  How often have you looked at a credit card application and seen how \nmany pages of small print are in it? Look at a mortgage. Look at any \nkind of commercial credit. In all that small print, the lawyers and the \nlobbyists have done their work. Too often, it is the person who signs \non the bottom line who ends up discovering they signed up for a raw \ndeal. Nobody is looking out for them. Nobody is putting at the top of \nthe contract: Green light. This is fair. We have taken a look at it. \nSafe, good to go, Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval--or yellow light: \nCareful. You might want to truly know what you are doing before you \nsign up for this--or red light: Bad deal. Dangerous for consumers. Look \nout.\n  Simple, helpful information for American consumers to get, an \nindependent commission to help advise consumers in those ways and have \nsome regulatory authority over the people who put those products \ntogether, that is what we want in this bill. It is not fancy. It is not \ntricky. It is just a way to unwind the ``gotcha'' contracts that too \nmany Americans have had to put up with for too long because Wall Street \nand the bankers have been writing those contracts and there hasn't been \ndiscipline over them.\n  So that is one of the ideas we are out there with. If they have a \nbetter idea, where is it? I don't want to deal that away in the dark. \nCome to the floor and tell us in the bright light of day what better \nidea you have than a consumer financial protection agency that is \nindependent and out there to help the ordinary folks.\n  We would also consolidate bank regulators so that a big Wall Street \nbank can't shop around and decide which regulator it wants to have \nregulated. You don't get to choose your ref when you go to play a game, \nand you shouldn't get to choose your regulator when you go out into the \nfield of commerce. It allows game playing and it is not right.\n  We should strengthen regulation over all financial firms and no more \nallowing them to change their charter to avoid rules they do not like. \nThat is not complicated. That is simple. It is clear. It is our \nposition in the bright light of day. If they have a better one, where \nis it? I am not going to deal that one away in the dark. It wouldn't be \nright.\n  There are provisions that would crack down on CEO compensation, to \nmake sure shareholders have a real say in executive pay and to make \nsure, in particular, that the compensation committees of the board that \nsets executive pay aren't just the pals and the golfing buddies of the \npeople whose multimillion-dollar pay and bonuses\n\n[[Page S2706]]\n\nthey are approving; to make sure it is independent directors who are on \nthe compensation committee and making those decisions. That is our \nposition. It is clear. It is out there in the bright light of day. It \nmakes sense. If they have a better idea, bring it. We are happy to \nlisten to it.\n  But this room is empty of Republicans right now. There are no ideas, \nthere are no alternatives. All they want to do is deal this stuff away \nin the dark and it is wrong. They will, however, attack it. They will \nsay that a provision in this bill that provides for the banking \nindustry to fund an orderly failure and wipeout of an existing bank so \nthe government doesn't have to come in and bail it out, because there \nis no provision for an orderly failure, is actually taxpayer-funded \nbailout legislation. I mean, they couldn't be more wrong. The argument \ndoesn't even make sense.\n  For starters, there is no bailout. The bank isn't bailed out. It is \nput out of its misery, but it is put out of its misery and sold off in \nan organized way. So as far as a taxpayer-funded bailout, there is no \nbailout. As far as it being taxpayer funded, it is industry funded. \nThere is no taxpayer money in the deal at all. We make the industry pay \nto basically have a funeral plan for their colleague banks that fail so \nthe taxpayer doesn't have to be there.\n  They turn that completely inside out, and they do so why? Not because \nit is true--we know that--but because they have a pollster who has \ntaken a poll and who has discovered that, guess what, the American \npublic doesn't like bailouts and doesn't like bailout bills. So, aha, \nthe geniuses discover they are going to call this a bailout bill \nbecause that makes it seem unpopular. It doesn't matter that it is not \ntrue. A little confusion never hurts when you don't have a position of \nyour own that you are willing to bring out in the light of day. But \nthat is what they have to say about that provision.\n  That is actually a provision that I think makes a lot of sense. There \nhas to be a way to have an orderly failure of a bank that goes \ninsolvent so the taxpayer doesn't have to come in and prop it up \nbecause people worry, if one goes, is there a run on the bank? What \ndoes this mean for the global banking system? You have to have a way \nfor banks to fail, for managers to be fired, for shareholders to lose \ntheir money, for all the consequences for failure in a real market \nsystem to happen but in an orderly way. That is what the bill does.\n  So you can go through this bill idea by idea, and I am willing to \nstand by the Democratic ideas. I actually have some amendments, if we \ncould get to this bill, that I would like to see called up because I \nthink we could improve it. I would love to see us reverse a decision \ncalled the Marquette decision--a decision by the Supreme Court that \nsaid the rules for a bank are determined by the State where the bank \nhas its headquarters--where it is domiciled, and if there is a conflict \nbetween a State law that protects the consumer and the State law for \nwhere the bank is, it is the home of the bank that wins.\n  Well, now, how did that all work out? What happened is the banks \nfigured out the States that have the worst consumer protection laws in \nthe country and they moved there. Not for nothing does your credit card \nusually come from one of just two or three States.\n  The result of that is that the power of the States of the United \nStates of America, the sovereign power of the States of the United \nStates of America they have had since before the Revolution to protect \nconsumers from exorbitant interest rates, from rates that were called \nusury because they were too high, illegally high, was taken away from \nthem. Nobody in Congress made that decision. It slipped through in the \nback of the Supreme Court decision all those years ago and the industry \nsaw their opportunity and they adapted. If you want to know why you are \npaying a 30-percent interest rate on your credit card when your home \nState has an interest rate cap of 18 percent, it is because of that \ndecision.\n  I am for putting that choice back in the hands of the States to \nprotect their own consumers from these global, international, \nmultinational banks. Global, international, multinational banks, huge \nWall Street banks could not give a hoot about Rhode Island. But if they \nhave to obey Rhode Island law, that is another question--Rhode Island \nlaw or Colorado law or California law or Vermont law; you name it. The \nStates should be able to protect their consumers the way they always \nhad until this decision--it is part of American history--from \nexorbitant and cruel interest rates. So I would like to see that \namendment.\n  But the bill as it is, is something we can be proud of. It is a shame \nthat here we are with two votes now back to back, with the Republicans \nrefusing to allow us to even enter that debate. I have wracked my brain \nto try to think of a way to explain why they are doing this. There are \nnot any good reasons.\n  One is to prevent progress on anything, anything and everything--the \npolitics of obstruction. If it has President Obama's name on it, if it \nwould reflect well on him no matter how important it is to the American \npeople, forget it. Job No. 1 is to deny any victories, any support to \nObama irrespective of the merits. We have seen plenty of evidence of \nthat and maybe that is the reason.\n  Reason No. 2, they have interests, special interests they want to \nprotect--Wall Street interests, banking interests, people who do not \nwant to see an independent consumer financial protection agency looking \nover consumer contracts and sticking up for the little guy. That could \nbe another reason. That would explain why they do not want to put their \npositions on the record anywhere. That is why they will not write a \nreform bill. That is why they will not put forward a reform amendment \nin the committee. That is why they will not come to the floor and allow \nus to debate this bill.\n  They know their arguments are running against the public interest, \nthe concerns of the American people and the needs of our country, and \nare just to protect Wall Street. They don't want that in public so they \nare willing to have this fight. They are willing to blockade even going \nto this bill, just for the purpose of protecting the darkness in which \nthey want to cut deals to protect Wall Street and the special interests \nbehind them.\n  That has to stop. Like many of my colleagues I am prepared to stay \nhere, to keep banging away at this, to come and vote over and over \nagain, to spend days and nights on this issue until we get the job \ndone. I take some comfort from some of the stories of history, one of \nwhich is the Biblical story of Jericho. When Joshua and the Israelites \nsurrounded Jericho, they didn't go and negotiate and ask them would you \nplease open the door, we will give you what you want. No, they went \naround the city, time after time--seven times they went around the city \nof Jericho, blowing their horns, blowing the ram's horn. On the seventh \nday, on the seventh tour around Jericho, when they blew their horns, \nJoshua said to the Israelites: Let out a great shout. And they let out \ntheir great shout and the ram's horns blared and the walls fell flat.\n  Maybe it will take seven times around this bill before the walls of \nobstruction the Republicans have put up to protect the dark deals they \nwant to do for their special interests fall. Maybe it will take seven \ntimes. Maybe it will take 17 times. Maybe it will take 27 times. But \nwhen you look at the damage that Wall Street caused to this country \nwith its speculative, dangerous practices, with its unregulated, \nuninhibited excesses, this is important.\n  This is one we need to win for the American people. This is one we \nneed to win for the safety of our economy going forward. This is one we \nneed for every family that lost their job because the financial \ncatastrophe washed through the business they worked for. They have \nnever been to Wall Street, they have no interest in the financial \nindustry, but they are as out of work as anybody else because of what \nsplashed and sloshed across this country from what happened on Wall \nStreet.\n  Those are people we cannot forget. Those are people we cannot let \ndown. Rhode Island still has the third highest unemployment in the \ncountry. We are in our 27th month of severe recession. It has been \ncompounded by historic flooding that has 2,000 Rhode Islanders still \nout of their homes. The flooding sure isn't Wall Street's fault but it \ncompounds the harm that Wall Street inflicted on the entire economy, \nand it focused so intensely in my home State of Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\n  As far as I am concerned, we are here, we are here to stay, we are \ngoing to get this done, and we cannot be discouraged by the Republican \nobstruction.\n  I see the majority leader on the floor. Would it be convenient to \nyield to him?\n  Mr. REID. I so appreciate my friend extending his usual courtesy.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID.

JONES\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I wish today to pay tribute to \nthe well-respected tribal leader and proud veteran of the War in the \nPacific with the U.S. Marine Corps, Stanley G. Jones, Sr., ``Scho-\nHallem.''\n  Mr. Jones is retiring after more than 40 years of service to his \npeople, the Tulalip Tribes, of my State of Washington. Mr. Jones served \non the Tulalip Tribes Board of Directors for the past 44 years; longer \nthan any other Tulalip tribe member.\n  Mr. Jones helped guide tribes in the Northwest through their legal \nbattle to regain lost treaty rights, culminating in the Boldt Decision \nof the 1970s. He was instrumental in reviving the traditional First \nSalmon Ceremony in 1976, the practice having been outlawed by the \nFederal Government in the early 1900s. He was the first Chair of the \nNational Indian Gaming Task Force, and helped set tribal policy \nregarding the usage of proceeds from Tulalip tribal ventures.\n  Mr. Jones was a strong advocate for economic development. He led the \nTulalip Tribes' efforts to invest their lands, and worked to create \njobs and opportunities for his tribe's people, and those in neighboring \ncommunities. He also endeavored to provide educational opportunities, \nhealth care, housing and senior services to tribal members.\n  Mr. Jones will be sorely missed but his legacy is in the growing \nrespect for treaty rights and tribal sovereignty that he leaves behind. \nToday his vision is being carried on by a new generation of tribal \nleaders.\n  I take this opportunity to wish him a long and well-deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/27/senate-section/article/S2707-4", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING MARY THURMAIER\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today it is with sadness that I \nremember the life of Mary Thurmaier, who passed away on April 25. I was \nfortunate to know Mary, who did so much for her community and for our \nstate.\n  Mary was a tireless activist and volunteer. Perhaps her most \nsignificant contribution of all was her 24 years of service on the \nStevens Point Area School Board, from 1982 to 2006. Mary, a devoted \nmother of four herself, spent her nearly two and a half decades on the \nboard working to strengthen public education for the children of \nStevens Point. She focused much of her considerable effort on critical \nissues like early childhood education.\n  Mary also served a vital role for her community when she managed the \nPoint Area Bus Cooperative before the city took over the operations. \nShe did a tremendous job in that position and later went on to serve as \ndirector of the Stevens Point Convention and Visitors Bureau. She also \nserved as a Democratic national committeewoman for Wisconsin.\n  Above all, Mary was a beloved wife, mother, and grandmother. My \nthoughts are with her family and friends today, as so many mourn her \nloss. I know all of us are grateful for Mary's life and her many \ncontributions to Stevens Point and the State of Wisconsin, which will \nlive on for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/27/senate-section/article/S2707-5", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:13 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4543.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 3261. A bill to establish the Buffalo Bayou National Heritage Area \nin the State of Texas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \ndesignate the Buffalo Bayou as a National Heritage Area. This \nlegislation will designate the 25-mile stretch of the Houston Ship \nChannel as the first National Heritage Area in Texas. This distinction \nwill allow up to $1 million annually for 10 years to the area and \nprovide the tourism benefits of Federal recognition without restriction \non land or commerce.\n  In 2002, Congressman Gene Green and I introduced the Buffalo Bayou \nNational Heritage Study Act, which directed the U.S. Department of the \nInterior to conduct a study to determine if the Buffalo Bayou was \neligible to receive National Heritage Area distinction. The Department \nof the Interior has concluded that the Buffalo Bayou has met the \ncriteria needed for National Heritage Area distinction, and I support \nthis distinction. I wish to recognize Congressman Green for \nspearheading the efforts to designate the Buffalo Bayou as a National \nHeritage Area.\n  The Buffalo Bayou has played an important role in the development of \nTexas and our nation's commerce. The Buffalo Bayou has helped the City \nof Houston become the fourth largest city in the United States by \nsupporting oil refining, petrochemical production and commercial trade.\n  The history of the Buffalo Bayou begins on August 30, 1836, when \nAugustus Chapman Allen and his brother, John Kirby Allen, founded the \nCity of Houston near the banks of the Buffalo Bayou. The city was \nincorporated on June 5, 1837, and named after the former General and \nPresident of the Republic of Texas, Sam Houston. One of the most \nsignificant battles in the history of Texas, the Battle of San Jacinto, \nwas fought at the mouth of Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River. It \npaved the way for the Republic of Texas to become an independent \ncountry.\n  If approved by Congress, the Buffalo Bayou's National Heritage Area \nstatus would enhance as well as promote the national significance of \nthis historic waterway.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 3263. A bill to establish a Chief Veterinary Officer in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, along \nwith Senator Ensign, to establish a Chief Veterinary Officer within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. I want to acknowledge the leadership \nthat our colleagues in the House, especially Representative Rogers of \nAlabama, have shown in introducing a bipartisan companion bill. This \nbipartisan, bicameral legislation advances increased focus on \nveterinary health, food defense, and agricultural security within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Importantly, it does this without \ncreating an additional layer of management within the Department.\n  Animal disease and zoonotic outbreaks are a looming threat to the \nUnited States. A major foreign animal disease outbreak, such as foot-\nand-mouth disease, could have far-reaching effects, threatening our \nfood supply and harming both domestic commerce and international trade. \nThe Department of Homeland Security would be called upon to provide \nleadership and to integrate the necessary assets and people from across \nthe Nation to respond to such an incident.\n  This bill would strengthen the Department's capacity to prepare for \nand respond to such a crisis by ensuring that there is a veterinary \nleader within the Department who is fully prepared and empowered to \nrespond. The Secretary of Homeland Security would be required to \nappoint a veterinarian with expertise in veterinary public health, \nemergency preparedness, and other related fields as the Department's \nChief Veterinary Officer. He or she would lead the division of the \nDepartment with primary responsibility for veterinary issues, food \ndefense, and agricultural security, and would serve as the Department's \nlead policy advisor and principal point of contact on those issues. \nThis senior leader also would provide overall guidance for the health \nof the Department's working animals that play a vital role in the \nNation's defense.\n  I have long been concerned about the Nation's ability to prepare for \nand respond to agriculture disasters, such as a catastrophic foreign \nanimal disease outbreak. In February, 2009, I held a hearing on \nprotecting public and animal health and received testimony from several \nagencies, including the Government Accountability Office, GAO, which \nhad recently completed a review of the Federal veterinary workforce. \nGAO reported troubling shortfalls in our veterinarian workforce and our \nplanning to respond to foreign animal disease and zoonotic outbreaks.

A bill to restore Second Amendment rights in the District of \nColumbia; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Second \nAmendment Enforcement Act today with Senator Tester. I have always \nsupported Americans' Second Amendment rights and was pleased when the \nSupreme Court found in June 2008 that the District of Columbia had \nreached too far in restricting the District's residents from owning \nfirearms and defending themselves in their home. The legislation that \nwe introduce today seeks to implement the Supreme Court's decision in \nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller.\n  Specifically, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act would codify many \nof the laws the District of Columbia City Council has put in place in \nresponse to the Supreme Court's decision. For example, this legislation \nwould codify the District's repeal of the semiautomatic ban and retain \nthe District's ban on fully-automatic machine guns. The legislation \nwould also codify the District City Council's law that prohibits the \ncarrying of firearms into the District's public buildings that have \nimplemented security measures and codify the Council's law regulating \nthe carrying of rifles or shotguns.\n  The legislation would correctly restore the right of self-defense for \nany District resident in his or her home. Previously, the District had \na requirement that any firearm kept in a home be stored in a manner \nthat made it essentially useless for self-defense, e.g. kept ``unloaded \nand either disassembled or secured by a trigger lock, gun safe, locked \nbox, or other secure device.'' The legislation would also clarify that \nlandlords cannot prohibit firearms in rented homes or offices or \ndictate what firearms tenants may own.\n  Most egregious was the District's restrictions on the purchase of \nfirearms and outright ban on the purchase of ammunition. At the heart \nof the Supreme Court's decision was that District residents must be \nable to own operable firearms for lawful purposes, which must then \nallow residents meaningful opportunities to purchase firearms and \nammunition. Since the District does not have traditional retail gun \nshops and current federal law prohibits a person from purchasing \nhandguns outside the person's State of residence, the legislation would \namend Federal law to allow District residents the ability to purchase \nguns from federally-licensed dealers in Maryland and Virginia and then \ntransport them back to their homes in DC. Let me be very clear on this \npoint, this legislation would not allow residents of the District to \nbuy firearms from anyone who is not a federally-licensed dealer, even \nat a gun show. I believe this is a very reasonable restriction and one \nthat again, like much of this legislation, takes into consideration the \nconcerns of the District's City Council.\n  Some may ask why a Senator from Arizona and a Senator from Montana \nwould introduce legislation that impacts the lives of District \nresidents. It is simple--we believe that residents across this country \nshould have access to firearms to protect themselves, particularly in \ntheir own home or place of business. It is a constitutional right and \none that was put in place by the Founding Fathers, recognized by the \nSupreme Court and cherished by many Americans. However, the District of \nColumbia City Council did not follow the Supreme Court's directive in \nfully updating their city's laws regarding firearms, and so now it is \nup to Congress to ensure that District residents' rights are respected \nby their government.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nlegislation that will not only restore District residents' rights, but \nalso ensure that no resident in any State, territory or the District is \nprevented from exercising his or her Second Amendment right.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Second \nAmendment Enforcement Act of 2010 with Senators McCain, Begich, \nBennett, Brownback, Burr, Chambliss, Graham, Hatch and Wicker to codify \nthe landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision District of Columbia v. \nHeller, which ruled Washington, DC's, decades-old ban on firearms \nunconstitutional. This bill will repeal the District of Columbia's \nrestrictions on semiautomatic firearms, current gun storage law and \ncomplicated firearms registration system. It will ensure that law-\nabiding persons in Washington, DC, are able to fully exercise their \nSecond Amendment rights just like all other Americans.\n  My cosponsors and I, all signers of the bipartisan friend-of-the-\ncourt brief for District of Columbia v. Heller, urging the Court to \nsupport gun rights, think this is a very important bill and we welcome \nour colleagues' support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/27/senate-section/article/S2710-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2710-S2711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 501--RECOGNIZING AND SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS \n                   OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Franken) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 501\n\n       Whereas on average, a person is sexually assaulted in the \n     United States every 2\\1/2\\ minutes;\n       Whereas the Department of Justice reports that 203,830 \n     people in the United States were sexually assaulted in 2008;\n       Whereas 1 in 6 women and 1 in 33 men have been victims of \n     rape or attempted rape;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense received 2,908 reports of \n     sexual assault involving members of the Armed Forces in \n     fiscal year 2008, representing an 8 percent increase from \n     fiscal year 2007;\n       Whereas children and young adults are most at risk of \n     sexual assault, as 44 percent of sexual assault victims are \n     under 18 years of age, and 80 percent are under the 30 years \n     of age;\n       Whereas sexual assault affects women, men, and children of \n     all racial, social, religious, age, ethnic, and economic \n     groups in the United States;\n       Whereas women, children, and men suffer multiple types of \n     sexual violence, including acquaintance, stranger, spousal, \n     and gang rape, incest, child sexual molestation, forced \n     prostitution, trafficking, forced pornography, ritual abuse, \n     sexual harassment, and stalking;\n       Whereas it is estimated that the percentage of completed or \n     attempt rape victimization among women in institutions of \n     higher education is between 20 and 25 percent over the course \n     of a college career;\n       Whereas, in addition to the immediate physical and \n     emotional costs, sexual assault has associated consequences \n     that may include post-traumatic stress disorder, substance \n     abuse, major depression, homelessness, eating disorders, and \n     suicide;\n       Whereas only 41 percent of sexual assault victims pursue \n     prosecution by reporting their attack to law enforcement \n     agencies;\n       Whereas \\2/3\\ of sexual crimes are committed by persons who \n     are not strangers to the victims;\n\n[[Page S2711]]\n\n       Whereas sexual assault survivors suffer emotional scars \n     long after the physical scars have healed;\n       Whereas, because of advances in DNA technology, law \n     enforcement agencies have the potential to identify the \n     rapists in tens of thousands of unsolved rape cases;\n       Whereas aggressive prosecution can lead to the \n     incarceration of rapists and therefore prevent these \n     individuals from committing further crimes;\n       Whereas national, State, territory, and tribal coalitions, \n     community-based rape crisis centers, and other organizations \n     across the Nation are committed to increasing public \n     awareness of sexual violence and its prevalence, and to \n     eliminating it through prevention and education;\n       Whereas important partnerships have been formed among \n     criminal and juvenile justice agencies, health professionals, \n     public health workers, educators, first responders, and \n     victim service providers;\n       Whereas free, confidential help is available to all \n     survivors of sexual assault through the National Sexual \n     Assault Hotline, more than 1,000 rape crisis centers across \n     the United States, and other organizations that provide \n     services to assist survivors of sexual assault;\n       Whereas, according to a 2010 survey of rape crisis centers \n     by the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, 72 percent \n     of programs have experienced a reduction in funding over the \n     past year, 56 percent have experienced a reduction in \n     staffing, 23 percent have a waiting list for services, and \n     funding and staffing cuts have resulted in an overall 50 \n     percent reduction in the provision of institutional advocacy \n     services;\n       Whereas individual and collective efforts reflect the dream \n     of the people of the United States for a nation where \n     citizens and organizations actively work to prevent all forms \n     of sexual violence and no sexual assault victim goes unserved \n     or ever feels there is no path to justice;

Res. 501\n\n       Whereas on average, a person is sexually assaulted in the \n     United States every 2\\1/2\\ minutes;\n       Whereas the Department of Justice reports that 203,830 \n     people in the United States were sexually assaulted in 2008;\n       Whereas 1 in 6 women and 1 in 33 men have been victims of \n     rape or attempted rape;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense received 2,908 reports of \n     sexual assault involving members of the Armed Forces in \n     fiscal year 2008, representing an 8 percent increase from \n     fiscal year 2007;\n       Whereas children and young adults are most at risk of \n     sexual assault, as 44 percent of sexual assault victims are \n     under 18 years of age, and 80 percent are under the 30 years \n     of age;\n       Whereas sexual assault affects women, men, and children of \n     all racial, social, religious, age, ethnic, and economic \n     groups in the United States;\n       Whereas women, children, and men suffer multiple types of \n     sexual violence, including acquaintance, stranger, spousal, \n     and gang rape, incest, child sexual molestation, forced \n     prostitution, trafficking, forced pornography, ritual abuse, \n     sexual harassment, and stalking;\n       Whereas it is estimated that the percentage of completed or \n     attempt rape victimization among women in institutions of \n     higher education is between 20 and 25 percent over the course \n     of a college career;\n       Whereas, in addition to the immediate physical and \n     emotional costs, sexual assault has associated consequences \n     that may include post-traumatic stress disorder, substance \n     abuse, major depression, homelessness, eating disorders, and \n     suicide;\n       Whereas only 41 percent of sexual assault victims pursue \n     prosecution by reporting their attack to law enforcement \n     agencies;\n       Whereas \\2/3\\ of sexual crimes are committed by persons who \n     are not strangers to the victims;\n       Whereas sexual assault survivors suffer emotional scars \n     long after the physical scars have healed;\n       Whereas, because of advances in DNA technology, law \n     enforcement agencies have the potential to identify the \n     rapists in tens of thousands of unsolved rape cases;\n       Whereas aggressive prosecution can lead to the \n     incarceration of rapists and therefore prevent these \n     individuals from committing further crimes;\n       Whereas national, State, territory, and tribal coalitions, \n     community-based rape crisis centers, and other organizations \n     across the Nation are committed to increasing public \n     awareness of sexual violence and its prevalence, and to \n     eliminating it through prevention and education;\n       Whereas important partnerships have been formed among \n     criminal and juvenile justice agencies, health professionals, \n     public health workers, educators, first responders, and \n     victim service providers;\n       Whereas free, confidential help is available to all \n     survivors of sexual assault through the National Sexual \n     Assault Hotline, more than 1,000 rape crisis centers across \n     the United States, and other organizations that provide \n     services to assist survivors of sexual assault;\n       Whereas, according to a 2010 survey of rape crisis centers \n     by the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, 72 percent \n     of programs have experienced a reduction in funding over the \n     past year, 56 percent have experienced a reduction in \n     staffing, 23 percent have a waiting list for services, and \n     funding and staffing cuts have resulted in an overall 50 \n     percent reduction in the provision of institutional advocacy \n     services;\n       Whereas individual and collective efforts reflect the dream \n     of the people of the United States for a nation where \n     citizens and organizations actively work to prevent all forms \n     of sexual violence and no sexual assault victim goes unserved \n     or ever feels there is no path to justice; and\n       Whereas April is recognized as ``National Sexual Assault \n     Awareness and Prevention Month'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month \n     provides a special opportunity to educate the people of the \n     United States about sexual violence and to encourage the \n     prevention of sexual assault, the improved treatment of \n     survivors of sexual assault, and the prosecution of \n     perpetrators of sexual assault;\n       (B) it is appropriate to properly acknowledge the more than \n     20,000,000 men and women who have survived sexual assault in \n     the United States and salute the efforts of survivors, \n     volunteers, and professionals who combat sexual assault;\n       (C) national and community organizations and private sector \n     supporters should be recognized and applauded for their work \n     in promoting awareness about sexual assault, providing \n     information and treatment to survivors of sexual assault, and \n     increasing the number of successful prosecutions of \n     perpetrators of sexual assault; and\n       (D) public safety, law enforcement, and health \n     professionals should be recognized and applauded for their \n     hard work and innovative strategies to increase the \n     percentage of sexual assault cases that result in the \n     prosecution and incarceration of the offenders;\n       (2) the Senate strongly recommends that national and \n     community organizations, businesses in the private sector, \n     colleges and universities, and the media promote, through \n     National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, \n     awareness of sexual violence and strategies to decrease the \n     incidence of sexual assault;
