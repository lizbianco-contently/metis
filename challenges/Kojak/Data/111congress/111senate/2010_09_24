Mr. President, sometimes all it takes to be a hero is to do \nyour job the way you are supposed to do that job.\n  A few days after New Year's, a deranged gunman walked into the Lloyd \nD. George Federal building in downtown Las Vegas. In addition to \nhousing our Federal courts, it is also the building where my staff \nworks, Senator Ensign's staff, and of course many other employees of \nthe people of the State of Nevada.\n  Court security Officer Stanley Cooper and Deputy U.S. Marshal Richard \nJ. Gardner--everyone calls him Joe--were on duty that day. They were \nboth in the lobby when the gunman got there. Both of them were shot. \nOfficer Cooper didn't make it. He died in the line of duty. I met his \nfamily and spoke at his funeral earlier this year, and I know they \nstill miss him every day. Joe Gardner was more fortunate. He returned \nfire on the gunman. He too was hit while protecting the people working \nand visiting the courthouse but he did survive.\n  We can never know for sure how many lives were saved because Officer \nCooper gave his or because U.S. Marshal Gardner put his own life at \nrisk. And they can never know how grateful we are for their courage. It \nis hard to explain.\n  I am proud to say I have appointed this exemplary Nevadan--U.S. \nMarshal Joe Gardner--to the Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of \nBravery Board. Because if anyone knows what bravery is, it is Joe \nGardner. Seven Federal law enforcement officers serve on this board for \n2-year terms. I want to express my appreciation to my friend the \nRepublican leader, Senator McConnell, for joining me in making sure Joe \nGardner is one of them. It was an easy choice.\n  Too often we take these heroes for granted. We pass them on the \nstreets or on our way through an office building's lobby. There are \nprecious few like U.S. Marshal Joe Gardner--good men and women who wake \nup every morning, go to work and put everything on the line to protect \npeople they do not even know. They will tell you they are just doing \ntheir jobs, and we should be grateful they are doing their jobs. We \nshould fulfill our responsibility just as often--by thanking them every \nsingle day.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce morning business now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "24", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/24/senate-section/article/S7437-8", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the majority leader has generously \nconsented to allow me to make a few observations before I must leave \nthe Chamber.\n  My view is the majority has literally wasted months in the Chamber \ntrying to tell the private sector what to do instead of providing \ncertainty to help them make investment decisions. This bill we will be \nvoting on cloture on Tuesday will do nothing to create jobs in our \ncountry. Most of the factories the Durbin bill is trying to prevent \nfrom moving overseas are not traveling overseas to sell back to the \nAmerican market but are moving there to gain competitive advantage over \nforeign companies in foreign markets. In doing so, they create more \njobs and more opportunity in the United States. The nonpartisan Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has informed my staff that this bill, similar to \nso many others produced by the majority this year, will increase the \ndeficit by nearly $1 billion, violating the majority's own pay-go \nrules.\n  It is my hope we will not decide to debate and pass this bill. I \nthink it would be a step in the wrong direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend is correct. There has been a lot \nof wasted time in the Senate. But it hasn't been because of the \nmajority. We have had to answer to more than 100 filibusters, which \nhave eaten up weeks and weeks of our time, when we should have been \ntalking about jobs for the American people. For my friend to stand on \nthe floor and say the continual exporting of jobs is good for the \ncountry is beyond the ability of someone to believe. Not only does the \nfact that these jobs are transferred to another country create \ntremendous job losses, but we give these people tax benefits for doing \nso. It is hard to comprehend how such a policy ever came to be. This is \nan effort to stop it.\n  We have some very commonsense ideas. One says: If you want to come \nback to the United States and you want to create some jobs here, we \nwill give you a tax benefit for that. But we do say that if you are \ngoing to tear down a plant, an operation in America, you should not get \na tax benefit for doing that, as now exists. Right now, if you move a \nwood manufacturing company out of the State of Washington, tear down \nyour plant and move it to China, you get a tax break for that. The \nAmerican people don't want that. Finally, outsourcing these jobs is the \nthird part of our legislation--shipping jobs overseas, terminating the \njobs here and then making the product over there cheaply and then \nsending the product back here and you get a tax break for it. The \nAmerican people don't understand that. They don't understand it because \nit is illogical. That is what the debate will be about.\n  We will start the debate Monday afternoon. Everyone should be aware \nthat we will have a live quorum at about 7 o'clock on Monday evening. I \nexplained to the minority leader yesterday that we were going to do \nthat so it is no surprise. Then we will see if during the evening we \nneed any more. We will try to set up the debate in a constructive \nfashion. It is a debate we on this side relish.\n  Mr. President, I now withdraw my motion to proceed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, six months ago our Nation \naccomplished something that so many generations before had struggled to \nachieve. Six months ago yesterday, with the enactment of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, our Nation stood up and declared \nthat the health of our citizens is worth fighting for.\n  There has been a lot of debate, as the Presiding Officer knows, in \nthis Chamber and in the House of Representatives and on the talk shows \nand talk radio. There is a lot of debate about theories and death \npanels and health care and preexisting conditions. But behind all of \nthat is human beings in difficult situations. After hearing people say \nthings about this health care law that simply aren't true, it is \nimportant to remember how this affects individual human beings.\n  This legislation began to take effect when, yesterday, several things \nhappened. One is that a 22-year-old who is home from school who just \ngot a job but doesn't have insurance in that job can stay on her \nparents' health care plan until she turns 27. Small businesses can get \ntax breaks to insure their employees. Something most small businesses--\nalmost every small businessperson I know--want to do is provide decent, \naffordable health insurance to their employees. They will be better \nable to do that because of this bill. Also yesterday, because of this \nlegislation, we saw movement toward the doughnut hole being closed. \nThat simply means that senior citizens, conflicted with very high \nhealth care costs, having to choose between medication and heating \ntheir home or proper food, cutting their pills in half or having to \nskip a day in taking it because they couldn't afford it--this bill will \nbegin to close that doughnut hole\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\nthat President Bush and the Republican Congress created.\n  We are seeing major progress which affects individual people. Mary \nfrom Ashtabula, OH, which is in the northeast corner of the State, \nshared a story with me about her friend who is paying $56 each month \nfor medications to treat her chronic illness. After the doughnut hole \nkicks in, she worries that her friend will have to pay literally 10 \ntimes that--not $56, which she can handle, but literally $500 per \nmonth, which she can't. This increase will catastrophically affect her \nfriend, who is 80 years old and living on a tight budget. Next year, \nbecause of this legislation that is taking effect now, Mary's friend \nwill see her prescription drug costs cut in half.\n  Robert from Cleveland wrote me a letter sharing his concerns about \nbeing young and uninsured. As happens to many young adults, Robert was \ndropped from his mother's insurance on his 21st birthday. He has been \nunable to obtain full-time employment. He has remained uninsured, not \nby choice but because he really had no options. In fact, he saw the \nrisks associated with being uninsured firsthand as he accompanied his \nalso uninsured friend to the hospital after sustaining a basketball \ninjury not too long ago. His friend left the emergency room with a \n$3,000 bill. Robert understands that young adults such as him and his \nfriend will no longer have to face the uncertainty and fear associated \nwith being uninsured.\n  This legislation also, as of yesterday, allows States such as Ohio \nand every State in the country to set up what are called high-risk \ninsurance pools. We all know--and the Presiding Officer knows it from \ntalking to people in Rochester and Duluth and St. Paul, and I have \ntalked to people in Toledo and Dayton and Springfield who can't get \ninsurance because they have a preexisting condition. So 462 Ohioans \nalready have signed up for what is called this high-risk insurance \npool. That means that even with a preexisting condition, those 462 \nOhioans have insurance. Six months ago, they were uninsured and \nuninsurable. Today, they have insurance.\n  Laura from Hamilton County wrote to me when she learned about the \nhealth care law. She wrote:\n\n       I cheered when I learned that children with chronic \n     conditions cannot be denied health insurance coverage. I have \n     a child with Type 1 diabetes. I have worried for years about \n     what will become of him as he ages and moves off our \n     insurance policy. I have worried for years what his health \n     plan options will be. It is a relief to now be able to shift \n     our efforts to battling the disease, not the health care \n     system.\n\n  Any mother or father with a sick child wants to focus their efforts \non taking care of that illness, not fighting with insurance companies, \nnot worrying about cobbling together payments to pay the doctor, the \nhospital, and the drug company.\n  I am proud to say these changes are just the beginning. As of \nyesterday, when you renew or purchase a health insurance plan, you \ndon't have to worry about lifetime limits. We know what happens: If you \nget sick, if you live in Akron or Youngstown and you get very sick and \nspend a lot of time in the hospital, insurance companies--it is called \nrescission--will simply cancel your insurance because you exceeded the \nlifetime limits they set up. Well, no more lifetime limits because of \nthis bill.\n  From now on, recommended preventive services, immunizations, \nmammograms, and other recommended screenings, will be covered without a \ncopay or deductible. We want people to get screened, to get preventive \ncare. It saves their health, and it saves all of us money. So they can \nget less expensive health care. For them, taking away their requirement \nto pay copays and deductibles will make a huge difference.\n  There are now new restrictions on private insurers from placing \nunreasonable limits on your coverage. Patients can access out-of-\nnetwork emergency room services and children can no longer be denied \ninsurance because of a preexisting condition. Think of the parents we \ntalk to who have a child who is sick and can't get insurance because \nthat child has a preexisting condition, as if a parent wanted it that \nway. Now we have fixed this.\n  The Presiding Officer was part of this debate, as all of us in this \ninstitution were, during last year and the beginning of this year when \nwe passed this bill. We know what the opponents--people speaking mostly \non behalf of the insurance industry, the drug industry, and people who \njust don't agree that we should do something like this--we know what \nthey did. They lied about death panels. They spread half-truths about \ncosts. They even labeled health care reform ``communism.''\n  They did the same thing with Medicare. I remember the same arguments \nwhen I was a kid. I was 12 years old, 13 years old when Medicare \npassed. They used the same arguments about Medicare. They said: The \ngovernment is going to stand between you and your doctor. They said: It \nis going to turn the United States into the Soviet Union. They said: We \nare never going to be able to get health insurance again. It is going \nto be big government running our lives. I don't think they say that \nabout Medicare anymore. They have tried to dismantle and privatize \nMedicare, but they know it has worked.\n  In the 1930s, these same people with the same philosophy campaigned \nagainst Social Security, saying it wouldn't work. In the 1960s, they \ncampaigned against Medicare, saying it wouldn't work. Now they are \ncampaigning against the health care law.\n  There are Republicans all over this country--not many voters, I don't \nthink--who are talking about repealing the health care law. So what \nthey are going to do is kick the 23-year-old off their parents' \ninsurance. Now they are going to take away these tax breaks for small \nbusinesses to insure their employees. They are going to reinstate the \ndoughnut hole. They are going to put more costs back on senior \ncitizens, who finally are getting some help with their drug costs. I \ndon't get it. They are going to bring back preexisting conditions. They \nare going to say it is OK again to deny somebody coverage for a \npreexisting condition. I don't think the public is going to buy that. I \ndon't think this institution will vote that way.\n  It is important to recognize from where we have come. Most of all, it \nis important to think about individual human beings we have met who are \naffected so positively by this law. They are going to be able to get \ninsurance. They are not going to be denied coverage if they have a \npreexisting condition. Businesses will be able to help their employees \nby covering them for insurance. Senior citizens are going to get \nsignificant help for their drug costs. What is not to like about that? \nThat is why it is important that we stand firm as we mark this 6-month \nbeginning of these changes that will make our health care system work \nbetter, be more responsive to people, and, most importantly, take care \nof individual Americans better than ever before.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "24", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/24/senate-section/article/S7439-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7439-S7440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             STEELDAY 2010\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the critical \nrole of structural steel in our Nation's infrastructure and industrial \neconomy.\n  Today, September 24, 2010, is the second annual SteelDay and is being \ncelebrated through events nationwide. These events highlight the many \nAmerican jobs provided by the structural steel industry and the \ncontributions of structural steel as a safe, strong, green, and \neffective building material.\n  The structural steel industry is a major employer in Illinois. Today, \nthe United States has 4 major structural steel mills, 10 hollow \nstructural shape producers, and more than 2,600 steel fabricators. \nTogether, they employ over 185,000 Americans, producing 4.5 million \ntons of fabricated structural steel in 2009. In Illinois, more than 100 \nstructural steel firms provide more than 2,000 good jobs.\n  Most of the structured steel in a building can be recovered and \nrecycled--as much as 98 percent. In fact, columns and beams that are \nmade at U.S. steel mills include an average 93 percent of recycled \nmaterials. It is the most recycled material on the planet.\n  There is a renewed interest in this country in domestic steel as a \nbuilding material, and structural steel accounts for 5 percent of the \nsteel consumed in the United States. Shipping steel from other \ncountries creates a huge and unnecessary carbon footprint. LEED \ncertification, an environmental rating\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\nsystem developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, relies heavily on \nthe use of domestic steel in new construction.\n  The industry continues to incorporate improvements in the technology \nused to build steel projects. These improvements are also bringing down \nconstruction costs and increasing safety at construction sites. In \nlight of these economic, environmental, and safety factors, it is no \nsurprise that there is a three-to-one preference for using structural \nsteel in the construction of multistory residential and nonresidential \nbuildings.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the structural steel industry on its \nsecond annual SteelDay. Steel manufacturing and construction is driving \nour Nation's progress into the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "24", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/24/senate-section/article/S7440-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GREATER OWENSBORO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nremarkable accomplishments of the Greater Owensboro Chamber of \nCommerce. They were selected as the winner, out of eight National \nfinalists, in the 2010 Chamber of the Year competition sponsored by the \nAmerican Chamber of Commerce Executives, ACCE. This is quite a feat, as \nthe ACCE's Chamber of the Year is the Nation's only award that \nrecognizes local chambers for their dual role in creating and leading \nbusinesses and communities.\n  Chambers wanting to apply for this award could do so if they had an \nexceptional year or if they had a program or initiative that went above \nand beyond expectations. With this in mind, the Greater Owensboro \nChamber of Commerce highlighted their success in developing the Chamber \nLeadership Initiatives for Northwestern Kentucky, C-LINK, alliance and \nthe Owensboro Buys It! program in the application process.\n  C-LINK includes 12 chambers in the region and has been a leading \nproponent of Interstate 69 in western Kentucky, one of the largest \ntransportation projects in the region, which has seen significant \nprogress in the past two years. Owensboro Buys It! was started in 2009 \nto create local commerce and to teach small business leaders how to \ninitiate an ``elevator pitch'' and sharpen their ability to gain and \nretain customers. When the chamber board of directors mapped out a \nstrategic plan in 2008, they made it their goal to earn this award by \n2012. Because of their hard work, they managed to beat even that \naudacious goal.\n  Under the leadership of chamber president Jody Wassmer, the board of \ndirectors, staff, and members of the Greater Owensboro Chamber of \nCommerce made their hometown, their Commonwealth, and this Senator very \nproud. I ask my colleagues to rise and join me in congratulating them \non this honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "24", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/24/senate-section/article/S7440-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the House of Representatives for \npromptly enacting the Freedom of Information Act amendments to the \nSecurities and Exchange Act, Investment Company Act, and Investment \nAdvisers Act of 2010, S. 3717. This bipartisan bill will ensure that \nthe Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, remains an effective tool to \nprovide public access to information about the stability of our \nfinancial markets.\n  This bill will also ensure that the important goals of the historic \nWall Street reform law--enhancing transparency, accountability, and \nconfidence in our financial system--will become a reality for all \nAmericans. The bill eliminates several broad FOIA exemptions for \nSecurity and Exchange Commission, SEC, records that were recently \nenacted as part of Public Law 111-203. The bill also helps to ensure \nthat the SEC has access to the information that the Commission needs to \ncarry out its new enforcement activities under the new reforms.\n  I thank Representative Edolphus Towns, the distinguished chairman of \nthe House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and \nRepresentative Barney Frank, the distinguished chairman of the House \nCommittee on Financial Services, for their support of this bill and for \nworking with me to quickly enact this legislation. I also thank \nSenators Grassley, Cornyn, and Kaufman for cosponsoring this important \nopen government bill. In addition, I commend the many open government \norganizations, including OpenTheGovernment.org, the Project on \nGovernment Oversight, the American Library Association, and the \nSunlight Foundation for their support of this bill.\n  The Freedom of Information Act has long recognized the need to \nbalance the government's legitimate interest in protecting confidential \nbusiness records, trade secrets, and other sensitive information from \npublic disclosure, and preserving the public's right to know. To \naccomplish this, care must always be taken to ensure that exemptions to \nFOIA's disclosure requirements are narrowly and properly applied. The \nbill accomplishes this important goal.\n  I commend the Congress for working in a bipartisan and expeditious \nmanner to eliminate these overly broad FOIA exemptions. I urge the \nPresident to promptly sign this good government bill into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "24", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/24/senate-section/article/S7440-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FEDERAL HIRING FREEZE\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate subcommittee that \noversees the Federal workforce, I strongly oppose the proposal by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to impose a hiring freeze for \nall nonsecurity positions in the Federal Government. If adopted, this \nproposal would sacrifice our Nation's long-term investments in the \nemployees needed to efficiently and effectively run government programs \nfor a short-sighted approach that does nothing to address our current \nfiscal challenges.\n  Far from being fiscally responsible, these policies would end up \ncosting the government more over the long run, by increasing our \nreliance on contractors whose work would not be capped. Arbitrary \nrestrictions on hiring Federal employees open up opportunities for \nwaste, fraud, and abuse as contracting expands without investment in \noversight. Over the past decade, Federal contracts have nearly doubled \nin size, to over $500 billion, but the size of the workforce overseeing \ncontractors has stayed constant. We must reverse, not reinforce, that \ntrend.\n  Over the past two years, we have made efforts to rebalance the work \nperformed by Federal employees and contractors. Many times, replacing \ncontractors with Federal employees allows agencies to more efficiently \nmeet their missions and provide vital services. The American people \nexpect strong leadership from the Federal Government and we must make \nsure the Federal Government has the people it needs to perform critical \nfunctions and to properly oversee the important work done by \ncontractors. Freezing the Federal workforce could once again lead to \ndramatic overreliance on contractors, putting agency missions and \ntaxpayer dollars at risk.\n  The American people deserve a government that hires the right people \nwith the right skills to run their government in an effective and \nefficient manner. An arbitrary cap on Federal employees is a poor \nsubstitute for the careful, thoughtful approach to Federal workforce \nplanning we need.\n  Our Federal civil service is comprised of hard working, talented \npeople who have dedicated their lives to the service of this country--\nand our way of life would not exist without them. These are honorable \nmen and women who provide critical services to the American people, \nincluding protecting our Nation, ensuring that our food and drugs are \nsafe, caring for our wounded warriors, and responding to natural \ndisasters. America's public servants deserve our gratitude and respect. \nI thank them for their dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "24", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/24/senate-section/article/S7440-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7440-S7441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AQUACULTURE DISASTER ASSISTANCE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on an \nissue that is of great importance to my home State of Louisiana: \nFederal disaster assistance. As you know, along the gulf coast, we keep \nan eye trained on the Gulf of Mexico during hurricane season. This is \nfollowing the devastating one-two punch of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nof 2005 as well as Hurricanes Gustav and Ike last year. Our communities \nand businesses are still\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\nrecovering from these disasters--some from a disaster that devastated \nthe gulf coast almost 5 years ago. We are now also dealing with the \neconomic and environmental damage from the Deepwater Horizon disaster \nwhich occurred this April. For this reason, as chair of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship ensuring effective \nFederal disaster coordination is one of my top priorities. While the \ngulf coast is prone to hurricanes, other parts of the country are no \nstrangers to disaster. For example, the Midwest has tornadoes, \nCalifornia experiences earthquakes and wildfires, and the Northeast \nsees crippling snowstorms. So no part of our country is spared from \ndisasters--disasters which can and will strike at any moment. With this \nin mind, we must ensure that the Federal Government is better prepared \nand has the tools necessary to respond quickly, effectively following a \ndisaster.\n  In order to help ongoing recovery efforts in the gulf coast, and to \ngive the U.S. Small Business Administration, SBA, more tools to respond \nafter a future disaster, I am proud that the House of Representatives \npassed H.R. 5297, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. I have spoken at \nlength on the Senate floor about the huge impact this legislation will \nhave for small business owners. Today I also note that this legislation \nincludes an important provision improving SBA disaster assistance. This \nprovision builds off of SBA disaster reforms enacted in 2008 and \nensures that small businesses in the aquaculture sector will not be \nleft without disaster assistance following future disasters. In \nparticular, the provision is section 1501 of H.R. 5297. I note that \nthis provision is similar to section 205 of legislation I introduced \nlast year, the Small Business Administration Disaster Recovery and \nReform Act of 2009. This section amends the Small Business Act to make \naquaculture businesses eligible for SBA economic injury disaster loans.\n  Currently, the SBA determines that aquaculture includes any industry \nwhere an individual farms aquatic organisms, farming means intervention \nin the rearing process to enhance production--regular stocking, \nfeeding, protection from predators. These include farmers of: algae, \nalligators, frogs, turtles, seaweed, clams, crawfish, pearls, fish \nfarms/hatcheries, mussels, and oysters. Under current provisions of the \nSmall Business Act, SBA is prohibited from providing assistance to \nthese industries as it was wrongly assumed that they would be covered \nby other Federal agencies. This is because, when Congress repealed SBA \ndisaster assistance for agricultural businesses in the 1980s, they \nmistakenly assumed that all of these businesses, including aquaculture \nbusinesses, would be helped by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \nUSDA.\n  For example, oystermen who seed private grounds which they own or \nrent are engaged in aquaculture and are currently ineligible. Public \nground oystermen, however, who do not have exclusive use of any area, \ndo not farm and are eligible for SBA economic injury disaster loans. In \nLouisiana, our aquaculture businesses in the southern part of the State \nwere hit hard by both Hurricane Katrina and Rita. These businesses, \nmany crawfish farmers or those with fish farms, were ineligible for \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, disaster assistance, but were \nalso ineligible for SBA disaster loans. We also learned that similar \nproblems followed Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. A more recent \nexample of the huge problem this causes is that the SBA is currently \noffering $2 million economic injury disaster loans, EIDLs, to \nbusinesses impacted by the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Since the Small \nBusiness Act currently prohibits aquaculture businesses from receiving \nEIDLs, they were ineligible. However, no other Federal agency, \nincluding USDA was providing assistance for this disaster. So small \nbusinesses impacted by a disaster were told. We cannot help you, even \nthough no other Federal agency was there to fill in the gap.\n  In closing, I believe that the commonsense fix sent to the President \ntoday will give these businesses they help they need to recover from \nfuture disasters. Businesses involved in the farming of the following \nstand to benefit greatly from this new legislation: algae, alligators, \nfrogs, turtles, seaweed, clams, crawfish, pearls, fish farms/\nhatcheries, mussels, and oysters.\n  I thank the chair and ask that my entire statement and a copy of this \nparticular provision appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 1501.

The banquet will celebrate his 30 years of \nministry and his 23 years as Pastor of New Life Baptist Church \nMinistries.\n  Since accepting his call to the ministry, Pastor Bradley has \npersistently sought to encourage and enlighten his congregation, and \nthrough these efforts, has earned the respect and admiration of people \nthroughout Michigan. His pastoral leadership and commitment to service \nis admirable, and The New Life Baptist Church Ministries has flourished \nunder his spiritual guidance. Through his stewardship and many \ncommunity-based efforts such as the ``Mission in the City Movement,'' \nPastor Bradley has provided much needed assistance to those most in \nneed in the greater Saginaw community.\n  Before becoming pastor of New Life, Pastor Bradley studied theology \nunder the tutelage of several well-known religious leaders. He also \nearned a bachelor's degree from the United Theological Seminary in \nMonroe, LA, and is a graduate of the Beeson Institute for Advanced \nChurch Leadership. Pastor Bradley is a family man and is supported by \nhis wife, Relinda Bradley. They have enjoyed 32 wonderful years \ntogether and are the proud parents of two children, June and Rufus, Jr.\n  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Pastor Bradley on 30 \nyears of pastoral leadership and faithful service to the greater \nSaginaw community. We wish him the best as he continues this important \nwork for many more years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "24", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/24/senate-section/article/S7441-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7441-S7442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:08 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 846.

Accordingly, the United States interprets the term \n     `license or other written authorization' in Article 2 and the \n     term `licenses or other authorizations' in Article 6(1), as \n     these terms apply to the United States, and the term `prior \n     written authorization by the United States Government' in \n     Article 7, to refer only to such licenses, licensing \n     requirements, and other authorizations as are required or \n     issued by the United States pursuant to the International \n     Traffic in Arms Regulations, as modified or amended; and the \n     United States interprets the reference to `the applicable \n     licensing requirements and the implementing regulations of \n     the United States Arms Export Control Act' in Article 13(1) \n     to refer only to the applicable licensing requirements under \n     the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, as modified or \n     amended.\n       Section 4.

Understandings.\n       The Senate's advice and consent to the ratification of the \n     Treaty with Australia Concerning Defense Trade Cooperation is \n     subject to the following understandings, which shall be \n     included in the instrument of ratification:\n       (1) Meaning of the phrase ``identified in.''\n       It is the understanding of the United States that the \n     phrase ``identified in'' in the Treaty shall be interpreted  \n     as meaning ``identified pursuant to.''\n       (2) Cooperative programs with exempt and non-exempt defense \n     articles.\n       It is the understanding of the United States that if a \n     cooperative program is mutually determined, consistent with \n     Section 2(2)(e) of the Implementing Arrangement, to be within \n     the Scope of the Treaty pursuant to Article 3(1)(b) of the \n     Treaty despite involving Defense Articles that are exempt \n     from the Scope of the Treaty pursuant to Article 3(2) of the \n     Treaty, the exempt Defense\n\n[[Page S7446]]\n\n     Articles shall remain exempt from the Scope of the Treaty and \n     the Treaty shall apply only to non-exempt Defense Articles \n     required for the program.\n       (3) Investigations and reports of alleged violations.\n       It is the understanding of the United States that the words \n     ``as appropriate'' in Section 10(3)(f) of the Implementing \n     Arrangement do not detract in any way from the obligation in \n     Article 13(3) of the Treaty, that ``Each Party shall promptly \n     investigate all suspected violations and reports of alleged \n     violations of the procedures established pursuant to this \n     Treaty, and shall promptly inform the other Party of the \n     results of such investigations.''\n       (4) Exempt defense articles.\n       It is the understanding of the United States that if one \n     Party to the Treaty exempts a type of Defense Articles from \n     the scope of the Treaty pursuant to Article 3(2) of the \n     Treaty, then Defense Articles of that type will be treated as \n     exempt by both Parties to the Treaty.\n       (5) Intermediate consignees.\n       It is the understanding of the United States that any \n     intermediate consignee of an Export from the United States \n     under the Treaty must be a member of the Approved Community \n     or otherwise approved by the United States Government.\n       (6) Scope of treaty exemption.\n       The United States interprets the Treaty not to exempt any \n     person or entity from any United States statutory and \n     regulatory requirements, including any requirements of \n     licensing or authorization, other than those included in the \n     International Traffic in Arms Regulations, as modified or \n     amended. Accordingly, the United States interprets the term \n     `license or other written authorization' in Article 2 and the \n     term `licenses or other authorizations' in Article 6(1), as \n     these terms apply to the United States, and the term `prior \n     written authorization by the United States Government' in \n     Article 7, to refer only to such licenses, licensing \n     requirements, and other authorizations as are required or \n     issued by the United States pursuant to the International \n     Traffic in Arms Regulations, as modified or amended; and the \n     United States interprets the reference to `the applicable \n     licensing requirements and the implementing regulations of \n     the United States Arms Export Control Act' in Article 13(1) \n     to refer only to the applicable licensing requirements under \n     the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, as modified or \n     amended.\n       Section 4.

A bill to permit employees to request, and to ensure \nemployers consider requests for, flexible work terms and conditions, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President:\n\n       We all fill many roles in our lives. We are workers, \n     parents, sons and daughters, and members of our communities. \n     We struggle to do well in each responsibility. But when the \n     demands of work overshadow the rest of our lives, our lives \n     feel out of balance. This legislation gives millions of \n     American workers the opportunity to restore that balance--to \n     be good employees and responsible citizens and family \n     members, too. They deserve no less.--Senator Ted Kennedy \n     delivered these words on December 6, 2007.\n\n  With those words, Senator Kennedy introduced the Working Families \nFlexibility Act in 2007. Today, I continue his essential work by \nreintroducing the legislation he championed.\n  Millions of Americans face unbelievable demands on their time due to \nwork and familial responsibilities. Thirty years ago, people worked \nfewer hours and it was commonplace for one parent to stay at home while \nthe other worked. Today, 70 percent of households are led by either two \nemployed parents, or a single parent.\n  There are numerous demands on our personal time. Parents spend \ncountless hours on childcare, caring for older relatives, doctor's \nappointments, kids sporting events, and school activities--on top of \nputting in a full day at work. Then, there is the time it takes to get \nto work. It is not uncommon for people to spend hours every day in \ntheir cars, or on some form of public transportation, getting to and \nfrom work each day.\n  These time commitments lead to stress and a loss of productivity. \nAccording to research compiled by Workplace Flexibility 2010, a public \npolicy initiative at Georgetown Law, a staggering 92 percent of \nemployees feel they don't have enough flexibility on the job to meet \nthe needs of their children and families.\n  We need a change. Parents deserve options. We must encourage an \nevolution in the modern workplace to acknowledge the realities of our \noutside time commitments.\n  One thing we can do is promote workplace flexibility. Flexibility can \nmean telecommuting, job sharing or part-time work. For workers, this \nflexibility means greater control about when and where they get their \nwork done. For employers, it means less turn over, higher morale and \nmore productive employees. It is a win-win for both employer and \nemployee.\n  That is why I am introducing the Workplace Flexibility Fairness Act. \nLong championed by Senator Ted Kennedy, this bill acknowledges the \nrealities of our modern workforce by providing employees the ``right to \nrequest'' flexible work options in terms of hours, schedules and work \nlocation. Further, the legislation provides employers with flexibility \nby encouraging them to review these requests, propose changes and even \ndeny workers if the request is not in the best interest of the \nbusiness. Lastly, the legislation imposes civil penalties on any \nemployer who discriminates against an employee for exercising any right \ngranted under this legislation. This provision is necessary to protect \nworkers who initiate a conversation with their employer about workplace \nflexibility options.\n  Countries around the world, including Great Britain, Germany, the \nNetherlands and New Zealand have ``Right to Request'' laws that have \nbeen shown to increase productivity, attendance and overall job \nsatisfaction. It is time for Congress to encourage workplace \nflexibility in the United States. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to pass this common sense legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "24", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/24/senate-section/article/S7447-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7447-S7448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 644--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING OCTOBER 10, 2010, \n                  AS ``NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE WEEK''\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \nCasey, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Burris, Mr. Udall \nof Colorado, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Shaheen, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nBennet, Mr. Feingold, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Corker, Mr. Reed, Mr. Udall of \nNew Mexico, Mr. Pryor, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Inouye, and \nMr. Levin) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 644\n\n       Whereas, in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt established \n     the first national wildlife refuge on Florida's Pelican \n     Island;\n       Whereas, in 2010, the National Wildlife Refuge System is \n     the premier system of lands and waters to conserve wildlife \n     in the world, and has grown to more than 150 million acres, \n     552 national wildlife refuges, and 38 wetland management \n     districts in every State and territory of the United States;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important \n     recreational and tourism destinations in communities across \n     the Nation, and these protected lands offer a variety of \n     recreational opportunities, including 6 wildlife-dependent \n     uses that the National Wildlife Refuge System manages: \n     hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, \n     environmental education, and interpretation;\n       Whereas hunting is permitted on more than 320 national \n     wildlife refuges and fishing is permitted on 272 national \n     wildlife refuges, welcoming more than 2,500,000 hunters and \n     more than 7,000,000 anglers;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are important to local \n     businesses and gateway communities;\n       Whereas, for every $1 appropriated, national wildlife \n     refuges generate $4 in economic activity;\n       Whereas approximately 41,000,000 people visit national \n     wildlife refuges every year, generating nearly $1,700,000,000 \n     and 27,000 jobs in local economies;\n       Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System encompasses \n     every kind of ecosystem in the United States, including \n     temperate, tropical, and boreal forests, wetlands, deserts, \n     grasslands, arctic tundras, and remote islands, and spans 12 \n     time zones from the Virgin Islands to Guam;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are home to more than 700 \n     species of birds, 220 species of mammals, 250 species of \n     reptiles and amphibians, and more than 1,000 species of fish;\n       Whereas 59 refuges were established specifically to protect \n     imperiled species and of the more than 1,200 federally listed \n     threatened and endangered species in the United States, 280 \n     species are found on units of the National Wildlife Refuge \n     System;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges are cores of conservation \n     for larger landscapes and resources for other agencies of the \n     Federal Government and State governments, private landowners, \n     and organizations in their efforts to secure the wildlife \n     heritage of the United States;\n       Whereas 39,000 volunteers and more than 220 national \n     wildlife refuge ``Friends'' organizations contribute nearly \n     1,400,000 hours annually, the equivalent of 665 full-time \n     employees, and provide an important link with local \n     communities;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges provide an important \n     opportunity for children to connect with nature and discover \n     the natural world;\n       Whereas, because there are national wildlife refuges \n     located in several urban and suburban areas and 1 refuge \n     located within an hour's drive of every metropolitan area in \n     the United States, national wildlife refuges employ, educate, \n     and engage young people from all backgrounds in exploring, \n     connecting with, and preserving the natural heritage of the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas, since 1995, refuges across the Nation have held \n     festivals, educational programs, guided tours, and other \n     events to celebrate National Wildlife Refuge Week during the \n     second full week of October;\n       Whereas the week beginning on October 10, 2010, has been \n     designated as ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'' by the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service; and\n       Whereas, in 2010, the designation of National Wildlife \n     Refuge Week would recognize more than a century of \n     conservation in the United States and would serve to raise \n     awareness about the importance of wildlife and the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System and to celebrate the myriad \n     recreational opportunities available to enjoy this network of \n     protected lands: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning on October 10, 2010, as \n     ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Wildlife \n     Refuge Week;\n       (3) acknowledges the importance of national wildlife \n     refuges for their recreational opportunities and contribution \n     to local economies across the United States;\n       (4) pronounces that national wildlife refuges play a vital \n     role in securing the hunting and fishing heritage of the \n     United States for future generations;\n       (5) recognizes the importance of national wildlife refuges \n     to wildlife conservation and the protection of imperiled \n     species and ecosystems;\n       (6) applauds the work of refuge ``Friends'' groups, \n     national and community organizations, and public partners \n     that promote awareness, compatible use, protection, and \n     restoration of national wildlife refuges;\n\n[[Page S7448]]\n\n       (7) reaffirms the support of the Senate for wildlife \n     conservation and the National Wildlife Refuge System;

Res. 646\n\n       Whereas Thanksgiving Day celebrates the spirit of selfless \n     giving and an appreciation for family and friends;\n       Whereas the spirit of Thanksgiving Day is a virtue upon \n     which the United States was founded;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Agriculture, \n     roughly 35,000,000 people in the United States, including \n     12,000,000 children, continue to live in households that do \n     not have an adequate supply of food; and\n       Whereas selfless sacrifice breeds a genuine spirit of \n     thanksgiving, both affirming and restoring fundamental \n     principles in our society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates Thursday, November 18, 2010, as ``Feed \n     America Day''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to sacrifice \n     2 meals on Thursday, November 18, 2010, and to donate the \n     money that would have been spent on that food to the \n     religious or charitable organization of their choice for the \n     purpose of feeding the hungry.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce Senate Resolution \n646, also known as Feed America Day.\n  Feed America Day began in 2002 as a small effort in Provo, UT. From \nthat small beginning, the campaign has received support from over 1,100 \nlarge and small cities. This includes over 60 cities that have \nresponded with proclamations, covering a population exceeding seven \nmillion.\n  This eighth year of promoting Feed America Day is held on the \nThursday immediately preceding Thanksgiving Day. On that day, each \nperson is encouraged to fast two meals and then to contribute to a food \nbank, church, or charity the equivalent dollar amount saved.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported that 35 million \nAmericans, including 12 million children, live in homes that do not \nhave an adequate supply of food. This resolution recalls that selfless \nsacrifice breeds a genuine spirit of thanksgiving, both affirming and \nrestoring fundamental principles in our society. In that spirit, I \nencourage individuals and families to remember to help those in need \none week before Thanksgiving.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "24", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/24/senate-section/article/S7448-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4658.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.\n\n  The bill (S. 3196), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, the Senate has just passed an important \npiece of legislation that will make our Presidential transitions safer. \nThe Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act, which I introduced in \nApril along with Senators Voinovich, Akaka, and Lieberman--and which \nhas also been cosponsored by Senators Carper and Collins--is a \nbipartisan bill and the product of research into best practices from \nrecent transitions.\n  With input from the General Services Administration, and following \nthe release of new studies by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public \nService and Presidential scholars like Martha Joynt Kumar and Terry \nSullivan, we crafted a bill that draws on the successes of the 2008-\n2009 transition. Our Nation was fortunate that both President Bush and \nPresident-Elect Obama were both focused on ensuring a smooth and secure \ntransition. In this, our first transition between parties since the \nattacks of September 11, 2001, in the midst of two wars and the worst \neconomic downturn since the Great Depression, we had no room for error.\n  This legislation will help remove the stigma that all too often \ndissuades candidates from taking the responsible step of early \ntransition planning before election day. By extending a limited number \nof government services to Presidential nominees, we can make early \ntransition activities a normal part of responsible candidacy.\n  I thank my cosponsors for their work on this bill, and I thank my \ncolleagues for their unanimous support. I am glad that the Senate has \ntaken this important step. In our post-September 11 security \nenvironment, we simply cannot afford to leave Presidential transitions \nto chance. I urge the House of Representatives to take swift action to \npass this bill.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the op-ed by Ed Gillespie and Donna\n\n[[Page S7452]]\n\nBrazile on the importance of passing this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Roll Call, July 20, 2010]\n\n           Congress Can Expedite the Presidential Transition\n\n                  (By Donna Brazile and Ed Gillespie)\n\n       For most Americans, the morning after a presidential \n     election has been decided represents a moment of relief. \n     Relief that months of campaign commercials, debates and a \n     seemingly endless stream of canvassers knocking on their \n     doors and phoners interrupting their dinners are finally \n     over--relief at the end of a long and exhausting process.\n       However, for the election winner's staff, that morning is \n     the official beginning of a stressful and complicated process \n     that can make or break the new president's first two years in \n     office.\n       Having worked on presidential transitions, we both know the \n     pressures facing transition staff. There are only 11 or 12 \n     weeks between Election Day and the inauguration, too short a \n     period to prepare for the host of challenges facing incoming \n     administrations. This is especially true in our post-9/11 \n     security environment and in times of economic uncertainty, \n     which demand a seamless transfer of power and leave us no \n     room for a gap in national leadership.\n       That is why, in recent elections, candidates have begun \n     planning their transitions informally before winning \n     election. While these efforts are almost never spoken of out \n     of fear they will be derided as presumptuous, they have \n     become as important to the process of transferring power as \n     the formal transition following Election Day.\n       To their credit, both President Barack Obama and Sen. John \n     McCain (R-Ariz.) engaged in transition planning before the \n     election was held in 2008. President George W. Bush also \n     deserves praise for making a smooth transition out of office \n     a high priority during the final months of his term. None of \n     these steps was mandated by law, and all pre-election \n     transition efforts by candidates had to be funded privately.\n       It was fortunate that, in the first transfer of power \n     between parties after 9/11, with two ongoing wars and the \n     worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, both major \n     candidates and the White House took it upon themselves to \n     ensure one of the smoothest transitions in modern history. \n     But we should not simply leave something so important to \n     fortune.\n       Sens. Ted Kaufman (D-Del.) and George Voinovich (R-Ohio) \n     have introduced the Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act. \n     This bipartisan legislation would extend to both parties' \n     nominees some of the government services (i.e., office space, \n     secure computer systems) currently provided to presidents-\n     elect for their transition planning several weeks before \n     Election Day. It also authorizes funding for sitting \n     presidents to help plan for a responsible transfer out of \n     office and recommends the Bush administration's Presidential \n     Transition Coordinating Council as a model.\n       This will go a long way toward removing the stigma of \n     presumptuousness that discourages early transition planning. \n     We now know that in 2008 the Obama and McCain campaigns were \n     poised to make a joint statement acknowledging that both were \n     engaging in pre-election transition planning as an act of \n     responsibility. However, at the last minute the issue became \n     politicized and neither campaign wanted to risk being accused \n     of ``measuring the drapes'' in the White House.\n       This political calculus is understandable but dangerous in \n     today's world. The Kaufman-Voinovich bill was written in \n     consultation with veterans of past transitions. Its \n     introduction follows on the heels of a landmark report by the \n     nonpartisan, nonprofit Partnership for Public Service as well \n     as academic articles by presidential scholars Martha Joynt \n     Kumar, Terry Sullivan and others analyzing the successes and \n     shortcomings of recent transitions. The Pre-Election \n     Presidential Transition Act would provide nominees with \n     office space, computer services and information about \n     previous transitions. It would not pay transition staff \n     salaries or provide for the hiring of outside consultants. \n     For those expenses and others not covered by the bill, it \n     would allow candidates to open transition accounts to which \n     they could raise money or transfer funds from their campaign \n     chests.\n       For those of us who have worked on presidential \n     transitions, this bipartisan effort by two outgoing Senators \n     in a non-presidential election year is long overdue. Congress \n     should take advantage of this opportunity to implement the \n     changes proposed by this bill to ensure more responsible, \n     more secure and more seamless transfers of power in the \n     future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "24", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/24/senate-section/article/S7452-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 644, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 644) designating the week of October \n     10, 2010, as ``National Wildlife Refuge Week.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a resolution I \nsubmitted today with Senators Crapo and Cardin to celebrate National \nWildlife Refuge Week and honor the extraordinary National Wildlife \nRefuge System. I am pleased that so many of my colleagues have joined \nme to cosponsor this resolution.\n  President Theodore Roosevelt established the first national wildlife \nrefuge on Florida's Pelican Island in 1903. He was a renowned \nnaturalist, an avid hunter, and is considered to be one of the greatest \nconservation leaders in American history.\n  Roosevelt was spurred to action after witnessing a dramatic decline \nin bird and animal populations across the country due to unregulated \nand unsustainable hunting. A sportsman himself, Roosevelt saw a great \nneed to conserve our nation's natural resources not only for the \nbenefit of his generation but for future generations as well.\n  President Roosevelt set out this basic principle when he said:\n\n       I recognize the right and duty of this generation to \n     develop and use the natural resources of our land. But I do \n     not recognize the right to waste them, or to rob, by wasteful \n     use, the generations that come after us.\n\n  He was a man of action. Over the course of Presidency, Roosevelt \nwould establish more than 50 Federal bird reserves which would become \nthe foundation of the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n  Today, the Refuge System has grown to more than 150 million acres, \n552 national wildlife refuges, and 38 wetland management districts. \nThese lands are truly American treasures and important parts of our \nnatural heritage.\n  The Refuge System is a magnificent network of lands and waters \ndedicated to wildlife conservation. It is exceptionally diverse, \nencompassing every kind of ecosystem in the United States, including \nforests, wetlands, deserts, grasslands, tundras, and remote islands.\n  National wildlife refuges are critical to the broad goals of wildlife \nconservation to both keep common species common and to protect and \nrestore imperiled species. Refuges do this well. They are home to an \nincredible amount of biodiversity, including over 700 species of birds, \n220 species of mammals, 250 reptile and amphibian species, and\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\nmore than 1,000 species of fish. Furthermore, of the more than 1,200 \nfederally listed threatened and endangered species in the United \nStates, 280 are found on national wildlife refuges.\n  The incredible resources available through the National Wildlife \nRefuge System offer a variety of recreational opportunities including \nhunting, fishing, wildlife watching, photography, hiking, boating, \nenvironmental education, and so much more. In fact, hunting and fishing \nis permitted on hundreds of refuges, providing opportunities for over \n2.5 million hunters and more than 7 million anglers.\n  National wildlife refuges also provide children and families a unique \nopportunity to explore and learn about wildlife and the outdoors. A \nthird of U.S. children and teens are overweight or close to it. Playing \noutside and engaging with the natural world can get our children \nactive, and studies show that it can also reduce stress, improve \nattention and cooperation, and open children's imagination and \ncreativity.\n  Refuges also afford service opportunities for local residents. Every \nyear 39,000 volunteers and over 220 refuge ``Friends'' organizations \ncontribute nearly 1.4 million hours of their time to lead educational \nprograms, guide tours, restore habitat, maintain trails, and offer \ntheir time and energy in other important ways. Their efforts are worth \nthe equivalent of 665 full-time employees.\n  National wildlife refuges are important to local businesses and \ngateway communities. Each year, refuges draw 41 million visitors, \ngenerating nearly $1.7 billion and 27,000 jobs for local economies. \nRefuges are also a good investment for the American people. For every \n$1 appropriated, refuges generate $4 in economic activity.\n  Since 1995 refuges across the country have held festivals, \neducational programs, guided tours, and other events to celebrate \nNational Wildlife Refuge Week during the second week of October. This \nyear Refuge Week will take place from October 10 to 17.\n  There is much to celebrate. For over a century, the National Wildlife \nRefuge System has served to conserve our wildlife heritage, provide \nrecreational opportunities for our communities, and support for local \neconomies. With at least one refuge located in every State and within \nan hour's drive of every metropolitan area across the Nation, we can \nall take part in National Wildlife Refuge Week.\n  In my home State of Delaware, we are fortunate to have two national \nwildlife refuges: Bombay Hook and Prime Hook. The tens of thousands of \nacres of freshwater wetlands and tidal salt marshes these refuges \nprotect are considered some of the best on the Atlantic coast and \nprovide critical habitat for waterfowl migrating between Canada and \nMexico. In fact, the American Bird Conservancy has recognized Bombay \nHook as one of America's 100 important Bird Areas.\n  Bombay Hook and Prime Hook are also incredible places to visit and \nenjoy. Bombay Hook host over 100,000 visitors a year, and the Great \nOutdoor Recreation Pages, GORP magazine recently rated the refuge as \none of the top Ten most scenic drives in the United States. \nFurthermore, studies show that visitors of Prime Hook generate over \n$1.21 million and nearly 20 jobs a year in the local Sussex County \neconomy.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues in sponsoring this resolution to \ncelebrate National Wildlife Refuge Week and honor the National Wildlife \nRefuge System.\n  As President Roosevelt once said:\n\n       It is not what we have that will make us a great Nation. It \n     is the way in which we use it.\n\n  We must continue the legacy of President Roosevelt and work to \nconserve our wildlife heritage for current and future generations.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements related to the resolution be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

refuges are cores of conservation \n     for larger landscapes and resources for other agencies of the \n     Federal Government and State governments, private landowners, \n     and organizations in their efforts to secure the wildlife \n     heritage of the United States;\n       Whereas 39,000 volunteers and more than 220 national \n     wildlife refuge ``Friends'' organizations contribute nearly \n     1,400,000 hours annually, the equivalent of 665 full-time \n     employees, and provide an important link with local \n     communities;\n       Whereas national wildlife refuges provide an important \n     opportunity for children to connect with nature and discover \n     the natural world;\n       Whereas, because there are national wildlife refuges \n     located in several urban and suburban areas and 1 refuge \n     located within an hour's drive of every metropolitan area in \n     the United States, national wildlife refuges employ, educate, \n     and engage young people from all backgrounds in exploring, \n     connecting with, and preserving the natural heritage of the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas, since 1995, refuges across the Nation have held \n     festivals, educational programs, guided tours, and other \n     events to celebrate National Wildlife Refuge Week during the \n     second full week of October;\n       Whereas the week beginning on October 10, 2010, has been \n     designated as ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'' by the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service;\n       Whereas, in 2010, the designation of National Wildlife \n     Refuge Week would recognize more than a century of \n     conservation in the United States and would serve to raise \n     awareness about the importance of wildlife and the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System and to celebrate the myriad \n     recreational opportunities available to enjoy this network of \n     protected lands: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning on October 10, 2010, as \n     ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Wildlife \n     Refuge Week;\n       (3) acknowledges the importance of national wildlife \n     refuges for their recreational opportunities and contribution \n     to local economies across the United States;\n       (4) pronounces that national wildlife refuges play a vital \n     role in securing the hunting and fishing heritage of the \n     United States for future generations;\n       (5) recognizes the importance of national wildlife refuges \n     to wildlife conservation and the protection of imperiled \n     species and ecosystems;\n       (6) applauds the work of refuge ``Friends'' groups, \n     national and community organizations, and public partners \n     that promote awareness, compatible use, protection, and \n     restoration of national wildlife refuges;\n       (7) reaffirms the support of the Senate for wildlife \n     conservation and the National Wildlife Refuge System; and\n       (8) expresses the intent of the Senate--\n       (A) to continue working to conserve wildlife; and\n       (B) to manage the National Wildlife Refuge System for \n     current and future generations.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.
