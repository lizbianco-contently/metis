Mr. President, we had a very successful week legislatively. \nI extend my appreciation to Senators on both sides of the aisle, \nespecially my friends on the Republican side. There were no 30 hours \nused. It worked out extremely well. There was ample time for debate, \nand there were issues that were of concern to both parties. Of course, \nthe issues are important to the country.\n  Without belaboring the issues on which we voted, I wish to spend just \na minute on two issues--first, the pay-go rules we passed.\n  The Presiding Officer has been a great asset to the Senate. He has \nworked with the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, and \nothers to focus on finances of our country. The Presiding Officer was a \nvery successful Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia and noted for \nwhat he did with budgetary matters in Virginia.\n  Pay-go rules are so important. We have rules now, like people have in \ntheir individual homes. We are working to do what people who work for a \nliving do, and that is spend money we have. It is not as if we are \ninventing something new. During the Clinton years, we had pay-go rules. \nAs a result of that, we were able to spend less money than we were \ntaking in. For the first time in decades, in the last 3 years of the \nClinton administration, we paid down the national debt by hundreds of \nbillions of dollars. So I hope, looking into the future, we can \ncontinue doing that; that is, do it again. It is so important.\n  I extend my appreciation to Members of the House of Representatives, \nespecially the Speaker and the majority leader, Steny Hoyer. They have \nbeen focused on this pay-go for more than a year.\n  We were finally able to get it done over here. It is going to be good \nfor the country. I think the things we did will continue to focus on \nthe money that we do not have and the way we have to get our budget in \norder. I am especially happy we were able to give the doctors 5 years' \nreprieve from the Draconian rules that were facing doctors who take \nMedicare patients.\n  The other issue I wish to spend a minute on is last evening, again \nwith the cooperation of all Senators, we\n\n[[Page S354]]\n\nwere able to pass the Iran sanctions law. It is so important. We all \nknow what that country is doing to its citizens. It is time this \ncountry of ours stepped forward and did some things to focus on what \nthey are doing; that is, what Iran is doing. The legislation we passed \nwill certainly allow this to take place.\n  We have a conference with the House. I will have a conversation later \ntoday with the chairman of the committee over there, Howard Berman, who \nhas been such a good friend of mine personally. He and I came to \nWashington together in the House of Representatives, but he has also \nbeen a great representative of our country in his chairmanship of the \nForeign Affairs Committee in the House.\n  Senator McCain had an amendment about which he is concerned. I \nappreciate his not offering it last night because it would have caused \nother amendments from this side being offered.\n  As a result of the cooperation between both sides of the aisle, we \ngot this legislation passed. We hope to get it out of conference \nquickly and have the President sign it. It is certainly what we need to \ndo. Iran is a country on which all the world is focusing. We must do \neverything we can to stop them from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/29/senate-section/article/S354-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to join Chairman \nLeahy's eloquent and inspiring remarks of yesterday and express my \nstrong disagreement with the Supreme Court's decision released last \nweek in Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission.\n  In this astonishing decision, the slimmest of 5-to-4 majorities \noverturned legal principles that have been in place since Theodore \nRoosevelt's administration. The five Justices who make up the Court's \nconservative bloc opened floodgates that had for over a century kept \nunlimited spending by corporations from drowning out the voices of the \nAmerican people. It would be hard to call this decision anything other \nthan judicial activism.\n  Let me start by reminding my colleagues of the long history of \nsuccessful and appropriate regulation of corporate influence on \nelections. Federal laws restricting corporate spending on campaigns \nhave a long pedigree. The 1907 Tillman Act restricted corporate \nspending on campaigns. Various loopholes have come and gone since, but \nthe principle embodied in that law more than 100 years ago--that \ninanimate business corporations are not free to spend unlimited dollars \nto influence our campaigns for office--was an established cornerstone \nof our political system. Monied interests have long desired to wield \nspecial influence, but the integrity of our political system always has \nhad champions--from Teddy Roosevelt a century ago to Senators McCain \nand Feingold in our time, who won a bruising legislative battle with \ntheir 2002 bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act.\n  Last week, that activist element of the Supreme Court struck down key \nprotections of our elections integrity, overturned the will of Congress \nand the American people, and allowed all corporations to spend without \nlimit in order to elect and defeat candidates and influence policy to \nmeet their political ends. The consequences may well be nightmarish. As \nour colleague, Senator Schumer said, one thing is clear: The \nconservative bloc of the Supreme Court has predetermined the outcome of \nthe next election; the winners will be the corporations.\n  As my home State paper, the Providence Journal, explained:\n\n       The ruling will mean that, more than ever, big-spending \n     economic interests will determine who gets elected. More \n     money will especially pour into relentless attack campaigns. \n     Free speech for most individuals will suffer because their \n     voices will count for even less than they do now. They will \n     simply be drowned out by the big money. The bulk of the cash \n     will come from corporations, which have much more money \n     available to spend than unions. Candidates will be even more \n     unlikely to take on big interests than they are now.\n\n  What could make a big interest more happy than that? The details of \nthis case were quite simple. Citizens United is an advocacy \norganization that accepts corporate funding. It sought to broadcast on \non-demand cable a lengthy negative documentary attacking our former \ncolleague, now-Secretary of State Clinton, who was then a candidate for \nPresident. The law prohibited the broadcast of this kind of corporate-\nfunded electioneering on the eve of an election. Citizens United filed \nsuit, arguing that this prohibition violated the first amendment. The \nconservative Justices agreed, holding that all corporations have a \nconstitutional right to use their general treasury funds, their \nshareholder funds, to pay for advertisements for or against candidates \nin elections.\n  Although the decision was cast as being about the rights of \nindividuals to hear more corporate speech, its effect will be with \ncorporations--big oil, pharmaceutical companies, debt collection \nagencies, health insurance companies, credit card companies and banks, \ntobacco companies--now all moving without restriction into the American \nelection process.\n  To highlight the radical nature of this decision, let me put this in \nthe context of true principles of judicial conservatism. Justice \nStevens explained in his dissent that the principle of stare decisis--\n``it stands decided''--assures that our Nation's ``bedrock principles \nare founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of \nindividuals.''\n  It is jarring that the unrestrained activism of the conservative bloc \non the Supreme Court led them to pay so little heed to longstanding \njudicial precedents, brushing them aside with almost no hesitation. \nJustice Stevens noted that ``the only relevant thing that has changed \n[since those prior precedents] . . . is the composition of this \nCourt.''\n  Is it truly just a coincidence that this same bloc of Judges just \nlast year invented a new individual constitutional right to bear arms \nthat no previous Supreme Court had noticed for more than 200 years or \nis something else going on here where core Republican political goals \nare involved? Is stare decisis now out the window, at least with the \nRepublican activist judges?\n  Another supposed conservative principle thrown aside by these \nactivists was the approach to constitutional interpretation that \nfocuses on the original intent of the Founders. Read the opinions. By \nfar, the most convincing discussion of that original intent appears in \nJustice Stevens' dissent, not in the majority opinion or in Justice \nScalia's concurrence. Justice Stevens, in dissent, correctly explains \nthat the Founding Fathers had a dim view of corporations. They were \nsuspicious of them. They considered them prone to abuse and scandal, \nand that those corporations that did exist at the time of the founding \nwere largely creatures of the State that did not resemble contemporary \ncorporations. Justice Stevens rightly describes it as:\n\n       . . . implausible that the Framers believed ``the freedom \n     of speech'' would extend equally to all corporate speakers, \n     much less that it would preclude legislatures from taking \n     limited measures to guard against corporate capture of \n     elections.\n\n  This lack of historical awareness is, as I will explain, not the only \nflaw of the majority opinion. Only the dissent points out the most \nbasic point:\n\n       . . . that corporations are different from human beings . . \n     . corporations have no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, \n     no thoughts, no desires.\n\n  I would add they have no souls. The dissent explains:\n\n       Corporations help structure and facilitate the activities \n     of human beings, to be sure, and their ``personhood'' often \n     serves as a useful legal fiction. But they are not themselves \n     members of ``We the People'' by whom and for whom our \n     Constitution was established.\n\n  The majority just bypasses this elemental point.\n\n[[Page S355]]\n\n  One bedrock principle in our democracy is that the will of the people \nshould be supreme except in very limited circumstances. In the judicial \ncontext this means that courts should hesitate before striking down \nstatutes enacted by Congress. But it seems that is not so when core \ntenets of the Republican platform are involved.\n  It is not just this one case. There is a pattern that is discernible \nwhen these five men get together to strike down laws of Congress they \ndo not like and make new law more to their liking. The pattern is not \njust discernible, it is unmistakable. It is undeniable. It appears, \nindeed, to be without exception.\n  Look at the evidence: There is virtually perfect concordance between \nthe major departures by the activist bloc from conservative judicial \ntenets--such as judicial restraint, original intent, States rights--and \nthe result in those cases of achieving current Republican political \ngoals. One could probably call this practice ``situational judicial \nrestraint.'' A rational person could conclude, based on the evidence of \nthe Court's behavior, the observable results that this and other \ndecisions by the five-man conservative bloc would more properly be \ncharacterized as political prize-taking than judicial lawmaking.\n  The only unchecked power in the American political system is that of \na majority of a court of final appeal. When a small group can seize \nmajority power in a court of final appeal, they answer to no one and \ncan rule as they please. That danger is why courts are ordinarily so \ncareful to answer to rules of judicial practice, respect for precedent, \nanswering the narrowest question, and engaging in honorable, neutral, \nand logical analysis to arrive at decisions. That is why this \nconservative majority's departure from these rules of judicial practice \nand the association between these departures and outcomes favorable to \ntheir political party is so unpleasant.\n  The steady march of the activist rightwing bloc to establish its \nconservative political priorities as the law of the land should come to \nobservers as no surprise. It represents the fruit of a longstanding and \noften very public effort to turn the law and the Constitution over to \nspecial interest groups and conservative activists. Conservative \ninstitutions, such as the Federalist Society, were created to groom and \nvet the ideological purity of foot soldiers in the conservative \nmovement. Consider legal historian Steven Teles on the role of the \nFederalist Society in the Reagan administration:\n\n       Society membership was a valuable signal for an \n     administration eager to hire true-believers for bureaucratic \n     hand-to-hand combat. In addition, by hiring this Society's \n     entire founding cadre, the Reagan administration and its \n     judicial appointees sent a very powerful message that the \n     terms of advancement associated with political ambition were \n     being set on their head: clear ideological positioning, not \n     cautiousness, was now an affirmative qualification for \n     appointed office.\n\n  The results of this meld of political ambition, ideological \npositioning, and judicial appointees have been terrible. Fringe \nconservative ideas, such as hostility to our Nation's civil rights, \nenvironmental protection, and consumer protection laws, have been \nsteadily dripped into the legal mainstream by endless repetition in a \nrightwing echo chamber. The mainstream of American law has been shifted \nsteadily to the right by force of this effort, backed by seemingly \nendless corporate funds. This ``rights movement'' for corporations, for \nthe rich, the powerful, and the fortunate, has been pursued in a \nmanner--deliberate infiltration of the judicial branch of government--\nthat should concern anybody who respects the law and, in particular, \nrespects our Supreme Court.\n  The Republican effort to capture that institution for those interests \nhas been a remarkably aggressive and surprisingly explicit effort. \nUsually, political efforts to capture great public institutions come, \nas it were, in sheep's clothing. But this wolf came as a wolf. Consider \nfor example the official Republican Party platform of 2000, which \n``applauded Governor Bush's pledge to name only judges who have \ndemonstrated that they share his conservative beliefs and respect the \nConstitution.'' All that was left out was that they should be willing \nto bend the law and overturn precedents to impose those beliefs.\n  The pattern is not complicated. America's big corporate interests \nfund Republican candidates for office, and those corporate interests \nwant those Republicans to help them. That is as old as politics. \nRepublicans, once elected, make it a priority to appoint judges who \nwant to help them--judges who may give obligatory lip service opposing \njudicial activism but will actually deliver on core Republican \npolitical interests; the conservative bloc of judges overrules \nprecedent and 100 years of practice to open the doors to unlimited \ncorporate political spending; and corporations can now give ever more \nmoney into the process of electing more Republicans. Connect the dots: \nThe Republicans are the party of the corporations; the judges are the \nappointees of the Republicans; and the judges just delivered for the \ncorporations. It is being done in plain view.\n\n  The Washington Post recently explained:\n\n       ``The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is now free to spend \n     unlimited amounts of money on advertisements explicitly \n     attacking candidates.''\n\n  The Chamber of Commerce already had announced in November ``a massive \neffort to support pro-business candidates.'' So the response from the \nRepublicans, as reported by the Washington Post, should come as no \nsurprise:\n\n       Republican leaders cheered the ruling as a victory for free \n     speech and predicted a surge in corporate support for GOP \n     candidates in November's midterm election.\n\n  Now that the Court has taken the fateful step of forbidding any \nlimits on corporation spending to limit campaigns, we can expect to see \ncorporate polluters under investigation by the Department of Justice \nrunning unlimited ads for a more sympathetic Presidential candidate; \nfinancial services companies spending their vast wealth to defeat \nMembers of Congress who are tired of the way business is done on Wall \nStreet; and defense contractors overwhelming candidates who might dare \nquestion a weapons program that they build.\n  The Court was so eager to give artificial corporations the same \nrights as natural living human beings that it virtually overlooked \nforeign corporations. The activist Republican majority leaves wide open \nthe possibility of constitutionally protected rights to influence \nAmerican elections being held by a Saudi oil company interested in \nAmerican energy policy, a Third World clothing manufacturer opposed to \nAmerican labor standards, or a foreign farm conglomerate concerned \nabout America's food safety rules. Is the five-man conservative bloc's \nfealty to corporate power so absolute that they could not bring \nthemselves to say that the first amendment doesn't protect foreign \ncompanies wishing to drown out the voices of American citizens?\n  Our government is of the people, by the people, and for the people. \nBy refusing to distinguish between people and corporations, the \nCitizens United opinion undermines the integrity of our democracy, \nallowing unlimited corporate money to drown out ordinary citizens' \nvoices. So look out for government of the CEOs, by the CEOs, and for \nthe CEOs, who now have special privileged status: Not only may CEOs use \ntheir personal wealth to influence elections, they now get the added \nmegaphone--not available to regular citizens--of being able to direct \nunlimited corporate funds to influence elections. CEOs now have twice \nthe voice or more of everyday Americans.\n  I won't belabor the record here, because it is something of a \ntechnical matter, but before I conclude I have to say from the point of \nview of judicial practice, the majority opinion is disturbing in \nseveral ways: First, it uses rhetorical devices that are more \nconsistent with polemic than judicial determination--vastly overstating \nthe opponents' arguments, using false analysis, knocking over a straw \nman, indulging in selective quotation and unsupported fact finding.\n  One example: This is what the conservative bloc found as a fact. And \nremember, fact finding is not the proper province of an appellate court \nin the first place, but here is what they found regarding elections:\n\n       We now conclude that independent expenditures, including \n     those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or \n     the appearance of corruption.\n\n  They just decreed that. So a company comes in, drops a couple of a \nmillion dollars in a smear campaign\n\n[[Page S356]]\n\nagainst an opponent at the bitter end of a race, when it can't be \nanswered, and the next thing you know the person they defended against \nthe opponent is in their pocket. No appearance of corruption? Well, the \nSupreme Court has decided it: No appearance of corruption. That is \nclear to them.\n  Here is another finding of fact by this bloc of judges:\n\n       The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will \n     not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.\n\n  They made that up out of whole cloth. There are hundreds of thousands \nof pages of findings to the contrary in the record of previous Supreme \nCourt decisions they overruled. But, no, they made these unsupported \nfindings.\n  It is novel, it is naive, and it contrasts with the actual findings \nof this Senate 100 years ago, which said the following:\n\n       The evils of the use of [corporate] money in connection \n     with political elections are so generally recognized that the \n     committee deems it unnecessary to make any argument in favor \n     of the general purpose of this measure. It is in the interest \n     of good government and calculated to promote purity in the \n     selection of public officials.\n\n  The evils of the use of corporate money in connection with political \nelections was so generally recognized 100 years ago that the Senate \ncommittee working on that legislation deemed it unnecessary to make any \nargument in favor of the measure--it was too obvious. Yet now this \nappellate tribunal has made fact findings that that is all wrong.\n  Moreover, a small band of conservative Justices departs from regular \njudicial practice by relying for precedent on its own members' previous \nconcurring and dissenting opinions, as if they were their own little \ncourt, building a scaffold of arguments alongside the law, in wait for \nthe right case with a sufficient majority to abandon the law and jump \nto their scaffold of argument. As Justice Stevens accurately pointed \nout, the majority opinion of the right wing bloc is essentially an \n``amalgamation of resuscitated dissents.''\n  Finally, and most disturbingly, the Chief Justice evaluates precedent \nin terms of whether his five-member bloc objects to it. He is \nsurprisingly outright about this. He said this: ``Stare decisis,'' the \nprinciple that a settled question is settled, that it stands decided--\n``stare decisis effect is . . . diminished when the precedent's \nvalidity is so hotly contested that it cannot reliably function as a \nbasis for decision in future cases.''\n  He later continues: ``The simple fact that one of our decisions \nremains controversial . . . does undermine the precedent's ability to \ncontribute to the stable and orderly development of the law.''\n  As anybody looking at this can see, it is a completely self-\nfulfilling theory, and it allows the five-man right wing bloc on the \nCourt to gradually undermine settled precedent, to tunnel under it with \nquarreling objections, hotly contesting it, perhaps even to accelerate \nthe process of undermining it; then, at some point, decree that the \nsettled precedent is no longer valid because they have quarreled with \nit. Now it must fall.\n  There can be little doubt that the conservative bloc is laying the \nfoundation for future right wing activism in a seemingly deliberate and \nconcerted effort to expand its political philosophy into our law. Of \ncourse, always the dramatic changes observably fall in the direction of \nthe Republican Party's current political doctrine and interests.\n  I will close by quoting Justice Stevens, who I think puts the \nfundamental issue of the Citizens United majority opinion in clear \nrelief. ``At bottom,'' he says:\n\n       . . . the court's opinion . . . is a rejection of the \n     common sense of the American people, who have recognized a \n     need to prevent corporations from undermining self-government \n     since the founding, and who have fought against the \n     distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering \n     since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a strange time to \n     repudiate that common sense. While American democracy is \n     imperfect--\n\n  Justice Stevens concludes--\n\n     few outside the majority of the Court would have thought that \n     its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/29/senate-section/article/S356-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Honest Leadership and Open Government \nAct of 2007 calls for the Select Committee on Ethics of the U.S. Senate \nto issue an annual report not later than January 31 of each year \nproviding information in certain categories describing its activities \nfor the preceding year. Reported below is the information describing \nthe committee's activities in 2009 in the categories set forth in the \nact:\n\n       (1) The number of alleged violations of Senate rules \n     received from any source, including the number raised by a \n     Senator or staff of the Committee: 99. (In addition, 26 \n     alleged violations from the previous year were carried into \n     2009.)\n       (2) The number of alleged violations that were dismissed--\n       (A) For lack of subject matter jurisdiction or in which, \n     even if the allegations in the complaint are true, no \n     violation of Senate rules would exist: 58. (This figure \n     includes 12 matters that were carried into 2009.)\n       (B) Because they failed to provide sufficient facts as to \n     any material violation of the Senate rules beyond mere \n     allegation or assertion: 45. (This figure includes 5 matters \n     that were carried into 2009.)\n       (3) The number of alleged violations for which the \n     Committee staff conducted a preliminary inquiry: 13. (This \n     figure includes 8 matters from the previous year carried into \n     2009.)\n       (4) The number of alleged violations for which the \n     Committee staff conducted a preliminary inquiry that resulted \n     in an adjudicatory review: 0.\n       (5) The number of alleged violations for which the \n     Committee staff conducted a preliminary inquiry and the \n     Committee dismissed the matter for lack of substantial merit: \n     8. (This figure includes matters in which the Committee \n     subsequently lost jurisdiction. It also includes two letters \n     of public dismissal.)\n       (6) The number of alleged violations for which the \n     Committee staff conducted a preliminary inquiry and the \n     Committee issued private or public letters of admonition: 1.\n       (7) The number of matters resulting in a disciplinary \n     sanction: 0.\n       (8) Any other information deemed by the Committee to be \n     appropriate to describe its activities in the previous year:\n       In 2009, the Committee staff conducted 10 Member code of \n     conduct training sessions and 5 new Member sessions; 19 \n     employee code of conduct training sessions; 12 Member and \n     committee office campaign briefings; 27 ethics seminars for \n     Member DC offices, state offices, and Senate committees; 3 \n     private sector ethics briefings; and 7 international ethics \n     briefings.\n       In 2009, the Committee staff handled 12,667 telephone \n     inquiries for ethics advice and guidance.\n       In 2009, the Committee wrote 996 ethics advisory letters \n     and responses including, but not limited to, 752 travel and \n     gifts matters (Senate Rule 35) and 111 conflict of interest \n     matters (Senate Rule 37).\n       In 2009, the Committee issued 3,309 letters concerning \n     financial disclosure filings by Senators, Senate staff and \n     Senate candidates and reviewed 1,663 reports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/29/senate-section/article/S356-2", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S356-S357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DENYING AL-QAIDA SAFE HAVENS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the attempt to blow up a U.S. airliner \non Christmas Day has shined a spotlight squarely, if belatedly, on \nYemen. I cannot overstate the importance of denying al-Qaida safe \nhavens in Yemen and countries like it, an issue on which I have been \nworking for years. The threat from al-Qaida in Yemen, as well as the \nbroader region, is increasing, and our attention to this part of the \nworld is long overdue.\n  That is why I welcome the President's increased focus on Yemen. But \nwe need to remember, as we focus needed resources and attention on \nYemen, that it shouldn't be seen as the new Afghanistan, or the new \nIraq. Instead, Yemen highlights the importance of a comprehensive, \nglobal counterterrorism strategy that takes into account security \nsector reform, human rights, economic development, transparency, good \ngovernance, accountability, and the rule of law.\n  We must seize the opportunity to focus attention on the strategy and \npolicies we need to deny al-Qaida safe havens around the world, \nincluding in Yemen. Concurrently, we need to examine our policy in \nYemen and better understand how we can develop a partnership that is \nboth in our national security interest and helps Yemen to move towards \nbecoming a more stable, secure nation for its people. The recognition \nat the recent high-level international meeting on Yemen in London of \nthe importance of addressing broader economic, social and political \nfactors in Yemen is thus very welcome.\n  Any serious effort against al-Qaida in Yemen will require \nstrengthening the\n\n[[Page S357]]\n\nweak capacity of the government as well as its legitimacy in the eyes \nof its citizens. We need to be careful about providing assistance to a \ngovernment that isn't always aligned with the needs of the Yemeni \npeople, as last year's State Department report on human rights notes. I \nam pleased to be an original cosponsor with Senators Kerry and \nFeinstein of a resolution that urges the implementation of a \ncomprehensive strategy to address instability in Yemen that also calls \non the Yemeni government to strengthen efforts to address corruption, \nto respect human rights and to work with its citizens and the \ninternational community to address the factors driving instability in \nthe country.\n  Yemen is a fragile state whose government has limited control in many \nparts of the country. It faces a multitude of challenges including \npoverty, a young and growing population, resource scarcities, and \ncorruption. It is also distracted from the counterterrorism effort by \ntwo other sources of domestic instability--the al-Houthi rebellion in \nthe North and tensions with a southern region with which Sana'a was \nunited less than 20 years ago. In other words, counterterrorism is \nhampered by weak governance and by internal conflicts that would not \nappear on the surface to threaten our interests. With this in mind, we \nmust also work to ensure that, in the provision and use of our \ncounterterrorism assistance to Yemen, care is taken to protect \ncivilians and prevent the alienation of the local population and \nattention is given to the local conditions that enable militants to \nrecruit followers.\n  Instability in Yemen is, of course, also closely linked to conflict \nin the Horn of Africa. Last year, Somali pirates attacked a U.S. \nvessel, which briefly raised awareness of maritime insecurity fostered \nby a lack of effective governance and insufficient naval capacity on \nboth sides of the Gulf of Aden. This problem continues, even when it is \nnot on the front pages, and is both a symptom and a driver of overall \ninstability in the region. Meanwhile, refugees from the conflict in \nSomalia, as well as from the broader region, are fleeing to Yemen. \nAccording to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for \nHuman Rights, more than 70,000 Somalis and Ethiopians arrived on \nYemen's shores in 2009--a dramatic increase from previous years. The \nhuman cost to this exodus, as well as the potentially destabilizing \neffects, demand our attention.\n  Congress and the executive branch need to work together to ensure \nthat the weak states, chronic instability, vast ungoverned areas, and \nunresolved local tensions that have created safe havens in which \nterrorists can recruit and operate do not get short shrift in our \ncounterterrorism efforts. We cannot continue to jump from one perceived \n``central front in the war on terror'' to the next. Local conditions in \nplaces like Yemen--as well as Somalia, north Africa and elsewhere--will \ncontinue to enable al-Qaida affiliates and sympathizers to recruit new \nfollowers. As a result, although we should aggressively pursue al-Qaida \nleaders, and our efforts to track individual operatives are critical, \nwe will not ultimately be successful if we treat counterterrorism \nmerely as a manhunt with a finite number of al-Qaida members. I am \npleased to see that Ambassador Daniel Benjamin has underscored the \nimportance of our counterterrorism efforts addressing conditions that \nfacilitate recruitment to terrorism and extremism. I hope this \nunderstanding is shared throughout our government agencies and in the \nimplementation process.\n  To effectively fight the threat from al-Qaida and its affiliates in \nYemen and elsewhere, we also need to change the way our government is \nstructured and how it operates.\n  In this regard, we need better intelligence. For example, we need to \nimprove the intelligence that relates directly to al-Qaida affiliates--\nwhere they find safe haven and why and the local conflicts and other \nconditions that create a fertile ground for terrorist recruitment. And \nwe need to pay attention to all relevant information--including the \ninformation that the State Department and others in the Federal \nGovernment openly collect. Conditions around the world that allow al-\nQaida to operate are often apparent to our diplomats, and do not \nnecessarily require clandestine collection. The information diplomats \nand others collect therefore should be fully integrated with the \nintelligence community.\n  That is why I have proposed and the Senate has approved a bipartisan \ncommission to provide recommendations to the President and to the \nCongress on how to integrate and otherwise reform our existing national \nsecurity institutions. Unless we reform how our government collects, \nreports and analyzes information from around the world, we will remain \na step behind al-Qaida's global network.\n  We also need better access to important countries and regions. When \nour diplomats aren't present, not only will we never truly understand \nwhat is going on, but we also won't be able to build relationships with \nthe local population. In some cases, we can and should establish new \nembassy posts, such as in northern Nigeria. In other cases, such as \nYemen, where security concerns present obstacles, we should develop \npolicies that focus on helping to reestablish security, for the sake of \nthe local populations as well as for our own interests.\n  In addition, as Yemen makes clear, we need strong, sustained policies \naimed directly at resolving conflicts that allow al-Qaida affiliates to \noperate and recruit. These policies must be sophisticated and informed. \nWe have suffered from a tendency to view the world in terms of \nextremists versus moderates, good guys versus bad guys. These are \nblinders that prevent us from understanding, on their own terms, \ncomplex conflicts such as the ones in Yemen that undermine broader \ncounterterrorism goals. This approach has led us to prioritize tactical \ncounterterrorism over long-term strategies. And it has contributed to \nthe misperception that regional conflicts, which are often the breeding \ngrounds for al-Qaida affiliates, are obscure and unimportant and can be \nrelegated to small State Department teams with few resources and \nlimited influence outside the Department. We must change this dangerous \npattern, which is why my resolution with Senators Kerry and Feinstein \nurges a comprehensive policy toward Yemen, approved at the highest \nlevels and agreed upon by the entirety of the U.S. Government.\n  We have an opportunity to take a smarter approach. By recognizing al-\nQaida as a global network that takes advantage of local conditions, \ninstead of a monolithic threat, we can get ahead of the curve and \nidentify threats before the next attack.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/29/senate-section/article/S357-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S357-S358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            65TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LIBERATION OF AUSCHWITZ\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, on January 27, 1945, the Nazi \nconcentration camp at Auschwitz, including Birkenau and other related \ncamps near the Polish city of Oswiecim, was liberated by the Soviet \nArmy. This week, people have gathered at Auschwitz and in many other \nplaces to mark the 65th anniversary of that event. I am pleased that \nPresident Obama presented a video address in which he underscored--\nusing Elie Wiesel's words--the sacred duty of memory.\n  Auschwitz-Birkenau was the principal and most notorious of the six \ndeath camps built by Nazi Germany to achieve its goal of the mass \nextermination of the Jewish people of Europe. Built in Nazi-occupied \nPoland initially as a concentration camp for Poles and later for Soviet \nprisoners of war, it soon became a prison for a number of other \nnationalities.\n  Ultimately, a minimum 1,300,000 people were deported to Auschwitz \nbetween 1940 and 1945, and of these, at least 1,100,000 were murdered \nat that camp. An estimated 6 million Jews--more than 60 percent of the \npre-World War II Jewish population of Europe--were murdered by the \nNazis and their collaborators at Auschwitz and elsewhere in Europe. In \naddition, hundreds of thousands of civilians of Polish, Roma, and other \nnationalities, including in particular disabled individuals, \nhomosexuals, political, intellectual, labor, and religious leaders, all \nof whom the Nazis considered `undesirable,' as well as Soviet and other \nprisoners of war, perished at Auschwitz.\n  On that day of liberation, 65 years ago, only 7,000 camp prisoners \nwho had passed through the infamous Auschwitz gates, the ones who \npromised\n\n[[Page S358]]\n\n``Arbeit Macht Frei''--``Work Will Make You Free''--managed to survive \nthe selections, torture, starvation, disease, inhuman medical \nexperiments, and executions that occurred at Auschwitz.\n  According to a new survey published this week by the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, at least 41 of the OSCE's 56 \nparticipating states commemorate the Holocaust with official events. \nThirty-three participating states have established official memorial \ndays for Holocaust victims, and January 27 is the official Holocaust \nMemorial Day in many European countries, including Denmark, Estonia, \nGermany, Greece, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. I am deeply \ngratified that since 2005, the United Nations has also observed January \n27 as a day of remembrance for the victims of the Holocaust. In fact, \nAuschwitz-Birkenau was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in \n1979.\n  I personally visited Auschwitz in 2004 and cannot overstate the \nimportance of the Memorial Museum there today in the effort to teach \nfuture generations about the Holocaust. The recent theft of the \n``Arbeit-Macht-Frei'' sign--which, fortunately, was recovered--has \ncertainly heightened awareness of the need for additional security \nmeasures there, and I support the efforts to secure increased funding \nfor the preservation of the Memorial Museum.\n  Teaching about the Holocaust is an obligation that must be met not \nonly at Auschwitz, but at places where people learn around the globe. \nAs chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I \nam deeply concerned by the rise of anti-Semitism and violent extremism \nin some OSCE participating states. In particular, I am deeply troubled \nby the continued prevalence of Nazi-era discourse to describe Roma. As \nThommas Hammarberg, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human \nRights, has said:\n\n       Even after . . . the Nazi killing of at least half a \n     million Roma, probably 700,000 or more, there was no genuine \n     change of attitude among the majority population towards the \n     Roma.\n\n  With this concern in mind, I was pleased to learn that the United \nNations invited the OSCE senior advisor for Romani issues, Andrzej \nMirga, to participate in the commemoration they organized this year. \nSadly, as Mr. Mirga observed, although approximately 23,000 Romani \npeople were sent to Auschwitz, none were among the survivors liberated \nthere 65 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/29/senate-section/article/S358-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. WEBB (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n       S. 2970.

Mr. President, a number of things of importance have\n\n[[Page S360]]\n\nhappened with regard to our financial condition over a period of years. \nActually, this week the President, in his State of the Union Address, \nmade some reference to the seriousness of our financial condition. I \nthink his comments were far too weak, and he insufficiently advised the \nAmerican people of how serious our condition is.\n  Yesterday, in the Budget Committee, Mr. Elmendorf, who is the CBO \nDirector selected by our Democratic majority in the Congress and whom I \nthink tries his best to do the right thing day after day and give us \nthe right numbers to make our plans upon, told us a lot of things that \nwere very troubling. He was just repeating that the dire predictions \nand dire assessments they have made previously, which are, if anything, \non track and getting worse. They haven't misjudged the numbers and how \nbad our debt is increasing, but, in fact, if anything, they may have \nunderestimated them.\n  I will just quote one thing in his statement to us yesterday. He \ntalked about analyzing the American debt or how much money we owe as a \npercentage of the size of our economy--as a percentage of GDP, gross \ndomestic product. That is one way economists like to look at it. He \npointed out that the numbers might look a little better, but there are \na number of things that are on the table that are likely to occur. I \nthink he is exactly correct about that; if those things occur then the \nsituation realistically is even worse. He analyzed if the tax cuts were \nmade permanent and if the alternative minimum tax is indexed for \ninflation. The President proposed to make some of the tax cuts \npermanent, and Members of Congress are reluctant to see taxes increase \nsubstantially, which will occur if the tax cuts aren't extended but are \nallowed to expire. Each year we address the alternative minimum tax \nbecause it is falling ferociously on middle-income Americans, and \ndisproportionately on families with children. Every year, we indexed it \nand fixed it so it doesn't impact so many people, but for 1 year only. \nBut when the CBO tries to predict the budget deficit, they have been \nassuming that the AMT would go back to its high rate, and we would have \nmore income coming in because we are taking these increased taxes from \nAmerican families.\n  However, instead of fixing it permanently, which would score a loss \nof revenue over 10 years, we only fix it 1 year, and the CBO has to \nassume based on what the law is that it would not be fixed again and \nthat these taxes will be imposed on Middle America and we will have \nmore revenue and make the budget numbers look better. But I don't think \nwe are going to not fix AMT. Frankly, we may not be able to 100 percent \nfix it, in my view, but that is what the votes have been each year, to \nfix it 100 percent.\n  He notes that if annual appropriations keep up with the increasing \ngross domestic product, as they have over the last 20 years, which is \nabout where increases in spending has fallen, the deficit in 2020 would \nbe historically large as a percentage of GDP, and the annual deficit \nwould be large as a percentage of GDP. Then he said:\n\n       The debt held by the public would equal nearly 100 percent \n     of GDP. This is a level of debt that most economists say has \n     the ability to create instability and a lack of confidence in \n     the United States Government and it would have adverse \n     economic ramifications throughout our economy. In other \n     words, once the Nation reaches this high of a level of debt, \n     we have a very serious problem, and it is very difficult to \n     extract yourself from the cliff with those kinds of huge \n     deficits.\n\n  I think the President should have talked about that in real detail. \nHe did say on the discretionary accounts, which amount to about 18 \npercent of our budget, he would like to have a freeze, and he made some \nexceptions and said that freeze wouldn't be this year, though. Instead, \nit would be next year because that is the way things work, and I wish \nto talk about that for a minute. I think our Congress needs to be more \nserious about it, and the President needs to be more serious about it.\n  Senator McCaskill, my Democratic colleague, and I offered an \namendment yesterday that was voted on, and I think 17 Democrats joined \nwith all but one Republican to vote for it, and it would have helped. \nIt would have said the budget we passed--which I will explain to my \ncolleagues how we violate it--the budget we passed that allows the 1 \npercent to 2 percent increase in discretionary spending accounts would \nbe enforced. In other words, there would be a cap on our spending. So \nwe put in this amendment that we offered the actual dollar amounts in \nthe budget we passed last year--or basically the Democrats passed last \nyear--and we wouldn't go above that. It would take a two-thirds vote to \ngo above those top line numbers. That would work. This was done in 1990 \nand in 1997. They had statutory caps, not just budget caps, and those \nstatutory caps led to a consistent reduction in annual deficits to the \npoint that by the late 1990s we were in surplus for 4 years from 1998 \nthrough 2001. We had surpluses for the first time in decades. Then we \nallowed the statutory caps to expire and we got back on this spending \ntrack that has put us in this deficit situation that exceeds anything \nwe have ever done before in the history of the American Republic; \nnothing close to it, except World War II.\n  But when the war ended, we promptly got back on the right track and \nbrought the economy back into sound shape. I don't see us heading in \nthat direction. It is going to take bold leadership.\n  We received 56 votes to put these statutory caps in, but it took 60, \nso it is not the law. I am disappointed about that. If you want to know \nthe truth, I think the leadership in the Senate didn't mind how many \nvoted for it, as long as it wasn't 60, because it crimps their style.\n  The President, during his State of the Union Address, made some \nconfusing statements about his commitment and the depth of it to \ndealing with the problem. He gave some lipservice to the freeze, which \nI think I am going to support, and I will back him on that all I can. I \nhope he can do that. However, there were other things that were \ncontrary to a freeze. For example, he said we were going to take money \nfrom the Wall Street bailout, the TARP money as we call it, and he \nsaid:\n\n       I am proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall \n     Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks \n     give small businesses the credit they need.\n\n  Well, that sounds OK, except that is $30 billion more. Well, we took \nit from the TARP money that they paid back, so that doesn't count. That \ndoesn't count? It does count.\n  At the budget hearing yesterday, Senator Gregg, the ranking \nRepublican and former chairman of the Budget Committee, who is an \nexpert on this and very respected, asked this question of Mr. \nElmendorf.\n  The budget Chairman:\n\n       There has been a lot of talk about the fact that the TARP \n     money is available to spend somewhere else. First, the law \n     doesn't allow that.\n\n  Parenthetically, I would note that Senator Gregg put in the language. \nHe foresaw that when the banks paid back the money they were given as \npart of this financial bailout, it shouldn't be used as a slush fund to \nspend. He wrote it in there. So he said:\n\n       First, the law doesn't allow that. It is supposed to reduce \n     the debt. But I want to clarify the fact that there is no \n     TARP money. All of this money has to be borrowed, right? \n     Every cent of the TARP money is borrowed from China or \n     somebody else, right?\n\n  Mr. Elmendorf answered:\n\n       There is just one pool of government money and everything \n     else is sort of accounting treatments to keep track of \n     various purposes. But, yes, if more is spent through the \n     TARP, that is just more that's spent and more that's \n     borrowed, and more that goes to the Federal debt.\n\n  So there is no free money in the TARP repayments. We borrowed the \nmoney, every penny of it, to give to those banks. When they pay it \nback, we have a debt to pay down.\n  That is what we were supposed to do. That is what Senator Gregg put \nin the bill. Now they claim they have some free money paid back by the \nbanks, and we can just spend it. That is what the President said, and \nit is not accurate. That is wrong, and it doesn't prove to me that he \nunderstands he has to fight every day over every billion dollars to \ncontain the natural tendency of this body to spend.\n  Mr. President, I point out that even though the President talked \nabout a freeze, he talked about $30 billion for banks, not big banks, \nbut this free money he apparently suggests has now appeared as a result \nof the repayment of the loans they got in the financial bailout. Some \nof the banks didn't even\n\n[[Page S361]]\n\nwant the loans. They forced them to take it, basically. Some have been \ntold they should not pay it back. They don't want them to pay it back, \nwhen the banks are ready to pay it back. At any rate, some of that is \npaid back. We borrowed the money to give it to them. When it is paid \nback, it is not extra, free money. We always assumed that most of this \nmoney would eventually be paid back.\n  I point out as to how big a need it is to spend $30 billion out of \nthis money for community banks instead of big banks, to give small \nbusinesses credit. Well, what did the community banks say? They don't \nwant the TARP.\n  According to the Christian Science Monitor yesterday, the headline \nis: ``Community Bankers to Obama on TARP: Thanks, But No Thanks.'' \nCommunity bankers say they have plenty of money now. That isn't the \nproblem with loaning money. It says:\n\n       ``The whole TARP program is perceived as a misadventure by \n     the public,'' says Dennis Jacobe, chief economist for Gallup, \n     Inc. in Washington. ``I think it is greatly disliked.''\n\n  Now we are getting the money back from the big banks, and now the \nother bankers said they don't need it. Also, as we talk about money, \nthe President is proposing a second stimulus package. The first one \npassed was scored at $787 billion, the largest expenditure in the \nhistory of the American Republic--a breathtaking amount of money, so \nlarge that most people have not been able, in any realistic way, to \napprehend how large it is. I just point out that the State of Alabama, \none-fiftieth of the Nation, an average-size State with over 4 million \npeople--our budget, the general fund, is about $2 billion.\n  Senator Warner was Governor of Virginia and did a fabulous job and \nwas well respected for his work. I am sure they didn't have a $100 \nbillion budget. I don't know what it was, but it is a lot less than \nthat.\n  We spent over $700 billion on one vote on one day, out the door, and \nevery penny of it was borrowed because we were already in debt. So if \nyou spend more money, you have to borrow it. However, now it is not \n$787 billion. Based on some of the entitlement language we put into the \nbill, it is now at $862 billion. Some people said they would not vote \nfor a bill over $800 billion, so they got it under. In truth, \nsurreptitiously, they put in guaranteed benefits for certain programs, \nand those have now claimed the money, and it is over $800 billion. I \nthink it is $862 billion. That is a pretty big overrun--$75 billion. \nJust like that. We didn't vote on it really.\n  Now we have stimulus II. This is what the President said:\n\n       Now the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of \n     these steps [referring to clean energy and high-speed rail]. \n     As the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate \n     to do the same. . . .\n\n  I thought we had a freeze on spending. Let me tell you what the \nHouse's so-called jobs bill does. It costs $150 billion. Spending. \nAnother $150 billion in spending, with $28 billion for highways, and \nabout $2.5 billion for railroads, and $2 billion for clean energy.\n  Well, if I recall, we were told that the $787 billion stimulus bill \nwas designed for what primary purpose? Jobs and to rebuild our \ncrumbling infrastructure. They talked about roads and bridges that have \nfallen in and interstates getting old and needing all this work. Do you \nremember that? That is how the bill was sold by this administration. I \ndon't want to be just partisan carping, but that is what they told us.\n  Amazingly, less than 4 percent of the stimulus bill that we passed--\nthe $787 billion package--went to highways and infrastructure, less \nthan 4 percent. I complained about that. I remember making speeches on \nit because jobs are created when you build a highway. At least you have \nsomething permanent that benefits the Nation--perhaps replacing a \nbridge that you are going to have to replace anyway, and you get a \nbenefit for everybody from improving our infrastructure, although that \nis not a philosophy that will always stand us in good stead. We were \ntrying to create jobs, and at least we should have focused on \ninfrastructure.\n  Now they are coming back with $150 billion more--$28 billion for \nhighways and $2.5 billion for railroads. That is not good management of \nmoney. That is not good spending.\n\n  The President went on to say this:\n\n       According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \n     independent organization that both parties have cited as the \n     official scorekeeper for Congress, our approach would bring \n     down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two \n     decades.\n\n  He is talking about the health care bill that did not pass. He said \nit would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion. That is not \naccurate. The CBO on December 19 of last year, trying to get out these \nscores as fast as they could, said it would cut the deficit by roughly \n$1 trillion. Then they revised it 1 day later. The official score was \nthat it would reduce the deficit about half that amount.\n  As I explained on the floor, that is a product of miscalculation--\ndeliberate miscalculation. Let me explain.\n  The way they get this score in the first 10 years, for example, is \nthey said it would create a surplus of $132 billion if we would pass \nthis health care bill. Isn't that great? You add 20 million people to \nthe rolls, give many of them subsidized health care, and you are going \nto reduce the costs and you are going to save money. That is a pretty \ngood deal if you can get it. But, of course, you cannot get something \nfor nothing. Nothing comes from nothing.\n  What happened was, Medicare scored that if you cut Medicare benefits, \nas the administration proposed, and you increase Medicare taxes, as \nthey proposed, you create extra money in Medicare and you extend the \nlife of Medicare. Medicare is going into bankruptcy, but this would \nextend the life of it. That is an honest and correct score.\n  The Congressional Budget Office utilizes what it calls the unified \nbudget. They score the whole budget as to how it comes out. The amount \nof money is increased to the government through Medicare, and they \nscore that as a gain. Since the health care bill would not take effect \nor pay benefits until 4 or 5 years later--although the taxes increase \nnow--then over 10 years, it would create a surplus of $132 billion. \nSound good? But I read the small print of the CBO letter and the small \nprint of the Medicare letter.\n  The Medicare Chief Actuary told us that if you raise taxes and you \ncut spending in Medicare, it will extend the life of Medicare. But he \nhad a parenthetical line in there. He said: Of course, you cannot \nsimultaneously use the Medicare savings to fund a new program and claim \nit does both. You would be spending the money twice. How logical is \nthat? But that is what they did. He used this phrase: ``Although the \nconventions of accounting might suggest.'' What he is saying is, \nMedicare scores the money. They scored it accurately. Mr. Elmendorf and \nCBO score it as a unified budget. They said you have more money for \nMedicare and spending in the first 10 years of the health care plan--it \nis less than that--so you have a net surplus, right? Looks good. Sounds \ngood. But that is not so because there is a bond, a debt instrument \nfrom the U.S. Treasury back to the Medicare Trust Fund. As soon as \nMedicare starts going into deficit again, they are going to cash in \nthose bonds and the government is going to have to then borrow the \nmoney on the open market.\n  According to the CBO, it would not increase the deficit but it would \nincrease the debt of America. When we raised the debt limit yesterday--\nand my colleagues voted to do so--the internal debt between the \nTreasury and Medicare, counts as part of the Nation's debt. It is an \ninternal debt. It is not scored the same way. But sooner or later, when \nSocial Security and Medicare start cashing in and claiming their money, \nthe U.S. Treasury has to do something. What they are going to do and \nwhat they have been doing is convert those debt instruments and go out \nand sell bonds in the marketplace. Whatever the interest rate, they \nhave to pay to China, individuals in the United States, and others who \nbuy those Treasury bills. We are selling so many of them it is no doubt \ngoing to drive up the interest rate.\n  These numbers are not real. My concern and my criticism of the \nPresident's address is not that he said we ought to have a freeze. I \nsalute that, and I will support that. But he did not indicate the \nseverity of the crisis we are in.\n  Two years ago, President Bush's last year, he had a $460 billion \ndeficit which I think at that time was the highest deficit since World \nWar II. It spiked up\n\n[[Page S362]]\n\nas a result of increased spending and the recession we are in. Last \nyear, the debt was $1.4 trillion, 1,400 billion dollars, three times \nwhat it was. And this year the projected deficit is going to be almost \nthe same, according to Mr. Elmendorf's report.\n  It continues this way, unfortunately, throughout the decade and will \naverage, based on the planned expenditures and revenues as set forth by \nthe Obama administration's budget, almost $1 trillion a year in \ndeficits. This is why experts are repeatedly telling us it is \nunsustainable. We will be maintaining deficits twice as large as \nanything we have ever seen for the next decade.\n  Let me show what it means in one area that I think all of us can \nunderstand. When you borrow money, you pay interest on it. Each year, \nthe interest we pay on the debt is one of the biggest line items in the \nwhole budget. If the debt goes up from $5.7 trillion in 2008 to $17 \ntrillion in 2019, which is what they project will happen, the interest \nrate is going to go up. It will go up even more than that. It will go \nup more. Interest rates are extraordinarily low as a result of the \neconomic slowdown. They are going to go up, and they are going to hit \nus in the book.\n  Here is what CBO says will happen. In 2009, we paid $200 billion in \ninterest on the debt. In 2019, they project we will pay $799 billion. \nThey project an increase in rates and an increase in debt--a tripling \nof debt and an increase in interest rates--which leads to four times as \nmuch interest being paid over that period of time. Frankly, it does not \ninclude some other factors in there also.\n  I have to say to my colleagues, I am sorry we did not pass the \nstatutory cap we offered this week. But I was encouraged by so many of \nour Democratic colleagues who saw fit to support it. I think it is \nindicating there is a recognition in this body that we are going to \nhave to do some tough things. We cannot keep spending like this. There \nis always some excuse for it. We cannot continue it.\n  Think about this. The Federal Highway Program a few years ago, before \nwe had the stimulus package, was about $40 billion a year. Federal aid \nto education is about $40 billion a year. Other programs are in that \nrange. It gives you a picture of what kind of dollars we are talking \nabout. But if you add $600 billion in increased interest payments over \nthis next decade, in 1 year $600 billion more, this is going to crowd \nout spending for all kinds of programs that we wish to fund.\n  We are going to be in a dilemma. How much more can we borrow--100 \npercent of GDP? More?--without destabilizing our currency or cutting \nspending? And it is going to crowd out spending on items we need to be \nspending money on. It is going to be crowded out by the interest \npayment which will exceed all expenditures in the budget, well above \nthe defense budget even, the largest expenditure.\n  This is a stunning path we are on. Mr. Elmendorf reconfirmed it \nyesterday in his testimony before the Budget Committee. I am worried \nabout it. The American people are worried about it. I don't think they \nknow it is as bad as it is, but they know it is not good. They know \nthere is no free lunch. They know nothing comes from nothing, and that \nwe have to pay for what we do around here. We cannot continue to \nborrow, borrow, borrow, stimulate today and maybe 1 day in the future \nwe will get around to paying it.\n  I offer to you, in 2019, there is no plan to pay down a dime of the \ndebt. It is just to pay the interest on the debt. In 2019, we will add \n$1 trillion more to the debt of America. It is going up almost $1 \ntrillion a year, and these are outyears, according to CBO analysis. \nNothing is perfect that far out. It could be better; it could be worse. \nThey are not projecting a recession in the outyears; they are \nprojecting steady economic growth. It could be worse.\n  We have to do better. This is not a matter that is going away. The \nAmerican people instinctively have it right. They are telling us in \nrallies and tea parties: You guys have to do better. You are being \nirresponsible. I think they are fundamentally correct. They have every \nright to be upset with us. We can do better. We must do better. And I \nhope we will.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to make these remarks. \nIt is something we are going to have to continue to work on. We cannot \ncontinue this path. If we put our mind to it, we can fix this \nsituation. It is not a challenge beyond our capacity. But make no \nmistake, financially I doubt we have ever been in a situation that \nrequires as much clarity and as much determination as is going to be \nrequired over the next decade, and some painful decisions are going to \nhave to be made. They are going to have to be made.\n  That means containing spending and resisting the temptation to create \nmore and more new programs that inevitably cost more than they were \nprojected to when they started.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/01/29/senate-section/article/S362-1", "month": "01", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 2010, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.
