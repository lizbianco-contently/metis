Mr. President, I want to say a few things on the vote we \nwill have at 2:15 p.m. today. The issue that is creating all of the \nattention is a provision that the committee put in the bill dealing \nwith don't ask, don't tell. The committee did a good job on that issue. \nWhat they said is, if the President of the United States and the \nSecretary of Defense, after reviewing the work being done by the \nPentagon--which will be completed this December--decide it is in the \nbest interest of the United States military to do away with that \npolicy, that will be the case.\n  There are some who are saying this bill that came out of the \ncommittee repeals don't ask, don't tell. That is not the fact. It is \nnot repealed in the bill. It simply says, I repeat, if the Defense \nDepartment, with the Secretary of the Defense and the President, \ncertifies it will have no negative effect on the military after \nstudying the Pentagon's work, then they can move forward on that and, \nin effect, repeal that policy. But it is not in this bill.\n  Anyway, the point is, we are going to have that vote at 2:15 p.m., \nand I will discuss with the Republican leader later today what we are \ngoing to do if there are amendments that are going to be offered on \nthat. I have said some of the things I am interested in doing on that \nbill. I am not here in any way suggesting that people aren't being \naccurate in their depiction of this bill. I\n\n[[Page S7230]]\n\njust want to make sure that people understand what the facts are on \nthis bill, and I think the Armed Services Committee did an extremely \ngood job in committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/21/senate-section/article/S7230-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is no secret that Americans are \nunhappy with the way our friends on the other side have handled things \nover the past few years, and especially the last year and a half. \nAmericans have been speaking out across the country about the need to \nreturn to a smaller, more competent, more accountable government that \nlives within its means. Instead, Democrats in Congress have given them \nmore government, more spending, more debt--and now they are threatening \na massive tax hike to top it all off.\n  What has been most remarkable to me in watching this all play out is \nthe way our friends on the other side have doubled down on their plans \nin the teeth of public outrage. Yesterday, we saw a CNBC survey showing \nmost Americans don't like the idea of seeing taxes raised on anybody at \nthis point. CNN says that most of the economists it surveyed said the \nbest thing we can do for businesses is to assure them their taxes won't \ngo up at the end of the year.\n  Yet Democratic leaders are still clinging to the discredited idea \nthat government needs more power, more money for more Washington \nprograms. Maybe the reason is that the Democratic vision of recovery--\ntheir idea of success, according to the assistant majority leader--is 9 \npercent unemployment. That is right. Yesterday, the No. 2 Democrat in \nthe Senate said that Congress could ``breathe a sigh of relief'' at 9 \npercent unemployment or less. That is their idea of success.\n  Well, our idea of success is for businesses to start hiring again and \nto get this country back on track. It seems the more Americans say they \nwant Democrats to stop what they are doing and focus on jobs and the \neconomy, the more determined they are to press ahead with their various \nliberal agenda items while they have still got the chance.\n  That is basically what today's vote on the Defense authorization bill \nis all about. The Defense authorization bill requires 4 or 5 weeks to \ndebate. But instead of having that debate or turning to the Defense \nappropriations bill, which funds the military, they want to use this \nweek for a political exercise. They want to weigh this bill down with \ncontroversy in a transparent attempt to show their special interest \ngroups ahead of the election that they haven't forgotten them.\n  It is quite astonishing. Democrats have called up this bill not to \nhave a vote on it or to consider amendments to help our troops in the \nfield but to put on a show--to use it as an opportunity to cast votes \nfor things Americans either don't want or aren't interested in seeing \nattached to a bill that is supposed to be about defense.\n  My friend, the majority leader, has already said this bill isn't \ngoing to pass with these items attached to it before the election. But \nhe is keeping them on there anyway. So this is not a serious exercise, \nit is a show. And it is because of shows such as this our friends have \nlost credibility with the public.\n  Americans want us to take care of the basics and do it competently--\ntake care of the basics and do it competently. This isn't too much to \nask. But evidently it is too much to ask of Democratic leaders in \nCongress right before the election.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I withhold my request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/21/senate-section/article/S7230-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today I am joining with Senator Brownback \nto introduce a bipartisan amendment to the Defense authorization bill \nthat will save and create jobs in one of the most important sectors in \nour economy--our aerospace industry.\n  Our amendment is about protecting skilled family-wage jobs--\nmanufacturing jobs, engineering jobs, and jobs with technical skills \nand expertise that are passed from one generation to the next. These \nare jobs that not only support families during this difficult economic \ntime but that are also helping keep entire communities above water--\njobs in communities such as Kansas, Connecticut, California, and in my \nhome State of Washington. They are jobs that support small businesses, \npay mortgages, and create economic opportunity, and are jobs that right \nnow are at risk because of illegal subsidies that undercut workers and \ncreate an uneven playing field for America's aerospace workers.\n  The amendment Senator Brownback and I are offering is a commonsense, \nstraightforward way to protect American aerospace jobs from unfair \nEuropean competition, and it is an amendment that specifically targets \na major job-creating project--the Air Force's aerial refueling tanker \ncontract--as a place where we can begin to restore fairness for our \naerospace workers. This amendment says that in awarding that tanker \ncontract the Pentagon must also consider any unfair competitive \nadvantage aerospace companies have. And there is no bigger unfair \nadvantage in the world of international aerospace than launch aid.\n  As you may know, Mr. President, launch aid is direct funding that has \nbeen provided to European aerospace company Airbus from the treasuries \nof European governments. It is what supports their factories and their \nworkers and their airplanes. It is what allows them to roll the dice \nand lose. And it is what separates them from American aerospace \ncompanies such as Boeing, which bets the company on each new airplane \nline. In short, it is what allows them to stack the deck against our \nAmerican workers.\n  In July of this year, the World Trade Organization handed down a \nruling in a case that the United States brought against the European \nUnion that finally called launch aid what it is--a trade-distorting, \njob-killing, unfair advantage. In what was one of our Nation's most \nimportant trade cases to date, the WTO ruled very clearly that launch \naid is illegal. It creates an uneven playing field. It has harmed \nAmerican workers and American companies and it needs to end.\n  Specifically, the WTO found that European governments have provided \nAirbus more than 15 billion Euros in launch aid, subsidizing every \nmodel of aircraft ever produced by Airbus in the last 40 years, \nincluding the model they plan to put up for our tanker competition. \nThey ruled that France and Germany and Spain provided more than 1 \nbillion Euros in infrastructure and infrastructure-related grants \nbetween 1989 and 2001, as well as another 1 billion in shared transfers \nand equity infusions into Airbus. They ruled that European governments \nprovided over 1 billion Euros in funding between 1986 and 2005 for \nresearch and development directed specifically to the development of \nAirbus aircraft. In fact, the Lexington Institute estimates that launch \naid represents over $200 billion in today's dollars in total subsidies \nto Airbus.\n\n  Launch aid has had very real consequences. It has created an uphill \nbattle for our workers and for American aerospace as a whole. Because \nof launch aid, our workers are now not only competing against rival \ncompanies, they are competing against the treasuries of European \ngovernments. At the end of the day, that has meant lost jobs at our \nAmerican aerospace companies and suppliers and in the communities that \nsupport them.\n  I have been speaking out against Europe's market-distorting actions \nfor\n\n[[Page S7231]]\n\nmany years because I know and understand that these subsidies are not \nonly illegal, they are deeply unfair and anticompetitive. My home State \nof Washington is home to much of our country's aerospace industry, and \nI know our workers are the best in the world. On a level playing field, \nthey can compete and win against absolutely anyone. Unfortunately, \nAirbus and the European Union have refused to allow fair competition. \nInstead, they use their aerospace industry as a government-funded jobs \nprogram, and they have used billions in illegal launch aid to fund it.\n  They are going to do just about anything to keep those illegal \nsubsidies in place. We saw evidence of that in recent days in news on \nAirbus's attempts to distract and hide their job-killing subsidies \nthrough their retaliatory WTO case against Boeing. Unfortunately for \nthem, it was a smokescreen that failed. News reports and analysts have \nall shown that the two WTO decisions are worlds apart. In fact, leading \naerospace analyst Loren Thompson wrote after the Boeing ruling that it \n``found nothing comparable to European launch aid.'' The most recent \nWTO ruling really only reinforces that American aerospace workers have \nbeen at a competitive disadvantage, and that needs to change.\n  Let me be clear about one thing. Our objective here is not to limit \ncompetition; our objective is to make sure everyone can compete on a \nlevel playing field. Airbus has made it clear they will go to any \nlengths to hurt our country's aerospace industry. We need to make it \nclear that we will take every action to stop them because this is not \nonly about the future of aerospace, right now it is about jobs that \nwill help our entire economy recover.\n  In fact, as we look for ways to stimulate job growth and keep \nAmerican companies innovating and growing, we should look no further \nthan this amendment. This amendment is commonsense policy. It makes \nsure the U.S. Government policy translates to Pentagon policy because \nthe fact is that the U.S. Government, through our Trade Representative, \nhas taken the position that Airbus subsidies are illegal and unfair. \nYet the U.S. Department of Defense is ignoring that position as we look \nnow to purchase a tanker fleet, and that does not make any sense--not \nfor our country, not for our military, and certainly not for our \nworkers. The WTO made a fair decision. Airbus subsidies are illegal and \nanticompetitive. Now the DOD needs to take that ruling into account.\n  When I talk to our aerospace workers back home in Washington State, I \nwant to tell them we have evened the stakes. I want them to know their \ngovernment is not looking the other way as policies continue to \nundercut their job opportunities. I want them to know that while they \nare working to secure our country by producing the best airplanes in \nthe world, their government is doing everything it can to make sure \nthere are fair opportunities that will keep them on the job.\n  I know our workers will win a fair and open competition, and I urge \nthe DOD to do the right thing to make this competition fair and open by \nconsidering illegal subsidies in awarding these critical contracts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment when we \nadopt it and help us protect our American aerospace jobs as a result.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, in a few hours we are going to \nbe voting on whether we want to take up the Defense bill. That should \nbe a no-brainer, for, after all, defense of the country is one of the \nmost important things the U.S. Government can do. We are going to \nconsider that. Yet we have some highly inflammatory issues that \npossibly are going to derail this bill.\n  I have the privilege of sitting on both the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and the Intelligence Committee. The provisions in this bill, \nfrom my standpoint, are going to ensure that our service men and women \nwho are putting their lives on the line for this country will have the \ntraining, the equipment, and the resources they need and deserve.\n  Back in February, the Secretary of Defense told our Armed Services \nCommittee that the Department's top priorities are ``rearming and \nstrengthening the nation's commitment to care for the all-volunteer \nforce, our greatest strategic asset'' and ``rebalancing America's \ndefense posture by emphasizing capabilities needed to prevail in \ncurrent conflicts while enhancing capabilities that may be needed in \nthe future.'' That is what the Secretary of Defense said. What more can \nyou say? That is what this bill does. This National Defense \nAuthorization Act is going to authorize over $700 billion in \ndiscretionary budget authority for the programs and initiatives to \ncarry out what the Secretary of Defense said.\n  In order to carry this out for an all-volunteer force, here are some \nof the things the bill will do. It will improve the quality of life for \nthe service members and their families, authorizing much needed \nmilitary construction and housing projects.\n  Here is another example: Ensure that all of the forces preparing to \ndeploy are trained for what they are deploying for and that their \nequipment is ready so that they can succeed at combat. I remember back \nin the early days of the Iraq war, I had mamas and daddies calling me \nbecause members of the Florida National Guard were in Iraq and they did \nnot even have the adequate body armor. Never again for those kinds of \nthings. But that is another reason for us to have this bill.\n  Another reason: It will authorize a 1.4-percent pay raise for our \nservice members.\n  To get ready for the ongoing efforts to prevail in this fight, here \nis also what the bill would do:\n  Counterinsurgency. It enhances our ability to go after the bad guys \nin those counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan, and it would \nimprove the ability of our military to counter nontraditional threats \nsuch as those that now threaten us in the cyber warfare domain.\n  Of course, it would support the highest priority unfunded needs that \nare identified by the Chiefs of Staff.\n  It would also authorize over $110 billion in base budget authority \nfor funding high-priority weapons systems. I will give an example. The \nNavy's littoral combat ship allows us to get in close to shore in \nmodernized equipment and boats; also, the E2-D Advanced Hawkeye, the \nAir Force's Joint STARS Program, and the new hot, stealthy F-35 Joint \nStrike Fighter.\n  This bill takes several steps to enhance our capabilities to protect \nour country against emerging threats, including terrorism and the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This is in a subject area \nof the subcommittee in Armed Services that I chair.\n  We are going to have an increased capability for manufacturing and \ntesting capabilities to reduce the time required to produce high-demand \nitems such as body and vehicle armor, the IED jammers, Mine Resistant \nAmbush Protected Vehicles--that is the MRAP vehicles--and to modernize \nDepartment test capability facilities to ensure new weapons systems \nmeet the requirements of that warfighter who is out there on the \nground, facing the threat.\n  In this bill is also funding for advanced technologies for weapons \nsystems and further R to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels in our \nmilitary machine.\n  It is going to add $113 million for unfunded requirements that were \nidentified by the commander of the Special Operations Command for \nground mobility vehicles, deployable communications equipment, thermal \nand night vision goggles, special operations combat assault rifles, and \nnonlethal weapons technologies. This is the new kind of war and combat \nwe are facing. It is often these highly specialized, trained units that \nare going in under stealth with highly sophisticated weapons and \nequipment to go after a very stealthy enemy who does not wear a uniform \nand who blends right into the local population.\n  This bill also goes after getting us improved in the nonproliferation \nprograms.\n  There is so much in this bill. Yet we are facing not even getting the \n60 votes this afternoon to be able to proceed with the Nation's \ndefense. Why is that? Because there is a provision in here, that was \nvoted out of the Armed Services Committee, on the repeal of the \nstanding policy in the military of don't ask, don't tell--a repeal of \nit once the\n\n[[Page S7232]]\n\nDepartment of Defense completes a comprehensive review of the repeal. \nThe President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs--once that review is done under the bill--must certify to \nCongress that they can implement the repeal while maintaining \nreadiness, effectiveness, and unit cohesion. This provision obviously \nhas received a great deal of attention. I believe that proceeding in \nthis way--very cautiously--will allow the DOD to examine all the \nimplications of repealing this policy while moving forward with this \nchange.\n  It is clear that this Defense bill is a key piece of the legislation \nfor our military. For 48 consecutive years, the Senate has completed \nwork on a Defense authorization bill.

Mr. President, I also wish to share some \nobservations of a recent visit I made to another troubled part of the \nworld. In Colombia, I witnessed a country transformed. I went there \nwith our four-star commander, General Fraser of the U.S. Southern \nCommand. We went to a former FARC base in southern Colombia, the little \nvillage of La Macarena. It is now a headquarters for the special \noperations forces of the Colombian military.\n  It is interesting, this place out in the middle of the jungle, a \nviolent narcotrafficking insurgency that had completely controlled this \nterritory and had intimidated and terrorized the people. The FARC \nleadership used to hold press conferences under a large tree that is \nnow in the middle of that Colombian military base.\n  There are actually vacationers from around the world that are coming \nto a nearby stream that used to be the vacation destination for FARC \nleaders and their friends. Well, those days of the FARC controlling \nthat part of Colombia are over. In recent years, the Colombian military \nhas killed, captured, disarmed hundreds of FARC fighters, and those who \nremain are on the move.\n  The FARC is not defeated, but they are certainly diminished. Just \nbefore General Fraser and I arrived, the military carried out another \ndaring hostage rescue, raiding a FARC camp and freeing four Colombian \nhostages. Some of those had been in captivity for well over a decade. I \nmet with the President of Colombia. He was the Defense Minister a \ncouple years ago, before he was elected President, when they pulled off \nthat miraculous deception that rescued the three American hostages who \nhad been there for years in captivity with the FARC. Two of those three \nAmerican hostages were from Florida.\n  So the Colombians, with U.S. assistance, have transformed their \nmilitary into a 21st century counterinsurgency force, and it has been \nvery effective. They are even sending their forces now to help train \nthe Mexican security forces, where there is so much trouble brewing.\n  Since the time is drawing nigh, I will share at a later date the \ntroubles that Mexico faces. It is substantial, with the \nnarcotraffickers basically penetrating all levels of the Mexican \nGovernment but especially the local and State governments of Mexico. It \nis of enormous importance to the United States that we have success \nwith our neighbors, our friends to the south, to be able to get control \nof their country just like the Colombians did as they diminished the \nFARC.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to talk about our Nation's \nindebtedness. I know very few people watch these presentations. But to \nmy friends on the other side, before they turn their monitors off, this \nis not a partisan presentation. Hopefully, it is a presentation to \ncause us, together, to look at our Nation's indebtedness from a \ndifferent viewpoint and, hopefully, when we get to real business in \nJanuary, we will focus on this in a way that brings us together and \ndoes not separate us.\n  I wish to start by looking at where our country is today as it \nrelates to debt to our gross domestic product. Most countries in the \nworld look at the amount of debt they have as a country in relation to \nthe gross domestic product the country has. That is the sum of all the \noutput.\n  For a lot of businesspeople who may be tuned in today, it is not \nunlike a company that looks at its revenues and compares the amount of \ndebt the company has to those revenues or gross profits. So, today, our \ncountry's debt-to-GDP is at 62 percent debt to gross domestic product.\n  I think most of us understand the problem we have as a country today \nis that we are very rapidly moving to 146 percent of debt to GDP within \nthe next 20 years. I would like to point out the reason this dot is \nhere. That is where Greece was when the European Union had to come in \nand bail it out. It was at 120 percent of GDP. I do not wish to compare \nour country to Greece. Greece is very different. I was just there \nvisiting with the Prime Minister, their Finance Minister, and several \nbankers. There is much about their economy that is very different than \nours.\n  But I do think it is important to look at the fact that they were at \n120 percent of debt to GDP when they had to be bailed out by European \nUnion members. We are quickly moving beyond that over the next 20 \nyears.\n  This is a slide I hope everybody who may be tuned in will focus on \nand remember. There are three important components. It begins by \nlooking at the revenues, which is the blue line. The spending is the \nred line. There are three elements of this that I would like for people \nto focus on, if they would.\n  For those people who think Republicans and Democrats cannot work \ntogether, I do wish to point out a period of time when we had a \nDemocratic President and a Republican Congress, and the line actually \npassed. We had revenues that were higher than our expenditures. I do \nwant to say that the fiscal issues during that time were far different \nthan the ones we have today.\n  Where we are today, in 2010, is far different. We have a huge gap \nbetween spending and revenues. People might say: Well, during a \nrecession, maybe there are some extraordinary things that may occur. \nMaybe the spending rises tremendously, maybe revenues drop. Here is the \nproblem. Here is the part of the slide I hope almost everybody will \nfocus on into the future; that is, that gap never goes away.\n  Where we are today is at 1.47 more in spending than we have in \nrevenue. The problem is, where we are as a country is that this gap \nnever goes away. In 2020, we still are spending $1.25 trillion more \nthan we are taking in.\n  In Tennessee, the average household, in most recent data, earned \nabout $43,000 a year. If they used the kind of logic we are using today \nin Washington, the average Tennessee household would spend $74,000. In \nother words, the average Tennessee household would borrow 40 cents for \nevery $1 they spend. Fortunately, that is not what is happening in \nTennessee, or at least not with most families.\n  I think when you look at a problem, you need to sort of look at \ntrends that have taken place. If you look back at 1970, 62 percent of \nwhat we spent as a country was on what is called discretionary \nspending, things such as defense, highways, and education. Only 31 \npercent of what we spent at that time was on mandatory spending, things \nsuch as Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid and only 7 percent on \ninterest.\n\n[[Page S7233]]\n\n  But if we fast forward to today, obviously that pie chart has changed \ndramatically. Today, we are spending, in 2010, 56 percent of what we \ntake in on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Only 38 percent is \ngoing to discretionary spending: defense, highways, and education and, \nagain, 6 percent in interest payments.\n  However, if you fast forward on the present trend, you see mandatory \nspending actually becomes crowded out. It is 49 percent of what we \nexpend in 2035. By that time, because of the large amount of borrowing \nthat is taking place, 25 percent of what our budget will be made up of \nis interest payments, something that has absolutely nothing to do with \nmaking our country stronger. As you can see, only 26 percent of our \nspending would then be on things such as defense, highways, education, \nthings entitled ``discretionary spending.''\n\n  This year we spent $187 billion on interest payments, which greatly \ndwarfs what we spent in the area of transportation, $69 billion; \nhomeland security, $49 billion; Department of Education, $45 billion. \nThe problem is, if you fast forward to 10 years, this is a timeframe \nthat is not way out into the future. This is something most Americans \ncan focus on; that is, a decade from now. In 10 years, $916 billion \nwill be going out of the Federal coffers to pay interest; again, hugely \ndwarfing the expenditures on transportation, on homeland security, and \neducation.\n  I used to borrow a lot of money in my business. I built and owned \nbuildings around our country. It was always important to know whom I \nwas borrowing money from and to have a proper relationship with them. \nIt is also interesting to look at our country and where we are \nborrowing the money we are spending. If you go back and look at 1960, \nAmericans loaned the American Government money.\n  Our parents--maybe some of you in the audience--loaned the money to \nthe Federal Government by buying Treasury bonds. As a matter of fact, \nback in 1960, only 5 percent of the money we borrowed in this country \ncame from foreign holders. But if you look at today, the picture is \nvery different. As a matter of fact, today, 47 percent of the public \ndebt we borrow is held by foreign holders.\n  Look, I understand about international trade and global transactions \nand certainly support that. I have been a part of that in the past. The \nreason I point this out is that, again, a big part of what we are \nborrowing is from others. China holds almost 10 percent of our debt.\n  I think most of you saw recently where they slightly depressed the \namount of holdings they had in the United States, dropping it from \nabout $870 billion to $844.\n  I do wish to point out something that former Treasury Secretary \nPaulson talked about in a book he recently wrote about the crisis. I \nused to talk with him sometimes on the weekends. Obviously, he was \nworking 7 days a week, as do I and most of us in this body. I talked to \nhim for a great deal of time.\n  I remember him telling me during the time of the crisis that he was \nconcerned about China. He was concerned about China. In the book, he \ntalks about feeling that there was a scheme that Russia was trying to \nget China to engage in, to get them to stop buying our securities, \nduring the period of time that we were most destabilized, in order to \nput greater pressure on our country during a time of great turmoil.\n  Obviously, that did not happen. But all of us say, I think it is \nimportant, when you are moving into a range of having more indebtedness \nthan you can handle, it is very important to know and understand you \nare borrowing money from people who may not have the same interests \nthat we as a country have.\n  This is something you do not see often in this body, but I hope \neverybody will focus on this slide. The fact is, there is plenty of \nblame to go around. We do a great job in this body, especially a few \nweeks before an election, of pointing fingers at each other, talking \nabout whose fault it is that our country is in the situation it is in. \nBut as it relates to our country's indebtedness, I can assure you there \nis plenty of blame to go around.\n  What I learned in my business, where I spent most of my life, \nwhenever we had an ox in the ditch, it did not do a lot of good to try \nto point fingers at how we got there. It was better to try to focus on \nhow we solve that problem. I certainly knew that as mayor of the city \nof Chattanooga.\n  I can tell you, in this body, as soon as we begin devolving into \npointing fingers, we quickly move away from solving some of the major \nproblems we have as a country.\n  I think as we look at trying to deal with this issue, it is good to \nlook at the way things have been. Over the last 50 years, our \ngovernment has spent about 20.3 percent of our GDP. Over that same \nperiod, the revenues into the Federal Government have been about 18 \npercent. There are economists on both sides of the aisle who say as \nlong as the economy is growing, we can continue that in perpetuity. \nComing from the background I come from, this is not a comfortable \nsituation. I would rather see us take in the same amount of money we \nexpend, but certainly there are academicians and economists on both \nsides who have different points of view.\n  What is the right amount of spending? I think everybody is aware that \nPresident Obama has put together a deficit reduction commission. It is \nchaired by two individuals. One of those is Erskine Bowles, chief of \nstaff to Bill Clinton. He is a Democrat. He ran for the Senate from \nNorth Carolina. I talk to him extensively on the phone. He certainly \nhas a lot of sound ideas. The other is Alan Simpson, former Senator \nfrom Wyoming. They are chairing a deficit reduction commission the \nPresident has put together.\n  A great breakthrough occurred recently when Erskine Bowles said he \nbelieves the Federal Government ought to spend about 21 percent of our \ncountry's GDP. Our average over the last 50 years has been 20.3 \npercent. Our revenues over the same period have been 18 percent.\n  Bob Corker, because he is more conservative on that front, or would \nlike to see balance--a balance a lot of people on both sides would like \nto see--my number might be 18 percent. Erskine Bowles has thrown out \nthe number of 21. But to me, somewhere between 18 and 21, there is a \ndeal. I want to say to everybody that I am open to negotiation. I would \nlove for us to agree as a country as to what percentage of our gross \ndomestic product we all agree is the right number for us in Washington \nto be spending. If we can focus on this first, page 1, we can move away \nfrom many of the issues that separate us.\n  This is something on which I hope everybody who may be tuned in will \nfocus. The fact is, I don't think we have thought about this deficit \nissue as something that is anything more than academic. We have thought \nabout it as something that will affect a Congress down the road, maybe \nour neighbor, but not us. In order to get to Bob Corker's number over \nthe next decade, which is a period on which most of us can focus, we \nwould have to cut spending by $6.7 trillion. That is a lot of money. To \nget to the number Erskine Bowles has thrown out--for which I am open to \nnegotiation--over the next decade we would have to cut $3.4 trillion in \nspending. To get where we have been over the last 50 years over the \nnext decade, we would have to cut $4.5 trillion in spending.\n  The reason I point this out is, this is a huge number. Even by \nFederal Government standards, these numbers are draconian.\n  I realize this is something that is probably not attainable. To get \n$6.7 trillion in cuts we would have to cut $670 billion a year over the \nnext 10 years. To put that in perspective so people can digest it, this \nis more money than we spend each year on Medicare. This is more money \nthan we spend each year on defense with two wars. The type of cuts it \nwould take to get to where we have been as a country for the last 50 \nyears, those cuts are draconian. I don't think we as a Congress have \nquite come to terms with that.\n  What we need to do is fundamentally change the way we do business in \nWashington. I don't care what side of the aisle one may sit on or what \ngimmicks each side of the aisle may put forth to look at trying to \nconstrain spending. All of us know we have absolutely no construct to \ncontain spending. We are operating this year without a budget. We have \nhad problems with spending for decades. There is nothing\n\n[[Page S7234]]\n\nhere that causes us to focus on it in the right way. Again, both sides \nhave had great problems in this regard.\n  What we need to do as a body, as a Senate, is to create a construct \nthat forces us to cap spending and incentivize growth. I plan on \noffering legislation later this year. I realize this is a political \nseason and nothing serious will be taken up. What I want to do as a \nbody is to focus on the amount of spending we deal with in Washington \nas a percentage of our gross domestic product, as I have been \ndiscussing, and to develop a construct that causes us over time to move \nto that cap. I realize we will not be able to do it overnight, but it \nseems to me if we can adopt that kind of thinking where we look at \ngovernmental spending as a percentage of GDP--Erskine Bowles, who is \nworking right now as head of the deficit reduction commission, has made \na major contribution by throwing out a number, and I am open for \nnegotiation--to me, if we can focus on that kind of construct, then it \nis in everybody's interest to hope the gross domestic product grows.\n  As the gross domestic product grows, as our economy grows, and the \ntypes of issues we face as they relate to cutting spending are less \ndifficult to deal with, we would be unified toward getting to a point \nthat is appropriate as it relates to spending so our indebtedness does \nnot put us in the same kind of situation in which Greece found itself. \nBut at the same time, after we have done that, then we could agree on \npolicies that actually incentivize growth because as the economy grows, \nit is easier to deal with this issue.\n  I will come to my conclusion. The fact is, this is becoming a cliche. \nI realize it is said over and over again, but we are, in fact, the \nfirst generation of Americans in a situation where we likely, if we \ndon't change our course of action, will leave the country in lesser \ngood shape than we found it. As a matter of fact, we will leave the \ncountry in worse shape.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CORKER. I appreciate the cue.\n  The fact is, I don't think there is anybody in this body who would \nconsciously wake up and spend every day of their life taking lavish \nvacations, going to nice hotels, eating out at night, running that up \non a credit card, and then leaving that for their heirs to pay. There \nis nobody in this body who would consider doing that. But that is \nexactly what we are doing right now in Washington because of the way we \nare handling our fiscal affairs. We are running up a tab that our \ngrandchildren, some of the children in this audience who have come in \nas students, will be left to pay.\n  I believe in American exceptionalism. I think we are, in fact, the \ngreatest country that ever existed and ever will. I think the role we \nplay in this world creates all kinds of gains as it relates to \ncitizens' ways of life throughout the world. I would hate to see us as \na country end up so diminished not only because of the tremendous \nimpact it would have on our citizens--we have seen what has happened \nwith this financial crisis and the distortions it has created \nthroughout the economy, the hardships it has created for so many \nAmericans--but I would hate for us to be so diminished because of our \nindebtedness, so diminished so that we had to talk to lenders about \nthose austerity measures we had to take as a country for them to \ncontinue to loan us money, for us to be so diminished that we did not \ncontinue to play the exceptional role we play in the world, the \nexceptional role we play in continuing to raise up Americans' dreams \nand wishes and continue to allow them to actually pursue.\n  I plan on offering legislation. I have a nine-page bill. I know there \nare no bills around here that get seriously considered that are nine \npages. Others, I know, will weigh in. But I sure hope to work with \npeople on both sides of the aisle. I plan on offering legislation later \nthis year or the first of the next Congress. I hope we as a Congress \nwill deal with this issue in an appropriate way. I am looking to work \nwith people on both sides of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss the \nDefense authorization bill and the don't ask, don't tell provisions \nincluded in it. Let me begin by making my position crystal clear: I \nagree with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, \nthat the don't ask, don't tell law should be repealed. It should be \nrepealed contingent upon the certifications of the President, the \nSecretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nthat its repeal would not have an adverse impact on military readiness, \nrecruitment, and retention. Those are exactly the provisions included \nin the Defense authorization bill.\n  My view is that our Armed Forces should welcome the service of any \nqualified individual who is willing and capable of serving our country. \nThe bottom line for me is this: If an individual is willing to put on \nthe uniform of our country, to be deployed in war zones such as Iraq \nand Afghanistan, to risk his or her life for our country, then we \nshould be expressing our gratitude to those individuals, not trying to \nexclude them from serving or expel them from the force.\n  That is why during consideration of this bill in May, I supported the \ncompromise provisions that were put forth by Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Levin. At a previous Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, I \nasked Admiral Mullen if there was any evidence at all that allowing gay \nand lesbian troops to serve had harmed military readiness in those \ncountries that allow their service now. At least 28 countries, \nincluding Great Britain, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and Israel \nallow open service by lesbian and gay troops. We have no greater allies \nthan Great Britain, Australia, Canada, and Israel. None of these \ncountries--not one--reports morale or recruitment problems. At least \nnine of these countries have deployed their forces alongside American \ntroops in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and at least 12 of these nations are \nallowing open service and are currently fighting alongside U.S. troops \nin Afghanistan.\n  There is a cost involved to end our current policy. According to a \n2005 GAO report, American taxpayers spend more than $30 million each \nyear to train replacements for gay troops discharged under the don't \nask, don't tell policy. The total cost reported since the statute was \nimplemented, according to GAO, has been nearly $200 million. That \ndoesn't count the administrative and legal costs associated with \ninvestigations and hearings, and the military schooling of gay troops \nsuch as pilot training and linguist training.\n  We are losing highly skilled troops to this policy. According to the \nGAO, 8 percent of the servicemembers let go under don't ask, don't tell \nheld critical occupations defined as services such as interpreters. \nThree percent had skills in an important foreign language such as \nArabic, Farsi or Korean.\n  More than 13,000 troops have been dismissed from the military simply \nbecause of their sexual orientation since President Clinton signed this \nlaw in 1993. Society has changed so much since 1993, and we need to \nchange this policy as well.\n  But let me say that I respect the views of those who disagree with me \non this issue, such as the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator McCain; and I will defend the right of my colleagues \nto offer amendments on this issue and other issues that are being \nbrought up in connection with the Defense authorization bill.\n  There are many controversial issues in this bill. They deserve to \nhave a civil, fair, and open debate on the Senate floor. That is why I \nam so disappointed that rather than allowing full and open debate and \nthe opportunity for amendments from both sides of the aisle, the \nmajority leader apparently intends to shut down the debate and exclude \nRepublicans from offering a number of amendments.\n  This would be the 116th time in this Congress that the majority \nleader or another member of the majority has filed cloture rather than \nproceeding to the bill under an agreement that would allow amendments \nto be debated.\n  What concerns me even more is the practice of filling the amendment \ntree to prevent Republican amendments. If that is done on this bill, it \nwill be the 40th time.\n\n[[Page S7235]]\n\n  I find myself on the horns of a dilemma. I support the provisions in \nthis bill. I debated for them. I was the sole Republican in the \ncommittee who voted for the Lieberman-Levin language on don't ask, \ndon't tell. I think it is the right thing to do. I think it is only \nfair. I think we should welcome the service of these individuals who \nare willing and capable of serving their country. But I cannot vote to \nproceed to this bill under a situation that is going to shut down the \ndebate and preclude Republican amendments. That, too, is not fair.\n  So I am going to make one final plea to my colleagues to enter into a \nfair time agreement that will allow full and open debate, full and open \namendments to all the provisions of this bill, including don't ask, \ndon't tell, even though I will vote against the amendment to strike \ndon't ask, don't tell provisions from this bill.\n  Now is not the time to play politics simply because an election is \nlooming in a few weeks. Again, I call upon the majority leader to work \nwith the Republican leaders to negotiate an agreement on the terms of \ndebate for this bill so that we can debate this important defense \npolicy bill this week, including the vital issue of don't ask, don't \ntell.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/21/senate-section/article/S7235-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley).

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I hope we will proceed to the Defense \nauthorization bill this afternoon. The Senator from Maine, as far as I \nam concerned, has raised a very legitimate question about whether \namendments will be offerable to this bill, and the majority leader has \nspoken on that on the Record. This is what he said last Thursday. He \nsaid:\n\n       . . . in addition to issues I have talked about in the last \n     couple days, there are many other important matters that both \n     sides of the aisle wish to address. I am willing to work with \n     Republicans on a process that will permit the Senate to \n     consider these matters and complete the bill as soon as \n     possible, which likely will be after the recess.\n\n  So the majority leader has said he is more than willing to engage in \nthat process.\n  If that process does not lead to a fair result, then--if we can get \nto the bill--if the Republicans feel there has not been adequate \nopportunity to offer amendments, the opportunity will be there to \nprevent the passage of the bill until those amendments are considered. \nThis is the normal process. But to deny an opportunity to move to the \nbill so we can engage in a debate on amendments and so we hopefully \nwill have an opportunity, as we should, to debate amendments on the \nbill, it seems to me is prejudging the outcome of the debate.\n  The time to determine whether there has been adequate opportunity to \ndebate the bill is after you have had an opportunity to debate the \nbill. That judgment cannot be made in advance, particularly in the face \nof the majority leader's assurance. I agree with the Senator from Maine \nthat it is important this assurance be there. It is there, it was \nthere, in part, because of the issue she has raised over the last few \ndays.\n  When the majority leader says let us get to the bill because he \nagrees--he has talked about a number of issues, but in addition to the \nissues which he has talked about, which include a debate on don't ask, \ndon't tell, include a debate on the DREAM Act--in his words, ``there \nare many other important matters that both sides of the aisle wish to \naddress'' and that he is ``willing to work with Republicans on a \nprocess that will permit the Senate to consider these matters and \ncomplete the bill as soon as possible, which likely will be after the \nrecess.''\n  But we need to get to the bill. We need to get to the bill so we can \nthen begin to debate amendments. I think many Senators have amendments \nthey want to offer. It is not unusual on a Defense authorization bill. \nWe usually have hundreds of amendments that are offered. Last year, I \nbelieve we adopted something like 60 amendments. That process will \nagain occur but only if we can get to the bill.\n  To insist in advance there be an agreement, let me tell you, as \nmanager of the bill, I love unanimous consent agreements. I love time \nlimits. I love time agreements. I love agreements to limit amendments. \nThat is fine. But until you get to the bill, you are not in a position \nto work out such agreements. These are theoretical issues. We do not \neven know what amendments are going to be offered to this bill--until \nwe get to the bill. How can you have an agreement on what amendments \nwill be in order when we have not gotten to the bill and the amendments \nare not even filed?\n  So it is a legitimate point the Senator from Maine makes that she \nwants to be sure, as I hope every Senator does, that there will be \nadequate consideration of amendments during the debate on this bill.\n  The Republicans have the ability to stop a completion of \nconsideration of this bill until--unless and until--there is an \nopportunity to have a debate on amendments the way we usually do on the \nauthorization bill. That ability to stop the completion of this bill is \nthere, but it can only be utilized if we get to the bill.\n  To try to figure out in advance all the amendments which might be \nfiled and what amendments will be ordered and what time agreements will \nbe reached is, it seems to me as a practical matter, impossible to do.\n  The assurance of the majority leader was there and is there. I am not \ngoing to repeat it because I have already quoted it twice--but that \nassurance that other amendments, besides the ones he has talked about \npublicly, will be in order. Again, I think everybody understands the \nrules of this place. Nonrelevant amendments can be offered. They have \nin the past on this bill, including by the Senator from Arizona, who \noffered a very nonrelevant amendment against the wishes of Senator \nWarner, an amendment having to do with campaign finance reform not too \nmany years ago. That amendment, although nonrelevant, was passed by \nthis body. I supported that amendment, against the wishes of the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner.\n\n  There are dozens of nonrelevant amendments which have been offered on \nthe Defense authorization bill. To suggest somehow or other that only \nbegan last year when there was a--or on the last bill--when there was a \ndebate on hate crimes is inaccurate. It was not a debate on the \naddition of the hate crimes amendment which began the consideration of \nnonrelevant amendments on the Defense authorization bill. As a matter \nof fact, it was the fourth time the hate crimes amendment was adopted \non the Defense authorization bill. The first time was when Senator \nThurmond was chairman of the committee, against his wishes but \nnonetheless adopted. There are literally dozens of other nonrelevant \namendments that have been considered. Why? Because the rules of the \nSenate permit consideration of nonrelevant amendments on bills.\n  This is one of the few authorization bills that needs to be passed, \nnot just because it supports the troops, critical not only in wartime \nbut generally, but also because of the rules of this body requiring \nthere be an authorization bill for defense for a number of specific \nmatters, including military construction.\n  So our hope is we can begin consideration of this bill. I am going to \ngive the reasons why we need to consider this bill in a few moments. \nBut, again, I wish to assure colleagues there is plenty of opportunity \nto prevent this bill from being adopted if there is not adequate \nconsideration of amendments\n\n[[Page S7236]]\n\nthat people may want to offer--relevant amendments and, yes, \nnonrelevant amendments--because the rules of the Senate permit the \nconsideration of nonrelevant amendments. So I hope we can get the votes \nof 60 Senators this afternoon to begin consideration of this bill.\n  We have enacted a Defense authorization bill every year for the last \n48 years. We have done so because the bill always contains important \nbipartisan measures to improve the compensation and quality of life of \nour men and women in uniform, provides our troops the equipment and \nsupport they need in ongoing military operations around the world, and \nenhances the oversight and efficiency of DOD operations. Yesterday \nafternoon, I described in detail many such measures that are included \nin this year's bill.\n  Before I continue, I do have a parliamentary inquiry as to what the \ntime situation is: How many minutes are there available prior to the \nrecess for the caucuses, and what is the division of that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls 36\\1/2\\ minutes and the \nminority 40 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So the majority has 36 minutes; is that what I understand?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So I yield myself 10 additional minutes, Mr. President.\n  This bill includes a handful of contentious provisions which were \nadopted during the course of the markup. There always are contentious \nprovisions in this bill, and the reason we are here is to debate those \nprovisions. Hopefully, we will have that opportunity.\n  Some of the provisions in the bill I support, some of the provisions \nI objected to in committee and I voted against them. But we should not \ndeny the Senate the opportunity to take up a bill which is essential \nfor the men and women in the military because we disagree with some \nprovisions in the bill.\n  These are legitimate issues for debate, and the Senate should debate \nthem. But the only way we can debate and vote on the issue--the various \nissues, contentious and otherwise--is if the Senate proceeds to the \nbill.\n  It has been argued that we should not proceed to consider this bill \nfor a number of reasons: One, because of the don't ask, don't tell \nprovision in the bill. Another one is because there was a cut in the \nbill to the money requested by the administration for the Iraqi \nSecurity Forces Fund. It has been argued there is ``wasteful'' spending \nthat was added by the Armed Services Committee. Another issue is \nbecause of the likelihood that nonrelevant amendments, such as the \nDREAM Act, will be offered.\n  First, as to don't ask, don't tell, the Secretary of Defense and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs informed our committee in February that \nthey support the President's decision to work with Congress to repeal \nthe existing law. Secretary Gates said:\n\n       The question before us is not whether the military prepares \n     to make this change, but . . . how we best prepare for it.\n\n  The committee held two hearings on don't ask, don't tell policy and \nquestioned numerous other witnesses in other hearings about the policy \nas they came before the committee. The amendment of the policy was \ndebated on and voted on in the Armed Services Committee. It is clearly \nrelevant to the bill because the original policy was adopted as a \nprovision of the fiscal year 1994 Defense Authorization Act after being \ndebated and voted in the committee 15 years ago.\n  The argument, then, is made that it is inappropriate for us to act on \ndon't ask, don't tell before the Department of Defense has completed \nits review of the issue. But the provision that is in this bill and the \nprovision we adopted in committee doesn't tie the military to any \nspecific course of action. There will not be any change to the law or \nto the military's policy before the Department has completed its \ncomprehensive review and considered the comprehensive survey of the \nforce now underway. Even when that review has been completed, under our \nbill, no change can take place until and unless the President, \nSecretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nconsider the results of the review, and only if then they can certify \nto the Senate and the Congress that the change can be implemented in a \nmanner that is consistent with standards of military readiness, \nmilitary effectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and retention.\n  That certification, if it is not made, then will result in this \npolicy not changing. Only if the President, the Secretary of Defense, \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, obviously in consultation, as the \nlaw provides, with the Chiefs of Staff--only then, if the certification \nis made that our standards of military readiness, military \neffectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and retention can be \nmaintained, will this law be changed.\n  The Senate should debate and vote on don't ask, don't tell as we \ndebated the original provision on that issue. As I understand it, by \nthe way, one amendment that has been filed is a motion to strike. But \namendments are not limited to that. The majority leader specifically \nsaid there may be other amendments relative to don't ask, don't tell \nthat would also be able to be considered. But only if we can get to the \nbill can we consider those other amendments. We are not going to have \nthe opportunity to debate this issue and vote unless we proceed to the \nbill.\n  As to the cut in the money requested for the Iraqi Security Forces \nFund, I pointed out yesterday this decision was consistent with the \npreviously expressed view of the Congress and the Armed Services \nCommittee that the Government of Iraq should assume a greater \nresponsibility for the financial burden of building Iraqi security \nforces as U.S. forces draw down. Iraq, according to a GAO analysis we \njust received, has a cumulative budget surplus of $52 billion through \nthe end of fiscal year 2009, and as much as $5 billion in unspent \nsecurity funds. It is well positioned to pay for its own military \nequipment instead of coming to the American taxpayers for large \nhandouts.\n  This issue was debated and voted on in the committee. There was an \namendment of the Senator from Arizona to strike $1 billion, which we \nadded for our military, and provide the money, under his amendment, to \nthe Iraqi Government instead. What we did is, we had a request for $2 \nbillion. We reduced that to $1 billion. The Senator's amendment was to \nrestore the $1 billion. We defeated that amendment in committee after \ndebate by a vote of 15 to 10.\n  I know the Senator is disappointed in that outcome, but that is what \ndebates are for. The Senate should debate and vote on the issue, but we \nare not going to be able to do that unless we proceed to the bill.\n  As to the ``wasteful'' funding that the Senator from Arizona says was \nadded by the committee, yesterday I gave a detailed accounting of how \nthe committee proposes to spend the money for added force structure, \nforce modernization, and quality of life for our troops. The Senator \nresponded and gave several examples of what he considered to be \nwasteful spending. Well, let's take a look at some of those. The \nSenator--by the way, we added $4 billion. We made cuts and we added. We \nmade changes of $4 billion in that budget request for force structure, \nforce modernization, and support of the troops. The wasteful spending \nlist of the Senator yesterday was $28 million out of $4 billion. \nApparently, $4 billion was a pretty good spending decision when \nquestions were raised about $28 million.\n  Let's look at some of the $28 million that is labeled wasteful \nspending: $3 million because it was for a ``plant-based vaccine \ndevelopment.'' This effort that we are supporting, an additional $4 \nmillion, has been identified by the military as the most promising path \nso far to rapidly produce the millions of vaccine doses that could be \nneeded to respond to a biological threat against our troops on the \nbattlefield. And $8 million was pointed to by the Senator, which is \ngoing to a physical fitness center at an Air Force base. That fitness \ncenter has been identified by the Air Force as being mission essential.\n  These are not porkbarrel items added by Senators who just want \nspending in their States. These items have been identified by the \nmilitary as being essential items for them. It wasn't in the budget. \nThey could not find the money. We did.\n  The Senator questioned the proposed spending of $7.6 million for a \nquiet propulsion load house. I doubt that too\n\n[[Page S7237]]\n\nmany Members of the Senate know what a quiet propulsion load house is. \nIt is a place where we test our ships to make sure that they meet \nrequirements for avoiding enemy detection. The Navy said it ``requires \nnew ship propulsion technology to be sufficiently tested, evaluated, \nand certified to ensure that signature performance goals and objectives \nare met prior to fleet introduction and operational use.''\n  The Navy says the current equipment does not have the capability to \ntest and evaluate either reduced or full-scale electric propulsion \nmotors with the necessary quiet load machine to approve and certify \nelectric propulsion technology and design. The Navy says it needs the \nnew facility to be operational within the next 5 years.\n  I believe the 10 minutes I have allocated to myself is up. So I will \nwithhold further comment on the arguments made against the bill.\n  My main point is the time to debate can only come if we can get to \nthe bill. That is the issue this afternoon, not whether issues are \ndebated--they are and there are plenty of issues to be debated, not as \nto whether issues will be debated. They will be, and the majority \nleader has said so. To try to get an agreement in advance on what \namendments will be in order before the bill comes up and amendments are \nfiled is a task that cannot be achieved. Only the intention can be \nstated to allow that to happen. The majority leader has stated that \nintention and the ways to implement it. There is plenty of leverage to \nstop the bill from passing if there is inadequate opportunity. We will \nget to the bill only if 60 Senators decide we should move to its \nconsideration before the recess on the Defense authorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe the chairman has agreed that he \nand I would have 5 minutes each before the vote this afternoon; is that \ntrue?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding there will be a \nmodification. There is no objection on this side to the following: that \nthe unanimous consent agreement we previously entered into would be \nmodified so the vote would occur at 2:30, and the time between 2:15 and \n2:30 would be equally divided. I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues on this \nside, we will recognize in the proper order as we go from one side to \nthe other: On my side Senator Inhofe would be recognized for 10 \nminutes, Senator Brown for 5 minutes, Senator Sessions for 5 minutes, \nSenator Chambliss for 5 minutes, and Senator LeMieux for 5 minutes. I \nbelieve that comes out to approximately 40 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear why I am opposed to moving to \nthe National Defense Authorization Act of fiscal year 2011 at this \ntime.\n  I am not opposed in principle to bringing up this Defense bill and \ndebating it, amending it, and voting on it. I am not opposed to having \na full and informed debate on whether to repeal the don't ask, don't \ntell law and then allowing the Senate to legislate.\n  What I am opposed to is bringing up the Defense bill now, before the \nDefense Department has concluded its survey of our men and women in \nuniform, which gives them a chance to tell us their views about don't \nask, don't tell. Whether you agree or disagree with this policy, \nwhether you want to keep it or repeal it, the Senate should not be \nforced to make this decision now, before we have heard from our troops. \nWe have asked for their views, and we should wait to hear from them and \nthen give their views the fullest consideration before taking any \nlegislative action.\n  This isn't just my view. This is the view of all force service \nchiefs: GEN George Casey, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army; ADM Gary \nRoughead, Chief of Naval Operations; GEN James Conway, Commandant of \nthe Marine Corps; GEN Norton Schwartz, Chief of Staff of the Air Force.\n  Let me quote from my colleague, GEN George Casey. Remember, these are \nthe service chiefs who are responsible for the training, equipment, \nmorale, and well-being of the men and women in uniform who serve under \nthem. What did General Casey say? He said this:\n\n       I remain convinced that it is critically important to get a \n     better understanding of where our soldiers and families are \n     on this issue, and what the impacts on readiness and unit \n     cohesion might be, so that I can provide informed military \n     advice to the President and the Congress. I also believe that \n     repealing the law before the completion of the review will be \n     seen by the men and women of the Army as a reversal of our \n     commitment to hear their views before moving forward.\n\n  The survey is not complete and will not be complete for some time.\n  Admiral Gary Roughead said this:\n\n       We need this review to fully assess our force and carefully \n     examine potential impacts of a change in the law. My concern \n     is that legislative changes at this point, regardless of the \n     precise language used, may cause confusion on the status of \n     the law and the Fleet and disrupt the review process itself \n     by leading Sailors to question whether their input matters.\n\n  GEN James Conway, Commandant of the Marine Corps, said:\n\n       I encourage the Congress to let the process the Secretary \n     of Defense created to run its course. Collectively, we must \n     make logical and pragmatic decisions about the long-term \n     policies of our Armed Forces--which so effectively defend \n     this great nation.\n\n  GEN Norton Schwartz, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, said:\n\n       I believe it is important, a matter of keeping faith with \n     those currently serving in the Armed Forces, that the \n     Secretary of Defense commissioned review be completed before \n     there is any legislation to repeal the Don't Ask, Don't Tell \n     law. Such action allows me to provide the best military \n     advice to the President, and sends an important signal to our \n     Airmen and their families that their opinion matters. To do \n     otherwise, in my view, would be presumptive and would reflect \n     an intent to act before all relevant factors are assessed, \n     digested and understood.\n\n  It could not be more clear what our uniformed service chiefs are \nsaying: Complete this review before repealing the law.\n  Then the question is: Why would the chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and the majority leader ignore the very explicit \nrecommendation of the four service chiefs? One can only draw one \nconclusion: November 2 is a few days away. The President of the United \nStates, we all know, made a commitment to the gay and lesbian community \nthat he would have as one of his priorities repeal of the don't ask, \ndon't tell policy. Looking at a bleak electoral situation, they are now \ngoing to jam this legislation through--or try to--in direct \ncontravention to the views of our service chiefs.\n  I spend a great deal of time with the men and women in the military. \nIt is my job. It is my job to do so, both the Guard and Reserve in \nArizona and traveling around the world to visit our men and women in \nplaces such as Kandahar, Baghdad, and other places around the world. \nEvery place I go, the men and women are saying: Look, let's assess the \nimpact of the repeal of this law. I get that from the senior enlisted \nmen whose responsibilities are great. Why are we now trying to jam this \nthrough without the survey being completed and without a proper \nassessment of its impact?\n  I urge Members not to vote in favor of bringing the bill to the floor \nat this time so the troops can be heard. Let us hear from the men and \nwomen who are serving in the military.\n  I remind my colleagues that last year, they brought up the hate \ncrimes bill and then put amendments on the hate crimes bill so there \nwere no other amendments allowed until the hate crimes issue was \nresolved. That is the concern of the Senator from Maine, that the \nmajority leader and/or the chairman will fill up the tree--in other \nwords, make it so other amendments are not allowed until this issue is \ndisposed of and then, of course, other issues.\n  In light of all the challenges that the Defense authorization bill \nentails--training, equipment, pay, benefits, all of the aspects of \nDefense authorizations that are so vital--why would the majority leader \nand the chairman want to bring up don't ask, don't tell, then the DREAM \nAct, then secret holds, and then reserve the rest of the issues for \nafter we come back after the election?\n  Again, one can only draw the conclusion that this is all about \nelections, not about the welfare and well-being and the morale and the \nbattle effectiveness of the men and women who are\n\n[[Page S7238]]\n\nlaying it on the line in Iraq and Afghanistan today.\n  The most fundamental thing we could do to honor the sacrifices of our \ntroops is to take the time to listen respectfully and carefully to what \nthey have to say about this major change before the Senate takes any \nlegislative action.\n  If the Senate goes down this path, we would be ignoring the views of \nthe troops and casting aside the professional military advice given by \neach of the four service chiefs, all four of whom oppose the Senate \ntaking any action on don't ask, don't tell before we hear from the \ntroops.\n  By the way, the way the legislation is framed, the service chiefs are \nnot involved in the final decision; only the President, the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense are. Why in the \nworld before the certification is made would not the service chiefs be \nrequired to certify that as well?\n  This is not about filibustering. It is not about the reasons why we \nare not taking up this legislation or why I am opposing this \nlegislation. It is all about the battle effectiveness, the morale of \nthe men and women who are serving in the military today who have \nvolunteered to put their lives on the line so the rest of us may live \nin a safe and secure environment. We owe them a right to have their \nvoices heard before we act legislatively, motivated by the upcoming \nelection.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we do alternate when there are Members who \nwish to speak. That would be the appropriate course. So I will yield \nmyself 5 minutes to respond to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I want to quote Admiral Mullen. Admiral Mullen reached \na conclusion about the necessity to change this policy. He reached this \nconclusion, I hope and believe, without any regard to an election \ncoming up. Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in \nfront of our committee back in February said the following:\n\n       It is my personal belief that allowing gays and lesbians to \n     serve openly would be the right thing to do. No matter how I \n     look at this issue, I cannot escape being troubled by the \n     fact that we have in place a policy that forces men and women \n     to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow \n     citizens. To me personally, it comes down to integrity, \n     theirs as individuals and ours as an institution.\n\n  To suggest that Admiral Mullen somehow or another reached his \nconclusion because there is an election coming up it seems to me would \nbe totally inappropriate, and I hope no one is making that suggestion. \nHe reached a conclusion about gays and lesbians serving in the \nmilitary. He stated his conclusion. Election driven, insulting? Of \ncourse not. He reached a conclusion--so did Secretary Gates--reached a \nconclusion that this policy must change. Because an election is coming \nup, Secretary Gates, a Republican, decides this policy must change \nbecause there is an election coming up? Of course not. It is because \nthey reached a conclusion that the policy needs to change, and the \nstudy they got underway is to determine how to implement that change.\n  What do we do in our bill? What we say in our bill is very explicitly \nthere is not going to be a change in policy unless and until there is a \ncertification from the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs and the President of the United States that the changes in \npolicy, which they are going to presumably provide, will not undermine \nthe morale, the recruiting, the retention of troops in the United \nStates.\n  Our bill that is in front of us specifically says there will be no \nchange in policy unless and until that certification comes. We want to \nhear from the troops also--the way the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff wants to hear from the troops, the way the Secretary of Defense \nwants to hear from the troops--as to how to implement a change in \npolicy. And we go beyond that. We say there will not be a change in \npolicy unless and until there is a certification from the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs that there will be no negative impact on morale, \nretention, and recruitment. That, it seems to me, is a totally \nappropriate way to legislate. That does pay respect to the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces.\n  Unless the opponents of this language suggest that Admiral Mullen, \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and Secretary Gates, who have reached \na conclusion that this policy must change, unless they are suggesting \nthat their conclusion is driven by elections, it seems to me it is \nwrong to suggest the fight legislatively is election driven.\n  Was the decision to implement this policy 15 years ago election \ndriven? No, it was based on a decision at that time that don't ask, \ndon't tell was the right policy. I did not think it was. I voted \nagainst it. But the decision was made.\n  To argue now that it is all about elections misunderstands the \nimportance of this issue, the significance of this issue, and what the \npeople of this country have come to understand, which is the service by \ngays and lesbians is just as valued as the service by others. Giving \ntheir lives up for the country, being buried in Arlington Cemetery, as \ngays and lesbians are, who have had the uniform of this country on, is \nthe ultimate sacrifice citizens can make for this country. Gays and \nlesbians have made this sacrifice, and nongays and lesbians, obviously, \nhave made this sacrifice too.\n  One other point. Is my time up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will stay within the time given me. We \nhave all had to reduce our time on this side. We have many Members who \nwish to speak.\n  Let me cover a couple of points and respond to statements made by the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  I was around in 1993. Actually, it was the last year I was serving in \nthe House, and I was on the House Armed Services Committee. I remember \nvery well when the gay lobby started becoming active during that time \nduring the Clinton administration. They said: We want to change the \npolicy. That is why they went through this policy called don't ask, \ndon't tell, which allows people to serve regardless of what their \nconditions are, their preferences are, but they do not talk about it. \nThey do not use the military as a forum to advance their liberal \nagenda.\n  It seemed to work. In the law--and it is still the law today--section \n571 reads--this was passed in 1993, 17 years ago:\n\n       The presence in the armed forces of persons who demonstrate \n     a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts would \n     create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, \n     good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the \n     essence of military capability.\n\n  I was one who applauded Secretary Gates--this is back on February \n10--when he said we are not going to be doing anything to change it \nuntil we study it and, most important--and this is the whole issue, I \nbelieve--we hear from those in the field, we hear from the troops in \nthe field. These are the guys who have gone through this. They \nunderstand what it is all about. And they were told they would be \nheard. That is the whole idea, that we would not do anything until \nDecember 1 when all the results were in.\n  I am a product of the U.S. Army. I served proudly in the U.S. Army, \nand I can tell you right now, there are some reasons in the military \nwhy this would not work.\n  Senator McCain covered the statements that were made by the service \nchiefs, but they are worth looking at again. It is very significant \nthat these service chiefs were outspoken in their opposition to \nchanging this policy or to repealing don't ask, don't tell. It is \ndifficult for a general in the armed services to go against a \nPresident.\n  I remember in 1998 when GEN John Jumper was strong enough to stand up \nand say what was happening in the Clinton administration in terms of \ndownsizing of the military. It took a lot of courage. But the other \nthing that is--and a lot of things have been said about Secretary Gates \nand Admiral Mullen, but they will be the most instrumental in this. \nHere is what their philosophy was. This is a statement I will read, and \nI want everyone to listen carefully. This is from the Secretary of \nDefense--Gates--and Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. They said, jointly:\n\n\n[[Page S7239]]\n\n\n\n       We believe, in the strongest possible terms, that the \n     Department must, prior to any legislative action, be allowed \n     the opportunity to conduct a thorough, objective, and \n     systematic assessment of the impact of such a policy change.\n\n  What they are talking about is the study we said was going to take \nplace. But then, wait a minute, something happened. Three things \nhappened 1 month later. This statement was made April 28. Then 1 month \nlater, on May 27, three things happened. What are those three things? \nFirst of all, Gates and Mullen agreed to this compromise and then \ntotally reversed their position of just 1 month before. Now, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee was talking about their \nposition. This was their position, and yet they reversed it at the same \ntime on the same day--May 27--that the House voted to repeal don't ask, \ndon't tell. There were a couple of conditions there, and the Senate did \nthe same thing, with one exception--one Senator in the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. It was right down party lines. In other words, \nevery Republican Senator but one opposed this idea of repealing this \nwithout going through the study. The study is the critical thing. We \nhave to go through the study before we would be in a position to know \nwhat those in the field want to do. I think this is very critical \nbecause it is not a matter of what you want to do with this, it is a \nmatter of hearing from the troops in the field.\n  Let's put up the next chart. People are saying: Well, don't worry \nabout it. The Senator from Michigan just said: Don't worry about it \nbecause, first of all, it has to be certified that there is no negative \nimpact on readiness. It is going to be certified by Mullen and Gates \nand the President.\n  But wait a minute--certified? They have already made up their minds.\n  Look, here is the most important--Admiral Mullen said:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, speaking for myself, it is my personal belief \n     that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would be the \n     right thing to do.\n\n  He is the one who is supposed to certify this. He has already \ncertified it. It is right here. When they say that 60 days after the \nfirst of December, that certification has to take place, it has already \nhappened.\n  Secretary Gates says:\n\n       I fully support the President's decision. The question \n     before us is not whether the military prepares to make this \n     change, but how we best prepare for it.\n\n  There you have it. Both of them are saying the same thing. They are \nsaying: Well, we have already made up our minds. They are the ones \ncertifying. And the third party, of course, is the President, and the \nPresident's position is very well known on that issue.\n  So I think this whole thing is so phony when they talk about this \ncertification, but the reason I want to get in as much as I can in the \nlimited 10 minutes is to let you know that it is not the only thing \nthat happened on May 27. I call it black Thursday because not only did \nthey vote to repeal the policy that has worked so well for the last 17 \nyears in terms of gays in the military, but they also passed an \nabortion amendment that allows abortions in military hospitals.\n  Now, very quickly, this has been going on--it has been changed for \nmany years. In 1970, an Executive order allowed abortions in DOD \nhospitals. In 1984, Bob Dornan--remember B-1 Bob? A lot of us remember \nhim. He changed it and tried to limit the abortions in government \nhospitals. In 1988, DOD hospitals barred abortions from the military \nfacilities. President Clinton changed that and relaxed the laws. Then \nin 1996 the authorization bill reversed Clinton, and therefore they \nwere not able to have abortions in military hospitals. Now, that is the \nlaw as it is today. But there is an amendment--and we have not even \ntalked about this amendment--that is going to open the military \nhospitals for abortions.\n  I had the honor of addressing this Values Summit last Friday, and I \ncan tell you right now that the people there, when they heard about all \nof this that was in this bill, were pretty shocked. And the question \ncame up, Why is it that we keep hearing over and over what is in this \nbill?\n  Let's get the next chart up there. Why are they so anxious to get \nthis thing on the floor when we are not going to be able to have \namendments? We all know what the rules are around here. To my \nknowledge, since I first came to Congress, this is the first time we \nwill have an authorization bill where we will not have a chance to \namend it, where we won't have a chance to offer amendments. Normally, \nthere are 100 or so amendments. A lot are agreed to, and our positions \nare heard. Not this time.\n  First of all, I think this is a political mistake. It is a dumb thing \nto do, to try to use the Defense authorization bill in times of war to \nadvance a liberal agenda. What is that liberal agenda? That agenda is \nto have open gays serving in the military, it is taxpayer-funded \nabortions in our military hospitals, and it is amnesty for illegals. I \nthink they are making a mistake. I agree with the Senator from Arizona \nthat it is totally political. It is all set up for the November 2 \nelection. And I can assure you that all of America is watching, and \nthey don't think the Defense authorization bill, in times of war, is \nthe appropriate thing to do to advance a far-left liberal agenda--an \nopen gay policy in the military, taxpayer-funded abortions, and amnesty \nfor illegals.\n  With that, Mr. President, I have used my 10 minutes, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I believe by unanimous consent we have an \norder of speakers, and I think the next one is--well, I will let \nSenator McCain speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 minutes remaining for the \nRepublicans and 19 minutes for the Democrats.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout a very important piece of legislation before this body, and that \nis, obviously, the Defense authorization bill--a bill that provides the \ntools and resources for our men and women serving in the military.\n  It has been my honor to serve on the Armed Services Committee with \nthe chairman, who is sitting right here. Being the new person on the \nblock, I have greatly enjoyed the back-and-forth of that committee \nprocess and the fair and free way we are able to debate amendments--\nsome of which passed and some didn't. But always, at the end of the \nday, there was a handshake and a smile, and we would go on and do our \nbusiness.\n  I remember a lot of us, especially the newer people, asking about our \nconcerns, which haven't been addressed here, and I remember the \nchairman saying that we would be able to handle these things during the \nbill process when it came to the floor. That was the general consensus \nby Senator McCain and others--don't worry, we will handle a lot of \nthese things on the floor. So I was actually looking forward to that \nfair and open process, similar to what we did during the financial \nreform bill.\n  Unfortunately, what has traditionally been a very open and bipartisan \nprocess has, in fact, evolved into a dynamic display of political grand\nstanding. My question is, What happened? I feel the majority party is \nusing our men and women in uniform as a tactic to pass politically \nexpedient legislation entirely unrelated to the Defense authorization \nbill, which, in my view, is not appropriate.\n  There has been much discussion by the leader about his plan to add \nthe DREAM Act as an amendment to the Defense bill. Let me be clear: I \nam willing to debate the merits of the DREAM Act, and even \ncomprehensive immigration reform, but not in a manner that exploits our \nmen and women who are serving in the military by using legislation that \nis supposed to be solely focused on supporting them, and additionally \nnot allowing for that open amendment process that I thought was \npromised to us during the committee process and something I have \nunderstood as being part of the very important history of this body.\n\n  As my colleague from Arizona pointed out yesterday on the floor, the \nextraneous legislation the leader intends to attach to the Defense \nauthorization\n\n[[Page S7240]]\n\nbill would never, ever be referred to the Armed Services Committee if \nit was introduced independently. In the past, the authors of the \nDefense bill, led by Senator Levin and Senator McCain, have been \nallowed to come to the floor and debate the process and enact necessary \npieces of legislation that keep our men and women in the armed services \nsafe and keep the military going. It is a traditional custom that, by \nand large, has been shunned. It has been shunned for political \ngamesmanship and posturing in favor of advancing the defense \nauthorization process.\n  Once again, Mr. President, as the new person here--well, I guess the \nsecond newest person here now--it is an incredible but not surprising \nturn of events that we have suddenly decided to refuse an open debate \non the things we have been working on for some time--certainly since I \nhave been here. An amendment process would allow for everyone's ideas \nto be considered, as we did during the financial reform and as we did \nduring the actual committee process itself.\n  Not only have the authors of the bill been effectively shut out, but \nso has every other Senator. Are my needs and the concerns of \nMassachusetts not the same as the majority leader's needs or the \nPresident's needs? We have issues that affect Massachusetts, and all \nthe other Senators have needs that affect their States that they feel \ncan contribute to the men and women and the way they serve and are \nprotected. When an issue as critical as our national defense comes to \nthe Senate floor, we should absolutely allow for an open process. This \nis too important an issue to cut off debate and control the process. I \nknow it is football season, but we should not use this as a political \nfootball. It is inappropriate.\n  On another issue of critical importance, as I said before, we spent 4 \nweeks on the financial reform legislation, and we had over 30 votes on \nthat particular bill. When the process was over, everyone was able to \noffer any amendments they wanted. I am disappointed that we are not \nhaving that same opportunity here. We should absolutely go through that \nsame process.\n  In closing, I am hopeful that in the days ahead we will turn our \nfocus back to jobs and the economy, where we can start listening to the \nAmerican people, who are demanding we focus on reducing our Nation's \ndebt, our out-of-control spending, lowering taxes on individuals and \nfamilies, and getting our economy moving again. I believe that is the \nbiggest national security issue we have in front of us right now--\nmaking sure we have the economic engine to not only continue with our \neconomic strength throughout this world but obviously providing the \ntools and resources for our men and women who are serving.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Brown for his \nservice on the committee. He has been invaluable to the committee, and \nI very much appreciate that.\n  The Senator's statement that he favors an open process is one that I \nshare. That is why I talked to the majority leader, and the majority \nleader made a statement last Thursday which I hope the Senator from \nMassachusetts would look at relative to the process. The majority \nleader has talked about a number of amendments which he would like to \nsee offered and would intend to offer. That is his right, as it is the \nright of any Senator.\n  Last year, we adopted the hate crimes bill, which was a nonrelevant \namendment. There was some objection to it. Many years ago, when the \nSenator from Arizona offered a campaign finance amendment to the \nDefense authorization bill--totally nonrelevant--Senator Warner, \nsitting right over here, very much objected to it. He said it would \nsink the bill. It did not sink the bill, by the way; it was passed by \nthe Senate--nonrelevant. And we have adopted other nonrelevant \namendments on this bill and other bills because the rules of the Senate \nallow for nonrelevant amendments.\n  As to whether this process is going to be open to other amendments, I \nassure the Senator from Massachusetts it will be, and I will make sure \nI do everything in my power to see that happens. That is why the \nmajority leader, last Thursday, assured the Senate--and these were his \nwords:\n\n       In addition to issues that I have talked about in the last \n     couple of days, there are many other important matters that \n     both sides of the aisle wish to address. I am willing to work \n     with Republicans on a process that will permit the Senate to \n     consider these matters and complete the bill as soon as \n     possible.\n\n  So Senator Reid was giving the assurance that other amendments \nbesides the three he has identified publicly are going to be in order. \nHe is not going to try to cut off debate.\n  As chairman of this committee, I have, for 30 years now, fought to \nmake sure this bill was open to amendments, and I will continue to do \nthat. Last year, I think there were something like 60 amendments. So \nthere is not going to be an effort to cut off debate on amendments \nwhich Members of the Senate want to offer that is different from any \nother time when this process is used.\n  We have to manage a bill. We have to get a bill passed. After there \nis debate on a bill, there comes a time when the majority leader says \nto the managers: We have to get a bill passed. You have to find some \nway we can get a bill passed. Then we enter into, hopefully, unanimous \nconsent agreements, where we work out how many amendments are left on \neach side. That is what our intention is to do here, too--to work out \nthese kinds of agreements as this matter unfolds.\n  But the issue now is whether we are going to get to debate the bill, \nwhether we can get to the point where we can offer amendments and reach \nagreements on what amendments are left that would be in order and on \ntime agreements. We can't get to that point unless we are allowed to \nproceed to the bill.\n  As far as I am concerned, it is totally inaccurate to say the men and \nwomen in uniform are being in some way not respected by proceeding to \nthis bill. If we cannot debate this bill this year, if we cannot offer \na motion to change don't ask, don't tell language, strike the language, \nwhatever, then we are not taking up the bill which is so critical to \nthe men and women in uniform. This bill is critical to them.\n  If there are Members here who want to strike or modify don't ask, \ndon't tell, the time to do it is when we get to the bill. We cannot do \nit now. We cannot amend this bill now unless we get to the bill. There \nis no point, it seems to me, in talking about the need to amend the \nbill--which I happen to agree is in order--unless we get to the bill. \nIt becomes a theoretical statement that something will or will not \nhappen, unless we can get to the bill.\n  I do not know of a time when there has been a filibuster against \ngetting to the Defense authorization bill. No matter how contentious \nissues have been, and they have been contentious over the years, the \nidea that there is a filibuster against proceeding to the bill so we \ncannot debate the kinds of issues which need to be debated, it seems to \nme, is what denies the men and women in uniform the opportunity to get \na bill passed that is so important to them.\n  We need to get to this bill. We need to make progress on this bill. I \nbelieve, as the majority leader has said,--I believe what he said--that \nthis is not going to be the kind of closed process which some have \nsuggested and imputed to him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We are depriving the men and women in uniform from having \na voice in this by short-circuiting a process by passing legislation \nbefore the study is completed. That is a fact. That is the view of all \nfour service chiefs, and I read it and I will continue to put it in the \nRecord.\n  Senator Sessions, I believe, is next?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will yield myself 30 seconds.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has reached a conclusion, \nthe Secretary of Defense has reached a conclusion--that this policy \nshould be changed. It should be. We ought to debate it. Whether to \nchange this policy, how it is changed--how it is implemented is what \nthey set in motion, a\n\n[[Page S7241]]\n\nstudy to help them decide. That is the process they agreed to.\n  Have they offended or insulted the men and women of the Armed Forces \nby concluding that this policy should change? Has the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs, Admiral Mullen, somehow, in some way, not taken into \nconsideration the well-being of the men and women of the Armed Forces \nwhen he concluded this policy should change? Has Secretary Gates been \nguided by elections coming up when he concluded that this policy should \nchange and that the study that is underway should be taken in order to \ndetermine how to implement that change?\n  I don't consider that they have offended or insulted the men and \nwomen they command. This language surely protects exactly what \nSecretary Gates and Admiral Mullen have put into motion--a study as to \nhow to implement a change in policy. That is what this study is all \nabout. That is what we require be completed prior to any change in the \npolicy.\n  We have gone a step beyond--a step beyond--requiring that they \ncertify--obviously, after consultations with the Chiefs of Staff; that \nis required by law--that they certify that there will not be a negative \nimpact on morale, recruitment, or retention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is a policy of the President of the \nUnited States. He determined to change the policy that has been in \neffect for quite a number of years, and by all accounts has been \nworking very well. All four service chiefs favor keeping that policy. \nHe selected Admiral Mullen. He selected Secretary Gates, who has not \nbeen an enthusiastic supporter of this change, frankly. He has gone \nalong with the Commander in Chief who appointed him. He has indicated \nthat we ought to have a study first--made a commitment, really, to our \nmen and women in uniform that there would be a study first, and we are \nnot running an objective study.\n  So Admiral Mullen did testify he personally believed this was a \nchange that ought to be made. But the Army Chief of Staff, General \nCasey; the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Roughead; Air Force Chief \nof Staff Schwartz; the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Conway; \nand now General Amos--who just testified this morning will be replacing \nGeneral Conway--oppose it and believe we owe it at least to the men and \nwomen in uniform to study the impact this might have. I just believe it \nis not necessary to ram this through this fast before we complete a \nstudy. I oppose that.\n  We had reports of a general--he has denied how he was quoted in the \nWashington Times, General Bostick, in Europe, who made statements that \nupset a very large group of people--he is a personnel general, three \nstars--about how everybody had to go along with this agenda, be on \nboard with it, and suggested, according to the article, you would not \nbe able to stay in the military if you were not endorsing this \nproposal. He said it was the equivalent of civil rights and you were \nbeing a bigot if you somehow had a different view.\n  I just think that is dangerous. To say this is not going to have a \ncorrosive impact on the men and women in the military is a mistake. I \nthink it is being raised up in importance and being raised up in the \npotential to damage the military by the fact that it is being rammed \nthrough before a fair and objective review of the policy is conducted.\n  I believe that firmly. If this is going to be changed it ought to be \ndone respectfully, carefully, not moved through right now on this bill \nbecause of fear that the study will not be positive and it will not be \nable to be passed next year, maybe after the American people have sent \nsome new Senators to this Senate. Maybe then it will not be so popular \nand have so much support.\n  I am frustrated that I would have to vote against moving to the \nDefense authorization bill. Last year was the first time I did that \nbecause attached to the bill was an unrelated, controversial hate \ncrimes piece of legislation. I voted for bills that had other stuff in \nit I didn't agree with, but I try to be supportive. But I will not, and \nI urge my colleagues not to allow the Defense bill to be a train that \ncarries through controversial, unpopular pieces of legislation. It is \njust not the right thing for us to do, and we are going at it again \nthis year.\n  We have had a tradition of bipartisan support of Defense bills. I \nguess the first 12 years I was here we have always had massive \nbipartisan support, and I have signed them. This action is overriding \nthat tradition. It is not helpful.\n  I will just note, as the ranking Republican on the Judiciary \nCommittee, I am very disappointed that the majority leader has made \nclear that one of the amendments he is going to approve for us to vote \non would be the controversial, unpopular DREAM Act that has not had a \nhearing--at least in years that I can recall--in the Judiciary \nCommittee where it should be--to give amnesty to people who came into \nour country illegally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I urge my colleagues to vote against moving to this \nbill until it is cleaned up and does not have this controversial \nlegislation on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time is on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from GEN John \nShalikashvili, the retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 General John M.D.\n\n\n                                 Shalikashvili, USA (Retired),\n\n                               Steilacoom, WA, September 16, 2010.\n       Dear Senators: I am writing to urge the Senate to vote in \n     support of the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act. Each \n     element contained in the legislation that passed the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee is essential to the maintenance of a \n     strong, capable fighting force for our nation. Provisions in \n     the bill will ensure that our soldiers have the pay they \n     deserve and the equipment, training and support they need to \n     conduct their critical missions. In particular, I support the \n     DADT repeal language that passed through the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee earlier this year and is currently part of \n     the pending legislation.\n       The Pentagon is currently conducting a study on how to \n     implement a policy of open service. Congressional repeal is \n     vital for the Pentagon to implement their findings, whatever \n     they may be. As I have said before, repeal strikes down the \n     law that straitjackets military leaders' ability to craft a \n     sensible and practical policy about open service. Most \n     importantly, the current repeal language allows the Pentagon \n     the time it may need to answer any questions about how to \n     actually implement the change.\n       Additionally, repeal would allow military leaders to make \n     personnel decisions based on a person's skills, experience, \n     and overall job performance. Reflecting on my own service and \n     experience, I am quite confident that sexual orientation does \n     not impact a person's ability to defuse IEDs, provide medical \n     care for someone wounded in the line of duty, or translate \n     intercepted enemy intelligence into English.\n       Passing the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act, \n     including repealing DADT, would serve the interests of our \n     nation's security and all of its service men and women.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          John M.D. Shalikashvili.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me read just part of this letter.\n\n       I am writing to urge the Senate to vote in support of the \n     2001 national Defense Authorization Act. Each element \n     contained in the legislation that passed the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee is essential to the maintenance of a \n     strong, capable fighting force for our nation. Provisions in \n     the bill will ensure that our soldiers have the pay they \n     deserve and the equipment training and support they need to \n     conduct their critical missions. In particular, I support the \n     don't ask, don't tell repeal language that passed through the \n     Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year and is \n     currently part of the pending legislation.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       The pentagon is currently conducting a study in how to \n     implement a policy of open service. Congressional repeal is \n     vital for the Pentagon to implement their findings, whatever \n     they may be. As I have said before, repeal strikes down the \n     law that straightjackets military leaders' ability to craft a \n     sensible and practical policy about open service. Most \n     importantly, the current repeal language allows the Pentagon \n     the time it may need to answer any questions about how to \n     actually implement the change.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I have served in the Senate for 1 year. I \nhave watched the process of different pieces of legislation come to the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  One of the most frustrating things, to the American people and \ncertainly\n\n[[Page S7242]]\n\nfrustrating to me, is that we as Senators do not have the opportunity \nto offer amendments on these large pieces of legislation, legislation \nin this case that authorizes the actions of young men and women who are \nfighting to protect our safety and freedom around the world, that the \nSenator from Florida or Senator from Arizona or Senators from other \nStates cannot stand up and say: I have an idea. I have a proposal. I \nhave an amendment. Let it be aired in front of this body, let it be \ndebated, and let's see whether it rises or falls on its merits.\n  Instead, we get these rules that are closed where the majority leader \ncomes down and says: I am going to fill the tree, which is Senate \nparlance meaning: I am going to close off all debate except for on the \namendments I choose to put before the American people.\n  That is not right. That is why the American people are, in part, so \nfrustrated with Congress. We are not debating the issues that any \nindividual Senator may bring forth on behalf of their constituents on \nwhat they think is the right way to move forward. Instead, we are going \nto amendments on issues that should not be attached to this bill, in my \nopinion.\n  Don't ask, don't tell is a highly controversial amendment, one that \nhas not been debated, one that is not going to have the opportunity to \nhave the input of the military. We are supposed to be conducting a \nthorough examination and evaluation of the U.S. military before we make \nthis substantial policy change--while we are fighting two wars at the \nsame time. We are going to pass it and then see whether it is going to \nhave an impact on military readiness? Does anybody doubt what the \nconclusion will be if it is passed, what the military will then say?\n  If, for some reason, they had the courage and were able to have the \nfreedom to actually express their opinion, do you think this body would \nundo it? Instead of allowing us to have the process we are supposed to, \nwhere we are supposed to get a sense from the military about how it \nwill impact military readiness, we are going to pass, presumably, over \nthe opinion of the four chiefs of the different branches of the \nmilitary who oppose this measure, including General Amos, who will join \nnow as the Commandant of the Marines, this controversial measure.\n  Then we have the DREAM Act which, as my colleague from Alabama said, \nhas not gone through the Judiciary Committee. Many in my State support \nthe DREAM Act. It is a very difficult situation for kids who were \nbrought to this country by their parents, through no fault of their \nown, have gone through public school, now go to a university and may \nnot have the chance to stay and work in this country. I understand and \nI am sympathetic to that. But to attach that to this bill without \ntrying to fix the broken immigration system, without first securing our \nborders, is disingenuous and irresponsible.\n  So I, too, will not support moving forward on this Defense \nauthorization bill. This is not the way this Congress should act. This \nis not the way the process is supposed to work. It is unfair to the \nAmerican people. It is unfair to the members of the military. What \nshould happen is we should have an ability to bring any amendments \nforward that are germane to the Defense authorization bill and let them \nrise and fall on their merits.\n  What should not happen is that extraneous amendments that do not \nrelate to this issue be stuck on and that all debate be closed.\n  The American people are upset. They are frustrated with their \ngovernment. Their government is broken, and this is just another \nexample of how badly it needs to be fixed.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if what the Senator from Florida said is \ngoing to occur, it indeed would be a broken system. But the majority \nleader has said and said publicly that there are many other important \nmatters that both sides of the aisle wish to address other than the \nones he has raised himself, and he is willing to work with Republicans \non a process to permit the Senate to consider these matters and \ncomplete the bill as soon as possible.\n  I do not know exactly what the Senators are saying when they say this \nis a closed process, when the majority leader says, no, it is not. I \nmean, they want to debate amendments. You cannot debate amendments \nunless you get to the bill and offer amendments. I wish to debate \namendments too. There are provisions in this bill that I do not like \nthat I voted against in committee as chairman.\n  There are a number of provisions I would like to see stricken in this \nbill. But you cannot strike a provision or try to strike a provision \nbefore the bill is on the floor to debate. The issue here is whether \nthis filibuster against bringing this bill to the floor so we can \ndebate the amendments is going to succeed.\n  That is the issue today. Should we be able to debate amendments? You \nbet. I fought for that as long as I have been either chairman, ranking \nmember or member of the Armed Services Committee and other committees. \nOf course, we ought to be able to debate amendments.\n  But the debate today is whether we can get to the point where we can \ndebate amendments. People want to strike the language on don't ask, \ndon't tell. The only way we can get to that point, to strike or modify \nthat language, is if the filibuster does not succeed this afternoon; \notherwise we cannot get to that point.\n  We are debating now whether we can bring a bill to the floor so we \ncan do exactly what the Senator from Florida wants us to do, be able to \noffer amendments, be able to strike language, modify language, add \nlanguage.\n  As to whether nonrelevant amendments should be added, if we want to \nchange the rules of this Senate, offer an amendment to the rules. But \nthe rules of this Senate allow nonrelevant amendments to be offered, \nand dozens have been offered on Defense authorization bills, including \nby the Senator from Arizona, who about a decade ago offered a very \ncontentious amendment to change the campaign laws on terms of \ndisclosure.\n  The Senator, who was chairman of the Armed Services Committee, John \nWarner, argued passionately to the Senator from Arizona: Please, do not \noffer that to this bill. It could sink this bill. That was the argument \nof the chairman. The Senator from Arizona went ahead anyway, as was his \nright. By the way, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nacknowledged it was the right of the Senator from Arizona to offer \nnonrelevant amendments, and the Senator did that, the Senator from \nArizona. It was not the first time.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle have offered nonrelevant \namendments to the Defense authorization bill and to other bills because \nthat is their right. What is broken around here is the determination on \nthe part of the Republicans to not allow us to proceed to debate bills. \nThat is what is broken, in that the filibusters are now being used over \nand over and over in a way that they have never been used before, at \nleast in this quantity, to stop a bill from coming to the floor.\n  How do we debate the amendments which the Senator from Florida \nrightfully says we should debate unless we can get to the point where \nwe can debate them. We cannot debate them now. The bill is not before \nus. The question this afternoon is whether we are going to allow this \nbill to come before us so the Senate can do exactly what the Senate \nshould do, which is to have Senators be able to offer amendments, \ndebate those amendments, accept or defeat those amendments. That is \nwhat the Senate should be doing.\n  But we cannot do that if a filibuster denying the Senate an \nopportunity to debate the bill succeeds. Then we cannot do that. We \ncannot do what the Senator from Florida wants us to do, and I want us \nto do, to debate amendments, to have Senators be able to offer \namendments. That is the problem which we face more and more in this \nbody, and I deeply regret it.\n  I do not know how to change this system without changing the rules, \nwhich we are not going to be able to do. I do not know how we can \nprevent a filibuster succeeding or delaying the Senate from acting for \ndays and days and days, from being able to debate. Filibusters have \ntheir place, I believe, to protect the minority. They have their place \nso that the minority can be assured of extended debate. I have \nsupported that.\n  But the filibusters are being used now more and more to prevent us \nfrom debating, not to guarantee the opportunity to debate for the \nminority,\n\n[[Page S7243]]\n\nwhich is a legitimate function of the filibuster, but to prevent us \nfrom debating. This filibuster, if it succeeds this afternoon, is going \nto prevent us from debating the very issues which need to be debated. \nDon't ask, don't tell, we should debate it. We cannot debate it if we \ndo not get to the bill. The DREAM Act, should that be offered, should \nit not be offered? We cannot debate that unless we get to the bill.\n  As to the other provisions in this bill, one of the Senators \nmentioned the language about abortions. By the way, he said taxpayer-\npaid abortions, which is not in the bill, as I think the Senator from \nFlorida knows. It only allows abortions on a voluntary basis, which are \nlegal, if the woman pays for the abortion. These are not taxpayer-paid \nabortions. So putting that aside, it is a legitimate subject for \ndebate. How do you debate it if we cannot get to the bill?\n  That is what this issue is about this afternoon. Will we get to a \nbill, which I think all of us believe is a critically important bill to \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces? How do we get to that bill? How \ndo we debate these issues, which I agree with the Senator from Florida \nneed to be debated, rightfully are debated, if we are not able to get \nto the bill? That is the issue which we will decide this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes remain on the Republican side and \n4 minutes remain on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before my colleague speaks, very briefly, maybe the \nSenator from Michigan has forgotten what happened last year on hate \ncrimes. The bill was brought up, then the majority leader filed, as is \nhis right, the first amendment.\n  Then only amendments that the majority leader agreed to were allowed \non hate crimes. So we got stuck for a week on it. I predict to you that \nis exactly what would happen with the DREAM Act and with this issue as \nwell because the majority established that precedent last year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I came over to speak on this bill and \nin opposition to the motion to proceed. I sit here and I listen to the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee talk about the fact that this \nis an open process and that we have to get to this bill and everybody \ncan file amendments.\n  Well, when it comes to filing amendments to the Defense authorization \nbill, the majority leader is just like me. He is a Member of the \nSenate. He has the right to file amendments. I have the right to file \namendments. That is not the case here. That is not what we are arguing \nabout.\n  What has happened is the majority leader, for political purposes, has \ncome down and he has called up the Defense authorization bill and he \nhas done what we call filling the tree. He has filed three Democratic \namendments for his benefit and then he has filled the tree and he has \nnot allowed me to file an amendment. He has not allowed the Senator \nfrom Florida to file an amendment.\n  So when the chairman stands and says: We have to get to the bill. \nWell, we are on the bill. Is it right for the majority leader to be \nable to file amendments and nobody else to file amendments? I do not \nthink so. That is what we are arguing about today. If you believe that \nis a fair process and that is an open process, then you vote for the \nmotion to proceed.\n  But if you believe the process ought to be that every Member of the \nSenate has the right to come down, whether you are a member of the \nArmed Services Committee or not, and file an amendment and call up your \namendment and have a debate on it and a vote on it, then you need to \nvote against this motion to proceed. This is not the process that the \nSenate is used to following. It is the process this majority leader has \nseen fit to follow time and time again, and it is not right. It is not \nthe way the Senate is supposed to work.\n  I intend to vote against the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Are we on the bill \nnow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not on the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If cloture passes this afternoon, would we then be able to \nbe on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time is remaining on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes on the Republican side and \n3\\1/2\\ minutes on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, again, I would point out again that not only do the \nmembers of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and our service chiefs object to \nthis truncated process, being left out of the final decisionmaking \nprocess, they do not have to sign on to any conclusions that are \nreached as a result of this ongoing survey. But there are others, such \nas the incoming Commandant of the Marine Corps, who says, my personal \nview, the current law and associated policy have supported the unique \nrequirements of the Marine Corps. Thus, I do not recommend its repeal. \nMy primary concern with proposed repeal is the potential disruption to \ncohesion that may be caused by significant change during a period of \nextended combat operations.\n  We are in two wars, and now we are pursuing the social agenda of the \nDemocratic Party instead of taking the priority, as it is much called \nfor; that is, the welfare, the morale, the battle effectiveness of the \nmen and women in the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  So last year there was an amendment allowed, but procedurally, when \nwe did the hate crimes bill, there were only amendments that were \nagreed to by the majority leader. That is what we fear will happen in \nthis debate, and certainly the DREAM Act, which is also on the agenda \nfor the elections is clearly not something that should be addressed by \nthe Armed Services Committee. By all rights, it should be done by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I regretfully reach this stage. But I urge my colleagues to vote in \nopposition to the cloture vote.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time to the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I regret that I have been held up in another event, \nthat I could not get here until now. But I rise to speak in favor, of \ncourse, of the cloture motion and of taking up the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  This is critically important legislation. I know the debate has been \nmostly about a couple of parts of it or one amendment or maybe two \namendments that may be offered to it.\n  But the National Defense Authorization Act has to be passed. It has \nbeen passed every year for more than half a century. Why? Because it \nauthorizes increases in compensation and benefits for members of the \nmilitary and their families. No matter what you think about any \namendments that may or may not be put in, I do not think any of our \ncolleagues truly want to stop that from happening, nor do they want to \nstop the authorization of the procurement of military equipment that \nour soldiers need to protect them and to continue to be the most \neffective fighting force in the world, nor do they want to stop the \nauthorization for military construction in the United States and around \nthe world that our troops and their families need to live decently.\n  This is a motion to proceed. It is not a vote on the bill. To me, \nthis ought to be an easy vote, no matter what you think about don't \nask, don't tell or the DREAM Act or even what you think about the \nprocedure adopted because, let's remember, at any point once we go to \nproceed, if people in the Chamber do not think Senator Reid has allowed \nenough amendments, they can begin a filibuster and stop it right \nthere. This\n\n[[Page S7244]]\n\nbill won't come to a final vote, regardless of what is in it, until \nthere are 60 Members of the Senate who want it to come to a final vote.\n\n  I wish to speak for a moment about don't ask, don't tell. Senator \nLevin has done an excellent job in the debate. I voted against the \npolicy as a member of the Armed Services Committee in 1993, when it \nfirst came up. I was privileged to be an original cosponsor, with many \nothers, of the legislation to repeal it this year, working with Senator \nLevin and others on the committee, including Senator Collins who, to \nher great credit, had the guts to join us because she believes don't \nask, don't tell is un-American--my word--not fair and hurtful to \nmilitary effectiveness.\n  More than 14,000 members of the military have been put out of the \nservices since 1993 under don't ask, don't tell, not because they \nweren't good soldiers, sailors, marines or airmen, not because they \nviolated any military code of conduct but only because of their private \nsexual orientation. That number is the equivalent of an entire division \nof warfighters we need in places such as Afghanistan and elsewhere \naround the world. It is also a waste of money to train those 14,000. \nEstimates are that taxpayers paid over $600 million. We waste that by \ntossing them out, not because they are bad soldiers but because of \ntheir private sexual orientation.\n  I know some have said repealing don't ask, don't tell doesn't belong \non this bill. Don't ask, don't tell was originally adopted as part of \nthe Defense authorization bill. It is, frankly, the best and most \nlogical place around which to repeal the policy. I know Senator Levin \nhas talked about the process. There is a fundamental judgment that the \nPresident, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, and those of us who have sponsored the amendment to repeal \ndon't ask, don't tell have made, which is that it ought to go. It is \nun-American. It is inconsistent with our best values of equal \nopportunity, who can get the job done, not what one's private life is \nabout. It is hurting our military. That judgment has been made.\n  The study being done at the Pentagon is to determine how to implement \nthis best without intervening in military effectiveness. Then we put in \nthe amendment which is in the bill. This provision, as Senator Levin \nhas pointed out, doesn't go into effect until 60 days after the \nPresident, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff certify in writing that repeal of don't ask, don't tell \nis consistent with standards of military readiness, military \neffectiveness, unity, cohesion, recruiting, and retention. We couldn't \nask for more in the way of due process. We don't direct the military \nexactly when and how and over what timeframe they actually go about \npulling apart this unjust don't ask, don't tell policy.\n  It will be a close vote today. It would be a shame if we don't get \nthe 60 votes. If Members are against don't ask, don't tell being \nrepealed, vote against it when the amendment comes up. Submit an \namendment to strike it. But don't stop the whole bill which is so \nimportant to our military. If for some reason we don't get the 60 votes \ntoday, Senator Reid has made clear we are coming back, and we will do \nthis in November or December. We have to pass this bill for all the \nreasons I have stated, for our military effectiveness when our troops \nare in combat. There will come a day before the end of this year when \nthere will be a motion to strike the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. I \ndon't think opponents of don't ask, don't tell have the votes to \naccomplish that. When that day comes, we will support our military and \nAmerica's best values by ending this nonsensical, unfair policy.\n  In America, we judge people by whether they can get the job done, not \nby any quality about them personally. I think we will get this job done \nbefore the end of this year. I hope we can do it beginning this \nafternoon. But if we don't, we will come back.\n  I thank Senator Levin for his extraordinary leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/21/senate-section/article/S7244-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The time between now and 2:30 p.m. will be \nequally divided.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to Senator Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are at a critical juncture in proceeding \nto the National Defense Authorization Act. This bill is routinely taken \nup every year. I want to emphasize again, we are at the first step. \nThis is just a motion to go forward to begin to debate the bill. I \nwould hope we could at least summon sufficient votes to agree to talk \nabout these critical issues.\n  This legislation contains important programs for our military. We \nhave a military that is at war in Iraq and Afghanistan. They need \nequipment, and they need support. We have included changes for the \nquality of life of their families. One change, significantly, is to \nmake the TRICARE system comparable to the new health care system by \nallowing children who are up to 26 years old to stay on their parents' \npolicies.\n  There are some controversial provisions and proposals. One is don't \nask, don't tell. The other is the DREAM Act. First, the minority or \nanyone has the right to move an amendment to take out or change \nprovisions with respect to don't ask, don't tell. I would disagree with \nthat and oppose that, but that is something that can and will happen \nand will engender a very strong, positive debate. The other issue is \nthe DREAM Act. I think that has a significant connection to this bill \nbecause that is one of the ways in which a youngster who came to the \nUnited States--not by his or her choice but because of a family \nchoice--under 16 years of age who later joins the military, and who \nserves honorably, can be put on a path to eventually become a citizen. \nThat has a strong nexus to this bill. But that issue has to be proposed \non this legislation and voted for by a majority of Members.\n  So we are here simply to begin an important debate and discussion to \nsupport our men and women in uniform across the globe, and their \nfamilies. To deny at least the initiation of such a debate seems to be \nexactly contrary to why we should be here, which is to support our \nmilitary, to debate difficult issues, and then to take votes up and \ndown to decide the policy of the United States.\n  With that, I urge all my colleagues to support this motion to proceed \nto the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield any remaining time I have back to the chairman \nof the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Time will be charged equally.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will yield myself just a minute and a \nhalf. I would ask that the Republicans have their speaker--if they are \ngoing to be using their time--to come immediately after me; otherwise, \nit would not be fair for us to be using up all of our time in advance.\n  Mr. President, this morning a number of Republican Senators stated \nthey would support the current filibuster of this bill because they \nwere afraid that if we take up the bill, we are going to have a closed \nprocess that would limit their ability to offer amendments. The \nmajority leader has addressed this issue. He specifically said last \nThursday that he is ``willing to work with Republicans on a process \nthat will permit the Senate to consider these matters and complete the \nbill as soon as possible.'' He is very clear on this. He is not trying \nto prevent other amendments from being offered. However, there are not \ngoing to be any amendments, there is not going to be any opportunity to \nvote on any amendments unless we get 60 votes to overcome the current \nfilibuster and proceed to the bill. It makes no sense for Senators to\n\n[[Page S7245]]\n\nblock all amendments, which is what the effect will be if we do not end \nthis filibuster, to deny consideration of this bill so we can consider \namendments. It makes no sense to do that under the guise of wanting an \nopen amendment process. We are not going to have any amendments unless \nwe can get to this bill, unless we end this filibuster.\n  Amendments are appropriate. We have always had amendments on the \nDefense bill. The majority leader assures we are going to do that \nagain, and I will do everything I can as chairman to make sure that is \ntrue. So the issue today is not whether there is going to be specific \namendments in order; it is whether we are going to get to the bill so \nwe can try to consider amendments to the Defense authorization bill. \nThere are many amendments that should be considered, and I hope we do \nnot continue this filibuster. I hope we can get 60 votes and do the \nimportant work of the Nation, which is to get a defense authorization \nbill passed after it has been considered.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 5 minutes 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is, obviously, an important vote that \nis coming up. I repeat, I am not opposed in principle to bringing up \nthe Defense bill and debating it, amending it, and voting on it. I am \nnot opposed to having a full and informed debate on whether to repeal \ndon't ask, don't tell and then allowing the Senate to legislate. What I \nam opposed to is bringing up the Defense bill now before the Defense \nDepartment has completed its survey because we need to know the views \nof the men and women who are serving in the military in uniform. Give \nthem a chance to tell us their views. Whether you agree or disagree \nwith the policy, whether you want to keep it or repeal it, the Senate \nshould not be forced to make this decision now before we have heard \nfrom our troops. We have asked for their views, and we should wait to \nhear from them. All four service chiefs have said the same thing: Let's \nconduct the survey, let's get it done and then act on whether to repeal \nor not repeal.\n  There is one other aspect. This is a blatant political ploy in order \nto try to galvanize the political base of the other side, which is \nfacing a losing election. That is why the majority leader said we would \ntake up don't ask, don't tell, take up the DREAM Act, and then take up \nthe issue of secret holds and then address the other issues after the \nelection. I wonder why the majority leader would have those \npriorities--in other words, take up those that would be politically \nbeneficial, galvanize his political base as far as the Hispanic \ncommunity is concerned and the gay and lesbian community, and then take \nup the other issues after--after--the election is over in lameduck \nsession.\n  This majority leader has filled up the tree and has not allowed \ndebate 40 times--40 times--more than all the other majority leaders \npreceding him. Last year, the hate crimes bill was arranged in such a \nway that there were not amendments that could be proposed by my side of \nthe aisle.\n  So let's vote against cloture. Let's sit down and try to reach some \nkind of an agreement. Let the men and women in the military be heard \nfrom. Let their leaders go to their men and women who are serving and \ntell them we have heard their input before we make this legislative \nchange and stop the cynical manipulation of the men and women in the \nmilitary in order to get votes on November 2.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senate should have the opportunity \nto debate and amend this important bill. While the bill has many \nprovisions I support, it also includes billions of dollars of earmarks \nand funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that will dig us \ndeeper into debt without advancing our national security. I have a \nnumber of amendments to improve the bill, including one to require that \nfuture war funding be paid for, so it doesn't add to the deficit. I \nlook forward to the opportunity to offer those amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the time to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Levin.\n  I rise to oppose the filibuster of the National Defense Authorization \nAct and to say what is obvious--that this is a preelection campaign \nseason. There are a lot of politics, partisan politics swirling around, \neverything going on here, including procedural matters such as those we \nare involved in right now. But there are two things I know and I \nbelieve, and I wish to express them about this vote coming up.\n  One is, we have to proceed to consider the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. If we do not do it today, I hope we will do it as \nsoon after as we can because our military needs it. They are in combat. \nWithout this legislation passing, we will not have the authorization to \nincrease compensation and benefits for the military and their families, \nwe will not have authorization for critical military construction, we \nwill not have authorization for acquisition of critical military \nequipment that our troops need to fight safely on our behalf and to \nremain what they are--the bravest, most effective fighting force in the \nworld. So it may be today, it may not be today, but it is going to be \nsometime before the end of the year that we have to take up this bill. \nIt is our national, constitutional, moral responsibility.\n  Second--and this is a controversial part, of course--I believe we \nhave to repeal don't ask, don't tell, not only because it is not \nconsistent with the American values of equal opportunity, of judging \npeople by whether they can do a job or not, not by their nationality, \ntheir religion, their gender, their race, or their sexual orientation--\ncan you do a job, and if you can do it, then you can get that job in \nAmerica. We have thousands of Americans who are patriotic who want to \nserve who happen to be gay or lesbian, and we are telling them: You \ncannot. Not only that, we kicked out 14,000 of them in the last 17 \nyears under don't ask, don't tell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. At some point, we are going to come to a vote on the \nbill and on don't ask, don't tell. I believe a majority of my \ncolleagues in this Chamber--maybe more than that--are going to do what \nwe need to do, which is to repeal don't ask, don't tell.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 2 minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I just wish to emphasize again the statements of the \nservice chiefs.\n  GEN George Casey:\n\n       I remain convinced that it is critically important to get a \n     better understanding of where our Soldiers and Families are \n     on this issue, and what the impacts on readiness and unit \n     cohesion might be, so that I can provide informed military \n     advice to the President and the Congress. I also believe that \n     repealing the law before the completion of the review will be \n     seen by the men and women of the Army as a reversal of our \n     commitment to hear their views before moving forward.\n\n  Admiral Roughead:\n\n       My concern is that legislative changes at this point, \n     regardless of the precise language used, may cause confusion \n     on the status of the law in the Fleet and disrupt the review \n     process itself by leading Sailors to question whether their \n     input matters.\n\n  General Conway:\n\n       I encourage the Congress to let the process the Secretary \n     of Defense created to run its course.\n\n  General Schwartz:\n\n       I believe it is important, a matter of keeping faith with \n     those currently serving in the Armed Forces, that the \n     Secretary of Defense commissioned review be completed before \n     there is any legislation to repeal the Don't Ask, Don't Tell \n     law.\n\n  Let's listen to the people we place in charge of the men and women in \nthe military. This is not the time to move forward on this issue, \nparticularly with a political campaign at its highest.\n  I hope my colleagues will oppose the cloture vote and let's hear a \nstatement in favor of the men and women serving in the military.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S7246]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I indicated to the majority leader that \nI was going to propound a unanimous consent request at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of the Defense authorization bill; provided further that \namendments be offered in an alternating fashion between this aisle and \nthat; that the first 20 amendments offered be Defense-related \namendments within the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee, \nwith no amendment related to immigration in order during the first 20 \namendments.\n  Before the Chair rules, this is an important bill and the Senate \nshould consider the way we have done it every year. There are many \ncontroversial issues related to the underlying bill that need to be \ndebated and voted on by the Senate. Our view is we should start work on \nthe bill and tackle the relevant Defense issues before we divert into \nunrelated measures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I pride \nmyself in being a very patient person, and I will continue to be \npatient now. But during this Congress, we have had to overcome so many \nprocedural roadblocks--not one, not two, but scores. We are now over a \nhundred. This is in keeping with what has gone on this whole Congress. \nIt is remarkable that we have been able to get as much done as we have, \nwith all of the roadblocks that were thrown up.\n  This is an important bill. I recognize that. It is basically to take \ncare of our military personnel. To have this consent agreement, written \nin the language it is written in, changes how we have done legislation \nfor a long time.\n  We all know the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee has \noffered so many unrelated amendments to this bill. He is on record as \nhaving done so. His response to one dealing with transparency was: This \nis my only opportunity to do it.\n  For anyone to suggest that the Secretary of Defense is somehow \nantimilitary--he is a person who supports the DREAM Act.\n  I appreciate the manner in which the Republican leader offered this. \nHe gave me plenty of warning. We don't have surprises between the two \nof us.\n  I respectfully say this is changing the way we do business in the \nSenate, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Under the previous order, the clerk will report the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 414, S. 3454, the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011.\n         Harry Reid, Carl Levin, Tom Udall, Jack Reed, Barbara A. \n           Mikulski, Jon Tester, Al Franken, Richard J.

On this vote, the yeas are 56, the nays are \n43. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to reconsider is entered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for those who have been following this \nvote, this was an attempt to proceed to the Defense authorization bill. \nIt is one of the most important bills we consider during the course of \na year. Senator Levin of Michigan is chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and he was prepared to bring that bill to the floor.\n  There was an attempt made by the majority leader, Senator Reid, to \nallow three amendments to be considered--three amendments which would \nbe considered before other amendments on the bill. One of the \namendments related to the don't ask, don't tell policy. There is a \nprovision already in the bill which allows--after review by the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, the President, and the Department of Defense--the \npossibility of removing that provision from our law. That was one of \nthe amendments. The second amendment related to Senate procedure on \nsecret holds. But the third amendment--and the one I rise to speak to--\nis the one which became the focal point of this last vote. That \namendment related to a measure known as the DREAM Act.\n  Almost 10 years ago, I introduced this bill called the DREAM Act. The \nreason I introduced it was because I felt there was a serious injustice \nand unfairness going on in America. We have within our borders \nthousands of young people who were brought to the United States by \ntheir parents at an early age. I don't know what it was like in their \nhomes, but there weren't many democratic votes when I was 5 years old \nas to where we were going for vacation. I went where I was told, and \nthese children followed their parents to America. They came here and \nbecame part of America. We made certain they had an opportunity for an \neducation and health care. We made certain they had an environment \nwhere they could grow up in this country, and for many of them, it was \nthe only home they ever knew. But because they came to this country \nwith undocumented parents, they were not legal. They were not \ndocumented. They couldn't be citizens.\n  That, to me, is a serious injustice. We do not, in this country, hold \nthe crimes and misdeeds of parents against their children. What I have \ntried to do with the DREAM Act is to give these young people a chance--\na chance to earn their way to legal status and become part of the only \ncountry they have ever known. The DREAM Act isn't easy. The DREAM Act \nsays if you came here as a child, if you were raised in the United \nStates, are of good moral character, with no criminal record, and you \nhave graduated from high school, then we give you 6 years. In that 6-\nyear period of time, you have a chance to do one of two things to \nbecome legal: No. 1, serve the United States of America in the \nmilitary; and No. 2, complete 2 years of a college education. Then we \nwill give you a chance to come off temporary status and become legal in\n\n[[Page S7247]]\n\nAmerica. But you have to earn your way all the way through, subject to \nreview, examination, and all the requirements that should be there \nbefore someone gets this chance of a lifetime.\n  Well, the Republican minority leader came to the floor before this \nvote and he offered a unanimous consent request--which Senator Reid \nobjected to--and here is what it said. Of all the amendments you can \nconsider on the Defense authorization bill, you cannot consider any \namendment that relates to immigration.\n  I know what that was about. The Senate knew what that was about. It \nwas an attempt by the Republican side of the aisle to make certain the \nDREAM Act could never be called on the Defense authorization bill. They \nhave made an empty argument on that side that this DREAM Act has \nnothing to do with the defense of the United States. It is an empty \nargument.\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend, through the Chair, is it not also true \nthat under the terms of the DREAM Act, no one becomes a legal citizen, \nthat they get a green card?\n  Mr. DURBIN. They reach legal status. They have to make application to \ngo beyond it. In this situation, young people, undocumented in the \nUnited States, who want to voluntarily serve in our military, cannot do \nso. They are willing to risk their lives for America. Yet we say no.\n  The Secretary of Defense knows that is wrong. This morning, in a \nconversation I had with him in my office over the telephone, he \nreiterated what he had said to me before: These are the kind of young \npeople we need in America's military--high school graduates from \ncultural traditions that respect the military; people who are going to \nmake more diversity in our ranks. That is what we need. He knows, from \na national defense perspective, these will be good recruits for our \nmilitary and will distinguish themselves serving our country and coming \nup through the ranks.\n  That is what the DREAM Act offered to the Defense authorization bill. \nThe Republican leadership and every Republican Senator said no.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I ask, through the Chair, are you telling the American \npeople that the Secretary of Defense--a man chosen by the President of \nthe United States, not only by this President but the last President--\nis in favor of our passing the DREAM Act? Is that what the Senator from \nIllinois is saying?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Nevada exactly that. The \nDefense Department's fiscal year 2010-2012 strategic plan for the \ndefense of America specifically includes the DREAM Act as a means of \nmeeting the strategic goal of shaping and maintaining a mission-ready, \nall-volunteer force.\n  In 2007, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense at that time said the \nDREAM Act is very appealing because it would apply to the cream of the \ncrop of students and be good for readiness. Over and over again, the \nDepartment of Defense has told us this is an opportunity for young \npeople to serve your Nation, for America to be a safer place.\n  I wish to relate to my friend, the Senator from Nevada, a story I \ntold him earlier. This young man came this morning to the U.S. Capitol \nfrom the city of New York. I say to the Presiding Officer, he lives in \nBrooklyn. His name is Cesar Vargas. Cesar Vargas came to the United \nStates at the age of 5, brought here by his mom and dad from Mexico. He \ngraduated from the regular public schools of New York and then went on \nto graduate from college. It was more difficult for him because he is \nundocumented. So he couldn't get any Federal aid to education--no Pell \ngrants, no Federal student loans. But he made it and he graduated. He \nsaid to us this morning that after 9/11, because of his deep commitment \nto America, he tried to enlist in the Marine Corps. He said: I wanted \nto defend this country after we had been attacked by terrorists. He not \nonly tried the Marine Corps, but he tried other branches as well and \nrepeatedly he was turned down because Cesar Vargas is undocumented.\n\n  But his dream has not died. Now he is a third-year student at the \nCity University of New York Law School. He speaks four languages. He \nsaid he is studying a fifth--Cantonese. He is an exceptionally gifted \nyoung man. Do you know what his ambition is? Once again, to join the \nMarine Corps--to be in the Judge Advocate General Corps to serve \nAmerica, a country he dearly loves.\n  Because of this Republican decision--a procedural decision that says \nwe can't consider the DREAM Act--we will not have a chance to vote on \nthis important measure which would give Cesar Vargas and those like him \na chance to volunteer to serve America. I would say to my friends and \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, where is the justice in this \ndecision? At least have the courage to let us bring this matter to the \nfloor and stand and vote no. But to hide behind this procedural ruse--\nthis unanimous consent request--is totally unfair. It is inconsistent \nwith the spirit and the history of this Chamber, where we deliberate \nand debate and vote. But they ran and they hid behind this procedural \ndecision.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for a brief question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield for a quick question.\n  Mr. REID. I want everyone within the sound of my voice to understand \nhow much I appreciate--and the thousands and thousands of other people \nwho appreciate--Senator Durbin's advocacy of this issue. I also want \neveryone else within the sound of my voice to know we are going to vote \non the DREAM Act. It is just a question of time. This is so fair. That \nis all it is about, fairness--basic fairness.\n  I have to say to my friend from Illinois that I feel so bad. I have a \nstack of letters in my office that are the most heart-wrenching stories \nabout these dreamers. They are dreamers. But I want them to understand \nthis isn't the end of this. We are going to continue to move on it. We \nknow we have been blocked procedurally, but this is the first time we \nhave had our colleagues on the other side of the aisle stand and defy \nbasic fairness on the DREAM Act. They have gone around telling people: \nYes, we like it. We like it. But here was their chance. All we wanted \nto do was bring it to the floor, and they wouldn't even let us do that. \nThey didn't have the courage to allow us to have a vote on this.\n  So I want my friend to know how deeply appreciative I am--and \nspeaking for thousands and thousands of other people--for what he has \ndone on this issue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada, the majority leader, and \nI will tell him and those following this debate--some who are in the \nChamber, in the galleries, who I am sure are disappointed, if not \nheartbroken at this point. I mentioned Cesar Vargas, who is here, but \nGaby Pacheco, and so many others who have worked so hard for this \nchance, for this day, and my promise to them is this: As long as I can \nstand behind this desk and grab this microphone and use my power as a \nSenator, I will be pushing for this DREAM Act. It is my highest \npriority. It is a matter of simple American justice, and I would hope \nthe 11 Republicans who joined us last time will stop cowering in the \nshadows and come forward and join us in a bipartisan effort and not \nstop us procedurally from even debating and deliberating this critical \nissue.\n  For those who are so sad today, take heart. Tomorrow is another day, \nand we will be there to fight for you, and many others will join us. \nDon't give up your dream to be part of this great Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I wish to step back in history, if I \nmay.\n  On December 7, 1941, something terrible happened in Hawaii--Pearl \nHarbor was bombed by the Japanese. Three weeks later, the Government of \nthe United States declared that all Japanese Americans, citizens born \nin the United States or of Japanese ancestry, were to be considered \nenemy aliens. As a result, like these undocumented people, they could \nnot put on the uniform of this land.\n  Well, I was 17 at that time, and naturally I resented this because I \nloved my country and I wanted to put on a uniform to show where my \nheart stood.\n\n[[Page S7248]]\n\nBut we were denied. So we petitioned the government, and a year later \nthey said: OK, if you wish to volunteer, go ahead.\n  Well, to make a long story short, the regiment I served in, made up \nof Japanese Americans, had the highest casualties in Europe but the \nmost decorated in the history of the United States. I think the \nbeneficiaries of the Senator from Illinois will do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I know the Senator from Hawaii has to \nleave, but before he goes I just wish every American could have heard \nfrom a hero not of this body, of this Nation but of the world. Senator \nInouye did more than swim against the tide in order to put on the \nuniform of his country. He had to fight his way into the Army. He then \nbecame a Medal of Honor winner. The highest honor--the Medal of Valor--\nthat can be granted was awarded to Senator Inouye. He gave up more than \njust a few years of his life; he gave up part of his body for this \ncountry.\n\n  His eloquence and his passion for proper treatment of people who want \nto put on the uniform of this Nation is extraordinarily powerful. I \nonly wish every American could have heard it. I thank him for that \nservice and for that statement.\n  I also want to add a thank-you to the Senator from Illinois. I want \nto reinforce something he said by asking him a question. It had to do \nwith that unanimous consent request to which he referred. The way this \nrequest was worded, even if--well, let me back up.\n  We have heard for 2 days objections from Republicans that there would \nbe nonrelevant amendments that would be offered--which, of course, is \npermitted under our rules. As a matter of fact, the Senator from \nArizona has on a number of occasions on this bill offered nonrelevant \namendments. But even if that DREAM Act amendment of yours were modified \nso that it only related to young men and women who wanted to go into \nthe Army to serve their country and the educational part of it, as \nimportant as it is, if that were left out--even if the amendment were \ndesigned so that it could be referred to the Armed Services Committee \nbecause it would be defense related, even if you could design an \namendment like that, under this unanimous consent agreement no \namendment related to immigration would be in order during those first \namendments.\n  Is that not singling out immigration, saying, despite all of the \nprotestations we heard here about wanting to make sure amendments were \nrelevant--despite the history that is not required under the rule but \nthat is the protestations we heard over the last few days, we want \nrelevant amendments and the DREAM Act isn't relevant--under this \nunanimous consent request, even if the DREAM Act were modified so it \nmight be within the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee \nbecause it would be focused on service in the Armed Forces, under this \nrequest no amendment relating to immigration would be in order; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I reply to the Senator from Michigan through the Chair \nand thank him for this question. Just as the door was closed on Dan \nInouye of Hawaii when, as a Japanese American from Hawaii, he wanted to \nserve his country, the unanimous consent request from the Republican \nleader closed the door on anyone who wished to serve this country if it \ninvolved the issue of immigration. It had one intent: stop the DREAM \nAct, stop these young people from being given a chance to serve their \nnation. That is clearly the intent. Unfortunately, the partisan \nrollcall that followed is evidence that was the strategy.\n  Just as Dan Inouye prevailed and persisted and not only served his \ncountry admirably but with the highest level of valor, I am convinced \nthat many of the young people who leave heartbroken today by this vote \nwill get their chance someday, just as the Senator did, and they will \nserve this country with distinction and they will serve this Nation as \nthe Senator has led us in the Senate.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, what is the present parliamentary \nsituation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the motion to \nproceed to S. 3534.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask to speak as in morning business, and I also ask \nunanimous consent the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, be \nrecognized immediately after my remarks and she be recognized to speak \nfor 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Baucus pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n636 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise to express my deep disappointment \nthat we were unable to proceed to the Defense authorization bill.\n  I have been here a while, maybe I am wrong--I am searching my \nmemory--I don't remember any time that we voted against proceeding to \nthe Defense bill. I am going to go back. Certainly, in the time I have \nbeen here, I don't remember that.\n  It is a filibuster just to go to the Defense bill. It is perplexing \nto me because of some of what is in this bill--including funding for \nthe defense health program to care for our military personnel and their \nfamilies, including our wounded warriors. We know these wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan have taken quite a toll on our military men and women, \nboth in seen injuries and unseen injuries--injuries to the brain.\n  We know some incredible work is going on. I visited some of the \nresearch universities that are finding better ways to treat our wounded \nwarriors. They are finding better ways to treat terrible wounds that \nresult from horrible burns to our brave men and women. Now is the time \nto put those new and better treatments into place and there is a \nfilibuster and we cannot get to the bill.\n  We know there is a military pay raise in this bill for our \nservicemembers. Those voting no to proceed to this are stopping that.\n  This bill authorizes TRICARE coverage for eligible dependents up to \nage 26. In other words, just as we did in the Health Care Reform Act, \nin this bill we are saying if you are in the military and you have a \nchild, you can keep them on your coverage until they are 26.\n  It provides $3.4 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles \nor MRAPs, which have proven highly successful in protecting our troops \nfrom improvised explosive devices, and it requires companies to certify \nfor all DOD contracts valued over $1 million that they are not engaged \nin any sanctionable activity under the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996. So \nwe would make sure that the DOD, Department of Defense, is not involved \nin giving contracts to companies that are trading with Iran. This is so \nimportant, as we seek to sanction Iran for its reckless activity in \nmoving toward a nuclear weapon.\n  In the bill the Republicans blocked is also a repeal of the \nmilitary's don't ask, don't tell policy. The bill includes a provision \nstating that there will be no repeal of this policy until there is a \ncertification from the Department of Defense that it will not have \nadverse consequences on our troops.\n  Some said: Oh, this is just ignoring the Department of Defense, \nignoring the Secretary of Defense. Not at all. The way Chairman Levin \nput it together definitely has a check on it. So I do not understand a \nlot of my colleagues' claims that it is just a quick repeal with no \nchecks and balances from the Secretary of Defense.\n  I will say it again, it is clear in there, and I will read the exact \nwords, that there must be, as we repeal don't ask, don't tell, a \ncertification from the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that there will be no significant \nimpact on ``military readiness, military effectiveness, unit cohesion \nand recruiting and retention of the Armed Forces.''\n  I think it is important to note what countries allow gays and \nlesbians to serve. How about 22 of our allies who have fought with our \nservice men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan: Australia, Britain, \nDenmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Switzerland, \nAustria, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, New Zealand, Spain, \nBelgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Luxemburg and Norway and \nSweden. In addition, Israel and South\n\n[[Page S7249]]\n\nAfrica also don't discriminate against gays and lesbians. I don't know \nwho we end up with, but some of the countries I can find that still \ndiscriminate against gays and lesbians in the service are Iran, \nPakistan, Cuba, North Korea, and Turkey.\n  For us to stand with Iran, for us to stand with Cuba, for us to stand \nwith North Korea, Pakistan, and Turkey over Australia, Britain, \nDenmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Canada, \nGermany, et cetera--it just doesn't make sense.\n  The point is, because we are part of this coalition of 22 other \nnations, our service men and women are already fighting alongside gays \nand lesbians.\n  A majority of Americans think it is the right thing to do, to allow \nour qualified young men and women to serve regardless of their sexual \norientation. According to a CNN poll conducted in May, 78 percent of \nAmericans said they support allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly \nin the military--78 percent of Americans. We would be standing with \nthem and we would be standing with our allies.\n  Don't ask, don't tell is hurting our military. It is costing our \nNation--more than 14,000 service men and women have been discharged \nfrom the military under don't ask, don't tell. It has cost taxpayers \nbetween $290 million and maybe up to more than a $\\1/2\\ billion to \nreplace servicemembers who were discharged under this policy.\n  I know many Americans have seen in their living rooms, on the TV, men \nand women who are our neighbors' kids, and our neighbors, who have been \nkicked out of the military even though they were stellar service men \nand women. It is most unfortunate that our friends on the other side \nare mischaracterizing what is in the bill.\n  We allowed them an amendment to strip that language, and they said, \noh, well, if we pass this, then the military would be caught off guard. \nNot at all. The way it is written specifies that there must be a \ncertification that a repeal would not be harmful to our military.\n  I am also terribly disappointed we will not have a chance to vote on \nthe DREAM Act. The DREAM Act allows those students who have been here \nmost of their lives an opportunity to earn legalized status if they met \ncertain criteria. Those are kids who were brought over as kids, maybe a \nmonth or 2, or a year or 2, or 5 or 6 years old. They must have lived \nin the United States for 5 years. They must earn a high school diploma. \nAfter high school, they must complete 2 years of college or serve in \nthe Armed Forces for 2 years. They must demonstrate strong moral \ncharacter, and only those who pass these tests would be eligible to get \non the pathway to legality. Sixty-five thousand young people a year \ngraduate from high school, but they cannot join the military, or they \ncannot go to college, because of their immigrant status. It was not \ntheir fault they were brought into the country by their parents. I want \nto tell you that our military has said--and I will quote retired Army \nLTC Margaret Stock. She said: ``Potential DREAM Act beneficiaries are \nlikely to be a military recruiter's dream candidates for enlistment.''\n  Let me repeat that. The military itself has said, The DREAM Act will \nresult in a military recruiter's dream, because some of these recruits \nare very good with foreign language skills, foreign cultural awareness, \nthey are in short supply, and they would be excellent recruits.\n  Businesses support the DREAM Act. Our economic future is something we \ntalk about every day around here. I read a U.S.C. study that said, if \nwe finally begin a process where people who are here, who are hard \nworking and caring, can stay here and come out of the shadows, it will \ncreate 25,000 jobs and increase the gross domestic product of my State \nand of the Nation.\n  That is why I have the San Jose Mercury News, home paper of the \nSilicon Valley, writing an editorial last week in favor of the DREAM \nAct, saying it will boost America's economic competitiveness. So here \nwe have the time where we have something on the floor that is directly \nrelated to the military bill, because the military is saying it is a \nrecruiter's dream, this DREAM Act, because they are going to have so \nmany people lining up to join. We have Silicon Valley strongly \nsupporting this, and I will tell you, the San Jose Mercury News said: \n``The high school dropout rate in this country terrifies business \nleaders, who fear that in the coming decades we will not produce enough \ncollege graduates with math and science ability.''\n  That is why the Silicon Valley Leadership Group supports the DREAM \nAct. That is a group made up of Republicans, Independents, and \nDemocrats. They wrote: DREAM Act students ``deserve a chance, and the \nU.S. economy needs their knowledge and ability.''\n  Companies such as Microsoft also support the DREAM Act. They wrote: \n``The DREAM Act rewards those who place high value on education, and on \nservice to country.''\n  Last week the president of the University of California, the \nchancellor of the California State university system, and the \npresidents of State universities in Arizona, Washington, Minnesota, \nUtah, and Washington wrote in support of the DREAM Act. They write in a \nletter: ``In the current international economic competition, the U.S. \nneeds all the talent it can acquire and these students represent an \nextraordinary resource for the country. The DREAM Act . . . is an \neconomic imperative.''\n  In closing, I want to talk about a couple of stories. I think this is \nvery important. David graduated from high school with a 3.9 grade point \naverage. He is studying international economics and Korean at UCLA. He \nhas served as the leader of the UCLA marching band, and he spends his \nfree time tutoring high school students. After graduation, he hopes to \nenter the Air Force and some day politics. In many ways, he is a model \ncollege student and a leader in his community. But he was born in \nKorea. He came here when he was 9. His family spent 8 years trying to \nnavigate their way to legalized status, only to find out that their \nsponsor had erred in filling out the paperwork.\n  So here sits David. He had nothing to do with all of this. Here is \nwhat he says:\n\n       I will not be able to put my name down on a job application \n     because of my status. This country is throwing away talent \n     every second . . . but the DREAM Act can bring thousands of \n     students out of the shadows and allow them the opportunity to \n     work for the country they truly love right now.\n\n  I would say these students such as David did not choose to come to \nthis country. They were brought here by their parents. The reality is, \nthey have grown up here. This is the only country they know. I am very \ndisappointed that we are not voting on this important bill today. I \nhope we can take up the DREAM Act later this year. I believe it will \ntruly strengthen our economy, our military, and our Nation.\n  The very last point I want to make as we wind up this Congress is, I \nam so pleased that we passed the Small Business Jobs Act last week. I \ntraveled across California. I have met with so many small businesses, \nand I did a conference call with about 10 of those businesses, \nincluding the Los Angeles Baking Company, the Blue Bottle Coffee \nCompany in Oakland, biofuels manufacturer Solazyme, Capstone Turbine in \nChatsworth, U.S. Hybrid in Torrance, the Back on the Beach Cafe in \nSanta Monica, and the Santa Barbara Adventure Company. These are small \nbusinesses in my State that are very strong. They could not get access \nto credit to expand and hire. As a result of the work we did, they will \nbe able to get that credit. I want to thank the two Republicans who \ncrossed over to vote with us. It shows us that we can make progress \nwhen we work together, because this has to come ahead of politics.\n  I went to a company called Renova. Renova is helping to make \nCalifornia the hub of the clean energy economy. Vincent Battaglia, the \nowner there, told me he has been getting no help accessing the credit \nhe needs. He called our legislation ``the missing piece,'' the piece he \nhas been waiting for.\n  Small businesses create 64 percent of our new jobs. That is what \nhappened over the last 15 years. I believe this bill will help get them \nback on track. As they get back on track, our recovery will begin to \nhave a little more energy behind it. Because it is very slow; it is \nagonizingly slow.\n  I wanted to state on the Record how much I appreciate the two \nRepublicans--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank you and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7250]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenators from New Hampshire, Arizona, Kansas, and I be permitted to \nengage in a colloquy for half an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Senate Proceedings\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. On December 3, 1996, Senator Robert C. Byrd, the late \nSenator Byrd, who most of us think understood this body better than any \nSenator in its history, told the newly arriving U.S. Senators the \nfollowing:\n\n       Good afternoon and welcome to the United States Senate \n     Chamber. You are presently occupying what I consider to be \n     hallowed ground.\n\n  Senator Byrd went on to say:\n\n     . . . as long as the Senate retains the power to amend and \n     the power of unlimited debate, the liberties of the people \n     will remain secure.\n\n  In his last testimony before the Senate Rules Committee before he \ndied--this was in May of this year--Senator Byrd said:\n\n       Our Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be a continuing \n     body that allows for open and unlimited debate and the \n     protection of minority rights.\n\n  If I may add to that the last paragraph of a letter from Senator \nCoburn, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Coburn writes:\n\n       Too many Americans are upset, even angry, that their voices \n     are not being heard in Washington. The majority's abusive \n     practice of suppressing debate undermines the Senate's debate \n     traditions . . .\n\n  We could start out by complaining that the majority leader has cut \noff debate, cut off amendments at a record level. I have submitted \nevidence of that. But I think that would look to the American people \nlike we are kindergartners in a sandbox. Because it is not the voice of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, or Tennessee, or Arizona, or Kansas \nthat is so important. The voices of the people whom we are elected to \nrepresent are the important voices.\n\n  When 39 times in the last two Congresses the majority leader, through \nprocedural tactics, says no to amendments, and no to debate, he is \ncausing the Senate to deteriorate to a shadow of its former self, the \nkind of Senate that Senator Byrd thought was important, and the kind of \nSenate in which we want to serve.\n  Our goal is to represent the voices of the American people, to let \ntheir feelings, their anger, their hopes, all be represented here. That \nmeans we have to have a chance to offer amendments and have to have a \nchance to debate.\n  What that means is if we are successful in this election year, we are \ngoing to make sure that in the new Congress we have that opportunity. \nWe will make sure that these voices we hear across America are heard on \nthe floor of the Senate. The Defense authorization bill, which is being \ndebated today, is a perfect example of why I say the Senate is \ndeteriorating to a shadow of its former self by closing off the voices \nof the American people and by denying their elected Senators an \nopportunity to have a full debate on the issues facing them.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  Mr. GREGG. Because I think the Senator has addressed a core issue of \nconstitutional government. When the Founding Fathers got together in \nPhiladelphia and created this extraordinary Nation called America, and \nbuilt the Constitution upon which we were based, and upon which we \ngovern, was it not their intent to create the Senate as a body \ndifferent from the House of Representatives?\n  We understand in the House of Representatives amendments are not \nallowed if the Speaker does not want them. It is an autocracy over \nthere. We know that. But was not it the intention of the Founding \nFathers, as the Senator has pointed out, to give the American people a \nchance, through their Senators, to amend complex legislation? And has \nthat not always been the tradition since the founding of our Nation? \nDid Washington not explain this rather accurately when he said, The \nSenate is the saucer into which the hot coffee is poured? The House \nboils the coffee, they get all charged up about an issue, they pass it \nwithout amendments, often without any debate. It comes over here, and \nthe American people get to hear a little more subtlely about the issue, \na little more discussion about the issue. Specifically, they get to \namend it and address the issue.\n  I know the Senator from Arizona is here. Maybe he will be able to \ntell us--I am sure he will--how many times we have had a bill as big as \nthe Defense authorization bill on the floor, which is spending $700 \nbillion, and not had a chance to amend it. But was that not the purpose \nof the Founding Fathers, to make the Senate the place where there was \ndebate and discussion and amendment? Has that not been basically cut \noff by the majority leader and the majority party's attitude that they \ndo not want to take tough votes?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Arizona was here when that was not \nthe case, and the Senate functioned the way the Senate was supposed to \nfunction.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I make a couple of comments? One is, one of the \nthings that has disappeared that I saw in the first years I was here in \nthe Senate is the two leaders sitting down and perhaps coming to \ninformal agreements that are then put into unanimous consent agreements \nto move forward.\n  The other aspect of this I wonder if my colleagues would care to \ncomment on. One of the reasons why we have these--the majority leader \ncomes forward, as I believe he has 40 times, brings up a bill and then \nimmediately fills up the tree--and to the uninitiated, obviously that \nmeans there will be no other amendments allowed through that kind of \nparliamentary procedure. A lot of times that is read by the Members \nsaying, hey, there is going to be an amendment up that I do not want to \nhave to vote on. I do not want to have to vote on it. So fill up the \ntree, have no other amendments allowed to be voted on.\n  It seems to me that we should have the courage to go ahead and vote. \nTime after time, when I have seen basically a shutout from amendments, \nI have said, look, I will agree to a time agreement. I am not going to \nfilibuster it. Just give us 15 minutes either side and vote on it. But \nthey do not want to take tough votes. I am not going to call it \ncowardice, but I cannot call it courage, that people will prevail and \nsay, hey, let's fill up the tree so we can only get this done and we \nwill not have to take a tough vote on whatever the issue is that seems \nto be attracting the attention of the American people.\n  I say to my colleague from New Hampshire, who will not be with us \nnext January----\n  Mr. GREGG. I will be with you; I just will not physically be here.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I certainly do not in any way indicate that there is any \nphysical ailment that will cause you not to be a Member of the Senate \nnext January.\n  If the Senator from New Hampshire could provide us with the benefit \nof his experience in both the House and the Senate, and also maybe he \nwould give us at some point his view of what we need to do to fix this \ngridlock we have over the economy. He has done it on numerous \noccasions, but it comes to my mind that perhaps the Senator from New \nHampshire at some time would take an hour on the floor and say: Here is \nwhat I think we need to do. I think it would be valuable. I don't think \nthere is anybody in the Senate today who has a better grasp for the \nbudgetary issues we have to grapple with as we face an unprecedented \nsituation of debt and deficit.\n  Perhaps after this election, it may be possible for us to sit down \nand be included in the agenda of the Senate. That is one of the things \nthat has been a big change. It used to be that at least the majority \nleader, whichever party was in the majority, would come over and say: \nHere is our agenda. What is your agenda? What is your input? What do \nyou want to see happen? Most of the time nowadays, we hear what is \ngoing to happen either through reading it in the media or when the \nmajority leader comes to the floor and says: Here is what we will take \nup next. It does not lead to comity.\n  Mr. GREGG. Those are very generous and kind comments coming from a \nSenator who is of huge stature not only\n\n[[Page S7251]]\n\nin the Senate but in the country. I do hope to make some comments on \nthat. It won't take me an hour because the answer is simple: Stop \nspending. That is pretty much the bottom line.\n  The point of the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Arizona \non the issue of shutting down the amendment process is as critical to \nus getting better governance as anything. We can't have good governance \nif we don't have discussion and different ideas brought forward. Yet we \nare not allowed to do that any longer because the majority leader says: \nWe will not allow any additional amendment or any discussion.\n  On budgetary issues, on the spending issue, independent of the \nDefense bill, I think one of the reasons we haven't done a budget this \nyear is because the other side knows that if they bring the budget to \nthe floor, they cannot shut down amendments. Amendments have to be \nallowed. Under the rules, we have to be able to amend the budget \nresolution. I don't think they want to do that. They couldn't fill the \ntree on the budget.\n  As a practical matter, this attempt to foreclose debate on core \nissues of public policy, such as the defense issue and spending, by \nshutting down the floor through filling the tree is undermining not \nonly the Senate and its role but the whole constitutional process and \nthe right of the people to be heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Doesn't it send a message to people who are having their \nbudgets squeezed, having to make the most difficult decisions about \ntheir budget, that this body will function and continue to appropriate \nmoney for our functions without a budget of our own? What kind of a \nsignal does that send to the American people? Doesn't that contribute \nto the disconnect and the frustration Americans feel and give rise to \nthe tea party, which has had a seismic effect on the political \nlandscape?\n  Mr. GREGG. Absolutely. More than that, it begs the question as to why \nis the majority party governing. If they are not willing to govern, \nwhat are they collecting their paychecks for? Governing means putting \ntogether a budget and deciding how to spend the money. They are not \nwilling to do that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. One of the first decisions every family has to make is \nwhat is the budget, what are they going to be able to spend. We will be \ngoing out of session sometime here before the election without even a \ncursory effort at a budget.\n  Mr. GREGG. Absolutely.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the Senator from Kansas is here. He \nserved with distinction not only in the Senate but in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I wish to go back to the point Senator Byrd made. He said in his \naddress to new Senators in 1996:\n\n       [A]s long as the Senate retains the power to amend and the \n     power of unlimited debate, the liberties of the people will \n     remain secure.\n\n  What we are talking about here is not the importance so much of the \nvoice of the Senator from Kansas or the voice of the Senator from New \nHampshire but the voices of the American people. And they are being \nsuppressed.\n  The Senator from Kansas has seen Congress for a long time. What do we \nneed to do to take the Senate back to the Senate that it should be?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I appreciate the Senator bringing up the statements by \nour revered Senator Byrd. I remember when I first came to the Senate, \nhe had, for lack of a better word, a lecture or maybe a sermon to us \nall about the comity of the Senate and why the Senate is different from \nthe House. The standard example is that the House is where we pour a \nhot cup of coffee, and then it cools off in the Senate when we put the \ncoffee in the saucer. And that is what we are supposed to do to protect \nthe minority. Here is what Senator Byrd said in one of his last \nspeeches before the Rules Committee before we lost Bob. His knowledge \nand love for this body were unmatched. He actually wrote the history of \nthe Senate. He said he opposed cloture by a simple majority because \n``it would immediately destroy the uniqueness of this institution. The \nSenate is the only place in government where the rights of a numerical \nminority are so protected. A minority can be right and minority views \ncan certainly improve legislation.''\n  Obviously, if we go down another road--and we have--I just heard the \nmajority leader indicate this side of the aisle is guilty of \nobstructionism. I guess it is in the eye of the beholder.\n  I might remind my friend from Arizona that the bumper sticker for the \ndistinguished State of New Hampshire is ``Live Free or Die.'' I hope we \nlive free, and I would hope that the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire would not take that literally, given the comments by the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  I came into public service in 1980, with my dear friend from New \nHampshire. Other than some rather obstreperous incidents in regard to \nbasketball, we have enjoyed a very good relationship. But there isn't \nanybody here who understands the budget process and how minority rights \nshould be protected and how we should proceed other than Judd Gregg. He \nhas done an outstanding job. I know that once he leaves the Senate, he \nwill be called upon to help us get out of this tremendous debt problem \nand to face the entitlements square-on.\n  Facts are stubborn things. I am not trying to put these facts on any \nindividual. As the distinguished Senator from Tennessee has pointed \nout, what this really is about is the consent of the governed. That is \nwhat Madison was really interested in when he wrote about the \nConstitution. We want a strong Executive and certainly a House and a \nSenate to be responsive, but it is to protect the consent of the \ngoverned. The governed, as everybody knows, is extremely upset. It is \nbecause their voice is not heard. Why is their voice not heard?\n  In the 110th Congress in the House of Representatives, only 1 percent \nof the bills were brought to the floor with open amendment rules--1 \npercent. Ninety-nine percent of the bills reached the Senate from the \nHouse with little or no input from the minority. As of March of 2010, \nthe House was on track to shatter its record for closed amendment rules \nin the 111th Congress. That is the House.\n\n  I spent 16 years in the House. I can remember very well one \nparticular incident where there was a real controversy over a seat in \nIndiana. The secretary of state of Indiana declared the winner. It came \nback to the House Administration Committee, went back out to Indiana, \nrecounted. When the Democrat went ahead, they called it closed, and \nthat was it. We walked out. We said the comity of the House had been \ndestroyed.\n  We are close here in the Senate. In the 110th Congress, cloture was \nfiled 133 times, 98 of which were filed the moment the question was \nraised on the floor. If that isn't obstructionism, I don't know what \nis. Over the last 22 years, the majority leader has filled the tree \nroughly three times per Congress on average. However, from January 2007 \nto April of 2010, the majority leader filled the tree 26 times. That is \na 300-percent increase in filling the tree for the 110th and 111th \nCongress. These numbers do not reflect the additional times this has \ntaken place in the 5 months since the numbers were submitted to the \nRules Committee, including today, with DOD authorization. From the \n103rd to the 109th Congress, rule XIV to bypass the committee was used \non average 24 times per Congress. This was shattered in the 110th \nCongress when it was used 57 times. I go over these facts to show that \nin regard to the definition of obstructionism, it goes both ways. That \nis the rest of the story.\n  A little bit later, if the distinguished Senator from Tennessee has \ntime, I would like to go over this sense-of-the-Senate resolution or \nlegislation to be introduced by the junior Senator from New Mexico \ndeclaring the rules of the Senate unconstitutional in order to rewrite \nthe rules to favor a simple majority to pass legislation. I would like \nto have a discussion with him at a future time.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Utah has something to say as \nwell.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Utah has had a distinguished career \nin the Senate. His father did before him. He has an unusual perspective \nof this body. I wonder what his reflections might be upon Senator \nByrd's thought about the importance of allowing Senators to reflect the \nvoices of people in this country and when those voices are\n\n[[Page S7252]]\n\ncut off in the Senate, they are cut off at home.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nhis reference to my service. I use as my example for why I am here to \njoin this colloquy not my long service, because it hasn't been all that \nlong by the terms of the Senate, but my experience today. I think what \nwe experienced today on the floor is a demonstration of what happens.\n  I happen to be one--perhaps a minority on my side of the aisle--who \nis in favor of the DREAM Act. I want to be one who will vote for the \nDREAM Act. The Senator from Tennessee talks about people and their \nconcern. While I was back in Utah over the weekend, I had a \ndemonstration of very earnest young people show up in front of the \nFederal building to ask me to please vote for the DREAM Act. They had \ncompelling stories. I was identifying with what they had to say.\n  I had to say to them: I won't get an opportunity to vote for the \nDREAM Act.\n  Yes, they said, you will have a vote on Tuesday on the DREAM Act.\n  No, the vote on Tuesday is not on the DREAM Act. The vote on Tuesday \nis on a motion to proceed to the Defense authorization bill that has \nbeen loaded down with amendments that prevent us from having an up-or-\ndown vote on the DREAM Act itself.\n  They said: Well, the DREAM Act will be one of those amendments. The \nDREAM Act will be added to it.\n  Yes, it will be added to it. But will I have an opportunity to vote \non an amendment to strip out the other stuff I don't like? No. I won't \nhave the opportunity to do that. So this was the dilemma I explained to \nthese young people. Some of them looked too young to vote, but I am \nsure they are old enough to vote. It is just that everybody looks a lot \nyounger to me now than they used to.\n  I said: Here is the dilemma I have. By virtue of what the majority \nleader has done, he has created a parliamentary situation where, in \norder to vote as you want me to vote, as you express your voice to me, \nI have to vote opposite to what a large number of my other constituents \nwant me to vote. I have to vote in favor of Federal funding for \nabortions in military hospitals. Some will say it will be private \nfunding. Yes, but it will take place in a military hospital supported \nby Federal funding. I have never voted for Federal funding in any form \nfor abortions. Now, in order to support the DREAM Act by the way the \ntree has been filled, by the way this thing has been put together, I \nhave no choice. If I vote the way you want me to vote, I will offend a \nvast majority of my other constituents who don't want me to vote that \nway on the question of abortions in military hospitals. If I vote to \nproceed, I will be voting to act precipitously, in my view, with \nrespect to the policy of don't ask, don't tell, which President Clinton \nsigned into law at the beginning of my service in the Senate.\n\n  I am perfectly willing to vote to repeal don't ask, don't tell if the \nmilitary services complete their survey that tells us that is right and \nproper for military performance. But the majority wants to make that \ndecision before they get the information from the military. So I have \nto cast a vote that I think is the wrong vote for the military in order \nto vote for the DREAM Act.\n  Well, they looked at me as if I were crazy.\n  Well, certainly you can separate these things and vote on each one on \nits own individual merits?\n  I had to say to them: No, I can't. The way this is being handled now \nin the Senate, I cannot vote on the merits of each of these individual \nitems because the majority leader, exercising his right, has packaged \nthem together--filled the tree--in such a fashion that makes it \nimpossible for you to divide them and discuss each one on its own \nmerits.\n  I was questioned by the press as I went in to lunch.\n  Senator, we thought you were in favor of the DREAM Act?\n  Yes, I am.\n  Well, then, aren't you going to vote for cloture on the Defense \nauthorization bill?\n  Wait a minute, cloture on the Defense authorization bill becomes the \nkey vote on an immigration issue? That is the situation we have come to \nas we get this kind of procedure. And it very clearly, as the Senator \nfrom Tennessee has made clear, says the voices of the people on the \nlegislation in which they have an interest are not being heard because \nof this procedural activity. That is why I have joined in this colloquy \nto raise my voice in protest to the way this is being done.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  Madam President, the point of our discussion is a very simple idea: \nThis is a year above all years when there are voices in the country \nthat seek to be heard. When through procedural means the majority \nsuppresses those voices by suppressing their elected representatives, \nit only adds fuel to the fire.\n  Whatever the conditions after the election, I hope we Republicans \ncome back with the notion that we intend to make sure this Senate \nfunctions with an unlimited right to amend and with an unlimited right \nto debate, so we can force consensus on issues and deal with jobs, deal \nwith spending, deal with debt, and deal with the other issues that \ncause the American people to be turning out in droves this year in \nelections.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I say to my friend from Tennessee, I want to ask him a \nquestion. Is it fair to characterize these attempts by the majority to \nchange the rules--and that is what they want to do; I think it is a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution in the Rules Committee--to continue \nfavoring them, even if their majority narrows after November, in the \nlameduck or what I call the Daffy Duck, the lameduck now, you could \ncharacterize that as an ``arrogance of power.'' Those are pretty tough \nwords, but that is the exact term used by then-Senator Biden in 2005 to \ndescribe a similar attempt to rewrite the rules to favor the majority \nat that time. So what goes around comes around.\n  Does the Senator from Tennessee find it as disconcerting as I do that \nthe junior Senator from New Mexico has introduced a resolution \ndeclaring the rules of the Senate ``unconstitutional'' in order to \nrewrite the rules to favor a slimmer majority, i.e., one, one free \nthrow. That is it.\n  Does any majority last forever? The answer to that is no. What goes \naround comes around. If the interpretation of the Constitution and the \nSenate rules of the junior Senator from New Mexico is accepted, I say \nto my friend from Tennessee, what is to prevent any majority of either \nparty from rewriting the rules of the Senate whenever it suits them? \nWould such a practice not negate the whole point of having rules in the \ncontinuing body that is the Senate? Would this practice not make the \nSenate nearly identical to the House, where majority takes everything? \nWould this not neutralize the express purpose of the Senate to act as a \ncheck on the House and be directly 180 degrees opposed to what Senator \nByrd was warning us about in regard to his last testimony before the \nRules Committee in this distinguished body?\n  Again, my friend from Tennessee has hit the nail right on the head. \nWe have a lot of challenges around here. People say ``problems'' or \n``crises.'' We have a lot of challenges. The only way you meet a \nchallenge is to work together and to represent the consent of the \ngoverned. What we have here now is we do not have the consent of the \ngoverned. We do not have the opportunity.\n  I remember in the health care debate staying up until the wee hours \nof the morning in the HELP Committee, the Finance Committee. I did not \nget behind closed doors to write the bill that was actually written, \nbut I had 11 amendments on rationing. All of them were defeated on a \nparty-line vote. Trying to be a little clever by half, I introduced a \nDemocratic amendment, one of Senator Schumer's amendments. It was \ndefeated on a party-line vote. They did not even recognize it was \nSenator Schumer's--all on rationing.\n  One of the biggest controversial items you hear about throughout the \ncountry in regard to the health care debate is the rationing of health \ncare, which is going on right now. There was no consent of the \ngoverned. It was ``our way or no way.'' It did not have a chance. That \nis the biggest issue we face, and it seems to me it really reflects on \nthis body and how we treat each other and, more importantly, how we \ntreat the American people and why\n\n[[Page S7253]]\n\nwe have such a fuss out there in the hinterlands.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for taking this time. I think it is \nvery valuable time. I hope we can lower the debate a little bit--a \nwhole lot--and work together, as he has indicated, to meet the \nchallenges we have before the country.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas for his thoughtful remarks. He is exactly right. The voices \nof the people are to be heard here. They can only be heard and their \nliberties protected if their elected officials have the right to \nexpress those voices through unlimited amendment and unlimited debate. \nWhen the majority leader closes that debate off and closes off those \namendments a record number of times, that is closing off the voices of \nthe American people.\n  As the Senator from Kansas said, the shoe can sometimes be on the \nother foot. Those who today are wanting to create a freight train \nrunning through the Senate as a freight train runs through the House \nmay not be so eager to do that if the freight train turns out, after \nthe election, to be the tea party express.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 2010.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: The U.S. Senate once was considered \n     ``the world's greatest deliberative body.'' This no longer is \n     the case as the Majority Leader commonly abuses Senate rules \n     and traditions to prevent debate and obstruct other Senators \n     from offering amendments to legislation.\n       As you know, historically, the cloture process authorized \n     by Senate Rule XXII has been used sparingly. According to \n     Senate Procedure and Practice, ``Between 1917 and 1962, \n     cloture was imposed only five times.'' Fast forward 50 years \n     later, a report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), \n     reveals a clear trend by the majority of limiting debate by \n     immediately filing cloture on nearly all legislative \n     questions.\n       Under Democrat control of the Senate, 219 cloture motions \n     were filed in the 110th and 111th Congresses combined. \n     Perhaps most troubling, 171 of these cloture motions were \n     filed after the Senate had considered the legislative \n     question for one day or less. In contrast, when the \n     Republicans were in charge in the 108th and 109th Congresses, \n     only 84 cloture motions were filed.\n       Additionally, the Majority Leader has regularly abused a \n     procedure known as ``filling the tree,'' to exclude the \n     minority from offering amendments to bills. According to CRS, \n     he has employed this tactic 39 times on major pieces of \n     legislation since the start of the 110th Congress. The result \n     of this practice was the passage of legislation spending \n     hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars without members of \n     the minority having the opportunity to raise issues of \n     importance or to improve legislation. To put this number in \n     perspective, this represents a drastic increase from the mere \n     fifteen occasions former Majority Leader Frist ``filled the \n     tree'' in 108th and 109th Congresses combined.\n       Majority Leader Reid's use of ``filling the tree'' combined \n     with filing cloture entirely preempts any input from the \n     minority into legislation and destroys the two distinguishing \n     characteristics of the Senate--the right to fully debate and \n     amend legislation.\n       Too many Americans are upset, even angry, that their voices \n     are not being heard in Washington. The majority's abusive \n     practice of suppressing debate undermines the Senate's debate \n     traditions as well as the cherished American rights of free \n     speech and dissent. As a caucus, we should commit ourselves \n     to ensuring a more open and deliberative process that \n     protects the rights of every Senator to express the views of \n     the taxpayers they were elected to represent.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Tom A. Coburn, M.D.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Goodwin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent \nthat we not go into the quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss two important issues we \nwill not have the chance to debate because we are unable to take up the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  Let me start with the need for repeal of the discriminatory don't \nask, don't tell policy. We are so close to making a historic \naccomplishment that I think we would be able to look back on with \npride. It is also simply the right thing to do. This country is long \npast ready for it, and it is the right thing because the don't ask, \ndon't tell policy has been costly for our military. Treating gays and \nlesbians unequally because of their sexual orientation just does not \nmake sense to me. We should not be denying gay and lesbian Americans \nthe ability to serve our Nation simply because of who they are. We \nshould not make them lie in order to serve.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, endorsed \nthe repeal of don't ask, don't tell. He put it this way:\n\n       I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have in \n     place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about \n     who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens. For \n     me, personally, it comes down to integrity: theirs as \n     individuals and ours as an institution.\n\n  But as I said, this is not just about the right thing to do. The \ncountry is ready for it, and the military is ready for it. Things have \nchanged since 1993. The country is now way ahead of us on this issue. A \nWashington Post/ABC News poll in February 2010 showed that 75 percent \nof Americans believe gay and lesbian Americans should be able to serve \nopenly in the U.S. military--75 percent. There is almost nothing we can \nget 75 percent of the country to agree on these days. The country has \nbeen steadily moving in this direction for some time. In 1993, 44 \npercent of those surveyed favored this. It was up to 62 percent in \n2001. And now we are at 75 percent. Multiple other polls reinforce this \nresult. The country is way past being ready for this change, and so is \nthe military.\n  Do we need to think carefully about how to implement repeal? Yes. \nThat is why the Pentagon is undertaking a comprehensive review of how \nto implement the repeal. But is there any reason to think unit cohesion \nor military readiness is going to be negatively affected? No. There is \nsimply no reason to think that. In fact, let's look to the military's \nown thinking on this question. A recent article in Joint Force \nQuarterly concluded that ``there is no scientific evidence to support \nthe claim that unit cohesion will be negatively affected if homosexuals \nserve openly.'' No scientific evidence.\n  Let me also briefly tell you about my experience. Before I was a \nSenator, I did a number of USO tours over the years. On each tour, I \nwas more and more impressed with the men and women of the military. \nThis was between 1999 and 2006. I did seven tours. The last 4 years, I \nwas in Iraq and Afghanistan and Kuwait. I would go with a very eclectic \ntour of guys and women: the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, country \nwestern artists, almost all of whom are very rightwing, and we love \neach other because we went on these tours.\n  Let me tell you about one show I did. I am not going to say what base \nit was. I do not want to get anybody in trouble. We did a 4-hour show. \nThis was the fourth year we did this with the sergeant major of the \nArmy. We did a 4-hour show because we found out the troops loved the \nshow because it was a little bit of home. During the show, I would--I \nwas kind of the cohost with a beautiful woman named Leeann Tweeden, and \nwe would do comedy routines, we would introduce music, and we would \nintroduce the cheerleaders.\n  I would go out and do a monologue. This is something I would do and \nhad done for a number of years. I would go out and I would say: You \nknow, I have done now seven USO tours, and every year I am just more \nand more impressed with the military, except for one thing I don't get. \nIt is this whole don't ask, don't tell policy.\n  Now, it was about 28 degrees where I was talking, and there were \nmaybe a couple thousand troops. Most of them were standing, some were \nin the bleachers. This was like 3 hours into the show, but they were \njust loving the show.\n  I said: But there's one thing I don't understand. It is this don't \nask, don't tell policy. We all know that brave gay men and women have \nserved in our country's uniform throughout its history, and yet we have \nthis policy. Take, for example, General Smith.\n  I then pointed to the commander of the base.\n  I said: Now, here is one of the bravest men ever in the history of \nour country\n\n[[Page S7254]]\n\nto don our Nation's uniform in battle, and yet he is one of the gayest \nmen I have ever met.\n  And they started laughing and cheering.\n  I said: Now, why should General Smith have to stay in the closet when \nhe is such a great leader? General Smith, stand up and wave.\n  He got up and waved, and everyone cheered. And in the bleachers there \nwas a group of women soldiers who cheered extra loudly and waved at \nhim, and he waved back at them.\n  At the very end of the show, we sang ``American Soldier'' by Toby \nKeith.\n  I don't know if you know that song. It is a beautiful song. I will \nalways remember while doing the USO tours seeing soldiers with their \narms around each other crying and singing: I don't do it for the money. \nI've got bills that I can't pay.\n  At the end of the show, the general came up and gave me this \nbeautiful frame with an American flag that had flown over the base. He \ngave it to every member of our troop. When he gave it to me, he said, \n``Al, keep telling those don't ask don't tell jokes. I think you may \nhave some fans up there.'' And he pointed at those women. Later, those \nwomen came up to me and said, ``We are gay.'' And I think everybody \nknew it.\n  This was in 2006 when it was really hard for the military to recruit \npeople, so they gave waivers out at that time. They gave waivers--moral \nwaivers. They gave waivers for people who didn't do as well in school \nor didn't graduate from school. I swear, if you asked every man and \nwoman on that base: Who would you rather have standing to your right \nand left, that gay man or that gay woman who has been serving with you \nfor the last year or somebody who comes in here with a moral waiver--\nand many of those troops who had moral waivers served very honorably \nand bravely--or someone with a cognitive waiver--and many of those \nflourished in the military--they would say: I want that gay soldier, \nthat lesbian soldier, who I know has been on my right and on my left.\n  All gay and lesbian servicemembers want is to be able to serve. \nInstead, people are getting kicked out of the military--people who \ndon't need any kind of conduct waiver, people who don't need standards \nlowered for them in order to serve, people who are patriotic and \ncourageous and who have vital, irreplaceable skills.\n  What is more, the evidence is clear from other countries that have \nallowed gay and lesbian citizens to serve openly in their military--and \nSusan Collins spoke about this today. That evidence says this will not \nbe a problem. Ask the Israelis, ask the Canadians, and ask the British. \nThey have all successfully implemented open service.\n  But it is not only that the military is ready for this change; don't \nask, don't tell is just costly for the military. Thousands of willing \nand capable Americans with needed skills have been kicked out of the \nmilitary because of this foolish policy--and this policy alone. These \nare soldiers, airmen, and sailors in whom we have invested time and \ntraining. We cannot afford to lose dedicated personnel with critical \nskills when we are engaged in two wars.\n  On top of that, do we want our military officers spending valuable \ntime and resources investigating and kicking troops out of the military \nfor being gay?\n  The argument offered by some opponents is that this legislation goes \nback on the promise to take into account the comprehensive review being \nconducted by the Pentagon, but that is just a canard.\n  Let me remind you what Secretary Gates said about the review when he \ntestified before the Armed Services Committee back in February. \nSecretary Gates said:\n\n       I fully support the President's decision. The question \n     before us is not whether the military prepares to make this \n     change, but how we best prepare for it.\n\n  Not whether, but how. That process is going forward, and the \nprovision in this bill repealing the flawed don't ask, don't tell \npolicy does nothing to interfere with the Pentagon's process. All the \nprovision does is repeal the existing law. It does not tell the \nDepartment of Defense how to implement the repeal.\n  What is more, the repeal itself doesn't even go into effect until \nafter the Pentagon's comprehensive review is complete and the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff have certified that the Department of Defense has prepared the \nnecessary policies and regulations for implementation. They must also \ncertify that the implementation is consistent with military readiness \nand effectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and retention.\n  To be honest, I am not fully satisfied with that compromise. I wanted \na moratorium on discharges. But that is the compromise, and it doesn't \nundercut the Pentagon's review in any way.\n  Don't ask, don't tell makes no sense. It is foolish, it is unjust, \nand we must end it. The country is ready, the military is ready, and it \nis the right thing to do. I urge all of my colleagues to stand for \nequality and for common sense and to stand for our troops. It is long \npast time to end don't ask, don't tell. We will be proud that we did.\n  Let me turn to the DREAM Act, which also would have come up if we had \nbeen able to get cloture and move to the Defense authorization bill.\n  Minnesota is what it is today because we welcomed immigrants with \nopen arms. We welcomed the Swedes, who first tilled our fields and \nbuilt our railroads. We welcomed the Norwegians, who thrived in our \nlumber industry and founded choirs that remain the best in the world \ntoday. We welcomed the Danes, who made our State a leader in dairy \nfarming. We welcomed the Germans, the Finns, the Poles, and the Czechs.\n  In fact, from the time we were admitted to the Union in 1858 until \n1890, no less than one-third of Minnesotans were born abroad. Today, \nmost of the people we welcome don't come from Europe. They don't speak \nSwedish or German. They speak Spanish or Hmong or Somali, and they are \nnot one-third of our population. Just 7 percent of Minnesotans were \nborn abroad. So there are far fewer immigrants in Minnesota by \npercentage. Mr. President, let me tell you, these folks work just as \nhard and they show just as much promise.\n  I rise to speak in support of the DREAM Act because just by passing \nthis law we can do something remarkable to help those Minnesotans--at \nleast some of them. This is a group of young people who were brought \nhere by their parents. They were raised as Americans and, for the most \npart, speak English just like you and I. But because their parents made \na mistake, because their parents broke the law and entered the country \nillegally, or overstayed a visa, these kids are stuck. They can't go to \ncollege. They can't get jobs. They can't join our military. They are \nout of luck, and our society is going to pay for it.\n  The DREAM Act would allow these students to reenter society, to come \nout of the shadows of society to study or to serve in our country's \nmilitary.\n  I want to put faces to the young people of Minnesota who would \nbenefit from the DREAM Act. I am going to change their names to protect \ntheir identity.\n  There is a young man named Daniel. Daniel came to the United States \nfrom Colombia when he was 8. He grew up in the suburbs, and he ran \nvarsity track and cross-country for his high school. Since he couldn't \nget a driver's license, he took a 2-hour bus ride every day just to get \nto classes at Normandale Community College. In his second year, \nDaniel's father died, leaving Daniel and his mother without any income.\n  Daniel almost dropped out, but he didn't. Instead, he became the \nfirst member of his family to graduate from college, with dual \nassociate degrees in education and computer science--both with honors. \nDaniel is now at the University of Minnesota. He is trying to get his \nbachelor's degree. But since he can't work, he can't afford to attend \nschool full time. So every semester, Daniel saves up all of his money \nto take just one class. He is completing his bachelor's one class at a \ntime.\n  There is another remarkable young Minnesotan, Javier, who came to \nthis country at the age of 15. He enrolled in St. Paul High School and \nquickly learned English, and by his senior year was taking advanced \nplacement and college courses and volunteering at the State capitol. He \neven started to like the weather in Minnesota.\n  Today, Javier is an elected leader of student government at a college \nin our\n\n[[Page S7255]]\n\nState. He has become a role model not just for immigrants but for all \nhis fellow students. Javier wants to dedicate his career to improving \nour educational system. But because of the decision his parents made, \nhe can't.\n  I get letters from students like these all the time. Many of them are \njust as talented, and they all ask me for the same thing: the \nopportunity to work hard for this country. Let me repeat that: They \nonly ask for the opportunity to work hard for this country.\n\n  Another young woman wrote me to ask:\n\n       We do not want welfare or any money. We are not asking for \n     immunity to the law. We are only asking for a chance to come \n     out to the light and live like any other person.\n\n  There are a lot of reasons we should help them. The first reason is \nthat it is the smart thing to do. Some of my colleagues have stood here \nand said they couldn't believe the DREAM Act might be included in the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  In fact, the Defense Department has supported the DREAM Act since the \nBush administration. This bill is actually a part of our Nation's \nstrategic defense plan--hence, the Defense authorization bill. It will \nincentivize and reward students to wear our Nation's uniform, and our \nNation will be safer because of it.\n  Here is another reason this is smart. We don't want kids like Javier \ndoing dishes. We don't want kids like Daniel taking 10 years to get \ntheir bachelor's degree. We want them studying, contributing to our \neconomy, and serving in our military. But there is a far more important \nreason we should pass the DREAM Act, and that is because it is the \nright thing to do.\n  Mr. President, there is a passage in Leviticus--a book that appears \nin both the Old Testament and the Torah--which I think is appropriate. \nLeviticus is a book of laws. It is said to describe God's covenant with \nthe Israelites. This is chapter 19, verse 33:\n\n       When the foreigner resides with you in your land, you shall \n     not oppress the foreigner. The foreigner who resides with you \n     shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the \n     foreigner as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of \n     Egypt.\n\n  Mr. President, these are children, and we need to help them. They \nhave learned in our schools, they have played with our kids, and they \nwant to serve our country. We just need to give them a chance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is clear from the debate on the Defense \nbill and the vote that was held a bit ago that this is a partisan time \nfor our Nation. I come to the floor this afternoon to talk about an \nissue that is not at all partisan; that is, the question of doing \npublic business in public.\n  When you say those words--``doing public business in public''--people \nare almost flabbergasted when they are told that, regrettably, much of \nthe important decisionmaking in the Senate is not done with that level \nof public accountability and public transparency. That is because of \nwhat are known as secret holds where one Senator--just one--in a \ncompletely anonymous fashion, can block a bill or a nomination from \neven coming to light, from even being heard in the Senate.\n  For years now, there has been a bipartisan effort to change this \nprocedure, to require that all Senators be held accountable. Senator \nGrassley and I have been involved in this effort in a bipartisan way \nfor over a dozen years--for a dozen years--trying every way we could. \nWe established the principle that the Senate would do public business \nin public, and if a Senator wanted to object to a bill or a nomination, \nthey would have to be publicly accountable.\n  For years now, the defenders of secrecy, the defenders of a system \nwithout transparency and accountability look for one dodge or another. \nBut our bipartisan group--on the other side of the aisle, Senator \nGrassley, of course, the champion, Senator Collins, Senator Inhofe, a \nvery significant bipartisan group; over on our side of the aisle, and \nparticularly appreciative, is Senator McCaskill, who has done such hard \nwork on the principle of establishing open accountability; my colleague \nfrom the Pacific Northwest, Senator Murray, an influential member of \nthe Rules Committee, want this level of public accountability. It has \nbeen a big bipartisan group, and we seek to finally change this \nprocedure through an amendment that would have been possible under the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  It was said in the course of this discussion that a bipartisan effort \nto end secret holds through an amendment to the Defense authorization \nbill is ``a corruption of the process and procedures of the Senate if \never there was one.'' I believe the use of secret holds and not a \nbipartisan effort to end them is the real corruption of the procedures \nof the Senate.\n  Secret holds cannot be found anywhere in the U.S. Constitution or \nanywhere in the Senate rules. We have had a considerable debate over \nthe last few months about the Constitution, our reverence for this \nsacred document. Secret holds are nowhere in the Constitution and \nnowhere in the Senate rules. Yet in this Congress alone, they have been \nused to block what seems to be dozens of qualified nominees. I point \nout, this has gone on for years and years on both sides of the aisle. \nThat is the point Senator Grassley and I have emphasized for over a \ndecade: that this is an area of abuse where we have seen both sides of \nthe aisle use the secret processes to the detriment of the public \ninterest.\n  The real corruption of the process, in my view, is the way secret \nholds have been used to block the Senate from acting on numerous \nnominations and pieces of legislation without any accountability to the \npublic. That is why I believe it ought to be possible to debate a \nbipartisan amendment, to do public business in public to end these \nsecret holds.\n  The reason it needs to be done now is because past efforts to ban \nthese secret procedures have been blocked from getting a vote. This has \nhappened five times in just the past few months.\n  In the course of the debate as well, there was a discussion about \nwhat our bipartisan effort--to do public business in public--has to do \nwith national security. The answer is: a great deal.\n  For example, earlier this year, one of our colleagues secretly placed \na blanket hold on 70 nominations to critical positions in the Federal \nGovernment that were pending before the Senate. These nominations \nincluded nominees to positions in the Defense Department and the State \nDepartment. The Senator who secretly held up those 70 nominees said he \nwas doing it to address national security concerns.\n  Let me repeat that. We had 70 nominees under a blanket hold being \nheld up from even an open debate to address national security concerns.\n  It turned out that this particular Senator was concerned about a \ndispute about the Defense Department's contracting practices and an \nearmark for a counterterrorism center in the Senator's home State. This \none example shows that secret holds have been used, and certainly the \nquestion of whether they have been abused, to hold up dozens of \nqualified nominees over defense and national security issues.\n  This is only one example. Even today, there is at least one nominee \nfor a national security position whose nomination is secretly being \nheld up. No one knows who has the hold or why it has been placed.\n  I come back to the connection, first, that changing these Senate \nprocedures so public business is done in public is fundamental to all \nthe operations of the Senate and certainly our accountability to the \nAmerican people. But it has a direct link because of the examples I \nhave cited this afternoon to the future of national security policy in \nour country.\n  The continued use of secret holds is an abuse of secrecy by the \nSenate, and there is no better time to end this undemocratic process \nthan through an amendment to the Defense bill. With colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle determined, finally, to get this done, I believe we \nwill get it done when we get an open debate.\n  Our democracy and our national security are weakened when secrecy is \nabused. I very much appreciate the opportunity this afternoon to \nhighlight a number of key points in this discussion. First, this has \nabsolutely nothing to do with partisanship. Second, it is absolutely \nkey to the fundamental accountability of the Senate to the American \npeople to end this process of secrecy and of all Senators held \naccountable. Finally, this has a direct\n\n[[Page S7256]]\n\nconnection to matters of national security because in so many \ninstances, these secret holds have kept appointments to key national \nsecurity positions from being open to debate and scrutiny in the \nSenate.\n  At the end of the day, there are a lot of issues we face in the \nSenate that are hard to explain, that are complicated, and they are \nhard for folks to follow at home. What is not hard to explain is why it \nis so important to do public business in public.\n  At a time when the American people are certainly voicing considerable \nskepticism about the ways of Washington, this is a chance to show the \nAmerican people that the Senate is listening to them, that we share \ntheir commitment to open government, to doing public business in \npublic. I hope the Senate will be able to change this offensive, \nantidemocratic procedure that has been used way too long to keep the \nAmerican people from seeing the way the Senate operates.\n  I look forward to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle having \nthe debate on ending secret holds, doing public business in public. I \nbelieve that when we get that vote, we will get a resounding vote to \nfinally close this dark chapter in the way the Senate does business and \nbring some sunshine to the decisionmaking process in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to talk about the vote we had a \nlittle while ago and the need to go to the Defense authorization bill. \nTo me it is unconscionable that, at a time in which the Nation is at \nwar, our Republican colleagues would vote lockstep, in uniformity, to \noppose going to the Defense authorization bill--for whatever the \nreasons are, even though I do not find the reasons to be valid.\n  I think it is very clear that the majority leader said there would be \na host of amendments that would be offered once we went to the bill and \ndisposed of a few particular amendments that the majority leader was \ngoing to offer, that are in every way germane to the Defense \nauthorization bill, more germane than the amendments that have been \noffered in the past on extraneous matters by those who oppose \nproceeding to the bill. They thought it was fitting and appropriate to \noffer it on the Defense authorization bill. Yet, when you have \namendments that go to the very heart of how you recruit individuals for \nthe Armed Forces and how you allow individuals to serve in the Armed \nForces, that is not germane? Ridiculous.\n  What this is all about is an attempt once again to use the power of \nthe minority to obstruct the process of making sure this Congress is \nmoving forward and meeting its obligations to the American people, and \nin this particular case to the Nation's collective security. Because \nsomeone does not like an amendment to be offered doesn't mean they \nshould use their power simply to obstruct the whole process of \nconsidering the Defense authorization bill. Clearly they would have the \nopportunity to vote against any amendment they believed was not, in \ntheir view, in line with their views or in the national interest, but \ncertainly not to stop the process.\n  What is it? I looked at Senator McConnell's consent offer. It is \ninteresting. His consent offer basically said you have to do a whole \nbunch of amendments before you can do anything related to immigration. \nFirst of all, the DREAM Act is in total focus on recruiting in the \nUnited States. What does it say? It says young people who, by no fault \nof their own, no choice of their own, were brought to this country and \ndo not have a legal status here, and are willing to fight and maybe die \nfor their country--because this is the country they know, this is the \ncountry they believe is theirs, and they are willing to join the Armed \nForces of the United States and serve with honor and distinction and \nrisk their lives in defense of the country--if they did all of that, \nthen a couple of years down the line they would have a shot at becoming \na permanent resident of the United States, but their service to the \nNation would precede that.\n  Even those who say on the campaign trail ``we are for the DREAM \nAct,'' even those who are cosponsors and say ``no, we are for the DREAM \nAct,'' could not cast a vote to allow us to go to the Defense \nauthorization bill--which is much bigger than that--and then ultimately \npermit an up-or-down vote on several of those amendments before we got \nto a whole host of other amendments that Members are going to be able \nto offer, under the guise, under the cloak of saying, ``Oh, no, we \nopposed it because we were not going to have our opportunity, our \nsay,'' when clearly the majority leader said there would be a whole \nhost of amendments offered and clearly when amendments have been \noffered in the past under Democratic majority and Democratic rule. So \nthe precedent there is that this particular bill has always had a wide \nrange of amendments--the hypocrisy of saying no, you can't have an \n``immigration amendment'' even though that amendment deals with \nrecruiting people into the Armed Forces of this country.\n  The bottom line is we have had bill after bill debated in this Senate \nhaving nothing to do with immigration and the other side of the aisle \nhas come forward with all types of amendments, immigration related, of \nall sorts. Whether it was a bill about jobs and the economy, whether it \nwas a bill about health care, it doesn't matter--motherhood and apple \npie--we had immigration amendments.\n  Yet, when we have the opportunity to bolster the armed services of \nthe country and those who are willing to risk their lives to defend the \ncountry, we are told, oh, no, that is inappropriate. That clearly is so \ntransparent that I hope the Nation understands, and particularly in \ncommunities that were looking for the opportunity of the DREAM Act, to \nhave a vote on it, it is understood.\n  It is pretty amazing to me when I go to Walter Reed, and I have been \nthere in the past, or when I visited some of our troops in my travels \nabroad and see young men and women there who are not citizens of the \nUnited States yet. It is pretty amazing to me when I go to Walter Reed \nand see them with both of their legs blown off in support of the \ncountry they call their own, wearing the uniform of the United States, \nthat people question whether they love this country and are willing to \nserve it. They rejoice when, after their service, they get to take an \noath and become citizens of this country. These are sacrifices which \nthe few have been called upon to make for the many who do not have to \ngo. There is a small universe who have gone to defend this Nation \ncompared to the large universe of all of us as Americans who get \ndefended by the men and women in uniform--it is a small percentage of \nAmerica. Yet, many of that percentage who wear the uniform and risk \ntheir lives cannot call themselves a citizen. They are permanent \nresidents of the United States. They aspire to become citizens. But \nthey are not able to serve the country they call home.\n  It is fundamentally wrong, in my mind, to simply not allow a vote. \nYet not one Republican was willing to come forth and vote to proceed to \na debate and to consider amendments on the Defense authorization bill \nsimply because of an ideological view they hold as it relates to the \nfirst two amendments that would have been up in a long line of \namendments. Imagine if Democrats had lockstep voted against the Defense \nauthorization bill at a time of war--imagine.\n  I see the majority leader moved to change his vote in order to be in \na position to reconsider. I hope we will have that opportunity. I hope \nthere will be some enlightenment into understanding that there will be \nplenty of opportunities for all amendments. There will be a robust \ndebate. There will be the opportunity for up-or-down votes on the \namendments on both the DREAM Act--which, as I have said, is about \ngiving those young people an opportunity to serve their country, either \neducationally and/or in the armed services of the country, and to have \nto do so and perform before they get any relief--and, at the same time, \nto let many already in the service of their country and performing \nvaliantly and\n\n[[Page S7257]]\n\nrisking their life and limb be able to do so without hiding their own \nperson, who they are. Then we will go on to all the other amendments.\n  It is amazing to me that we have a lockstep vote to stop us from \nproceeding to this legislation. I hope all those communities and others \nwho both care about the defense of the Nation and those who believe in \nthe dignity of an individual who is serving their country, who believe \nin the opportunity to serve their country, will rise and their voices \nwill say no more filibustering, no more obstruction, no more ``no's,'' \nit is time to say yes to our country, it is time to say yes to our \ndefense, it is time to say yes to those individuals willing to serve.\n  Many others may not be willing to serve and we respect their choices. \nBut let's not stop those who are willing to serve, willing to wear the \nuniform of the United States, willing to risk their lives, willing to \ndefend their country. The vote that was taken sends all the wrong \nmessages. It is, in fact, a shame.\n  I hope we will have an opportunity another time and that the lights \nof some people will be able to turn on and we will have an opportunity \nto make sure we move to a Defense authorization bill. As the Nation is \nin the midst of winding down one war and is fully engaged in another \nwar, I hope we will have the opportunity for those who want to serve \ntheir country to be able to do so and earn their way, in the process in \nserving to have an opportunity to fully call America home, and for \nthose who are serving already, gallantly, who are serving with \ndistinction and courage and honor, not to have to hide who they are. \nThat is what is at stake. That is why it was so important to move \nforward and that is why today's vote is one that is shameful, hopefully \none we can turn around.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I had hoped we could begin consideration of \nthe annual National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, today but, \nhopefully, we will consider it as our first business when we reconvene \nafter the election.\n  I filed three amendments that deserve serious consideration by the \nSenate, two of them dealing with the New START treaty. It is important \nto deal with these amendments before consideration of the treaty.\n  Amendments Nos. 4636 and 4638 deal with modernization of the U.S. \nnuclear deterrent, which is directly related to the reductions called \nfor by the treaty; and, the Bilateral Consultative Commission, of which \nmuch has been written concerning the implications for the Senate's \nprerogatives in the treaty making function. Amendment No. 4637 deals \nwith a matter of great concern, China's reckless disregard for the \ninternational nonproliferation regime. I will ask that the article, \n``NSG Makes Little Headway at Meeting'' from the Arms Control \nAssociation Web site be printed in the Record.\n  Regarding amendments Nos. 4636 and 4638, I will first briefly discuss \namendment No. 4636 concerning START and modernization of the U.S. \nnuclear deterrent. In section 1251 of the fiscal year 2010 National \nDefense Authorization Act, the administration was required to provide a \ncomprehensive plan for the nuclear weapons stockpile, nuclear weapons \ncomplex and delivery platforms. The report--hereinafter the 1251 Plan--\nwas delivered to the Senate with the new START treaty on May 13, 2010.\n  While the 1251 Plan identified certain administration proposals to \nmaintain and modernize our nuclear deterrent, it became quickly \napparent that the plan, prepared on a tight schedule, did not provide a \nfully detailed picture of what is needed to modernize the U.S. nuclear \ndeterrent and how much it will cost. Of course, additional decisions \nand revised budget estimates will continue to be made over the next \ndecade of the 1251 Plan's scope. That is why the 1251 Plan and the \ncorresponding budget will require regular updating--a point often \nrepeated by the Directors of the national nuclear weapons laboratories.\n  As Dr. George Miller, Director of Lawrence Livermore National \nLaboratory, testified:\n\n       It is important to note that the nature of NNSA's work \n     requires program flexibility because technical issues arise \n     in the stockpile and requirements evolve. The scope of work \n     and budgets will need to be correspondingly adjusted. Annual \n     updates . . . could provide a mechanism to outline the \n     program's funding requirements and projections.\n\n  My amendment No. 4636 codifies that recommendation and resolves the \nissues of evolving requirements and costs by requiring the President to \nprovide a detailed update to the 1251 Plan report annually, for the \nduration of the new START treaty, describing revisions or adjustments \nto the plan as well as progress on satisfying the requirements of \nsection 1251. Reductions in the nuclear force posture are tied to the \nsubmission of that update. As the Secretary of Defense has stated, \nthere are 7 years to implement the treaty reductions; thus, a 1-year \nnotice-and-wait requirement should not cause any difficulty.\n  Additionally, the unbiased input of the directors of the NNSA \nlaboratories and facilities will accompany the report as validation \nthat adequate resources are being provided by the administration in \nsupport of sustainment and modernization activities. This is quite \nsimilar to the annual stockpile assessments as those familiar with that \nprocess will recognize.\n  This amendment fosters improved project management, a detailed \ncommitment to sustaining the U.S. nuclear deterrent, and reflects \nstrong bi-partisan support for nuclear weapon complex modernization.\n  I appreciate the broad support expressed for modernization. As \nSecretary Gates stated in his October 2008 Carnegie Endowment speech:\n\n       [t]o be blunt, there is absolutely no way we can maintain a \n     credible deterrent and reduce the number of weapons in our \n     stockpile without either resorting to testing our stockpile \n     or pursuing a modernization program.\n\n  Concerning amendment No. 4638, the purpose is equally clear: to \nmaintain the role of the Senate in treaty making. The Bilateral \nConsultative Commission authority is very broad. As Jack Goldsmith and \nJeremy Rabkin observed in an August 4 Washington Post op-ed piece, \n``New START Treaty could erode Senate's foreign policy role'':\n\n       This treaty . . . does, however, create a Bilateral \n     Consultative Commission with power to approve `additional \n     measures as may be necessary to improve the viability and \n     effectiveness of the treaty.' The U.S. and Russian executive \n     branches can implement these measures and thus amend U.S. \n     treaty obligations--without returning to the U.S. Senate or \n     the Russian Duma.\n\n  The time to deal with this concern is now. The Lugar Resolution of \nRatification approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee makes a \ngenuine effort to address concerns; I hope to work with the ranking \nmember to further improve his Resolution. But more can and should be \ndone in binding legislative language, such as my amendment. These \nprovisions are essential if we are interested in protecting the \nSenate's constitutional role and our missile defense and conventional \nprompt global strike capabilities.\n  As Messrs. Goldsmith and Rabkin observed:\n\n       If the administration does have a problem with them, the \n     Senate should worry--about the commission's power to limit \n     missile defense, the executive's attempt to limit the \n     Senate's constitutional role in the treaty process, or both.\n\n  I am pleased to have the support of Senator Sessions, the ranking \nmember on the Senate Judiciary Committee and a senior member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, who has cosponsored this amendment. I \nask unanimous consent that the Goldsmith-Rabkin article be printed in \nthe Record in addition to the article from the Arms Control \nAssociation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Arms Control Association]\n\n                  NSG Makes Little Headway at Meeting\n\n                           (By Daniel Horner)\n\n       The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) last month concluded its \n     annual plenary meeting with little apparent progress on two \n     high-profile issues, the potential sale of two reactors from \n     China to Pakistan and the adoption of more-stringent rules \n     for sensitive nuclear exports.\n       The Chinese-Pakistani deal was not on the formal agenda for \n     the meeting in Christchurch, New Zealand, but sources from \n     participating governments said the matter was discussed.\n       The group's June 25 public statement at the end of the \n     meeting does not specifically mention the discussions, but it \n     says that the NSG ``took note of briefings on developments \n     concerning non-NSG states. It agreed on the value of ongoing \n     consultation and transparency.''\n       The planned Chinese sale is an issue for the NSG because \n     the group's guidelines do not\n\n[[Page S7258]]\n\n     allow the sale of nuclear goods such as reactors and fuel to \n     countries that do not accept International Atomic Energy \n     Agency (IAEA) safeguards on all their nuclear facilities. \n     Pakistan does not have these so-called full-scope safeguards.\n       When China joined the NSG in 2004, it had already built a \n     power reactor at Pakistan's Chashma site. It claimed at the \n     time that, under the NSG's ``grandfather'' provisions, it was \n     entitled to build a second reactor, on the grounds that the \n     second project was covered in its existing agreement with \n     Pakistan. According to several accounts, the group agreed \n     that the second reactor would be allowable under the \n     grandfather provision but that subsequent power reactor sales \n     would not.\n       In the weeks before the June 21-25 Christchurch meeting, \n     the U.S. government said the sale of reactors beyond Chashma-\n     1 and -2 would be ``inconsistent with NSG guidelines and \n     China's commitments to the NSG.'' (See ACT, June 2010.)\n       In its public statements, China has responded to questions \n     about the deal in general terms. At a June 24 press \n     conference, Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said, ``China \n     and Pakistan, following the principle of equality and mutual \n     benefit, have been cooperating on nuclear energy for civilian \n     use. Our cooperation is consistent with the two countries' \n     respective international obligations, entirely for peaceful \n     purpose[s] and subject to IAEA safeguard[s] and \n     supervision.''\n       It it not clear what additional information China provided \n     at the Christchurch meeting. According to a European \n     diplomat, the discussion was ``not confrontational.''\n\n\n                          Clarification Sought\n\n       In a June 30 e-mail to Arms Control Today, a U.S. \n     Department of State official said, ``We are still waiting for \n     more information from China to clarify China's intended \n     cooperation with Pakistan, in light of China's NSG \n     commitments.''\n       According to the official, ``The United States has \n     reiterated concern that the transfer of new reactors at \n     Chasma appears to extend beyond cooperation that was \n     `grandfathered' when China was approved for membership in the \n     NSG. If not covered by the grandfather clause, such \n     cooperation would require a specific exception approved by \n     consensus of the NSG.''\n       In 2008 the NSG, led by the United States, granted an \n     exemption making India eligible to receive nuclear exports \n     from NSG members. Like Pakistan, India does not have full-\n     scope safeguards.\n       The NSG, which currently has 46 members, operates by \n     consensus. It is not a formal organization, and its export \n     guidelines are nonbinding. Before the 2008 NSG exemption, \n     Russia made and carried out deals with India for reactors and \n     fuel, justifying them on the basis of interpretations of the \n     NSG guidelines that other members considered overly \n     expansive.\n\n\n                      Enrichment and Reprocessing\n\n       A long-standing issue for the NSG has been its effort to \n     adopt a more rigorous standard for exports relating to \n     uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing. Since 2004, \n     the group has been discussing a new, so-called criteria-based \n     set of guidelines for enrichment and reprocessing transfers, \n     under which recipients of these proliferation-sensitive \n     exports would have to meet a list of preset requirements. The \n     list drafted by the group includes adherence to the nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Treaty, full-scope safeguards, and an \n     additional protocol, which gives the IAEA enhanced inspection \n     authority. However, the NSG members have not been able to \n     overcome certain states' objections to the proposal. Current \n     NSG guidelines simply call for members to exercise \n     ``restraint'' with respect to enrichment and reprocessing \n     exports.\n       At the end of 2008, the suppliers appeared to be close to \n     an agreement (see ACT, December 2008), but since then they \n     have not been able to reach consensus. According to the \n     Christchurch public statement, ``Participating Governments \n     agreed to continue considering ways to further strengthen \n     guidelines dealing with the transfer of enrichment and \n     reprocessing technologies.''\n       In a June 27 e-mail to Arms Control Today, the European \n     diplomat said that ``while progress was made there was no \n     consensus'' on the matter. Before the meeting, observers said \n     the main objections were coming from South Africa and Turkey. \n     The diplomat declined to identify the sources of the \n     objections at the meeting but said, ``The delegations which \n     have had difficulties in the past continue to have \n     problems.''\n       Meanwhile, at their June 25-26 meeting in Muskoka, Canada, \n     the Group of Eight (G-8) industrialized countries extended \n     their policy to adopt on a national basis the proposed NSG \n     guidelines on enrichment and reprocessing transfers. The \n     leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the \n     United Kingdom, and the United States said in their summit \n     communique, ``We reiterate our commitment as found in \n     paragraph 8 of the L'Aquila Statement on Non-Proliferation.''\n       Paragraph 8 of the L'Aquila statement, issued at the July \n     2009 G-8 summit in Italy, said the eight countries would \n     implement as ``national policy'' for a year the draft NSG \n     guidelines on enrichment and reprocessing and urged the NSG \n     ``to accelerate its work and swiftly reach consensus this \n     year to allow for global implementation of a strengthened \n     mechanism on transfers of enrichment and reprocessing \n     facilities, equipment, and technology.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 4, 2010]\n\n       New START Treaty Could Erode Senate's Foreign Policy Role\n\n                 (By Jack Goldsmith and Jeremy Rabkin)\n\n       Critics of the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) \n     warn that it may endanger the United States' capacity to go \n     forward with missile defense. But the treaty, Senate \n     consideration of which has been pushed back to the fall, \n     raises another concern. Consent to it as it stands will \n     further erode the Senate's constitutional role in American \n     foreign policy.\n       This treaty does not constrain future development of \n     missile defense (except in a few limited ways). It does, \n     however, create a Bilateral Consultative Commission with \n     power to approve ``additional measures as may be necessary to \n     improve the viability and effectiveness of the treaty.'' The \n     U.S. and Russian executive branches can implement these \n     measures and thus amend U.S. treaty obligations--without \n     returning to the U.S. Senate or the Russian Duma.\n       Could the commission constrain missile defense? It is \n     empowered to ``resolve questions related to the applicability \n     of provisions of the Treaty to a new kind of strategic \n     offensive arm.'' The treaty's preamble recognizes ``the \n     interrelationship between strategic offensive arms and \n     strategic defensive arms.'' The commission might have \n     jurisdiction over missile defense through this \n     interrelationship. Russia has already warned that it might \n     withdraw from the treaty if the United States develops \n     missile defenses. Limits on missile defense systems thus \n     might be ``necessary to improve the viability and \n     effectiveness of the Treaty.''\n       Supporters say the treaty allows the commission to make \n     only changes that, in the words of one State Department \n     official, ``do not affect substantive rights or obligations \n     under the Treaty.'' This assurance provides little comfort. \n     New START does not explain what counts as a ``substantive \n     right,'' and the commission, which is given very broad power \n     to interpret the treaty, will itself decide the issue.\n       It is true that the amendment procedure contemplated in the \n     new treaty is similar to one in the original START and that \n     amendment procedures of this sort have been embedded in arms \n     control agreements for decades. Also, the president has long \n     exercised an independent authority to make new international \n     agreements that implement treaties. Why should the Senate \n     care about this issue now?\n       One reason is that as treaty delegations of this sort have \n     expanded, and as more authority for making international \n     agreements is transferred to the executive branch and \n     international organizations, the cumulative effect of these \n     arrangements becomes increasingly hard to square with the \n     Senate's constitutional role in the treaty-making process \n     and, more generally, with separation of powers.\n       Some courts have begun to give credence to this concern. In \n     2006, the federal appellate court for the District of \n     Columbia declined to implement the ``adjustments'' that an \n     international organization had made to an environmental \n     treaty even though the political branches agreed to the \n     adjustment process. The court noted the ``significant debate \n     over the constitutionality of assigning lawmaking functions \n     to international bodies'' and held that treating the treaty \n     adjustments as law ``would raise serious constitutional \n     questions in light of the nondelegation doctrine, numerous \n     constitutional procedural requirements for making law, and \n     the separation of powers.''\n       Another reason is that courts often look to the practice \n     between the branches of government in determining \n     constitutional limits. If the Senate continually acquiesces \n     in delegating international lawmaking to the president and \n     international organizations, courts are unlikely to protect \n     senatorial power in the end. Moreover, arms control treaties \n     such as New START rarely come before courts.\n       In short, only the Senate can protect its constitutional \n     prerogatives.\n       One way for the Senate to do this would be to condition its \n     consent to the treaty on an interpretive ``understanding'' \n     that the commission's amendment power extend only to \n     technical treaty matters and not to limitations on missile \n     defense. Understandings of this sort are common in U.S. \n     treaties. The Senate could also condition consent to the \n     treaty on a requirement that it be notified about \n     deliberations of this commission.\n       Such provisions would preserve the commission's core \n     authority while constraining it in ways that eliminate the \n     most serious constitutional objections. They would also lay \n     down a marker about the Senate's role in this context.\n       The State Department insists that ``there were no secret \n     deals made in connection with the New START Treaty; not on \n     missile defense or any other issue.'' If that is true, the \n     administration should have no problem with minor Senate \n     tweaks of this sort. If the administration does have a \n     problem with them, the Senate should worry--about the \n     commission's power to limit missile defense, the executive's \n     attempt to limit the Senate's constitutional role in the \n     treaty process, or both.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise today to express my profound \ndisappointment that we were unable to\n\n[[Page S7259]]\n\nproceed to the Defense authorization bill. First and foremost, this is \nan important bill that provides our men and women in uniform with the \nresources they so desperately require while they bravely fight \noverseas. Day in and day out they make sacrifices to keep us safe, and \nthe fact that we were unable to proceed to a bill that provides them \nnot only with the equipment they need, but also provides for their \nfamilies, is extremely disheartening.\n  Not only does this bill provide necessary requirements for our armed \nservices, but it also contains landmark legislation that would finally \nlead to the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. Today, my colleagues and \nI, had a historic opportunity to put a stop to this discriminatory \npolicy, and the fact that the Republicans blocked the bill from being \ndebated is discouraging. The current policy actively discourages a \nsignificant portion of our population that is willing, capable, and \nable from serving in our military at a time when our Nation is at war \nand needs our best and brightest to serve. We owe it to the gay and \nlesbian community to repeal this law. I am confident that today's \nmilitary is ready for this change, and most importantly, it is the \nright thing to do.\n  Since 1993, when don't ask, don't tell was implemented, over 14,000 \nmen and women have been discharged from the service at a cost of over \n$600 million to the American taxpayer. These gay and lesbian service \nmembers, who are proud to serve in our military, and are often serving \nin critical specialties, are being denied the opportunity to fight \nbased solely on their sexual orientation. We cannot afford to continue \nto discharge these brave soldiers in whom we have invested time, \nresources, and training. We cannot afford this policy monetarily, but \nmost importantly, we cannot afford this policy because it negatively \naffects our national defense.\n  It has been estimated that approximately 48,000 gay and lesbians are \ncurrently serving in today's military. That means that there are 48,000 \nmen and women who on a daily basis are being forced to lie about who \nthey are so they can continue to serve their Nation proudly. These are \npatriotic Americans who are willing to put their lives on the line in \ndefense of our country but are unable to do so openly, simply because \nof who they are. Gay and lesbian service members fight, and die, \nalongside their fellow troops. It is time we stop asking them to live a \nlie.\n  I have travelled overseas many times and have met with our troops--\nall kinds of men and women--first generation Americans and those with a \nlong family history of service, members of every race and religion, \nand, yes, gays and lesbians. No matter what their religious background, \nnationality, or sexual orientation they are all unmistakably proud to \nbe serving the United States of America. It makes no sense to me why we \nwould deny that right to serve to any American who is brave enough to \nanswer the call of duty.\n  As we forge ahead in the coming weeks, I urge my colleagues to fully \nrepeal don't ask, don't tell. The time to do so is now; we can afford \nto wait no longer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, like many Americans, I am \nfrustrated with the gridlock in the Senate, and I am very concerned by \nour dysfunctionality, witnessed once again here today. When we were \nasked to lead on critical issues facing our men and women in uniform, \nour troops--also tied to our national security and our international \nleadership in the 21st century--the Senate has once again taken a pass, \nhas once again let politics obstruct our progress.\n  Coloradans sent me here to lead, like they sent the Presiding Officer \nhere from her great State of North Carolina, and to find solutions to \nproblems however vexing. I, for one, am increasingly tired of the \npartisan wrangling that besets each and every issue.\n  This debate, like so many others we have attempted to have, was \nderailed by obstructionism before it even began. Now, I realize some \nwill say they scuttled this critical Defense bill in part because the \nmajority leader announced he expected to have a vote on the DREAM Act, \nwhich, by the way, would allow young, undocumented immigrants a chance \nto attend college and serve in our military. They were brought here to \nthis country through no decision they made as very young people.\n  But I have to tell you, I think it was about more than just that. In \nmy humble opinion, the issues mattered far less than the politics. \nThere has been a concerted effort to prevent or stall debate on nearly \nevery major bill this year, and, sadly, a bill dealing with our troops \nis not free from the same tactics.\n  There is no reason we should not have a debate on any issue, let \nalone a vote, and the DREAM Act is no exception. I know the Presiding \nOfficer and I joined the Senate at the same time. We heard about how \nthe Senate is the world's greatest deliberative body. If you do not \ndeliberate, what does that make us?\n  I also know that repeal of don't ask, don't tell is a contentious \nsubject, and it has also been used as an excuse to sink this very \nimportant bill. But, I have to tell you, I think this is an outdated, \ndiscriminatory policy that undermines the strength of our military and \nthe basic fairness upon which our great Nation was built. At a time \nwhen we are fighting two wars, we need every skilled servicemember we \nhave: airmen, mechanics, translators, and all the many other \nspecialties our military serve in.\n  Unlike what some on the other side of the aisle have claimed, the \nlanguage in this bill repealing don't ask, don't tell respects the \nPentagon's timeline and gives our military leaders flexibility to \nimplement repeal in a way that tracks with military standards and \nguidelines. As Admiral Mullen testified before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee--the Presiding Officer remembers what a powerful day \nthat was--he said repealing don't ask, don't tell is the ``right thing \nto do.''\n  Unfortunately, political debate and disagreement has prevented us \nfrom having this important discussion on how best to support our \ntroops, plus thwarted a serious discussion about numerous pressing \nnational security issues. I am disappointed in the partisanship, but I \nhave to tell you, I am even more disappointed in the disservice to the \nmen and women in uniform that today's inaction has caused.\n  Our American citizens, our constituents, our friends and neighbors \nface difficult decisions in their lives every day, but many here in \nWashington bristle at the notion that they face hard choices. They say \ntaking votes on certain issues will be too difficult, that the politics \nare too tough, or that they cannot stomach the thought of losing. But \nAmericans have not run away from hard decisions in the past. What about \nus? This place is a forum--or it should be a forum--where we can work \ntogether.\n  But, today, with the Senate blocking this bill, I fear our national \nsecurity and our troops will suffer. Every year for nearly a half \ncentury--I think accurately put, 49 years consecutively--Congress has \ntaken up and passed a bill that renews, in some cases reforms, and in \nother cases replaces our defense policies.\n  This Defense authorization bill, like all those that came before it--\nthe previous 49 Defense authorization bills--is critically important. \nIt provides funding for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. It supports \nour servicemembers who keep America safe by including fair pay and \nbenefits for our men and women in uniform.\n  Preventing this debate keeps us from pushing forward with this bill's \nprovisions to enhance our military's readiness, improve our \nservicemembers' training, and upgrade equipment and resources to \nsucceed in combat. We are also leaving behind provisions in the bill to \nstrengthen our nonproliferation programs and enable the reduction of \nour nuclear weapons stockpile while ensuring the stockpile has \ncontinued reliability.\n  We are foregoing the crucial opportunity--I know the Presiding \nOfficer has believed this is very important as well--to increase the \nPentagon's use of alternative energy technologies and\n\n[[Page S7260]]\n\nfuels to improve the Department's efficiency and energy security.\n  The bill also includes so many important provisions for the health \nand resiliency--both mental and physical--of our servicemembers and \ntheir families. Specifically, it includes a provision I authored \nextending health insurance for military families, enabling the children \nof Active-Duty servicemembers and retirees to stay on their parents' \nplans until the age of 26--similar to what we did in the Health Care \nReform Act for the civilian sector. Importantly, the bill provides \nimproved care for our wounded servicemembers and their families.\n  As part of a longer term effort to treat both the physical and the \nunseen mental wounds of war, I have been reviewing the Army's report on \nHealth Promotion, Risk Reduction, and Suicide Prevention, which was \npublished earlier this summer. One passage particularly struck me:\n\n       In just six years, Soldiers experience the equivalent of a \n     lifetime when compared to their civilian counterparts.\n\n  In other words, at the age of 24, the average soldier has moved \nmultiple times, been deployed around the world, married and had \nchildren, seen death, had financial and relationship problems, is \nresponsible for dozens of soldiers, and gets paid less than $40,000 a \nyear.\n  The lives of average soldiers bear no resemblance whatsoever to ours. \nTheir sacrifices are far beyond what many of us can imagine, and we \nhave demanded so much of them for so long. That is why I have continued \nto focus my efforts on how we can help our brave service men and women \nsuffering from mental wounds when they come home. Fort Carson in \nColorado has had its share of difficulties addressing the needs of our \nsoldiers, but we are seeing real progress. I am particularly proud of \nwhat Fort Carson has been doing in the way of providing behavioral \nhealth care to soldiers not just when they get back home but also while \nthey are still on the battlefield.\n\n  That is the essence of Fort Carson's Mobile Behavioral Health Teams, \nwhich embed credentialed behavioral health providers within a brigade \ncombat team, both during deployment and in garrison. Language I \nauthored in this bill encourages the Army to replicate this successful \nprogram to help facilitate early identification and treatment of \nbehavioral health problems.\n  The bad news, again, is that this provision--and so many important \nprovisions in this bill--will not be debated today. It appears election \nyear partisanship has prevailed over the responsibility and the need to \nprovide for our men and women in uniform as they fight two wars.\n  Having said that, I do remain optimistic about our future, and I am \ncommitted to working toward a new kind of politics, where we find \nconsensus amidst disagreement. I know Americans want their leaders to \ntackle challenging problems and resolve the tough issues. That is what \nAmerica does. That is what Americans do. That is what we were hired to \ndo. So in that spirit, I will continue to reach out to all my \ncolleagues who wish to find common ground and call on others to let \nthis debate move forward in the coming weeks so support for our troops \nis not held back any longer. Americans sent us here to do no less.\n  Madam President, I thank you for your attention. I thank you for your \nservice on the Armed Services Committee alongside me. With that, I note \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I just completed a visit with the Republican \nleader. There will be no more rollcall votes tonight.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, ever since an act of horrific violence on a \nbright blue morning 9 years ago, our Nation has been at war. At home \nand abroad, this war has tested our Nation, tested our military \nstrength and our diplomatic skill, tested our resilience and our \ncourage. Over the last few months, I fear our Nation has been in danger \nof failing one of these tests, a failure that would threaten our safety \nand the freedoms we hold so dear.\n  At issue is a plan to build an Islamic community center a few blocks \naway from the site of the attack on the World Trade Center and the \nlarger question of whether our Nation will embrace diversity or choose \na path of division. This is not just a question of doing the right \nthing, although it is that. It is not just a question of preserving the \nvalues that have made our Nation a beacon of freedom across the globe, \nalthough it is certainly that too. This is also a question of whether \nwe will make our Nation safer by focusing on and extinguishing the \nflames of hatred that spawned the 9/11 attacks or, on the other hand, \nadd fuel to the fire that threatens us.\n  There should be little doubt that religious intolerance has no place \nin a nation built on the idea, as Thomas Jefferson once wrote, ``that \nour civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions.'' Our \nhistory is filled with moments in which we struggle to live up to that \nnotion, in which Roman Catholics or Mormons or Jews or others found \nthemselves beset by religious intolerance and wondering if the ideals \nset forth by our Founding Fathers would hold.\n  So it is in this case. American Muslims have built homes, raised \nfamilies, and run successful businesses in communities across our \ncountry. They have been drawn here because of the belief, as one \nprominent member of Michigan's Arab-American community recently wrote, \n``that there is room in America for all cultural and religious \nbackgrounds.''\n  Well, that is the America in which they chose to build their lives. \nIt is the America we aspire to be, that we claim to be. We should ask \nourselves, if we would not object to a church or synagogue at that \nlocation in Manhattan, how can we object to a Muslim place of worship \nand remain true to our most fundamental principles?\n  Upholding the promise of our founding values should be reason enough \nto resist anti-Muslim sentiment. But there are equally powerful reasons \nthat rely not on values but on simple common sense. The war that began \non September 11, 2001, is not only a war against terrorists but a war \nto isolate those terrorists from broader Muslim society. We have seen \ntime and time again that when we stray from our values, it is not just \na moral failure but a national security failure. Our troops work every \nday to keep weapons out of the hands of al-Qaida and its terrorists. \nYet, by indulging in intolerance, we hand al-Qaida a powerful \npropaganda weapon, one to use to stoke hatred of us and to recruit the \nterrorists who threaten our troops abroad and our citizens at home. We \nhave already seen in the violent and even deadly protests in \nAfghanistan how anger can spawn anger and hatred and can inspire \nhatred.\n  By threatening to burn holy texts or by holding an entire faith as \nsomehow responsible for the actions of its most fanatic members, Osama \nbin Laden and his kind are given precisely the kind of clash of \ncivilizations they so desperately seek to create.\n  I was heartened by the words of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who said:\n\n       We would be untrue to the best part of ourselves--and who \n     we are as New Yorkers and Americans--if we said ``no'' to a \n     mosque in Lower Manhattan.\n\n  I am also encouraged by the religious leaders of many faiths across \nour country who have stood up and said:\n\n       We support the rights of all Americans to worship in their \n     chosen place, through a climate of respect, dignity and \n     peace.\n\n  I am encouraged by the words of our commander in Afghanistan, GEN \nDavid Petraeus, who powerfully pointed out that the acts of religious \nintolerance are ``precisely the kind of action the Taliban uses'' to \ndirect hatred at our brave troops.\n  I am encouraged by the words of our President:\n\n\n[[Page S7261]]\n\n\n       This is America and our commitment to religious freedom \n     must be unshakeable.\n\n  I am heartened, too, by the reaction in my home State, which is home \nto a large, thriving, and valued community of Muslim Americans. The \nGrand Rapids Press has editorialized that ``[a] Manhattan mosque would \nbe a powerful statement that the terrorists did not--and cannot--win.'' \nA columnist in the Detroit News wrote:\n\n       Ground zero would seem to be the perfect place to \n     demonstrate that religious tolerance is why so many flocked \n     to our shores in the first place, and remains a key block in \n     the foundation of our freedom.\n\n  A Detroit Free Press editorial reads:\n\n       It's not just about this being a mosque, but about the \n     religious freedom that we all hold dear, and that was such a \n     critical part of this country's founding.\n\n  Michigan civil and religious leaders of many faiths and backgrounds \nhave invoked our most closely held beliefs and called on the Nation to \nspeak and act in harmony with those beliefs. The power of those beliefs \nrepresents a powerful tool against the hatred that inspired 9/11.\n  The founding principles of our Nation call on us to stand with voices \nof tolerance and reason. Those who have given their all in the defense \nof those principles would surely hope that we would resist the calls to \nhatred and violence. Our moral authority depends on that. Preservation \nof the freedom that defines us depends on that. Our safety depends on \nthat. I commend those who have spoken for tolerance and diversity, who \nhave resisted anger and intolerance, and who in doing so have upheld \nour most important values and have made our Nation safer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 6 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         World Alzheimer's Day\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Minnesotans and \ntheir families affected by Alzheimer's disease and recognize September \n21 as World Alzheimer's Day. Today, over 94,000 Minnesotans and 5 \nmillion Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease. These are \nepidemic numbers, and the toll on our families and communities is \ndevastating. Alzheimer's is the seventh leading cause of death and \ncosts our Nation $172 billion a year.\n  But today, on World Alzheimer's Day, we have reason to be hopeful. On \nthis day, Alzheimer's is getting the attention it deserves. Take the \nfirst ever Alzheimer's Breakthrough Ride as an example. For the last 66 \ndays, Alzheimer's researchers from across the country biked hundreds of \nmiles to spread awareness about Alzheimer's. Today, these researchers \narrived in Washington to demand that the fight against Alzheimer's be \nmade a national priority.\n  I am proud to say that among the researchers on the ride is Minnesota \ndoctor Michael Walters of the University of Minnesota's Grossman Center \nfor Memory Research and Care. Dr. Walters rode from Madison, WI, to \nChicago, IL, to raise awareness about Alzheimer's. He is here in \nWashington to demand that we in Congress provide the funding needed to \nmake real progress against this disease. And we need real progress. \nAfter decades of research, there is still no effective treatment and no \nway to prevent or cure Alzheimer's. That is why my colleague from \nMaryland, Senator Mikulski, has put forth a bill to make Alzheimer's \nresearch a national priority. S. 1492, the Alzheimer's Breakthrough \nAct, would dramatically increase funding for Alzheimer's research at \nthe National Institutes of Health. Under this bill, the NIH would also \nfocus on prevention and early detection of the disease--two \nunderstudied areas that could drastically improve the health of \nmillions of Americans. That is why I am proud to have cosponsored the \nAlzheimer's Breakthrough Act.\n  The bill puts us one step closer to finding a cure and gives hope to \nfamilies affected by Alzheimer's. One such family is the Shapiros of \nEdina, MN. In 2006, Alan Shapiro was diagnosed with Alzheimer's \ndisease. Alan's father, uncle, and grandfather have all died of \nAlzheimer's, and Alan's brother Robert is currently living with the \ndisease as well. Right now, Alan is in the midstage of his disease and \nneeds round-the-clock supervision. His wife Carol spends her days \ncaring for him so they can continue to live at home together. In \naddition to caregiving, Carol also takes care of all the things Alan \nused to do, such as maintaining the house. While Carol is involved with \nlocal sport groups, she struggles just to stay afloat.\n  Like the Shapiros, many families affected by Alzheimer's will tell \nyou that their needs are not being met. It is not always clear where to \nturn for help. Sometimes a doctor can tell you about a clinical trial \nor a friend can offer to do the grocery shopping, but unfortunately it \nis never really enough. Families such as the Shapiros need help \nplanning for the future, they need help navigating complicated \ninsurance policies, and they need help finding high-quality, long-term \ncare services and respite care. Fortunately for families in need of \nthis kind of help, there is a Federal law called the Older Americans \nAct. The Older Americans Act provides seniors and families affected by \nAlzheimer's with tools to create a long-term care plan, and it can help \ncaregivers, such as Carol Shapiro, find services for their loved ones. \nFor example, in Minnesota, the Older Americans Act funds the Senior \nLinkage Line. Families can call the line and get information about \nservices for people with Alzheimer's available in their community.\n  Because of limited funding, even resources such as the Senior Linkage \nLine are not always well known or able to serve everyone who needs them \nthe most. That is why it is important to take a close look at the Older \nAmericans Act when it is up for reauthorization next year. It is \ncritical that the Older Americans Act receive robust funding so \nfamilies affected by Alzheimer's know about the resources that are \navailable to them. It is also important that we strengthen the law to \nensure that people with Alzheimer's have access to high-quality, long-\nterm care services and that States have the resources to protect people \nwith Alzheimer's who receive care at home.\n  Today, on World Alzheimer's Day, I am committed to making support for \nfamilies affected by Alzheimer's a national priority. As a member of \nthe HELP Committee and the Special Committee on Aging, I will be \nfighting for the needs of Minnesotans affected by Alzheimer's disease \nduring the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act. I will be a \nstrong supporter of Alzheimer's research so real progress can be made \nto stop this disease. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I ask that \nthey take this important day to remember the families, such as the \nShapiros, living in their home States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     In Praise of Michelle O'Neill\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise again to honor one of our Nation's \ngreat Federal employees. As my colleagues know, I have been coming to \nthe floor since last May to deliver a series of weekly speeches \nrecognizing Federal employees' contributions to this country in some \nsmall way. When I was appointed to the Senate, I saw this as an \nopportunity to draw attention to the important work performed each day \nby some of America's hardest workers. They work for all of us. They \nchoose careers in public service not because they will be paid more, \nbecause they will not, or because it is an easy job, because it \ncertainly is not; they do it for love of their country and for a sense \nof duty. They do it because there are inherently government tasks we as \na nation expect to be performed and because every one of us deserves \nthe most highly skilled and hardest working public servants to carry \nthem out.\n  I have been honoring great Federal employees from this desk for the \npast 16 months. It has been one of the highlights of my time in the \nSenate. Now I rise to honor a great Federal employee\n\n[[Page S7262]]\n\nfor the last time. I am proud to share that my honoree today is my \n100th great Federal employee, a talented individual who spent two \ndecades reducing trade barriers for American goods.\n  Michelle O'Neill has served as Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for \nInternational Trade since 2005. In this role, Michelle supervises the \nday-to-day operations of the International Trade Administration, or \nITA. The ITA has over 2,400 employees and an operating budget of over \n$400 million. Its mission is to promote American exports and ensure \nfair access to overseas markets for our businesses.\n  Michelle, who holds a bachelor's degree from Sweet Briar College in \nVirginia and a master's degree from the Lyndon B. Johnson School of \nPublic Affairs at the University of Texas, first came to the Department \nof Commerce in 1983 as an intern. Over the course of her career, she \nhas served under 5 administrations and 11 Secretaries of Commerce. She \nhas traveled to over 40 countries to carry out her work.\n  From a family with a long history of public service, Michelle knew \nvery early that she wanted to pursue a career in government. Born on a \nmilitary base, Michelle has said that ``public service is part of my \nDNA; I have always found helping others, being part of something bigger \nthan myself, to be very rewarding.'' Throughout her career at the ITA, \nshe has done just that--helping Americans trade fairly across borders \nand pursue commerce, which has always been a vehicle for achieving the \nAmerican dream. Michelle has consistently placed her work above her own \nadvancement and taken risks for the sake of carrying out the ITA's core \nmission.\n  Michelle served oversees from 1995 to 1998 as the commercial attache \nto our mission to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, OECD. Before that assignment, she worked as executive \nassistant to the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade--the \nposition Michelle now holds. In 1995, she served as a Brookings \nlegislative fellow with the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade in the \nHouse of Representatives and from 1990 to 1991 was detailed to the \nOffice of Policy Development in the White House.\n  One of her major achievements at the ITA has been resolving a major \nChina market access barrier, for which she won the Department's Silver \nMedal. She also has been praised for her role in developing an online \nportal for government export assistance, called export.gov. Michelle \nwas also awarded the William A. Jump Award for exemplary service in \npublic administration. This June, she was honored as Outstanding Woman \nof the Year by the Association of Women in International Trade.\n  Today, Michelle is part of the ITA's leadership team. The American \npeople are fortunate to have her talents and experience at work for \nthem. She joins the 99 other outstanding public servants whom I have \nhonored weekly throughout my term. Together, they are my 100 great \nFederal employees--not that these are all the great employees, but I \nthink you see a mosaic which represents all of our Federal employees.\n  I hope to come to the floor next week to speak about a special group \nof outstanding Federal employees, but this week's honoree, Michelle \nO'Neill, is the final individual whose story I will share in this \nseries. I hope my colleagues in the Senate and all Americans will join \nme in thanking her and all those who work at the International Trade \nAdministration for their service to our Nation. They are all truly \ngreat Federal employees.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on August 5, 2010, I was presented with \nthe flag of the United States Public Health Service by the Commissioned \nOfficers Association, COA, of the U.S. Public Health Service, PHS, and \nits affiliated PHS Commissioned Officers Foundation. The Public Health \nService Commissioned Corps is one of our Nation's seven uniformed \nservices. When the COA was kind enough to present me with their Health \nLeader of the Year Award several weeks ago, it was noted that, while I \nhad the flags of the five armed services displayed in my office on \nCapitol Hill, there was no PHS flag to complete the display.\n  The first thing I noticed when presented with the PHS flag was its \ncolor--a bright yellow field with dark blue crest and inscription. The \nPHS flag reveals the history of our Nation's Public Health Service. The \nPublic Health Service traces its origins to 1798 with the passage of an \n``Act for the Relief of Sick and Disabled Seamen.'' The economic \nsurvival of our young country was almost totally dependent on maritime \ncommerce and this law was aimed at protecting the health of merchant \nseaman, without whose labors the young nation would not long survive, \nmuch less prosper.\n  Medical quarantine of ships found to be carriers of disease was an \nessential tool in protecting the commercial interests of the United \nStates. The PHS flag is the same yellow color as the maritime \n``quebec'' signal flag which is the international signal for a ship \nunder quarantine.\n  Emblazoned on the yellow field of the PHS flag is a crossed \n``fouled'' anchor and caduceus. The fouled anchor--an anchor wrapped by \nits chain and thus unusable--is the symbol of a ship or sailor in \ndistress. Interestingly, the caduceus in the PHS crest is the mark of \nHermes, the Greek god of commerce--later the Roman god Mercury--and \nconsists of a staff with two entwined serpents. The caduceus, emblem of \ncommerce, is often confused with the ancient Greek Rod of Asclepius--a \nstaff entwined by a single serpent--which represents the healing arts.\n  So the crest of the Public Health Service signifies the importance of \nprotecting the Nation's commercial interests by ensuring we have a \nhealthy workforce. This is as critical to the United States today as it \nwas in 1798--and we are faced in the 21st century with perhaps more \nthreats to the health of our workforce than ever before.\n  Leadership in the protection of our Nation's public health originates \nwithin the Public Health Service whose origins can be traced to that \n1798 law passed by Congress. And leadership within the Public Health \nService is embodied by the Office of the Surgeon General and the \nofficers of the PHS Commissioned Corps. These uniformed health \nprofessionals are essential defenders of our national security which is \ndependent on a healthy population--the bedrock upon which is built our \ncommerce and our national defense.\n  We all owe these PHS Commissioned Corps officers our support for \ntheir often unheralded efforts in protecting and promoting the Nation's \nsecurity. I am proud to honor their service by displaying the PHS flag \nin my personal office on Capitol Hill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/21/senate-section/article/S7262-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7262-S7263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DEFENSE TRADE COOPERATION TREATIES\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee approved the Defense Trade Cooperation Treaties with the U.K. \nand Australia and their implementing legislation. These treaties would \nexempt these two countries--two of our most important allies--from our \narms export licensing regime.\n  Though I am confident our allies will use these treaties as intended, \nI am very concerned that these treaties may make it easier for arms \ndealers to divert weapons to illicit purposes. The Government \nAccountability Office has reported that diversion of weapons from the \nUnited States, including through the U.K. and Australia, is a major \nsource of weapons for countries of concern to the U.S., including Iran. \nIt has also documented how arms smugglers have relied on previous \nlicensing exemption regimes as a cover\n\n[[Page S7263]]\n\nfor the diversion of arms. Finally, it has reported that U.S. officials \ncharged with enforcing our arms export controls are concerned that \nlicensing exemptions reduce the evidentiary trail they use to detect \nand prosecute the diversion of weapons.\n  While this implementing legislation will enhance reporting to \nCongress, it does nothing to address the problem of not having an \nevidentiary trail. That is a mistake. I will carefully monitor the \nimplementation of these treaties to ensure that they are not used by \narms dealers as cover to divert weapons to illegal end users. If we \nhave trouble prosecuting violations of the treaties, Congress may need \nto enact additional legislation requiring licenses in certain cases.\n  In an age of terrorism, it is more important than ever that we \ncontrol the proliferation of weapons that can be diverted to \nadversaries of the United States and feed regional conflicts around the \nworld. Our licensing regime is a critical component of our effort to \nensure that these weapons do not end up in the hands of our enemies. It \nshould be strengthened, not weakened. Unfortunately, the administration \nappears to be moving in the opposite direction with a larger effort to \ndecontrol the export of sensitive military equipment.\n  In addition, I am concerned that these agreements were negotiated as \ntreaties largely as a means to avoid congressional scrutiny. The House \nForeign Affairs Committee has carefully investigated our arms export \ncontrol regime and expressed concern about early attempts to provide a \nstatutory waiver in these cases. In response to these concerns, the \nBush administration sought to do an end run around the House of \nRepresentatives by negotiating the waivers as treaties. Further, it \nsought to limit Senate oversight by arguing that no implementation \nlegislation was needed to ensure that these treaties are enforceable. I \nregret that the Obama administration took the same position.\n  I was pleased that Senator Lugar took the time to carefully draft \nimplementing legislation that will ensure some bicameral oversight of \nthese treaties. However, while this addresses some of my concerns, it \nleaves many questions unanswered. This approach should not become the \nnorm. I urge the administration to rely on the regular legislative \nprocess to address any future, perceived deficiencies in our arms \nexport regime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/21/senate-section/article/S7263-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     RECOGNIZING DOLLE'S CANDYLAND\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I would like to pay special \ntribute to the Dolle family on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of \nDolle's Candyland of Ocean City, MD. For the past century, Dolle's has \nbeen one of the jewels of Ocean City's famous boardwalk, helping \nthousands of vacationing families build warm summer memories and \nproviding treats for lucky relatives and co-workers back home.\n  For its entire history, this Eastern Shore landmark has been presided \nover by men named Rudolph Dolle. The first of the line, the grandfather \nof the current proprietor, left his home in New York in 1910 to install \nan old-fashioned hand-made carousel on what was then the small Ocean \nCity boardwalk at the corner of Wicomico Street. Soon after the Dolles \nbuilt their carousel, the man who sold saltwater taffy next door fell \nupon hard times and offered to sell his business to Rudolph and his \nwife Amelia. Sales of salt water taffy quickly became the family's main \nlivelihood and were followed by homemade fudge and caramel popcorn.\n  The original merry-go-round burned to the ground in 1925 but the \ncandy business continued to flourish. In 1910, shop hands cooked the \nsaltwater taffy in small copper kettles before it was cut and wrapped \npiece by piece by the store's employees. Today, the copper kettles can \ncook 150 pounds of taffy at once, and the pulling, cutting, and \nwrapping is now performed by machines that can produce 650 pieces of \ntaffy every minute, allowing Dolle's to sell an average of almost 3,000 \npounds of taffy per day during the busy summer season.\n  The flagship store has been enlarged but remains on the original site \nat Wicomico Street and the boardwalk. A second store further north in \nOcean City is now open, and Dolle's now offers other homemade candy \ntreats, including caramels, gummy bears, and seasonal chocolates for \nthe holidays.\n  Four generations of the Dolle family have worked behind the counter \nand in the kitchen. They take great pride in their customer service and \ncivic engagement and provide free shipping to all orders sent to \nmilitary addresses.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me today in honoring the Dolle family on \nthe occasion of the 100th anniversary of the founding of Dolle's \nCandyland, and in sending along best wishes for many more generations \nof the Dolle family who will continue the family business and tradition \non the boardwalk in Ocean City, MD.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/21/senate-section/article/S7263-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              REMEMBERING \n                          DOUG M.

Through hard work and ingenuity, Doug and Heber grew \nthe trucking company expanding business throughout the United States \nand western Canada, established Dad's Travel Center truck stops and \nhave the Andco Leasing real estate development company. Doug has been \nrecognized for his principled business practices, receiving the Granite \nPillar Award in 2009 for business ethics.\n  Doug was also widely respected for his active involvement in the \ncommunity and church. He was a great humanitarian whose giving included \ncontributions to the Hurricane Katrina relief effort and local food \nbanks, and he dedicated substantial time and resources to the Boy \nScouts of America, through which he earned the one of the highest \nrecognitions given--Silver Beaver Award.

We worked \nclosely together when he served with me in the stake presidency of the \nEagle Rock Stake.\n  Through all that he did, Doug was a good, humble, gregarious, \ngracious, faithful, committed, reliable man of integrity. He was very \nkind and giving and served as a great model of how best to carry \noneself and treat others. His family and friends loved and trusted him \nimmensely, and he provided sound counsel to many throughout the \ncommunity. I will deeply miss my good friend, Doug Andrus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/21/senate-section/article/S7263-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7263-S7265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   2010 GOVERNOR'S AWARDS IN THE ARTS\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

ALBERT STARR\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this week marks the 50th anniversary \nof one of the most remarkable innovations in modern medicine. On \nSeptember 21, 1960, at the University of Oregon Medical School, Dr. \nAlbert Starr successfully implanted the first prosthetic mechanical \nheart valve. In 1958, Lowell Edwards, a retired mechanical engineer, \napproached Dr. Starr about the possibility of creating an artificial \nheart. Believing artificial heart technology to be a bit premature, \nStarr encouraged Edwards to consider valve replacement surgery. The \nvalve they designed--a ball and cage mechanical valve--was successfully \nimplanted in its first patient just 2 years later. For this \nachievement, Dr. Starr was the co-recipient of the Albert Lasker Award, \nfor Clinical Medical Research in 2007.\n  Dr. Starr continues to contribute to the development of medical \nscience as the director emeritus of Providence Heart and Vascular \nInstitute, medical director of the Albert Starr Academic Center, and \ndirector of bioscience research and development for Providence Health & \nServices in Oregon.\n  Since the valve's first use in 1960, heart valve replacement surgery \nhas saved millions of lives, giving hope to those with heart disease. \nToday, life saving heart valve replacement surgery is performed 300,000 \ntimes each year around the globe, with more than 90,000 of those \noperations taking place in the U.S.\n  Dr. Starr says he considers his legacy to be about the people he has \ntrained and his patients. For him, the human interaction has been the \nmost important aspect of his lifetime of achievements. I am grateful \nfor his passion to help people and to help advance medical science.\n  It is an honor for me to recognize Dr. Albert Starr for his \ncontributions to medical innovation and I am proud to have him call \nOregon his home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/21/senate-section/article/S7265-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 3813.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \nhonoring Walter Breuning, the oldest living man in the world. Walter is \ncelebrating his 114th birthday today.\n  He was born in Melrose, MN on September 21, 1896, and moved to Great \nFalls, MT, in 1918 while working for the Great Northern Railway. Walter \nis still a proud resident of Great Falls and delights fellow residents, \nstaff, and visitors at The Rainbow Senior Living home.\n  Despite all the honor and attention bestowed upon him for being the \noldest living man in the world, Walter is very humble. He has worked \nhard all his life and advises others to do the same. When I called him \nlast year to wish him a happy birthday, that is exactly what he said to \nme. Walter began working for the Great Northern Railway at the age of \n16 and gave 50 years of service to the railway. When he retired in \n1963, Walter didn't stop working; he began a second career, one that \nwould last until he was 99, as the manager and secretary of the Great \nFalls Shriner's Club.\n  Community service has been a big part of Walter's life and when he \nvisits with young people he always encourages them to give back to \ntheir communities. Walter is a 33rd degree Mason, the most advanced \nlevel for that fraternal organization.\n  Walter has practiced healthy habits all his life, and those have \ncontributed greatly to his longevity. He has eaten only two meals a day \nfor the past 30 years and says he is most grateful for his good health \nover the years. These healthy habits have helped Walter live life to \nthe fullest. He enjoys visiting with the many folks that come from all \nover to hear the insights of the oldest living man in the world.\n  I am proud to join today with folks from around Montana and across \nthe world in wishing Walter a very happy birthday. He is a great \nambassador for our State and I thank him for all his community \ninvolvement and service over the years. He truly represents the best of \nBig Sky Country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, 114 years old, your constituent? I guess \nSenator Baucus treats his constituents well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/21/senate-section/article/S7281-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 637--COMMENDING THE SEATTLE STORM FOR WINNING THE \n       2010 WOMEN'S NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mrs. Murray) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 567, S. 3717.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3717) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of \n     1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment \n     Advisers Act of 1940 to provide for certain disclosures under \n     section 552 of title 5, United States Code, (commonly \n     referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the Senate for promptly taking up \nthe Freedom of Information Act amendments to the Securities Exchange \nAct, Investment Company Act and Investment Advisers Act of 2010, S. \n3717--an important, bipartisan bill to ensure that the Freedom of \nInformation Act FOIA remains an effective tool to provide public access \nto information about the stability of our financial markets. This bill \neliminates several broad FOIA exemptions for Security and Exchange \nCommission--SEC--records that were recently enacted as part of the \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The bill \nwill also help ensure that the SEC has access to the information that \nthe Commission needs to carry out its new enforcement activities under \nthe new reforms.\n  I thank Senators Grassley, Cornyn, and Kaufman for cosponsoring this \nimportant open government bill, and for working with me to promptly \naddress this issue. I commend the many open government organizations, \nincluding OpenTheGovernment.org, the Project on Government Oversight, \nthe American Library Association and the Sunlight Foundation for their \nsupport of this bill. I also thank the distinguished chairman of the \nHouse Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Representative \nEdolphus Towns, for introducing a companion bill, H.R. 6086, in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I supported the historic Wall Street reform law, because that law \ntakes significant strides toward enhancing transparency and \naccountability in our financial system. But, I am concerned that the \nFOIA exemptions in section 9291 of that law, which was originally \ndrafted in the House of Representatives and included in the final \nlegislation, could be interpreted and implemented in a way that \nundermines this very important goal.\n  The Freedom of Information Act has long recognized the need to \nbalance the government's legitimate interest in protecting confidential \nbusiness records, trade secrets and other sensitive information from \npublic disclosure, and preserving the public's right to know. To \naccomplish this, care must always be taken to ensure that exemptions to \nFOIA's disclosure requirements are narrowly and properly applied.\n  When Congress enacted the FOIA exemptions in section 929I, we sought \nto ensure that the SEC had access to the information that the \nCommission needed to protect American investors--not to shield \ninformation from the public. I\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\nam also troubled by attempts in recent weeks to retroactively apply \nthese exemptions to pending FOIA matters.\n  I am also troubled by the sweeping interpretation that the Commission \nhas expressed, to date, that these exemptions would shield from public \nscrutiny all information provided to the Commission in connection with \nits broad examination and surveillance activities.\n  To truly restore stability and accountability to our financial \nsystem, Congress should take immediate steps to clarify this matter and \neliminate overly broad FOIA exemptions. Not surprisingly, there is \ngrowing concern about these exemptions from across the ideological and \npolitical spectrum.\n  I have said many times that open government is neither a Democratic \nissue, nor a Republican issue--it is truly an American value and virtue \nthat we all must uphold. It is in this bipartisan spirit that Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle have joined together to pass this bill. I \nurge the House of Representatives to enact this good government bill \nwithout delay.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements related \nto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 3717) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3717\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 632\n\n       Whereas the United Service Organizations (referred to in \n     this preamble as the ``USO'') has worked to serve members of \n     the Armed Forces and their families for nearly 70 years;\n       Whereas the USO provides morale and support services to \n     military families in more than 130 locations across the \n     world;\n       Whereas the USO continues to support veterans of the Iraq \n     and Afghanistan Wars;\n       Whereas the USO provides comfort to members of the Armed \n     Forces by sending care packages to bases overseas; and\n       Whereas the USO and their volunteers have sent 2,000,000 \n     care packages to our troops: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the work of the United Service Organizations \n     in supporting the members of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States around the world; and\n       (2) congratulates the United Service Organizations on \n     sending their 2 millionth troop care package.\n\n                              S. Res. 633\n\n       Whereas older adults, 65 years of age and older, are the \n     fastest-growing segment of the population in the United \n     States, and the number of older adults in the United States \n     will increase from 35,000,000 in 2000 to 72,100,000 million \n     in 2030;\n       Whereas 1 out of 3 older adults in the United States falls \n     each year;\n       Whereas falls are the leading cause of injury, death, and \n     hospital admissions for traumatic injuries among older \n     adults;\n       Whereas, in 2008, approximately 2,100,000 older adults were \n     treated in hospital emergency departments for fall-related \n     injuries, and more than 500,000 were subsequently \n     hospitalized;\n       Whereas, in 2007, over 18,400 older adults died from \n     injuries related to unintentional falls;\n       Whereas the total cost of fall-related injuries for older \n     adults is $80,900,000,000, including more than \n     $19,000,000,000 in direct medical costs;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimate that if the rate of increase in falls is not slowed \n     the annual cost under, the Medicare program will reach \n     $32,400,000,000 by 2020;\n       Whereas evidence-based programs show promise in reducing \n     falls and facilitating cost-effective interventions, such as \n     comprehensive clinical assessments, exercise programs to \n     improve balance and health, management of medications, \n     correction of vision, and reduction of home hazards;\n       Whereas research indicates that fall prevention programs \n     for high-risk older adults have a net-cost savings of almost \n     $9 in benefits to society for each $1 invested;\n       Whereas the Falls Free Coalition Advocacy Work Group and \n     its numerous national and State supporting organizations \n     should be commended for their efforts to raise awareness and \n     to promote greater understanding, research, and programs to \n     prevent falls among older adults: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 23, 2010, as ``National Falls \n     Prevention Awareness Day'';\n       (2) commends the Falls Free Coalition Advocacy Work Group \n     and the 31 State falls coalitions for their efforts to work \n     together to increase education and awareness about the \n     prevention of falls among older adults;\n       (3) encourages businesses, individuals, Federal, State, and \n     local governments, the public health community, and health \n     care providers to work together to promote the awareness of \n     falls in an effort to reduce the incidence of falls among \n     older adults in the United States;\n       (4) urges the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to \n     continue developing and evaluating strategies to prevent \n     falls among older adults that will translate into effective \n     fall prevention interventions, including community-based \n     programs;\n       (5) encourages State health departments, which provide \n     significant leadership in reducing injuries and injury-\n     related health care costs by collaborating with colleagues \n     and a variety of organizations and individuals, to reduce \n     falls among older adults; and\n       (6) recognizes proven, cost-effective falls prevention \n     programs and policies and encourages experts in the field to \n     share their best practices so that their success can be \n     replicated by others.\n\n                              S. Res. 634\n\n       Whereas, in 1910, the citizens of Saint Louis, Missouri, \n     inspired by the Smithsonian's Flight Cage, a large walk-\n     through bird cage constructed in Saint Louis for the 1904 \n     World's Fair and purchased by the city of Saint Louis at the \n     conclusion of the fair, formed the Saint Louis Zoological \n     Society and encouraged the city of Saint Louis to set aside \n     77 acres in historic Forest Park for the establishment of a \n     zoological park;\n       Whereas, guided by legislation providing that ``the zoo \n     shall be forever free'' and supported by the extraordinary \n     generosity of the people of Saint Louis, the Saint Louis Zoo \n     is, and his been since its inception, accessible for all, \n     enriching the lives of millions of people, including a record \n     3,101,830 visitors in 2009;\n       Whereas, through the exceptional work of dedicated staff, \n     state-of-the-art facilities including the Endangered Species \n     Research Center and Veterinary Hospital, and initiatives such \n     as the WildCare Institute, the Saint Louis Zoo has \n     established itself as a world leader in the conservation of \n     endangered species and their habitats;\n       Whereas, through classroom presentations, Zoo tours, \n     outreach programs, and educational resources such as the \n     Library and Teacher Resource Center, the Saint Louis Zoo has \n     provided invaluable educational opportunities to the members \n     of the public, including tens of thousands of school children \n     from the Saint Louis area for generations; and\n       Whereas the 2010 centennial anniversary of the founding of \n     the Saint Louis Zoo is an achievement of historic proportions \n     for the City of Saint Louis, the State of Missouri, the \n     United States, and the world conservation community: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate commemorates the 100th \n     anniversary of the founding of the Saint Louis Zoo on \n     September 24, 2010.\n\n                              S. Res. 635\n\n       Whereas Hispanic-serving institutions play an important \n     role in educating many underprivileged students and helping \n     those students attain their full potential through higher \n     education;\n       Whereas Hispanic-serving institutions are degree-granting \n     institutions that have a full-time equivalent undergraduate \n     enrollment of at least 25 percent Hispanic students;\n       Whereas, as of the date of approval of this resolution, \n     there are approximately 268 Hispanic-serving institutions in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas Hispanic-serving institutions are actively involved \n     in stabilizing and improving the communities in which the \n     Hispanic-serving institutions are located;\n       Whereas more than 48 percent of Hispanic students in the \n     United States attend Hispanic-serving institutions;\n       Whereas celebrating the vast contributions of Hispanic-\n     serving institutions to the United States strengthens the \n     culture of the United States;\n       Whereas the achievements and goals of Hispanic-serving \n     institutions are deserving of national recognition; and\n       Whereas the week beginning September 19, 2010, would be an \n     appropriate week for national recognition of Hispanic-serving \n     institutions: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the achievements and goals of Hispanic-\n     serving institutions across the United States;\n       (2) designates the week beginning September 19, 2010, as \n     ``National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week''; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     activities, and programs to demonstrate support for Hispanic-\n     serving institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "21", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/21/senate-section/article/S7300-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 3813 and S. 3815\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.
