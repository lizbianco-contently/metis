Mr. President, it was a great honor to have Father Gregoire \nFluet, my parish priest in East Haddam, CT, provide the opening prayer \nthis morning. I thank him immensely for his words. Reaching back to \nArchbishop Carroll was a wonderful way to begin the session.\n  Father Fluet is not only my parish priest, Mr. President. He is a \ndear friend and practically a member of my extended family. Father \nFluet and I first met nearly 30 years ago when he was pastor of St. \nJoseph's Church in North Grosvenordale, CT. Since his appointment in \n1998 as pastor of my home parish, Saint Bridget of Kildare in East \nHaddam, Father Fluet has been an important figure in my life, providing \nspiritual advice and counsel to me on a number of occasions. Father \nFluet has also played an important role in the lives of my two \ndaughters, Grace and Christina. He baptized both of them after they \nwere born, and provided religious instruction and first communion to my \nolder daughter, Grace.\n  In addition to being a great spiritual leader, Father Fluet has long \ndedicated himself to the study of our Nation's history and particularly \nto the history of New England. Ever the consummate scholar, Father \nFluet was awarded a doctorate in American History by Clark University \nin 2002, taught Western Civilization and World History as an adjunct \nprofessor at Quinebaug Valley Community College in Danielson, CT, and \neven published a history of the Diocese of Norwich.\n  But beyond his love of history, Father Fluet has always, first and \nforemost, demonstrated an unshakeable commitment to his flock and the \npeople of our community. He is a wonderful human being, and I am \nconfident that Saint Bridget of Kildare will continue to be blessed for \nyears to come by Father Fluet's dedicated spiritual leadership.\n  Once again, I would like to reiterate what a true honor it has been \nto listen to Father Fluet's words this morning. Thank you for taking \nthe time to be here today, Father Fluet. But most of all, thank you for \neverything you have done over the years for the people of our \ncommunity.\n\n[[Page S8258]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8258-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, congressional leaders of both parties \nwill meet with the President at the White House today to talk about the \nwork we have to do before the end of the year and, hopefully, about the \nthings we can do together to foster the right conditions for businesses \nto start investing again and creating jobs.\n  Americans are watching the economic drama that is playing out in \nEurope. They expect us to read the signs of the times and work together \nto make sure that we avoid a similar crisis here, that we don't walk \nright into the same problems through a lack of will or political \ncourage.\n  The American people expect us to put the national interest ahead of \nparty interest. And, frankly, that is why it has been so distressing \nfor many of us to watch our Democrat friends grope for a clear and \nunified position on whether or not to raise taxes in the middle of a \nrecession.\n  One would think that this issue would be simple and straightforward.\n  Economists say that preventing a tax increase is one of the most \nimportant things Congress can do to help the economy. And the voters \nratified that view earlier this month by sending candidates from both \nparties to Washington who vowed not to raise taxes once they got here.\n  But our Democrat friends are apparently still reluctant to draw any \nclear lessons from the election. With millions of American households \nstaring at the imminent prospect of smaller paychecks in just a few \nshort weeks unless Congress does something, Democrats are still \nsearching for a solution that enables them to benefit politically--\nregardless of what it does to the economy or to families.\n  Just take the latest proposal.\n  Some Democrats now say they only want to raise taxes on businesses \nthat make more than $1 million a year. Where did that number come from? \nWell, it turns out this figure has no economic justification \nwhatsoever. Nowhere will we find a study or survey which indicates that \nraising taxes on small businesses with over $1 million in income will \ncreate jobs or help spur the economy.\n  In fact, the author of this proposal freely admits it isn't an \neconomic policy proposal at all, but rather one that was designed to \nprovide better political messaging--an astonishing admission.\n  Let us get something straight. Millions of out-of-work Americans \ndon't want a message. They want a job. Millions of struggling families \ntrying to make ends meet don't need the Democrat messaging to improve; \nthey need the economy to improve.\n  Selling bad economic policy to the American people is not an \nacceptable alternative to creating an environment that will put people \nback to work and help spur the economy.\n  We have heard a lot of chatter here in Washington lately about the \nnegotiations that are expected to take place on this looming tax hike \nin the weeks ahead--on how to prevent it. How about we start with this: \nthe beginning and end of any negotiation shouldn't be what is good for \nany political party. It should be what is good for the economy and for \nthe American people. An if we leave the politics aside, if we look at \nthe facts, the answer here is simple: no tax hikes on anybody--period.\n  So the question isn't what is best for the economy and jobs--the \nanswer to that is obvious. The question is when will our friends on the \nother side get serious about either one.\n  It has been reported that the author of the $1 million proposal ran \nit through a focus group to see how it polled. This is precisely the \nkind of thing Americans are telling us to put aside. The election was a \nmonth ago. It is time to move on. It is time to work together on the \npriorities Americans want us to address.\n  Republicans have heard the voters loud and clear. They want us to \nfocus on preventing a tax hike on every taxpayer, on reining in \nWashington spending and on making it easier for employers to start \nhiring again. That is why Republican leaders are reiterating our offer \nto work with anyone, from either party, who is ready to focus on \npriorities like these.\n  The day after the election, the President acknowledged that ``the \noverwhelming message'' of the voters ``[was] that . . . we want you to \nfocus completely on jobs and the economy.''\n  That is the same message Republicans will bring to the White House \ntoday.\n  And that is why there is no reason we shouldn't be able to reach an \nagreement on taxes soon.\n  It is unclear how long our friends across the aisle will continue to \nresist the message of the election and cling to the liberal wish list \nthat got us a job-killing healthcare law, a ``cap-and-trade'' national \nenergy tax, an out-of-control spending spree, million more jobs lost, \ntrillions more in debt, but not a single appropriations bill to fund \nthe government or a bill to prevent the coming tax hikes.\n  With just a few weeks left before the end of the year, they are still \nclinging to the wrong priorities--instead of preventing a tax hike, \nthey want to focus on immigration and don't ask, don't tell--and, \nmaybe, if there is time left, see what they can do about jobs and the \neconomy.\n  Indeed, their entire legislative plan for the rest of the lame duck \nsession appears to be to focus on anything except jobs, which is \nastonishing when we consider the election we have just had.\n\n[[Page S8259]]\n\n  Republicans aren't looking for a fight. We are appealing to common \nsense and a shared sense of responsibility for the millions of \nAmericans who are looking to us to work together not on the priorities \nof the left, but on their priorities. And those priorities are clear.\n  Together, we must focus on the things Americans want us to do--not on \nwhat government wants Americans to accept. There is still time to do \nthe right thing. The voters want us to show that we heard them, and \nRepublicans are ready to work with anyone who is willing to do just \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8259-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Motions to Suspend\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to vote today against the \nCoburn effort to change our rules relative to earmark legislation.\n  I wish to tell you, as a member of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, we have put in place what I consider to be the most dramatic \nreform of this appropriations process since I have served in Congress. \nThere is full disclosure, in my office, of every single request for an \nappropriation. We then ask those who have made the request for the \nappropriation to have a full disclaimer of their involvement in the \nappropriation so it is there for the public record.\n  This kind of transparency is virtually unprecedented, and I think it \nis an effort to overcome some of the embarrassing episodes which \noccurred primarily in the House of Representatives under the other \nparty's leadership, where people literally went to jail because of \nabuse of the earmark process.\n  I believe I have an important responsibility to the State of Illinois \nand the people I represent to direct Federal dollars into projects \ncritically important for our State and its future. What the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma is setting out to do is to eliminate that option.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing the Coburn \nmotion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Coburn has proposed an amendment to \nthe badly needed food safety legislation now before the Senate that \nseeks to end congressionally directed spending, or earmarks. Senator \nCoburn described his amendment as an attempt to get spending under \ncontrol, but it fails the test of accomplishing that goal and fails to \nmeet Congress's constitutional obligation to exercise the power of the \npurse.\n  Article I, section 9 of the Constitution of the United States places \nthe power of Federal spending in the Congress, the branch of government \nmost directly connected to the people. The power of the purse is great, \nand therefore accountability for the exercise of that power should be \ngreat as well.\n  Our greater responsiveness in Congress to immediate public needs is \nessential. If the Coburn amendment passes, we would be barred from \nbringing that judgment to bear on some of the most pressing issues of \nthe day. Instead, the executive branch--which is, in practice, the most \nbureaucratic and least responsive branch--would control these \ndecisions. For example, under Senator Coburn's proposal, only the \nexecutive branch would have the power to initiate funding for disaster \nrelief. Measures to appropriate funds in response to disasters would be \nprohibited because they would dedicate funding to specific locations. \nSo, had this measure been in place when Hurricane Katrina struck the \nGulf Coast, Congress would have been powerless to react. Similarly, had \nthis restriction been in place when a Mississippi River bridge \ncollapsed in Minnesota in 2007, Congress could not have appropriated \nthe $195 million it set aside for repair and reconstruction.\n  This measure also would prevent Members from addressing the urgent \nneeds of our communities. I and other Members from Great Lakes States \nhave urged the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies to address \nthe growing threat that Asian carp will make their way from the \nMississippi River watershed into the Great Lakes. These invasive \nspecies of fish would devastate the lakes, doing enormous harm to our \nStates' economies. So long as the Army Corps continues to underfund \nthis important work, only the action of Congress can prevent an \neconomic disaster.\n  I would argue that each of these expenditures is important and \nnecessary. But the wisdom or folly of these decisions lies in the \nmerits of the projects themselves, not in the manner by which they were \nfunded. Allowing the Congress to make these decisions allows the voters \nto judge them on their own merits, to reward their representatives when \nthey make wise choices, and to render judgment in the voting booth when \nthey do not.\n  Senator Coburn is rightly concerned about the long-term fiscal \ncondition of the government. But it has been repeatedly pointed out, \ndespite the fiction surrounding this issue, that this amendment would \ndo nothing to improve our fiscal situation. Year after year, Congress \nworks within the top line of budgets submitted by the President, \nreadjusting priorities without increasing total spending. For this \nreason, the Coburn amendment would not reduce spending levels; it would \nsimply shift greater authority for deciding how money is spent from the \nlegislative branch to the executive.\n  There are two ways to close our fiscal gap. We can reduce spending or \nwe can increase revenue. Banning congressionally directed spending does \nneither. It would create the impression that we have taken a step \ntoward fiscal responsibility, without making any of the difficult \nchoices that reducing the deficit will require. I applaud Senator \nCoburn's desire to address our debt. But this measure fails to do so \nand in the process abdicates our constitutional responsibilities. So I \nwill oppose this amendment and urge our colleagues to do the same.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nCoburn-McCaskill amendment, which would impose a 3-year moratorium on \nearmarks.\n  This amendment is a direct attack on the authority vested in the \nCongress to determine how Federal funds are spent, despite the fact \nthat this power is clearly established in Article I of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  I, for one, take great exception to this attack. It would set a \ndangerous precedent, in my view, to simply turn over a blank check to \nthe executive branch and undermine the power that the Constitution \ngrants Congress. What if an administration is not focused on the needs \nof a particular State, perhaps because that State didn't vote for that \nPresident?\n  For years I have fought for funding of flood control in Sacramento. \nSacramento is one of the most endangered cities in the country when it \ncomes to catastrophic risk of flooding. Neither Democratic nor \nRepublican administrations have requested sufficient funding for the \nflood control improvements that will protect lives and property in that \ncommunity.\n\n[[Page S8260]]\n\n  As the Senator elected to represent the people behind those levees, \nshouldn't I be able to fight for the funding, whether or not the \nPresident agrees? I was elected by the people of California to \nrepresent the needs of California. And the people of Sacramento \ncertainly believe they need flood control. This is my duty as a \nSenator. Isn't that why we have a Congress?\n  As a coequal branch of government, we shouldn't be forced to approach \nthe administration with our hat in hand every time we believe something \nneeds to be done.\n  Another flaw in this amendment is the well-trod idea that it will \nsave this country money. Simply put, that is incorrect.\n  Discretionary spending is a popular target to attack. But the truth \nis that earmarks make up less than one-half of a percentage point of \nall Federal spending.\n  Earmarks are not the problem, so banning earmarks is not the \nsolution.\n  The real problem is entitlement spending. But tackling entitlement \nreform is neither easy nor popular. So, instead, we attack earmarks. It \nsounds good, and it gets applause. But we all know that it doesn't \nsolve the problem.\n  This amendment won't save this country one penny. It will merely \nshift the power of the purse from Congress to the White House and \nexecutive agencies.\n  If you want to reduce discretionary spending, it must be done through \nthe budget process.\n  I am also concerned about the process the Coburn-McCaskill amendment \nsets forth for waiving this new rule.\n  Rather than putting into effect a traditional budgetary point of \norder, which requires a three-fifths vote to waive, this amendment \ncalls for a two-thirds vote.\n  This means that if this amendment is approved, funding a public works \nproject would require the same number of votes as constitutional \namendments, impeachments, treaties, or the expulsion of Senators.\n  Why should the question of an earmark rise above the three-fifths \nrequirement to invoke cloture on the very bill containing the earmark?\n  Finally, this amendment disregards the significant reforms that have \nalready taken place to make the process transparent.\n  Since Democrats regained control of the Senate, the following reforms \nhave been enacted: Members must publicly certify that they have no \nprivate interest in earmarks they request. Members must post their \nearmark requests on the internet. Every bill with earmarks includes a \ntable listing the Senators who made the requests. This is the most \ntransparent earmark process ever, and I believe the reforms have \nworked.\n  The earmark process has been abused in the past, but I firmly believe \nthat eliminating the discretion of Congress to appropriate taxpayer \ndollars is folly. A knee-jerk reaction that tips the balance of power \ntoward the executive branch is not the solution.\n  Let me say this: I am open to further reform if it will make the \nprocess even more transparent.\n  The House of Representatives already bans earmarks to most private \nfirms, and I would support doing so in the Senate.\n  I believe the best use of earmarks is to provide funding for projects \nthat are essential to the public good, such as water infrastructure \nimprovements in a city such as East Palo Alto that cannot provide clean \nwater to its residents without a funding share from the Federal \nGovernment, or interoperable communications equipment in Contra Costa \nand Alameda Counties, which can be used when an earthquake or other \ncatastrophe strikes.\n  I believe this amendment is wrong for the Senate, it is wrong for our \nStates, and it is wrong for the people we come here to serve.\n  Handing over a fundamental responsibility to the executive branch, at \na savings of zero dollars to the taxpayer, is not the solution. \nContinued reform of a process that is important to so many of our \ncommunities is the better alternative.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak against the Coburn \namendment that would impose a 3-year moratorium on Congress' \nconstitutional responsibility to direct the spending of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The amendment in question propounds a problem that doesn't exist, a \nsolution that resolves nothing, and an argument that is factually \nbaseless.\n  This amendment will not lead to deficit reduction. In fiscal year \n2010, congressionally directed initiatives make up less than one-half \nof 1 percent of total Federal spending.\n  With total spending at $3.5 trillion it is irresponsible to tell the \nAmerican people that congressionally directed spending of one-half of 1 \npercent of this total amount is the cause of our country's deficit \nproblem.\n  Mathematically it is incorrect and mechanically it is incorrect. \nDoing away with congressionally directed initiatives does not guarantee \ndeficit reduction--it guarantees members of the administration will \nmake all the funding decisions.\n  Inherent in the arguments of the amendment's supporters is the \ncontention that projects and activities selected by the administration \nare superior. The argument seems to rely on the notion that there is \nsome objective formula used by the administration to select the best \nand most worthy projects to fund. This is false.\n  The fact is even in programs where some formula may be used, such as \na cost-benefit ratio formula, the formula is not necessarily perfect \nand can often fail to capture all the facts.\n  A small port dredging project may not look worthwhile when just the \ncommercial traffic is calculated. However, when the sport fishery \nimpact is included it makes the calculation different. Further, if the \nfish processing plant reliant on the commercial fishery is the largest \nemployer in the county that makes a difference.\n  While the formula may not capture these facts and thus the project \nfails to make the President's budget request, the areas congressional \nmembers and senators will know the facts and seek to modify the budget.\n  There was a recent news article using a Missouri project as an \nillustration of this debate. The project was not requested in the \nbudget and the senior Senator from Missouri rectified this fact by \nadding an earmark.\n  The junior Senator from Missouri is quoted in this article saying the \nproject would have been funded without such an earmark if funding had \nnot been diverted to less worthwhile earmarks. I am sorry, but there is \nno basis for the junior Senator's claim.\n  We have no idea what the administration will send up in the budget. A \nvery worthwhile project may come forward and it may not. And the \nreverse may be true. The administration may send up a project that is \nnot currently justified.\n  During the George W. Bush administration the budget request one year \nincluded construction funding for a Corps of Engineers project. The \nproblem was the chief engineer's report was not completed yet because \nthe studies were still on-going. Thus there was no way for the \nadministration to know based upon any objective criteria whether the \nproject should move into the construction phase.\n  While the project may have proved to be worthy there was no objective \nbasis for the administration making that assessment at that time. The \nfact is the administration added the project out of some political \ncalculation, not an objective calculation.\n  Let me provide some facts on earmarks using the civil side of the \nCorps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation which have two of the \nmost highly earmarked budgets of any Federal agency due to the way \nprojects are authorized and appropriated.\n  For fiscal year 2010, the President proposed spending $6.2 billion \nfor these two agencies. In his request the President proposed 1,184 \nindividual line items valued at $4.8 billion based on criteria of his \nchoosing. This criteria is not based in law nor was the criteria \ncoordinated with anyone outside of the administration.\n  The criteria was developed to ``get the biggest bang for the buck'' \nbut how do we know that? Just because that is what the administration \nsays.\n  Upon my review of the budget request, I was convinced that the \nadministration had left many priorities unfunded. That is why in \npreparing the fiscal year 2010 Energy and Water appropriations bill, \nthe subcommittee of\n\n[[Page S8261]]\n\nwhich I am the chair, we used the criteria established in law to \ndetermine what projects were eligible for funding.\n  Further, we gave particular credence to funding ongoing work. It is \nnot prudent to fund a construction project in one year and not fund it \nin the next. Yet the administration did not propose funding for more \nthan 175 ongoing construction projects that were funded in fiscal year \n2009.\n  These termination costs were not accounted for in the budgets that \nthe agencies provided to Congress. The Corps or the Bureau of \nReclamation cannot walk away from a construction site because they are \nnot funded for that project. They would have to reprogram funds from \nother projects to make the site safe for the public until it was funded \nagain.\n  Funding projects in this manner delays completion of the projects, \nincreases the costs and defers the benefits that these projects provide \nto the national economy.\n  For fiscal year 2010, Congress provided $6.58 billion for the COE and \nthe Bureau of Reclamation. Congress directed $817 million of this total \nfunding. All of this directed funding was disclosed in the required \ndisclosure tables in the report that accompanied the bill.\n  Let me list just a few projects that would not be funded in fiscal \nyear 2011 if we enacted the President's budget request as proposed:\n  Blue River Basin flood control project in Missouri; Swope Park \nIndustrial Area flood control project in Kansas City, MO; the Puget \nSound and Adjacent Waters Environmental Restoration project in \nWashington; the Charleston Harbor, SC, navigation deepening study; the \nVirginia Beach, VA, hurricane protection project; and the Western Sarpy \nand Clear Creek, NE, flood control project.\n  For that last project in Nebraska, the funds proposed in the fiscal \nyear 2011 Senate report would complete the project, yet it did not make \nit into the President's budget. Imagine these objective criteria that \nthe administration uses would leave the completion of a fully \nauthorized and economically justified construction budget for another \nyear.\n  I must also mention the issue of transparency. Today all Member \nrequests are available on line for public review. All Members must \ncertify that they and their family have no pecuniary interest in these \nprojects.\n  If there are legitimate proposals on further improving transparency \nthen I am sure they will be given consideration, but as of today the \npublic knows who is backing the projects we fund. There is \naccountability and there is sunlight.\n  I fear that if Congress cedes its authority to direct spending then \nwe will go back to a time when Members, staff, and entities outside of \nthe Federal Government will begin to pressure the administration and \nbureaucracy on getting specific projects funded.\n  There will be no disclosure of these phone calls and meetings. We \nwill not know if any trades have been made in exchange for project \nsupport.\n  Why would we give up sunlight and accountability for darkness and \nunaccountability?\n  Let me close by reiterating the basic points.\n  First, this amendment will not reduce the deficit. At less than one-\nhalf of 1 percent of total spending congressionally directed spending \nis simply not going to make a difference, particularly when that \nfunding will be left for the administration to direct its allocation.\n  Second, there is no objective formula that makes sure funding goes to \nthe most worthwhile projects. It simply doesn't exist. The Constitution \ngives Congress the power of the purse. This ensures the President's \npower is checked and assures Federal elected officials closest to the \npeople are making these decisions. It is absurd to give to an unelected \nbureaucracy that may never have been in your state the final decision \non what projects to fund.\n  Third in project based accounts such as the Corps of Engineers the \nadministration already earmarks the vast majority of projects funded. \nCongress is not abusing the power of the purse.\n  Lastly, we have greater transparency today on congressionally \ndirected spending than ever before. If we do away with this transparent \nprocess we will be left with a dark, unknown process of congressional \nMembers, constituent groups, and lobbyists seeking to influence the \nadministration. We should not trade transparency for darkness.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I oppose the Coburn amendment to impose a \n3-year moratorium on spending for local priorities, or ``earmarks.'' \nThose who support this amendment claim that it will help reduce the \ndeficit and put us on the path to fiscal responsibility. This is just \nincorrect.\n  Eliminating earmarks would not reduce spending and does nothing to \ndecrease the deficit. This amendment would merely transfer spending \nauthority away from elected members of Congress to the executive \nbranch.\n  The Coburn amendment would strip elected leaders' ability to direct \nfunding to their constituents' priorities. We should all agree that \nelected Members of Congress have a much better understanding of what is \nneeded in our cities and towns, and across our States than those \nsitting in Washington, DC.\n  In addition, since 2006, Democrats have instituted a series of major \nreforms that have made earmarks more transparent than ever, and have \nreduced earmark levels by 50 percent. Members of Congress are now \nrequired to list their names next to requested projects and to post all \nrequests on their official Web site. Through these initiatives Congress \nhas taken significant steps to improve transparency and allow for \ngreater scrutiny of these requests.\n  I am proud to say that I have helped fund hundreds of local \npriorities across my home State of California: priorities that have \nhelped build safer roads, increased commerce, prevented homes from \nflooding, improved health care services, spurred job creation and \nhelped veterans recover from combat injuries.\n  I oppose the motion to suspend the rules and allow for consideration \nof the Coburn amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe Coburn amendment. The legislative branch has a constitutional duty \nto make modifications and adjustments to the budget for the Federal \nGovernment. As a U.S. Senator and a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I take very seriously the responsibility of the Senate to \nhelp craft the annual Federal budget. Members of Congress have a duty \nto their constituents to preserve their role in working with the \nexecutive branch, whether Democratic or Republican, about how, where, \nand in what manner Federal dollars are spent.\n  The U.S. Constitution gives the responsibility of spending and \ntaxation to the Congress, not to unelected bureaucrats in the executive \nbranch. The notion that individuals who are completely unaccountable to \nthe American people will make spending decisions undermines the most \nbasic principle of democracy. Instead, the Founding Fathers correctly \nput this burden on the shoulders of individuals who have to answer to \nvoters at the ballot box.\n  Over the last few months, and particularly in the days since the \nelection, some Members of Congress and Members-elect have been tripping \nover themselves to take a stronger position in opposition to so-called \nearmarks. Proponents of this amendment claim that it targets earmarks. \nI would argue otherwise. This amendment strikes at the heart of the \nbalance that our Founding Fathers established between the executive and \nlegislative branches of our government.\n  Every single State would be shortchanged by the proposed moratorium \non earmarks. The Founders knew better. They knew that a Washington \nbureaucracy would not always make decisions that were best for country, \nincluding people working and living in small towns and big cities \nacross America.\n  That also includes making better decisions for the men and women who \nserve in our military. There is no better example than the National \nGuard and Reserve Equipment Account. Republican and Democratic \nadministrations alike have short-changed the Guard equipment budget for \ndecades and have done so even as the Guard has been called to provide \nas much as half of the troops needed for operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Without the National Guard and Reserve equipment account, \nour National Guard units would still be going into battle without\n\n[[Page S8262]]\n\nequipment like body armor and blast-protected vehicles. Congress \ninsisted on providing funding to our National Guard and that has saved \ncountless lives and enabled them to carry out their missions more \neffectively.\n  Adopting this amendment is a vote for less transparency. It is a vote \nfor backroom dealing and less sunlight on how decisions regarding \nFederal spending are made. One need only look back to when Congress has \nin the past failed to pass the appropriations bills and the government \noperated under a continuing resolution for the year. Federal spending \ndid not go down by a single dime. Instead, unelected administration \nappointees made decisions on which projects they wanted to see funded.\n  It is my hope that before the next Congress a measure of sanity \nreturns to discussion of the Federal budget. Everyone agrees that we \nmust make serious changes to our Federal balance sheet and bring our \nfiscal house in order. But it was not earmarks that created our \nalarming Federal debt. Eliminating earmarks is not going to get our \nfiscal house in order. Instead it is going to expand the power of the \nexecutive branch and its employees. It also rolls back all of the \ntransparency that Congress has embedded into its budget process.\n  Congress and the administration need to work together to address our \nFederal deficit. Adopting this amendment banning earmarks is a \npublicity stunt that has serious ramifications that actually moves our \ncountry in the wrong direction toward solving our problems in an open \nand constructive way.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the amendment \noffered by the senator from Oklahoma that would prohibit \ncongressionally designated spending items from being included in any \nauthorization, appropriations, or other bill for 3 years.\n  I firmly believe the appropriations process needs to be changed. I \nhave supported strong reforms to increase transparency and \naccountability, and have pushed hard for these necessary reforms while \nensuring that my State of Minnesota is not put at a competitive \ndisadvantage.\n  In fact, before being sworn in as a U.S. Senator, I promised \nMinnesotans that I would fight to fund their priorities in an open \nmanner and pledged to include these requests on my official Web site. \nAt that point in time, the posting of requests online was not a rule of \nU.S. Senate.\n  Since arriving in the Senate, I have supported several important \nreforms to how Congress directs spending. I have voted for limitations \non earmarks, including voting to ensure that American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act funds would be competitively bid. I also voted to \nrescind funds directed to certain transportation projects that have not \nbeen spent.\n  Clearly, there is more we can do to improve this process and I will \ncontinue to push for necessary reforms.\n  However, I believe that congressional appropriations help provide \nmuch-needed resources for important programs and projects across my \nState. All of the projects I sponsor are based on Minnesota constituent \nrequests and are available for the public to review.\n  Many of the requests I receive come from my visits to all 87 counties \nin Minnesota every year. A local mayor will show me a busy road that \nchildren in the community must cross many times a day to reach their \nschool and baseball fields. And the mayor will ask me to request funds \nto help build an underpass that will allow these kids to safely get to \nschool and their games.\n  Or a sheriff will show me how the local law enforcement's outdated \ncommunications equipment interferes with emergency response and \nendangers lives. And the sheriff will ask me to earmark funds to \nupgrade the department's radios.\n  In my State of Minnesota, we remember all too well how on August 1, \n2007, the I-35W bridge across the Mississippi River in Minneapolis \ncollapsed without warning. After we mourned the loss of 13 lives and \nthe shock of the disaster had subsided, we got to work with enormous \ntask of constructing a new bridge.\n  I worked hard with my colleagues in the Senate, especially Majority \nWhip Dick Durbin, Transportation Appropriations Chairman Patty Murray \nand Senator Norm Coleman, to provide up to $195 million in funds to \nhelp with the cost of constructing a new bridge. Under Senator Coburn's \namendment, this funding would be considered an earmark, and Minnesota \nwould have been left looking for other ways to recover from this tragic \nevent.\n  Earmarks have done more than build bridges in Minnesota. Earmarks \nhave provided critical funding to the Minnesota National Guard's \ngroundbreaking ``Beyond the Yellow Ribbon Program,'' which is \nnationally recognized for the assistance it provides our service men \nand women who bravely served our nation and are now transitioning to \ncivilian life.\n  Congressionally directed projects protect communities against annual \nflooding across my State from Roseau in the north to Moorhead in the \nwest to Owatonna in the south. And congressionally initiated spending \nfunds an innovative program in Stearns County, Minnesota to help \nprotect women and children who have been the victims of domestic \nviolence, provides much-needed resources to improve law enforcement \ncommunication and interoperability, and is building a new highway \ninterchange in Blue Earth County, MN, that will improve safety and ease \ncongestion while helping generate economic development.\n  Congressionally initiated spending cannot be discussed without also \nconsidering the grave financial situation we face as a nation. It is \nclear that we will need to make very tough decisions in the coming \nyears to restore fiscal responsibility and get our nation on a path \ntowards strong growth. Yet the Coburn amendment would not direct any \nsavings from the elimination of earmarks to be used for deficit \nreduction.\n  We need a serious commitment to deficit reduction, and I believe we \nneed real reforms. I look forward to the report by the President's \nNational Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform and others who \nare taking a comprehensive look at government spending. It is my hope \nthat we can come together to consider these recommendations carefully \nand reduce our nation's debt.\n  I am committed to serious fiscal discipline, and will continue to \nsupport real reforms to increase transparency to the appropriations \nprocess.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition \nto the moratorium on earmarks that has been proposed by many of my \ncolleagues.\n  We have done a lot of crusading around here against these so-called \nearmarks, or congressionally directed spending items, in our \nappropriations bills. They are often criticized by Members of Congress \nwhen discussing the unsustainable fiscal path of the Federal Government \nor its irresponsible overspending of taxpayers' dollars.\n  But my colleagues who oppose the use of earmarks miss the point. \nEarmarks, whether good or bad, are not the problem with our government. \nAccording to data from the Congressional Research Service and the \nCongressional Budget Office, in fiscal year 2010 earmarks accounted for \n0.009 percent of the Federal budget. That is nine one-thousandths of 1 \npercent. Total earmarks amounted to $32 billion, while the entire \nFederal budget was over $3.5 trillion. And by the way, I would like to \npoint out that the President-himself requested $22 billion in earmarks.\n  But the biggest threat we face as a nation is not a special request \nfor this or that project. The biggest threat we face is an \nunsustainable fiscal course caused by explosive and unchecked growth in \nentitlement spending and no money to pay for it. We have got an \noutdated tax code that does not sufficiently encourage economic growth, \nand a skyrocketing national debt that puts our credit-rating is serious \njeopardy. In fiscal year 2010, entitlement spending accounted for 55 \npercent of the budget, compared with the 0.009 percent for earmarks I \njust referred to.\n  Now, I will say that I do agree with much of the criticism expressed \nin this chamber over bad earmarks. I don't support wasteful use of any \ntaxpayer money, especially for egregiously useless projects that my \ncolleagues often highlight as examples of why we should eliminate \nearmarks altogether.\n  But why throw out the baby with the bathwater? Certainly there is \nboth\n\n[[Page S8263]]\n\ngood and bad government spending. I support the kind of government \nspending that facilitates activity that is helpful to my State of Ohio \nand to our national economy: transportation and infrastructure, for \nexample. And I am perfectly willing to defend that kind of spending and \nlet the public decide whether my decision to help build roads and \nbridges in Ohio is an outrageous--or a proper--function of Federal \nGovernment. The Senate appropriations earmark process is transparent, \nand I welcome the public review of the projects I support, which I find \nconstructive especially for hard-working, economically challenged \nfamilies in Ohio.\n  The truth is Congress has a constitutional obligation to determine \nhow the Nation spends its money. Banning earmarks cedes this power to \nunelected Federal bureaucrats in the administration. Congress should \nnot be criticized for spending money, but only for spending it \nwastefully or irresponsibly, be it through earmarks or other spending. \nBut the media loves to single out earmarks; they are hoodwinking people \ninto thinking that by cracking down on earmarks, Congress is doing \nsomething responsible to solve this looming fiscal crisis staring us in \nthe face. It's a disingenuous approach. And Congress is fooling the \npublic by pretending that earmarks are the problem, when the real \nissues are spending and tax and entitlement reform.\n  It is interesting to note that many of my colleagues who are so \nstrongly opposed to earmarks voted against the Conrad-Gregg fiscal \ncommission that could very well have forced Congress to act upon tax \nand entitlement reform recommendations. How could one be so outspoken \nagainst earmarks in the name of fiscal responsibility and then oppose \nthe commission that would propose reforms to the tax code and \nentitlements in order to put the country on a fiscally sustainable \npath?\n  So if my colleagues want to demonstrate true fiscal responsibility, \nif they admit that earmarks they have supported in the past are good \nuse of tax dollars, and if they admit that banning earmarks would cede \nthis control of spending from Congress to the administration, then why \ntake such a blunt approach? Why don't we take more thoughtful and \nnuanced steps outlined by Senator Inhofe, who suggested we reform the \nalready transparent earmark process and offered specific ideas on how \nto do it? Some of my colleagues practically admit that banning earmarks \nis not a very good idea per se, but that eliminating them is only \npolitically expedient, as the public has come to see earmarks as a \nsymbol of Washington's irresponsibility.\n  I don't want the public to be fooled by this. I don't support every \nearmark. There will always be examples of some wasteful projects \nsomewhere. But earmarks are not the problem that gravely threatens our \ncountry's way of life, and the future of our children and \ngrandchildren. This is why for over 5 years I have worked to create a \ncommission to solve our Nation's real fiscal problems, and why I hope \nthat the commission created by the President can produce a final \nlegislative proposal that will effectively address our unchecked \nentitlement growth, our outdated and overly complex Tax Code, and \nreturn our Nation to a sustainable fiscal path.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the Coburn motion to suspend the rules with \nrespect to amendment No. 4697.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

On this vote, the yeas are 39, the nays are \n56. Two-thirds of the Senators voting not having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on the Coburn motion to \nsuspend the rules with respect to amendment No. 4696. There will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are rapidly approaching the final vote \non the Food Safety Modernization Act. For the first time in seven \ndecades, the Congress has addressed this issue. It has taken several \nyears to get to this point. We have had involvement from Republicans \nand Democrats, from the business community, and from the consumers \ngroups. It is widely supported by both the business sector and the \nconsumer groups. We have had good bipartisan support on this bill with \nSenator Enzi and others on our committee. This is the product of a long \neffort to reach the compromise we needed to get good legislation \nthrough.\n  The vote we are about to have now is on a substitute offered by my \nfriend, the Senator from Oklahoma. This substitute would basically kill \nall of this work we have done. It eliminates a lot of the provisions we \nhave in this bill, such as the preventive control provisions that I \nthink is one of the most important parts of this bill, to get \npreventive measures in and to prevent the contamination of food in the \nfirst place.\n  It also eliminates the important trace-back provisions that we have \nin this bill that we have worked on on a bipartisan basis. It would \neliminate the important foreign supplier verification provisions which \nsay they have to verify that the food coming into this country is the \nsame as this.\n  I ask Senators to reject the substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, Senator Harkin and many on the HELP \nCommittee have worked hard on the bill that is before us. But it has \nfatal flaws, especially at a time when there is a $14 trillion debt and \na $1.3 trillion deficit, and it doesn't fix the real problem. We can \nspend $1.4 billion in this bill. We can cause food prices to go up at \nleast $300 million to $400 million. We can put unfunded mandates on the \nStates for $141 billion a year. That is what we will do if we reject \nthis alternative. This accomplishes the same thing, given that we have \nthe safest food in the world. We will continue to have the safest food \nin the world, we will move forward, but we won't do it by creating \nlayers upon layers of additional costs and regulations. The problem \nwith food safety is that the agencies don't do what they are supposed \nto be doing now. They need less regulation, not more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was unavoidably delayed on vote No. 255, \nthe Coburn motion to suspend the rules as to the Coburn amendment on \nearmarks. I would have voted a very strong no because I believe that \nauthority should remain with the elected representatives and not go to \nbureaucrats.\n\n\n                            SAVINGS CLAUSES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the distinguished floor manager for this bill yield \nin order to enter into a colloquy to clarify the meaning of certain \nprovisions in the legislation?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am pleased to yield to the distinguished majority whip \nand lead sponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wanted to clarify an important part of \nthis bill. While this bill does grant FDA many new authorities, the \nsavings clauses in this bill--in particular, sections 403(3), \n418(1)(3)(B), and 41900(3)(B)--preserve all of FDA's existing authority \nunder both the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public \nHealth Service Act, am I correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So while the bill does provide for certain exemptions \nfrom FDA authority for small farms and food processing facilities, \nthese exemptions are based only on the specific provisions added by S. \n510; they do not prevent FDA from taking appropriate actions against \nspecific farms or facilities--or from issuing regulations in the future \nthat might affect those exempted farms and facilities--based on \nexisting authorities that are currently in effect and will continue to \nbe in effect after enactment of S. 510. Am I understanding this \ncorrectly?\n  Mr. HARKIN. My colleague is correct. The exemptions for small farms \nand facilities in S. 510 do not in any way circumscribe FDA's existing \nauthority under current laws. As my distinguished colleague has just \nstated, this existing authority is expressly preserved in the savings \nclauses in the bill. Over the past 15 years, FDA has relied on a number \nof provisions in existing law in establishing preventive control, or \n``HACCP,'' and other preventive requirements for seafood, eggs, and \njuice. These authorities include section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food \nDrug and Cosmetic Act, which gives FDA the authority to take action \nagainst ``adulterated food'' when that food has been subjected to \n``insanitary conditions.'' In adopting these regulations, FDA has also \nrelied on section 701(a) of the food and drug law, which gives it broad \nauthority to issue regulations ``for the efficient enforcement'' of \nthat law, as well as its authority to ``prevent the introduction, \ntransmission, or spread of communicable diseases'' under section 361 of \nthe Public Health Service Act.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my distinguished colleague for clarifying this \nimportant matter.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, each year, 76 million Americans are \nsickened by foodborne illness. More than 300,000 become so sick they \nmust be hospitalized. More than 5,000 die of their illness. These \nstatistics are deeply worrisome. And behind each number is a family \ndealing with tragic loss or expensive hospital bills or concern for a \nsick child.\n  The situation cries for action, which is why I support passage of the \nlegislation we are now considering, the FDA Food Safety Modernization \nAct. This legislation seeks to address major deficiencies in the system \nthat protects Americans from foodborne illnesses. It includes \nprovisions recommended by Republicans and Democrats, by government \nexperts and outside groups. It should have strong bipartisan support.\n  The bill would give FDA authority to initiate food recalls even when \nproducers of unsafe foods refuse to do so voluntarily. It would \nstrengthen FDA's ability to trace harmful products to their source. It \nwould crack down on the unsafe food imports that have been the source \nof many health-risk incidents. It would increase FDA's authority to \ninspect food-producing facilities to prevent illnesses. And it would \nrequire greater diligence on the part of those producers to prevent \nfoodborne illnesses and other health threats.\n  Passing this legislation will make our food safer and protect \nAmericans from harm. I will vote to approve it, and I hope for a strong \nbipartisan vote in favor of this bill.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the FDA \nFood Safety Modernization Act. I commend Senator Durbin, Senator \nHarkin, and the many other Senators who have worked so hard for so long \non this important legislation. It is long past time that we make \nimprovements to our food safety procedures in the United States, and we \ncan see by the diversity of interests that have come together to \nsupport this bill from industry to farm to consumer groups that the \ntime to address this issue is now.\n  Like so many Rhode Islanders, I have been appalled by the stories of \ndeaths and serious illnesses from seemingly benign foods such as peanut \nbutter and spinach. These are foods we bring into our homes, expecting \nthem to nourish our families. We shouldn't have to worry that they \nmight make our children sick. American families need to know that their \ngovernment is protecting the food supply.\n  This bill goes a long way toward improving the Food and Drug \nAdministration's food inspection and recall system. First, the bill \nimproves our ability to prevent food safety emergencies through better \nrecord keeping, hazard analysis, controls, and food safety plans. These \nstandards are also applied to imported foods, which is increasingly \nimportant in our global economy. Second, FDA's ability to react to \nfoodborne illness outbreaks is significantly enhanced by increasing \ninspection and surveillance, making food more traceable in order to \nmore quickly pinpoint the source of an outbreak. Furthermore, the bill \ngrants the FDA the authority to order a mandatory recall of food if a \ncompany refuses to participate in a voluntary recall. Finally, this \nbill enhances FDA's capability to protect the American food supply from \nterrorist threats and from intentional contamination through building \ncooperation with the Department of Homeland Security at our ports.\n  I am very pleased that all of this is accomplished while protecting \nsmall farmers and producers. Rhode Island is\n\n[[Page S8265]]\n\nvery proud of its small farms, local produce, and the wonderful farmers \nmarkets that can be found throughout the State. Our farmers are proud \nto feed families in Rhode Island and the surrounding States, and I know \nthey do everything possible to ensure the food they sell is safe. I \nthank Senator Tester for his work on a compromise to protect farmers \nlike those in Rhode Island, and throughout Nation, who believe in the \nvalue of locally grown food.\n  It has been disappointing that the process to bring this bill about \nhas taken so long. The bill's sponsors have been trying to bring it to \nthe floor of the Senate for a vote for months, during which time the \noutbreak of salmonella in eggs made the need to improve our food \ninspection system even more clear. This is not a perfect bill, but it \nis a necessary one. Once it is passed, we must continue to build upon \nit. The matter of our families' safety is not a partisan issue; \nensuring food safety is a fundamental function of our Federal \nGovernment.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, the next time we sit down to eat dinner \nwith our families, are we sure that the food on our tables is safe to \neat? I understand that many Americans are concerned about food safety \nissues. We all want food for our families that is nutritious and free \nfrom foodborne pathogens and contaminants. Ensuring that our food \nsupply, both domestic and foreign food products, is safe is a high \npriority for me. I am focused on food safety not only as a lawmaker but \nalso as a consumer and a father.\n  Americans have every right to expect a safe food supply. We need \nsolutions to give Americans peace of mind that the foods they eat and \ngive to their families are safe to consume. There are 76 million cases \nof foodborne illness in this country every year. These illnesses send \nan estimated 300,000 Americans to the hospital each year and they kill \nan estimated 5,000 individuals yearly. Many of these deaths occur in \nvulnerable members of our communities: young children, the elderly, or \nthose with chronic illnesses.\n  I will share with you the story, a real story, of Kevin Kowalcyk, a \n2-year-old boy, who was sickened with an E. coli O157:H7 infection that \nhe acquired from eating a common food. I want to speak about Kevin \nbecause I want to be clear that when we are not talking about \nstatistics today, we are talking about real people, real lives. Kevin's \nillness started with vomiting and diarrhea, but soon he was passing \nlarge amounts of blood. On the third day of his illness, he was \ndiagnosed and hospitalized. On the following day, his kidneys started \nto fail. The medical staff, while brutally honest about how hemolytic \nuremic syndrome, HUS, affected children, felt that Kevin would live. \nThey told Kevin's parents that he would go to the brink of death--which \nhe did on several occasions--because ``this is the way it is for HUS \nkids.''\n  On day 12 of his illness, this normally healthy little boy looked as \nsick as a child can look. His body was swollen to three times its \nnormal size, and he was hooked up to a dialysis machine and a \nrespirator. His heart raced at 200 beats per minute, and light from \nhuge sun lamps focused on him, in attempt to raise his body \ntemperature. Kevin could not speak or cry. His loving family could not \nhold him. He suffered three heart attacks as they struggled to put him \non a heart-lung machine. And then Kevin died. The autopsy later showed \nthat his entire intestinal tract had been destroyed by gangrene.\n  One month after Kevin's August 11, 2001, death, America experienced \nthe horrible 9/11 attack, and the Kowalcyk family were told that they \nwere having another baby. Kevin's grandmother, Pat Buck, a Pennsylvania \nresident, was very concerned about her daughter and her new grandchild, \nand she was horrified by the type of death that her grandson had \nendured. So Pat did what any teacher would do and started studying \nfoodborne illnesses. What she learned shocked and appalled her.\n  By March 2002, Kevin's family was actively involved in food safety \nadvocacy. In April 2003, Senator Harkin declared that the Meat and \nPoultry Pathogen Reduction and Enforcement Act would be renamed Kevin's \nLaw. In 2006, after the spinach outbreak, Barbara Kowalcyk, Kevin's \nmother, and Pat Buck founded the Center for Foodborne Illness Research \n& Prevention, CFI, a national nonprofit dedicated to preventing \nfoodborne illness through research, education, advocacy, and service. \nIn 2007, Barbara and Pat were asked to participate in the filming of \nthe Oscar-nominated documentary, ``Food Inc.'' Today, CFI is viewed as \na credible organization that is looking for science-based solutions to \nAmerica's food safety challenges.\n  I tell you about Kevin's story because it is a powerful reminder that \nreal people are being affected by foodborne disease, not just once in \nawhile but every day. I want to thank Barbara and Pat Buck for sharing \ntheir story and becoming involved in such an important issue that \naffects all of our lives. In particular, I am thankful to them for \nturning their family's tragedy into an action that will help to ensure \nno child would ever again go through Kevin's horrible experience.\n  As Pat said to me once while visiting my office, ``It is time to move \nforward. Too many people are being sickened, too many are suffering \nnegative, long-term health consequences and too many are dying because \nthey ate a common food, such as peanut butter, cookie dough or fresh \nproduce. The 1938 law governing the Food and Drug Administration is too \nobsolete and it does not provide the Agency with the authorities or \nresources needed to develop a proactive approach to food safety. S. 510 \nwill help FDA to become more proactive. This legislation is needed to \nhelp America meet the food challenges of the 21st century.''\n  The U.S. Senate must modernize the U.S. system of food safety and \ninspection. That is why I am pleased to support passage of S. 510, \nSenator Durbin's Food Safety Modernization Act. We must provide the \nagencies that regulate food safety with additional authorities to \nensure the safety of our Nation's food supply. We must provide \nincreased resources to the FDA so that it can hire more personnel and \nso it can invest in improvements to domestic and imported food products \ninspection systems. We must mandate science-based regulations to ensure \nthe safety of food products that carry the most risk. We must improve \ncoordination between USDA, FDA, and the various other Federal and State \nagencies charged with regulating food safety. We must implement a \nnational traceability system so we have consistency and know where our \nfood comes from. And we must ensure the safety of both domestic and \nforeign food products.\n  With Senator Grassley, I introduced the EAT SAFE Act, which is \ndesigned to address a critical aspect of the food and agricultural \nimport system: food being smuggled into the United States. The greatest \nthreat of smuggled food and agricultural products comes from the \ncompanies, importers, and individuals who circumvent U.S. inspection \nrequirements or restrictions on imports of certain products from a \nparticular country. Some examples of prohibited products discovered in \nU.S. commerce in recent years include unpasteurized raw cheeses from \nMexico containing a bacterium that causes tuberculosis and strawberries \nfrom Mexico contaminated with hepatitis A. These smuggled food and \nagriculture products present safety risks to our food, plants, and \nanimals and pose a threat to our Nation's health, economy, and \nsecurity.\n  I am grateful to Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Enzi, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Dodd, Senator Gregg, and Senator Burr for incorporating \nportions of the EAT SAFE Act into S. 510. These provisions would add \npersonnel to detect, track, and remove smuggled food, call for the \ndevelopment and implementation of strategies to stop food from being \nsmuggled into the United States, and require data sharing amongst \nFederal agencies dealing with food safety and foodborne illnesses. I am \nthankful that this important issue is being addressed so that mothers \nand fathers across the Nation won't have to be concerned when they pack \ntheir children's lunches, sit down to eat a family dinner, or give \ntheir child a snack.\n  In the Senate, we owe it every American consumer to make needed \nimprovements to our food safety system before another outbreak sickens \nour citizens, and we need to make sure that we are vigilant and \nvigorously monitor and update our food safety system so that Americans \ncan continue to be confident that the food they eat is safe.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about S. 510, the \nFDA\n\n[[Page S8266]]\n\nFood Safety Modernization Act, which we will be voting on today.\n  This bill incorporates the best ideas from food safety experts, \nfarmers, small business owners, the Bush administration's Food \nProtection Plan, the Obama administration's Food Safety Working Group, \nand Members on both sides of the aisle.When enacted, it will transform \nAmerica's approach to food safety by emphasizing prevention and by \nstrengthening our capacity to detect and rapidly respond when food \nsafety emergencies occur in the future.\n  I would especially like to thank Senator Durbin for all of his \nefforts on the issue of food safety and his commitment to working on \nthis issue in a bipartisan manner. We originally teamed up to begin \nthis effort in the spring of 2008, and after numerous drafts and twist \nand turns, I am hopeful that we are close to getting this bill across \nthe finish line.\n  None of this would have been possible without a core group of \nbipartisan Members who have helped shepherd this bill since its \ninception. Senator Burr has been a key leader on food defense issues \nand has worked tirelessly to ensure that this bill is not burdensome \nfor small farmers and food producers. Senator Dodd, along with Senator \nAlexander, contributed greatly to the bill as a whole, and were \ninstrumental in providing a key provision relating to the need for \nschools to be more prepared to protect children with life-threatening \nfood allergies.\n  We have also been extremely fortunate to have the tireless support of \nboth Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Enzi, who assisted in moving \nthe bill through the HELP Committee with unanimous support roughly a \nyear ago, and who, in the last year have helped us navigate our way to \nthe floor.\n  Finally, I would like to thank our staffs who have put so much time \ninto this legislative effort. Although it has been a long and sometimes \narduous process, they have shown time and again that almost every \nproblem is solvable when you get a group of hard working folks around a \ntable. I would like to especially recognize and thank my own lead \nstaffer on this bill, Liz Wroe, as well as the following:\n  Dave Lazarus, Candice Cho, and Albert Sanders with Senator Durbin; \nJenny Ware, Jenn Alton, Josh Martin, Margaret Brooks, and Anna Abram \nwith Senator Burr; Jenelle Krishnamoorthy, Tom Kraus, and Bill \nMcConagha with Senator Harkin; Amy Muhlberg, Travis Jordan, Keith \nFlanagan, and Chuck Clapton with Senator Enzi; and Tamar Magarik Haro \nand Anna Staton with Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is poised to pass the FDA Food \nSafety Modernization Act, which will take much needed and long overdue \nsteps to protect Americans from unsafe food. I am disappointed that the \nSenate will not consider, however, an important amendment I proposed \nthat would have held criminals who poison our food supply accountable \nfor their crimes. My amendment would have greatly strengthened the \nability to deter outrageous conduct that puts Americans at risk. It \nreceived unanimous, bipartisan support when it was reported by the \nJudiciary Committee as the Food Safety Accountability Act. It is \nunfortunate that, despite this bipartisan support in committee, \nRepublican objections prevented the amendment from being considered by \nthe full Senate.\n  This legislative proposal would increase the sentences that \nprosecutors can seek for people who knowingly violate our food safety \nlaws in those cases where there is conscious or reckless disregard of a \nrisk of death or serious bodily injury. If it were passed, those who \nknowingly contaminate our food supply and endanger Americans could \nreceive up to 10 years in jail.\n  Just this summer, a salmonella outbreak caused hundreds of people to \nfall ill and triggered a national egg recall. The cause of the outbreak \nis still under investigation, but salmonella poisoning is too common \nand sometimes results from inexcusable knowing conduct. The company \nresponsible for the eggs at the root of this summer's salmonella crisis \nhad a long history of environmental, immigration, labor, and food \nsafety violations. It is clear that fines are not enough to protect the \npublic and effectively deter this unacceptable conduct. We need to make \nsure that those who knowingly poison the food supply will go to jail. \nThis amendment would have done that in the most egregious cases.\n  Current statutes do not provide sufficient criminal sanctions for \nthose who knowingly violate our food safety laws. Knowingly \ndistributing adulterated food is already illegal, but it is merely a \nmisdemeanor right now, and the Sentencing Commission has found that it \ngenerally does not result in jail time. The fines and recalls that \nusually result from criminal violations under current law fall short in \nprotecting the public from harmful products. Too often, those who are \nwilling to endanger our children in pursuit of profits view such fines \nor recalls as merely the cost of doing business.\n  Last year, a mother from Vermont, Gabrielle Meunier, testified before \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee about her 7-year-old son, Christopher, \nwho became severely ill and was hospitalized for 6 days after he \ndeveloped salmonella poisoning from peanut crackers. Thankfully, \nChristopher recovered, but Mrs. Meunier's story highlighted \nimprovements that are needed in our food safety system. No parent \nshould have to go through what she experienced. The American people \nshould be confident that the food they buy for their families is safe.\n  After hearing Mrs. Meunier's account last year, I called on the \nDepartment of Justice to conduct a criminal investigation into the \noutbreak of salmonella that made Christopher and many others so sick. \nIn that case, the outbreak was traced to the Peanut Corporation of \nAmerica. The president of that company, Stewart Parnell, came before \nCongress and invoked his right against self-incrimination, refusing to \nanswer questions about his role in distributing contaminated peanut \nproducts. These products were linked to the deaths of 9 people and have \nsickened more than 600 others.\n  It appears that Mr. Parnell knew that peanut products from his \ncompany had tested positive for deadly salmonella, but rather than \nimmediately disposing of the products, he sought ways to sell them \nanyway. The evidence suggests that he knowingly put profit above the \npublic's safety. Our laws must be strengthened to ensure this does not \nhappen again. My amendment would increase the chances that those who \ndisregard the safety of Americans and commit food safety crimes will \nface jail time, rather than a slap on the wrist, for their criminal \nconduct.\n  On behalf of the hundreds of individuals sickened by this summer's \nand last year's salmonella outbreaks, we must repair our broken food \nsafety system. The House has already passed a provision similar to my \namendment. I am sorry that partisan objections from a few Senators \nprevented the Senate from quickly adopting this important amendment. I \nwill continue to try to pass this commonsense legislation even if it \ncannot be coupled with the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, and I \nhope the Senate will act quickly to pass it separately.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of the most difficult issues I have \nhad to face as manager of S. 510 is the balance between small growers \nand processors and larger producers and food companies. This is always \na tough issue in agriculture. Those of us who work with our food system \nknow that one size does not fit all. It is always hard to get it right.\n  In this case, I know that some of my colleagues think the Tester-\nsponsored language goes too far to help small growers and processors. I \ndon't think we have, and here is why I say that. There are some very \nimportant limitations on the Tester provisions in S. 510. First, small \nbusinesses as we define them here are really small--a company that does \n$500,000 of sales a year is very small. We can't say exactly how much \nfood these small companies sell, but here is a good example that shows \nhow small these eligible companies are: The smallest member of the \nCalifornia League of Food Processors reports between $2.5 and $3 \nmillion a year in sales or five times as much as any company eligible \nunder the Tester provisions.\n  Second, many food companies that buy product from eligible producers \nwill tell them: Hey I want you to follow FDA regulations. I want all my \nsuppliers to follow FDA rules. Some may even require their suppliers to \ndo\n\n[[Page S8267]]\n\nmore than FDA requires. That decision is part of a private contractual \nrelationship. This bill does not affect these arrangements. They will \ncontinue to exist and will limit the application of any exemptions \nprovided in this bill.\n  Third, processors that want to be exempted will have to document that \nthey meet the exemption. There are two ways to do that. First, they \nmust show they are in compliance with State law or second, they must \nshow that they have completed a food safety plan of their own. Many \nprocessors will simply decide that for competitive reasons or lack of \ncapacity they will simply stick with whatever FDA requires. This is \nanother pragmatic limitation on the Tester provisions.\n  Fourth and finally, FDA is specifically authorized to take action and \nrevoke an exemption if it determines that the food presents a public \nhealth risk, and FDA can act to prevent an outbreak if needed. This \nprovision creates a ``one-strike-you are out'' exemption: once a farm \nor food processing facility has lost its exemption, it may never be \nreinstated.\n  Mr. President, it is not the intent of this legislation to include in \nthe definition of ``facility,'' for purposes of either FFDCA Sec. 415 \nor for the pending bill, seed production or storage establishments as \nlong as they do not manufacture, process, pack, or hold seed reasonably \nexpected to be used as food or feed. Further, we note that seeds not \nused as food or feed have historically not been subject to oversight by \nFDA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 4715 \nis agreed to.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, today with the passage of the Food Safety \nModernization Act by this overwhelming vote of 73 to 25, we have taken \nmomentous steps to help strengthen food safety in America. The Food \nSafety Modernization Act will bring America's food safety system into \nthe 21st century.\n  This bill gives the FDA the authority the agency needs to help \nprotect America from foodborne illnesses. While this bill is a historic \nstep forward in ensuring that our food supply is safe and protecting \nAmericans from foodborne illnesses, we have to now ensure that the FDA \nhas adequate resources to fulfill their profound responsibilities.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee and the entire Senate to ensure that they have the necessary \nresources to fulfill the provisions of this legislation.\n  As the primary cosponsors of the bill, Senators Durbin and Gregg \ndeserve a great deal of thanks for their outstanding leadership. I \nasked Senator Durbin when he started working on this bill. He said back \nin the House 18 years ago. So sometimes it takes a long time to get \nthese things done. But this is the first time in 70 years we have ever \nhad a major revision of our food safety laws. Senator Gregg has also \nworked at least a dozen years,\n\n[[Page S8268]]\n\nthat I know of, on this bill in his time in the Senate. I would also \nlike to thank my colleagues, Senator Enzi, the ranking member of the \ncommittee, former chairman and ranking member of the committee, for his \nhelp and also Senator Burr for working hard on the legislation and \ngetting it where it is today.\n  Finally, I thank my friend, Senator Dodd, for his tireless efforts. \nThe Senate will certainly miss his leadership on this and so many other \nimportant issues. Additionally, I thank members of our staffs who \nhelped to make this possible, and let me just--I am going to read their \nnames, but let me say at the outset, while many of us were perhaps not \naround during Thanksgiving week or perhaps even the week after the \nelections, I can tell you the staffs were hard at work day after day, \nsometimes late in the evenings, sometimes on weekends, to help get this \nbill together. These staff people deserve so many thanks from not only \nme but from everyone involved with this legislation.\n  From Senator Durbin's staff: Albert Sanders, Anne Wall, and Dena \nMorris; from Senator Enzi's staff: Chuck Clapton, Keith Flanagan, \nTravis Jordan, Frank Macchiarola, and Amy Muhlberg; Senator Dodd's \nstaff: Anna Staton and Tamar Haro; Senator Gregg's staff has worked on \nthis bill from the beginning: Elizabeth Wroe; Senator Burr's staff: \nAnna Abram and Margaret Brooks; Senator Reed's staff: Carolyn Gluck and \nKasey Gillette; and from my staff: Kathleen Laird, Tom Kraus, Bill \nMcConagha, Mark Halverson, Jenelle Krishnamoorthy, Pam Smith, and Dan \nSmith. All of them are heroes and heroines in my book. They really put \nforth supreme effort to get this bill to us today so we could have this \noverwhelming vote of approval.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to say a few words about a friend \nand colleague whom I will miss very much when he leaves the Senate \nafter we adjourn, Senator Russ Feingold. I cannot thank him for his \nservice without mentioning the outstanding work of his capable staff: \nMary Irving, his chief of staff; Sumner Slichter, his policy director; \nBob Schiff, chief counsel; and Paul Weinberger, his legislative \ndirector, a loyal and outstanding team.\n  Without intending it as a commentary on his successor, I have to \nconfess I think the Senate will be a much poorer place without Russ \nFeingold in it. I know that in my next term I will experience fewer \noccasions of inspiration because of the departure of Russ Feingold, a \nman whose courage and dedication to the principles that guided his \nSenate service often inspired me.\n  I will also miss the daily experience of Russ Feingold's friendship, \nand the qualities that distinguish his friendship, his thoughtfulness, \nkindness, humor and loyalty. I have treasured that friendship all the \nyears we have served together, and while friendship does not end with a \nSenate career, I will sorely miss his presence. I will miss seeing him \nevery day. I will miss traveling with him. I will miss the daily \nreminder of what a blessing it is to have a true friend in Washington.\n  Our first encounter with one another was in a Senate debate in which \nwe argued about an aircraft carrier, somewhat heatedly, if memory \nserves. Russ thought the U.S. Navy had one too many. I thought we did \nnot have enough. It was, I am sorry to admit, not a very considerate \nwelcome on my part to a new colleague, whom I would soon have many \nreasons to admire. But to Russ's credit, he did not let my discourtesy \nstand in the way of working together on issues where we were in \nagreement. And to my good fortune, he did not let it stand in the way \nof our friendship either.\n  We are of different parties and our political views are often \nopposed.\n  We have had many debates on many issues. But where we agreed on \nwasteful spending, ethics reform, campaign finance reform and other \nissues, it was a privilege to fight alongside and not against Russ \nFeingold.\n  We do not often hear anymore about Members of Congress who \ndistinguish themselves by having the courage of their convictions; who \nrisk their personal interests for what they believe is in the public \ninterest. I have seen many examples of it here, but the cynicism of our \ntimes, among the political class and the media and the voters, tends to \nmiss examples of political courage or dismiss them as probable frauds \nor, at best, exceptions that prove the rule. In his time in the Senate, \nRuss Feingold, every day and in every way, had the courage of his \nconvictions. And though I am quite a few years older than Russ, and \nhave served in this body longer than he has, I confess I have always \nfelt he was my superior in that cardinal virtue.\n  We were both up for re-election in 1998. I had an easy race. Russ had \na difficult one. As many of our colleagues will remember, Russ and I \nopposed soft money, the unlimited corporate and labor donations to \npolitical parties that we believed were compromising the integrity of \nCongress, and we were a nuisance on the subject. Russ 's opponent in \n1998 was outspending him on television, and the race became tighter. It \nreached a point where most observers, Democrats and Republicans, \nexpected him to lose. The Democratic Party pleaded with Russ to let it \nspend soft money on his behalf. Russ refused. He risked his seat, the \njob he loved, because his convictions were more important to him than \nany personal success. I think he is one of the most admirable people I \nhave ever met in my life.\n  We have had a lot experiences together. We fought together for many \nthings, important things. And we have fought many times on opposite \nsides. We have been honored together and scorned together. We have \ntraveled abroad together. We could not be farther apart in our views on \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but we traveled there together as \nwell, to gain knowledge that would inform our views and challenge them. \nWe have listened to each other; debated each other; defended each \nother; joked and commiserated together.\n  And in my every experience with Russ Feingold, in agreement and \ndisagreement, in pleasant times and difficult ones, in heated arguments \nand in the relaxed conversation of friends, he was an exemplary public \nservant; a gentleman; good company; an irreplaceable friend; a kind \nman; a man to be admired.\n  I can not do justice in these remarks to all of Russ's many qualities \nor express completely how much I think this institution benefited from \nhis service here and how much I benefited from knowing him. I lack the \neloquence. I do not think he is replaceable. We would all do well to \nkeep his example in our minds as we serve our constituents and country \nand convictions. We could not have a better role model.\n  I have every expectation we will remain good friends long after we \nhave both ended our Senate careers. But I will miss him every day. And \nI will try harder to become half the public servant he is. Because his \nfriendship is an honor and honors come with responsibilities.\n  God bless my friend Russ Feingold.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I want to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8268-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8268-S8269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I spent a lot of time, as my \ncolleagues have, traveling our States during the elections, to be sure, \nbut also since. I hear a lot of discussion from regular people--not \nfrom people running for office per se but regular people--about what \nthis new health care law has meant to them. I meet 22-year-olds who are \nnow on their parents' health insurance plan. If you are 22 in this \ncountry today, your chances of finding a job with decent health care \nare not real high in most places in our country, and\n\n[[Page S8269]]\n\nthey now celebrate the fact that they can be on their parents' health \ninsurance automatically. That is a big victory for consumers and a big \nvictory for those families.\n  I also talk to people who have children who have preexisting \nconditions and could not get insurance as a result. The law now is, an \ninsurance company cannot deny insurance to a family with a child with \npreexisting conditions. We also know now that someone who is sick and \ntheir health care is very expensive, that they cannot be thrown off \ntheir insurance because it costs the insurance company too much money.\n  We know now, and I hear from small businesses who almost all want to \ninsure their employees but simply cannot because of the high costs, \nthey now are getting a 30-percent tax credit to be able to insure their \nemployees, something, as I said, they wanted to do whether they live in \nConneaut in northeast Ohio or Middletown and Hamilton in southwest \nOhio. I see that all over my State--in Bowling Green, in Toledo, in \nZanesville and Chillacothe and Columbus and Bellaire. We are also \nseeing that so many senior citizens are getting hit hard by high drug \nprices.\n  We have begun. As one of the leaders in that effort on the HELP \nCommittee, Senator Bennet, the Presiding Officer, knows that we have \nbeen helpful in now beginning to close that doughnut hole that seniors \nfall into. After they have had $2,000 of drug costs, they are still \npaying the premium every month, but they do not get any coverage until \ntheir costs go above $5,000. That is sort of a cruel bargain that this \nCongress, for reasons I did not exactly understand--I opposed it back \nthen--passed the drug benefit and inflicted that on seniors. We are \nbeginning to fix that.\n  We know all that. Those are citizens I talk to about that. Put that \naside for a minute, unfortunately, and look at so many elected \nofficials in a State, conservative elected officials, mostly \nRepublicans, who are saying we should repeal the health care law and we \nshould bring back preexisting condition, take 23-year-olds, home from \ncollege or home from the service or whatever, and if they do not have \nTRICARE, throw them off their parents' health care plan, take away the \ntax cuts to small businesses. That is what they want to do and repeal \nthis health care plan.\n  My only question is, I guess I am waiting for the first Republican \nelected official--whether he is an attorney general in Ohio or \nelsewhere or whether he is a Congressman or she is a Congressman or a \nSenator--I am waiting for the first one who says: I want to repeal this \nplan. Take away these consumer protections; I want to repeal this plan \nand take away health insurance for people who are in high risk pools \nwho are getting insurance now and people down the road who are going to \nget covered with health insurance, the 50 million Americans who do not \nhave it and the tens of millions of Americans who are underinsured. I \nwant to hear one of those elected officials, who is saying repeal the \nhealth care plan, say they are not going to take their government \nhealth insurance. I cannot believe the number of elected officials, \nmostly Republicans, who have been the beneficiaries of government-\nsponsored health insurance--taxpayer-financed health insurance for 10 \nyears, 20 years, 30 years--who are saying: No, I want to repeal health \ninsurance for millions of Americans who are about to receive it. Some \nof them are already getting it; all of them getting better consumer \nprotections.\n  They will keep their plan, paid for by taxpayers. They want to deny \nit to others. I am waiting for one of my colleagues--and Republicans \naround the State and around the country who are calling for this health \ncare law to be repealed--to step up and say: Oh, I am not going to take \ngovernment insurance either. I am still waiting for that day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if we want to revive our \neconomy, one thing we can do is to bring back and extend the home buyer \ntax credit we enacted earlier this year. It was for a limited time. It \nhas expired, but it was hugely successful.\n  It is an $8,000 tax credit for qualified first-time home buyers and a \n$6,500 tax credit for repeat, move-up home buyers. And this tax credit \nthat we passed that was law was largely responsible for many of the \nhomes that were purchased in States like mine, Florida, where the \nhousing market has gone kaput. The mortgages were inflated when the \nhousing bubble burst, the property values dropped and you see a number \nof our States that have been hit so hard, albeit, the entire Nation has \nbeen hit hard by the housing bubble bursting.\n  Well, we tried this home buyer tax credit, and it worked. It was \npopular in other States, like California, like in Texas. Texas had a \nmore stable housing market, but folks recognized that a good housing \nmarket provides a lot of ancillary benefits for the economy. It creates \njobs. It generates consumer spending. The studies have shown, looking \nback on this tax credit we gave for housing, it was in the first \nquarter of this year, it led to a 6-percent increase in all home sales, \nand it led to a whopping 42-percent increase in the sale of new homes.\n  Now by contrast, when that credit expired, the home sales plummeted. \nWell, what does it mean in real terms to real people and real families? \nIt means jobs. It means jobs selling houses, jobs constructing houses, \njobs financing houses--anything associated with a person having one of \ntheir most important assets, their home. And then it means a lot of \njobs about making all the things that go inside a house. And that's the \nkind of boost we need again.\n  We need again to get this economy moving. Now, since it has been \nshown to work because it generates home sales and purchases--in States \nwhere the real estate industry is a large part of the economy, in \nStates where housing values have dropped, where many homes are \nunderwater in the value of their fair market value now compared to the \nface amount of their mortgage in many communities that are distressed \nby foreclosures--and what community has not been hit by that?--what it \ndoes is it turns that around and boosts the home sales. That is a part \nof economic recovery. Now, there are those who are out there who are \ngoing to say: Well, it is too expensive. That it doesn't yield good \nresults in certain parts of the country that were not hit with the \nhousing crisis like the rest of us were. And some people will claim: \nWell, we're coming out of the recession--by their estimation--and it \nwould be better to target our efforts elsewhere.\n  Mr. President, the recession's not over for many, many Americans. And \nif something has proven it works, why don't we reinstitute it? It was \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt who said, during another time of economic \nperil, the Great Depression, he said:\n\n       Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the \n     moment.\n\n  Mr. President, do we not have the ``dark realities of the moment'' of \nwhat's happening in the State of the Presiding Officer right now, in my \nState, and many others? Indeed, these are dark economic times, and most \nevery American knows it. Just look to the elections. In almost every \nexit poll after the election, 60 percent of the voters said the economy \nwas the most important issue facing the Nation--that they were \nconcerned about as they walked into that polling place. Forty percent \nof those same voters said their families are worse off financially than \nthey were just a few years ago. And 33 percent of them said that \nsomeone in their household had lost a job recently. Is that not the \n``dark realities of the moment''?\n  So let's take something that worked. And despite the fact that it's \ncostly, let's find an offset. Let's find another source of revenue to \npay for approximately the $15 to $20 billion that the home buyer tax \ncredit cost before that boosted the sales of homes and started to \nrevive the housing industry and, therefore, revive the fair market \nvalues of people's homes. Let's move to quickly bring back this home \nbuyer tax credit. It's worked before, and it will work again.\n  Mr. President, if I may be recognized again, since no one is waiting \nto speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n[[Page S8270]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8270-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    DISCLOSURE OF CLASSIFIED CABLES\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

America's friends and allies are at risk and, \ntherefore, America's national security is at risk.\n  When classified cables identify certain people who have helped us \nfrom around the world as we advance the interests of the free world, \ndefend our national security, and the safety of all humankind--when \nthose people are exposed, there are a lot of bad people out there who \nwant to get rid of those kind of people. When sources of information--I \nwill dress it up and tell you exactly what it is; it is called \nintelligence--when sources of intelligence are betrayed by being made \npublic, by the disclosure, indiscriminately, of thousands and thousands \nof cables that were marked ``Top Secret'' or marked ``Secret,'' then \nwhat we have done is we have started to shackle our arms behind \nourselves in our ability to defend ourselves.\n  Why do I say that? Well, look at all the recent attempts at a \nterrorist act. We were able to avert the terrorist striking because we \ngot the information that he was going to strike before he struck. Where \ndid that source of information come? Often that source of information \ncomes from far corners of the globe because we have a relationship with \npeople who are giving us information that we then track down and find \nthat, in fact, it is true and stop the terrorist from doing their \ndastardly deed upon innocent humans.\n  Since 2001 and the September 11th bombings and the September 11th \ncrashes of the airliners, over and over again the newspapers of this \ncountry have chronicled terrorist plots that have been thwarted for the \nreasons I have just said. Now along comes someone who, for whatever \nreasons of being a misfit, wants to disgorge thousands of classified \ncables that start to betray our sources of information to protect \nourselves and protect others--not even necessarily our allies--but \nother innocent victims in other countries with whom we may not even \nhave a relationship.\n  This is the height of dishonoring our country and our people and all \nhumankind, and it is the height of traitorous activity. It has to stop. \nWe cannot continue to thwart these terrorist acts if we do not have \nreliable sources of information in order to disrupt the terrorist \nplots. Do you know what? The newspapers have chronicled, since the \nattempt, for example, of blowing up FedEx and UPS--and, by the way, \nthose packages also were carried on commercial airliners with \npassengers on them--you know what the newspapers have chronicled? They \nhave pointed out how the terrorist organizations are crowing about how \nlittle it costs them and how they will find another way in order to do \nthis. As the newspapers reported, we found out and stopped that plot by \nlong-distance sources of information that came to us. To betray those \nsources, to now put their lives in jeopardy by the indiscriminate \nturning over to an organization called WikiLeaks that suddenly puts all \nof this up on the Web, is the height of irresponsibility, an act \nagainst humanity, and it has to be stopped.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8270-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8270-S8271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX POLICY\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about our economy and \nsome of the debates and discussions we are engaged in now about tax \npolicy as well as to emphasize the need to be guided during these \ndebates by the two essential priorities on which we must focus. \nObviously, those priorities are job creation and continuing economic \ngrowth, continuing our recovery. We also must make sure that in the \nprocess of doing that, we don't take steps that will increase long-term \ndeficits. So while we debate these many tax issues, I think it is \ncritically important that we don't forget about provisions that both \ncombat poverty and assist those who fall in the lower income brackets.\n  Last month, the Nation added over 150,000 jobs, which is strong \nevidence that we are slowly recovering from the devastating impacts of \nthe recent recession. But we are certainly not out of the woods yet, \nand the Senate must continue to pass legislation that will spur \neconomic growth as well as to focus on ways we can extend certain tax \nprovisions that are set to expire this year.\n  The debate, unfortunately, has largely focused only on whether to \nextend the current income tax rates. I am 100 percent in favor of \nextending income tax rates for middle and lower income tax brackets. \nNow is not the time to raise taxes on those middle-income families who \nare still recovering from the recession. Plus, the more money we put in \nthe pockets of those middle-income families means more money is being \npumped into the economy through the purchase of goods and services. \nThat is for sure, and I think we will even have consensus on that point \nalone.\n  Even as our recovery is slow, there have been a number of bright \nspots. One bright spot in the recovery is the rate of private sector \nhiring. In fact, according to the figures released by the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics, more private sector jobs have been created in 2010 \nwhen compared to the entire 8 years under President Bush. Private \nsector jobs decreased by 673,000 in the 8 years of President Bush's \nPresidency--a decrease of 673,000 private sector jobs. The increase I \nspeak of occurred within this calendar year of 2010--an increase of \n874,000 private sector jobs in 2010, and the year, of course, is not \nover yet.\n  The tax cuts for upper income folks implemented by President Bush had \nlimited impact on jobs in those years, and the income tax breaks for \nupper income folks added hundreds of billions to our deficit. However, \ndue to the current condition of the economy and to take every step \nnecessary that we must take to continue the recovery, I believe it is \nimperative that we maintain certainty. That is what economists have \ntalked to many of us about--to take steps not just to further economic \ngrowth and to continue to push forward the recovery but to do that in a \nway that creates some measure of certainty. Whether a small business \nowner--hundreds and hundreds of thousands across the country--or a \nlarge company, uncertainty and change often tend to make businesses \nless willing to expand and less willing to hire. Over the last few \nmonths, many of our colleagues in the Senate and I have spoken to both \nbusiness owners and economists to get their views on how we should \nhandle the expiring tax provisions. What I learned, among several \nlessons from these experts, is that certainty and consistency are \nneeded when the economy is still in a fragile condition.\n  So I will have more to say as the debate continues about tax cuts, \nbut during these discussions about the income tax cuts and what we \nshould do between now and the end of the year, two important provisions \nhave been barely mentioned: the child tax credit and the marriage \npenalty under the so-called earned-income tax credit. Both provisions \nprovide necessary tax relief for those in the lower income brackets, \nand both provisions are necessary to help working families barely \ngetting by for their children during this recession, at a time when \npoverty levels, unfortunately, are increasing. At this time, this \nSenate must act to provide tax relief to those who are in desperate \nneed of assistance while they recover from the effects of the \nrecession.\n  First, the child tax credit. This provides tax relief to working \nfamilies with children of up to $1,000 per child. The tax credit was \nfirst enacted in 1997 and was expanded last year in the Recovery Act to \nincrease the number of families eligible to receive the credit. As a \nresult of this expansion of the child tax credit, millions of \npreviously ineligible families received critical relief during these \ntough economic times.\n  These expanded tax cuts will expire if they are not extended by the \nend of the year. Here are the numbers from the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities: 7.6 million children will lose their child tax \ncredit if we don't continue it. An additional 10.5 million children \nwill see those credits reduced or the credits their families receive \nreduced. In Pennsylvania, half a million children will lose that \ncredit.\n  To put this in perspective, if you have a family with two children \nand earning minimum wage, that family\n\n[[Page S8271]]\n\nwould see its child tax credit reduced by $825. That is the equivalent \nof almost 3 weeks of pretax wages for a minimum wage worker--$825--\nwhich would have an adverse impact even on a middle-income family, but \nto say that about a family earning the minimum wage I think speaks \nvolumes about the impact of not extending the child tax credit. That \nwould be a horrific result for a minimum wage-earning family.\n  This vital tax relief is necessary to help families struggling to \nprovide their children with basic essentials. If that argument is not \nconvincing enough for folks in the Senate as a reason to extend it, \nconsider that the money that child tax credit results in will be spent \nimmediately and go right back into local economies. It is the same \nargument we have made on unemployment insurance--that it has an impact \non the overall economy.\n  The child tax credit is not the only poverty-fighting tax provision \nthat is in jeopardy of being reversed. Enhancements to the earned-\nincome tax credit are also set to expire. The so-called EITC--the \nearned-income tax credit--encourages and rewards work by providing a \nrefundable credit for working people against their payroll and income \ntaxes. Millions of working families with incomes of up to $48,000 are \neligible for the Federal earned-income tax credit.\n  The Recovery Act we passed in 2009 reduced the so-called marriage \npenalty in the earned-income tax credit by increasing the income level \nat which it phases out for married couples. If this expanded tax relief \nis not extended, 6 million workers will see their earned-income tax \ncredit reduced and 11 million children will be affected. So children \nget harmed by both. They get harmed by the failure to extend the \nearned-income tax credit and the failure to extend the child tax \ncredit.\n\n  So while the debate has been focused on the extension of tax rates on \nincome, the Senate must not overlook sound tax policy that both fights \npoverty and spurs economic growth. So I would encourage all Members of \nthe Senate to push for an extension of the provisions that expand \neligibility for the child tax credit as well as the earned-income tax \ncredit.\n  Finally, in addition to those tax provisions, we must not forget that \ntoday, November 30, 2010, is the day that federally funded unemployment \ninsurance programs will expire. I encourage other Members of the Senate \nto not block legislation that will reauthorize unemployment insurance \nprograms through the end of 2011--in other words, unemployment \ninsurance to help the newly unemployed still suffering through and \nfighting through this recession.\n  If folks in the Senate block this legislation today--an extension of \nunemployment insurance--if they block it, I hope they will have an \nanswer for the following question or two: What is your strategy to help \nthese folks get through this time when they have lost a job through no \nfault of their own? What are you going to do? What action are you going \nto take to try to help them?\n  That is one question. If you don't have an answer to that question, \nyou should also have to answer this question: What are you doing \naffirmatively to put in place strategies to create jobs? Are you just \ntalking about job creation, are you just talking about helping people, \nor are you going to take action to extend unemployment insurance or \nhave something else that will help those who are going through this \ndifficult period in their lives--many families who never dreamed they \nwould be in this position--and are you going to do something to help \nthe overall economy to grow and to continue the recovery? Because \nunemployment insurance does both. It helps the vulnerable get through \nthis recession. It is the right thing to do. It also has a substantial, \nimmeasurable impact on economic growth. All the studies show that. It \nis irrefutable that it is probably the best thing we can do to create \njobs and to continue the recovery--pass a reauthorization of \nunemployment insurance.\n  So I encourage my colleagues to not block, but if they block, they \nneed to have an answer to those basic questions.\n  In Pennsylvania, the unemployment rate now is 8.8 percent. Thank \ngoodness it fell below 9, but 8.8 percent in our State means 560,000 \npeople out of work. In the summer, it went as high as 592,000, so it \nwas approaching 600,000. We have approximately 560,000 unemployed \nPennsylvanians right now. We have to have an answer for those folks. We \ncan't just say: Well, it got a little difficult in Washington, or put \nsome other institutional or policy argument out there without having an \nanswer or an alternative for those who are unemployed.\n  As have many of the Members of the Senate, I have discussed the \nimpact of the expiration of unemployment insurance with folks in \nPennsylvania and others who will be suffering through this. In the \ncourse of those discussions, we have had a chance to review what the \nimpact would be on the economy as well as on Americans who have lost \ntheir jobs through no fault of their own.\n  There is one group we often don't mention. We talk about \nunemployment, jobless Americans and the economy. We often don't talk \nabout the adverse impact specifically on children. Mr. President, 1 in \n10 Pennsylvania children has an unemployed parent, and that is true \nacross the country--roughly 1 in 10 in many States.\n  That translates to 265,000 children under the age of 18 in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania who are directly impacted by \nunemployment--265,300 children who are affected just by unemployment. \nSo as we address ways to improve the economic outlook in our country \nand discuss the tax provisions, we must recognize the impact the \neconomy has on our children.\n  I will end with a line from the Scriptures that says that ``a \nfaithful friend is a sturdy shelter.'' It goes on to talk about how \nimportant having a faithful friend in life is. There are a lot of \nfolks, politicians especially, who talk nonstop about helping children \nand the importance of doing that and the priority placed on our \nchildren and the priority to protect our children from harm and to help \nthem especially in a recession. You have to do more than talk.\n  If you consider yourself a friend of children, you would support an \nextension of the child tax credit. You would support other provisions, \nsuch as unemployment insurance, that help families such as those \nfamilies who have 265,000 children who are affected by unemployment in \nPennsylvania. If you are going to say you are a faithful friend and \nwant to be a sturdy shelter for children, what are you going to do \nabout it?\n  The question we must ask ourselves, among many, is: Will the Senate \nbe a faithful friend to children, not just by talk and rhetoric but by \nactions, taking steps to help children get through this recession, \nhelping their families and also spur and continue economic growth and \nrecovery?\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nTennessee is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8271-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8271-S8273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMENDING RETIRING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 16 Senators will retire this year. \nThere is also a pretty big turnover in this body, but that is a lot of \nSenators at once. We are losing an enormous amount of talent, but, of \ncourse, we are gaining a lot of talent with the new Senators.\n  I wish to show my respect for those who have served, which I will do \nin a summary fashion because we are talking about 16 individuals with \nvery complex and distinguished backgrounds.\n  One might ask, what are the characteristics of a Senator? There are a \nlot of different answers to that, depending on your background and \nattitude toward politics and government, I suppose. I have always \nthought that one characteristic of almost every Member of the Senate is \nthat he or she probably was a first grader sitting in the front row, \nhand in the air waiting to be recognized. This is an eager bunch or you \nwould not have gotten here.\n  Second, it is a group of risk-takers. Most people who end up in the \nSenate get here because a lot of other people who wanted to be Senators \nwere standing around waiting for the right time to run. A lot of people \nwho were elected to the Senate seemed to have no chance of winning at \nthe time they decided to run, but the voters decided differently, and \nhere they are.\n  A third characteristic of Senators is that we are almost all \nprofessional and\n\n[[Page S8272]]\n\ncongenial. That is a big help. It is almost a requirement in an \norganization of 100 individuals who spend almost all their time with \none another, who serve in a body that operates by unanimous consent, \nwhen just one Senator can bring the whole place to a halt, and whose \njob basically is to argue about some of the most difficult issues that \nface the American people. So it helps that almost every Member of the \nSenate is an especially congenial person.\n  Back in Tennessee, people often say to me it must be rough being in \nthat job. They are awfully mean up there. The truth is, I don't know of \na more congenial group than the Members of the Senate. We begin the day \nin the gym. The next thing you know we are at a Prayer Breakfast, and \nthen we are at a committee hearing. Then we are on the floor voting, \nand then we have lunch. It goes through the day until 7 or 8 o'clock, \nor sometimes later. We live together and we get along very well. We \nknow and respect each other.\n  Not long ago, the Presiding Officer and I were having dinner together \nwith our wives. We were lamenting the loss of families who know one \nanother, the way it happened when his father was serving in Congress \nand when I first came to the Senate to work for Senator Baker. And \nthat's true. We've lost some of that. Still, there is an enormous \namount of affection and goodwill here. You don't always get to be very \nclose friends in this job, but you get to be very good acquaintances, \nand you learn to respect people for their strengths.\n  Senator Domenici said, when he left, that we don't do a very good job \nof saying goodbye here. That is true. As one part of saying goodbye, I \nwish to say at least one good thing about each one of the 16 retiring \nSenators. Much more could be said about each, of course. Mostly, I am \ngoing in alphabetical order.\n  First is Senator Bob Bennett of Utah. I have known him the longest. \nWe served together in the Nixon administration. I was in the White \nHouse working with Bryce Harlow, and he was in the Department of \nTransportation. That was in 1969 and 1970. What I will remember about \nBob Bennett--and most Senators will remember this about his legacy--are \nhis careful expositions of economic issues. He has a background as an \nentrepreneur and businessman. He served with distinction on the Joint \nEconomic Committee. His expertise in helping us better understand the \neconomy has been valuable.\n  Senator Evan Bayh is one of four Governors leaving the Senate. I am \none who thinks the more Governors, the better. That is a somewhat \nparochial attitude on my part. But Governors have gotten results and \nare used to working across party lines. Governor Bayh served two terms \nas a Senator. Still young, he obviously has a long career ahead of him. \nWhatever direction he chooses to go in, what I will remember most about \nEvan Bayh is the civility and bipartisanship he has shown on numerous \noccasions--and his courtesy to me as an individual Senator.\n  Senator Kit Bond, another Governor. He and I once served as law \nclerks on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for two judges who helped \nintegrate the South, Judges Tuttle and Wisdom. Senator Bond has a great \nmany things that could be said about him. But what most of us admire \ngreatly about his time here is his devotion to our intelligence \ncommunity and national security, as vice chairman of our Intelligence \nCommittee, making sure our intelligence agencies have the tools they \nneed to prevent terrorist attacks on America.\n  Senator Sam Brownback is going the other way, from Senator to \nGovernor of Kansas. During the health care debate, I often said that \neverybody who voted for the health care law ought to be sentenced to \nserve as Governor for two terms and try to implement it. Well, Senator \nBrownback voted against the health care law, but he's going home and \nwill have the opportunity to ``enjoy'' all those unfunded mandates on \nMedicaid and see how Kansas deals with it. What we'll miss about Sam \nBrownback, in addition to his extraordinary kindness, is his devotion \nto human rights, including giving voice to the oppressed people in \nNorth Korea and being an outspoken critic of the genocide in Darfur.\n  Senator Jim Bunning. Everybody knows about him and baseball. Nobody \nwould want to be a batter when he is throwing pitches. We understand he \nis the only person to strike out Ted Williams three times in one game. \nBut what not as many people know about him is that Jim Bunning has been \na persistent leader in fighting for sick nuclear workers who served our \ncountry during the fifties and sixties and were sick because of their \nwork in handling nuclear weapons. So Jim Bunning deserves the thanks of \nall the families of the sick nuclear workers in America for his service \nhere.\n  Senator Chris Dodd. Children and families are his hallmark and \nlegacy. He has been here a long time--five terms. But I have felt \nprivileged to work with him on the Subcommittee on Children and \nFamilies. One thing we've focused on together is premature births, but \nhe's also worked on a whole variety of other legislation. We will miss \nhis congeniality, his good humor, and his devotion to the Senate as an \ninstitution, making sure it stays unique as a place where we have \nunlimited debate and unlimited amendments, so the voices of the \nAmerican people can be heard.\n\n  Senator Byron Dorgan. I once heard the Chaplain say there is no \nbetter storyteller in the Senate than Senator Dorgan. He didn't mean \nmaking up stories. He said he was good at taking what he figured was \nthe truth and explaining it in ways the rest of us could understand. I \nhave enjoyed working with him on legislation that would make it easier \nto introduce electric cars and trucks in our country and reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Senator Russ Feingold will be remembered for his strong stands--\nsometimes solitary stands--such as when he voted against the PATRIOT \nAct and went to work early on campaign finance. I thank him for our \nwork together on the Africa subcommittee, on which he has served during \nhis whole time here.\n  There is no better Senator than Judd Gregg on either side of the \naisle. One indication of that is that the last three leaders of \nRepublicans in the Senate have asked him to sit in on leadership \nmeetings to get his wisdom and advice. He doesn't say too much, but \nwhat he says we all pay attention to. He has been the voice of our \nparty and we believe the voice of Americans who are concerned about \nfiscal responsibility, about spending, and too much debt.\n  Senator Blanche Lincoln has been a pioneer throughout her career, as \na staff member and a Congresswoman, and later as a Senator occupying \nSenator Hattie Caraway's desk, who was the first woman to be elected to \nthe Senate. Blanche Lincoln was the youngest woman ever to be elected \nto the Senate and left her mark with the passage of the 2008 farm bill.\n  Arlen Specter from Pennsylvania. The word to describe him is \n``courage.'' The other word is ``survivor.'' And they both go together. \nArlen has had a distinguished career from his youngest days. He was a \nmember of the Warren Commission, investigating President Kennedy's \nassassination. In the Senate, his work has spanned the entire mark. One \nof the things I appreciate most about Senator and Mrs. Specter is their \nwork on Constitution Hall in Philadelphia, which is such an example of \nliving history.\n  Senator George Voinovich has been a mayor and a Governor and a \nSenator, a strong voice in concerns of federalism. Federal workers have \nGeorge to thank for years of attention to issues involving Federal \nemployees that most of us were too busy to pay as much attention to.\n  There have been four Members appointed to the Senate who are \nretiring, and that is quite a number.\n  Senator Ted Kaufman of Delaware was a great teacher and a longtime \nSenate staffer before serving in the Senate himself.\n  Senator George LeMieux of Florida made his focus balancing the budget \nand controlling the debt. We have not heard the last of George Lemieux, \nI am sure, in politics.\n  Senator Roland Burris of Illinois was a State comptroller and \nattorney general. He is his own man, and capped off a long career in \npublic service by serving here.\n  Senator Carte Goodwin, the youngest Senator who replaced the oldest \nin Senator Byrd. He was here only a few months, but we've enjoyed \nhaving him.\n\n[[Page S8273]]\n\n  It has been my privilege to serve with these 16 Senators. We thank \nthem for their service to our country. They have had a chance to serve \nin what we regard as the world's greatest deliberative body; it is a \nspecial institution. We will miss their leadership, and we hope they \nwill stay in touch with us because they are not just retiring Senators, \nthey are all our friends.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is a war going on in this country, \nand I am not referring to the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan. I am talking \nabout a war being waged by some of the wealthiest and most powerful \npeople in this country against the working families of the United \nStates of America, against the disappearing and shrinking middle class \nof our country.\n  The reality is, many of the Nation's billionaires are on the warpath. \nThey want more, more, more. Their greed has no end, and apparently \nthere is very little concern for our country or for the people of this \ncountry if it gets in the way of the accumulation of more and more \nwealth and more and more power.\n  Mr. President, in the year 2007, the top 1 percent of all income \nearners in the United States made 23\\1/2\\ percent of all income. The \ntop 1 percent earned 23\\1/2\\ percent of all income--more than the \nentire bottom 50 percent. That is apparently not enough. The percentage \nof income going to the top 1 percent has nearly tripled since the \n1970s. In the mid-1970s, the top 1 percent earned about 8 percent of \nall income. In the 1980s, that figure jumped to 14 percent. In the late \n1990s, that 1 percent earned about 19 percent. And today, as the middle \nclass collapses, the top 1 percent earns 23\\1/2\\ percent of all \nincome--more than the bottom 50 percent. Today, if you can believe it, \nthe top one-tenth of 1 percent earns about 12 cents of every dollar \nearned in America.\n  We talk about a lot of things on the floor of the Senate, but somehow \nwe forget to talk about the reality of who is winning in this economy \nand who is losing. It is very clear to anyone who spends 2 minutes \nstudying the issue that the people on top are doing extraordinarily \nwell at the same time as the middle class is collapsing and poverty is \nincreasing. Many people out there are angry, and they are wondering \nwhat is happening to their own income, to their lives, to the lives of \ntheir kids.\n  If you can believe this, since between 1980 and 2005, 80 percent of \nall new income created in this country went to the top 1 percent--80 \npercent of all new income. That is why people are wondering and asking: \nWhat is going on in my life? How come I am working longer hours for \nlower wages? How come I am worrying about whether my kids will have as \ngood a standard of living as I had? From 1980 until 2005, 80 percent of \nall income went to the top 1 percent.\n  Today, the Wall Street executives--the crooks on Wall Street whose \nactions resulted in the severe recession we are in right now; the \npeople whose illegal, reckless actions have resulted in millions of \nAmericans losing their jobs, their homes, their savings--guess what. \nAfter we bailed them out, those CEOs today are now earning more money \nthan they did before the bailout. And while the middle class of this \ncountry collapses and the rich become much richer, the United States \nnow has by far the most unequal distribution of income and wealth of \nany major country on Earth.\n  Mr. President, when we were in school, we used to read the textbooks \nwhich talked about the banana republics in Latin America. We used to \nread the books about countries in which a handful of people owned and \ncontrolled most of the wealth of those countries. Well, guess what. \nThat is exactly what is happening in the United States today. And \napparently the only concern of some of the wealthiest people in this \ncountry is more and more wealth and more and more power--not all of \nthem, by the way. Not all of them. There are many wealthy people in \nthis country who understand and are proud to be Americans, who \nunderstand that one of the things that is important is that all of us \ndo well. And this is an issue--greed is an issue--we have to deal with.\n  In the midst of all of this growing income and wealth inequality in \nthis country, we are now faced with the issue of what we do with the \nBush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. And if you can believe it, we have \npeople here--many of my Republican colleagues--who tell us: Oh, I am so \nconcerned about our recordbreaking deficit. I am terribly concerned \nabout a $13.7 trillion national debt. I am terribly concerned about the \ndebt we are going to be leaving to our kids and our grandchildren. But \nwait a minute. It is very important that we give, over a 10-year \nperiod, $700 billion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent. Oh yeah, we \nare concerned about the debt, we are concerned about the deficit, but \nwe are more concerned that millionaires--people who earn at least $1 \nmillion a year or more--get, on average, $100,000 a year in tax breaks. \nSo we have a $13.7 trillion national debt, and growing, we have growing \nincome inequality--the top 1 percent earning more income than the \nbottom 50 percent--but the highest priority of many of my Republican \ncolleagues is to make sure millionaires and billionaires get more tax \nbreaks. I think that is absurd.\n  But it is not only income tax rates that we are dealing with; it is \nthe estate tax as well. And let's be clear. While some of my friends \nwant to eliminate completely the estate tax--which has been in \nexistence in this country since 1916--every nickel of all of those \nbenefits will go to the top three-tenths of 1 percent. If we did as \nsome of my friends would like--eliminate the estate tax completely--it \nwould cost us $1 trillion in revenue over a 10-year period, with all of \nthe benefits going to the top three-tenths of 1 percent.\n  So I am sure that in a little while my friends will come to the floor \nand say: We are very concerned about the deficit, we are very concerned \nabout the national debt, but do you know what we are more concerned \nabout? Giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country.\n  Mr. President, the tax issue is just one part of what some of our \nwealthy friends want to see happen in this country. The reality is that \nmany of these folks want to bring the United States back to where we \nwere in the 1920s, and they want to do their best to eliminate all \ntraces of social legislation which working families fought tooth and \nnail to develop to bring a modicum of stability and security to their \nlives.\n  There are people out there--not all, but there are some--who want to \nprivatize or completely eliminate Social Security. They want to \nprivatize or cut back substantially on Medicare. Yes, if you are 75 \nyears of age and you have no money, good luck to you getting your \nhealth insurance at an affordable cost from a private insurance \ncompany. I am just sure there are all kinds of private insurance \ncompanies out there just delighted to take care of low-income seniors \nwho are struggling with cancer or another disease.\n  Furthermore, there are corporate leaders out there, and many Members \nof Congress, who not only want to continue but they want to expand our \ndisastrous trade policies. My wife and I went shopping the other day--\nstarted our Christmas shopping--and we looked and we looked, and \nvirtually every consumer product that was out there in the stores was \nChina, China, and China. We seem to be a country in which we have a \n51st State named China which is producing virtually all of the products \nwe as Americans consume.\n  Our trade policy has resulted in the loss of millions of good-paying \njobs as large corporations and CEOs have said: Why do I want to \nreinvest in America when I can go to countries where people are paid 50 \ncents, 75 cents an hour? That is what I am going to do; to heck with \nthe working people of this country. So not only are we saddled with \nthis disastrous trade policy, but there are people who actually want to \nexpand it.\n  One of the things we are going to see is while we struggle with a \nrecordbreaking deficit and a large national debt--caused by the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan, caused by tax breaks for the wealthy, caused by \nan unpaid-for\n\n[[Page S8274]]\n\nMedicare Part D prescription drug program, caused by the Wall Street \nbailout driving up the deficit, driving up the national debt--some \npeople will say: Oh my goodness, we have all those expenses, and then \nwe have to give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, but we \nwant to balance the budget. Gee, how are we going to do that?\n  Obviously, we know how they are going to do that. They are going to \ncut back on health care, they are going to cut back on education, they \nare going to cut back on child care, and they are going to cut back on \nPell programs. We just don't have enough money for working families and \nnannies. We are going to cut back on food stamps. We are surely not \ngoing to expand unemployment compensation. We have a higher priority, \nMr. President: We have got to, got to, got to give tax breaks to \nmillionaires. I mean, that is what this place is all about, isn't it? \nThey fund the campaigns, so they get what is due them.\n  Amazingly enough, we have the CEOs on Wall Street and the large \nfinancial institutions that want to rescind or slow down many of the \nprovisions--the very modest provisions--in the financial reform bill. I \nvoted for the financial reform bill, but I will tell you clearly that \nit did not go anywhere near far enough, but it went too far for our \nWall Street friends and their lobbyists, who are all over here. And for \nthe hundreds of millions of dollars Wall Street spends on this place, \nthey want to rescind, slow down some of the reforms there.\n  These people want to cut back on the powers of the EPA and the \nDepartment of Energy so that ExxonMobil can remain the most profitable \ncorporation in world history while oil and coal companies continue to \npollute our air and our water. Last year, ExxonMobil made $19 billion \nin profit. Guess what. They paid zero in taxes. They got a $156 million \nrefund from the IRS. I guess that is not good enough. We have to give \nthe oil companies even more tax breaks.\n  So I think that is where we are. We have to own up to it. There is a \nwar going on. The middle class is struggling for existence, and they \nare taking on some of the wealthiest and most powerful forces in the \nworld whose greed has no end. And if we don't begin to stand together \nand start representing those families, there will not be a middle class \nin this country.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8274-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8274-S8275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING SENATOR BOB BENNETT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the retirement \nand the departure of my great friend, Bob Bennett. Senator Bennett and \nI have jointly represented the State of Utah for many years. We are \nclose. During that time, we have worked together as partners, \ncollaborators, but most of all as good friends. Bob's presence in the \nSenate is going to be sorely missed.\n  Senator Bennett is a lot of things. He is honest, he is thoughtful, \nhe is knowledgeable. But more than anything else, Senator Bennett is a \nfighter for the people of Utah. Bob has served with unwavering devotion \nto our State, its people, and its interests. Throughout his 18 years in \nthe Senate, the State of Utah has been foremost in Bob's thoughts, and \nI don't believe he has made a single decision he didn't believe was in \nthe best interests of our State and of our Nation.\n  Senator Bennett is the son of Frances and Wallace F. Bennett. Wallace \nF. Bennett, we should all remember, was also a great U.S. Senator from \nUtah who served four terms between 1951 and 1974. I think that is \naccurate. Bob is also the grandson of Heber J. Grant, the seventh \nPresident of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n  After attending East High School in Salt Like City, Bob graduated \nfrom the University of Utah, where he was elected the student body \npresident and obtained a degree in political science in 1959. His first \npolitical job was managing his father's 1962 successful reelection \ncampaign. Bob then spent several years working as a Mormon chaplain in \nthe Utah Army National Guard before becoming a chief congressional \nliaison at the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n  After his time at the Transportation Department, Senator Bennett \nmoved on to a successful career in public relations. For over a decade, \nhe presided over some of the most successful and high-profile public \nrelations organizations in the country. He became well known for his \nhard work, his leadership ability, and his entrepreneurial prowess. \nThis was solidified in 1984 when Bob was named the CEO of the Franklin \nInternational Institute, which is now known as Franklin Covey. Franklin \nCovey is now one of the premier personal and organizational \neffectiveness firms in the world. The products and services provided by \nthe company impact literally millions of people every year.\n\n  But when Bob joined the company they had only four employees. During \nhis tenure that number grew to over 1,000. By the time he left to run \nfor the Senate, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. \nIt was at that time an already thriving corporation, a world leader in \nits industry, thanks in no small part to Bob's leadership. For his \nefforts, Bob was named Inc. Magazine's Entrepreneur of the Year for the \nRocky Mountain region.\n  Bob was elected to the Senate in 1992 after a hotly contested \nRepublican primary and a hard-fought general election. His father--once \nagain, the great Senator Wallace F. Bennett--lived just long enough to \nsee his son win an election and serve in the Senate for almost a full \nyear. I know that must have been a great source of pride for the senior \nSenator Bennett and his family.\n  Over his 18 years in the Senate, Bob has continued to demonstrate \nsound judgment and strong leadership. Republican Senators have \nconsidered him a trusted resource when it comes to strategy and policy. \nHe has been a consistent resource for those who seek thoughtful answers \nto difficult political questions. For these reasons, among others, Bob \nhas served on the leadership teams of our current minority leader, \nSenator McConnell, as well as his predecessor, Senator Bill Frist.\n  While he is more well known for his quiet, contemplative demeanor, \nSenator Bennett has always been an outstanding orator. He comes often \nto the floor to discuss various issues at length, rarely reading from \nnotes and almost never skipping a beat. His contributions to our \ndebates in the Senate have always been very valuable, and I think \npeople on both sides of the aisle will acknowledge that and have \nappreciated the type of advocacy he has brought to the floor of the \nSenate--always courteous, always well thought out, always reasonable, \nand always, in my opinion, right.\n  As I mentioned before, I know few Senators who can match Senator \nBennett's commitment to the people he represents. Every single person \nin the State of Utah has benefited from the work of Senator Bennett. \nOne cannot ride on a train or drive on a freeway in Utah or avail \noneself of so many other assets and attributes in Utah without seeing \nthe results of Senator Bennett's service in the Senate.\n  Our State has seen a lot of growth in recent years due to the \nexpansion of our population and the fact that more and more companies \nhave recognized that Utah is a great place to do business. Utah's \ninfrastructure has for the most part been able to keep pace with the \nrapid growth, thanks in large measure to the work of Senator Bennett.\n  I will miss working with Senator Bennett to help the people of our \nState, but I will miss him more as a friend. Bob and his wonderful wife \nJoyce--and she has been a tremendous companion to him, tremendous \nhelpmate to him over these years--have been married for 48 years. They \nhave 6 children and 20 grandchildren. I know every one of them is proud \nof the great service Bob has rendered to his country and the Senate, \nand they should be. I too am so pleased and proud of my friend, Senator \nBennett, and I am certain that Bob will be successful in any endeavor \nhe chooses in the future upon leaving the Senate.\n  Bob Bennett is a wise counselor. He is a truly honest man. He cares \nnot only for the people he represented but everybody in this country \nand many people throughout the world.\n  He lives his religious beliefs. Other than family, I can't compliment \nanybody more than that. He lives his religion. He is exemplary. He is \none of the most thoughtful people I have ever known. I value his \nfriendship and I\n\n[[Page S8275]]\n\nvalue his advice and I have valued it over these years that we have \nserved together. He has always been a serious and productive leader who \nalso has a tremendously great sense of humor. After all is said and \ndone, he is a great father, grandfather, husband, and friend--just to \nmention a few.\n  Bob will be successful in whatever he chooses to do. He is a good \nman. I personally will miss him. I think everybody in the Senate will \nmiss him, and I believe it is safe to say everybody in Utah will miss \nhim as well--some more than others. Nevertheless, if they look at his \nrecord and they look at the things he has done for our State, for our \npeople, they are going to thank God that Bob Bennett was a Senator for \n18 solid years. I personally thank the Father in Heaven for having him \nhere as a partner to me, as a friend, and as somebody on whom I could \nrely and with whom I could counsel on some of these very earthshakingly \nimportant matters that come before our Senate.\n  I have such a great opinion of Bob Bennett, I don't think even he has \nknown--maybe not until today--how great that opinion has been. I think \nthe world of him. I love him as a human being, and I wish him the very \nbest, he and his family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am embarrassed and humbled and \ngratified by the comments of my senior colleague, Senator Hatch. My \nwife has said, by virtue of our retirement from the Senate: It is a \nlittle like going to your own funeral. You are hearing all of the \neulogies but you are still alive.\n  We, indeed, are planning a significant life and activity after the \nSenate. I will have more to say about that at some other time. But I \nwant to express my gratitude to Senator Hatch for the kind words he has \nspoken, but more importantly for the relationship we have developed in \nthe time we have served together.\n  We did not know each other very well prior to my running for the \nSenate. He was a Senator off in Washington; I was a businessman in \nUtah. We had little occasion to see our paths cross and become \nacquainted.\n  One of the things I will treasure the most out of my experiences in \nthe Senate has been the opportunity to come to know Orrin as a friend, \nas a dedicated legislator, and a role model and mentor. He has guided \nme many times when I needed some guidance. We have disagreed sometimes \nwhen that was appropriate given our particular positions on an issue or \ntwo, but always I have been able to look to Orrin Hatch as a mentor, a \nfriend, someone upon whom I could depend.\n  In the recent election when there were those who were suggesting that \nmaybe Orrin should distance himself from me for his own political \nbenefit, I am gratified by the fact that he not only refused to do that \nbut until the very end did everything he could throughout the State to \nsee to it that I was triumphant in that election.\n  It turned out I was not, as far as the convention is concerned, but \nelections and conventions are not the be-all-and-end-all of life. I \nwill go on to other activities, but I will hang onto my friendship with \nOrrin Hatch and continue my respect and love for him in the years to \ncome.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8275-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8275-S8277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NEW START TREATY\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak once again about \nthe New START treaty. Today I will talk about the New START treaty and \nthe maintenance of a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent. \nThat means maintaining and sustaining the nuclear weapons stockpile and \ndelivery platforms; modernizing the buildings and equipment in the \nnuclear weapons complex; and supporting the experts and scientists who \nare involved in it.\n  I would like to preface my remarks by underlining the urgency for the \nSenate to ratify the treaty. How can it be that we do not have a treaty \nwith Russia in place, along with its verification regime 360 days after \nthe expiration of the original START treaty? That is more than 6 months \nafter the administration submitted the treaty to the Senate.\n  The verification regime will provide crucial insight into Russian \nforces, insight that is degrading over time without the treaty in \nplace. We need to ratify this treaty now.\n  For decades, our relations with the Soviet Union, and now with \nRussia, have been stabilized and made more predictable and cooperative \nthrough arms control agreements. How can it be that now, when Russia is \nno longer our enemy and yet not our ally, my friends across the aisle \nare refusing to move forward on ratifying a modest treaty that is \ncritical for our national security?\n  If consideration of the treaty is delayed or blocked, it will make \ncooperation with Russia on national security interests much more \ndifficult, if not impossible. Do you seriously believe that, if you \nblock or reject the treaty, we will see Russia's continued cooperation \nwith international sanctions on Iran? Are you not concerned that Russia \nwill reconsider its prohibition on the sale of the S-300 anti-air \ndefense missile systems to Iran, as it did in September?\n  And why put the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program at \nrisk? Senator Lugar himself has warned that failure to ratify the \ntreaty could imperil that enormously successful program in securing \nloose nukes.\n  If this modest treaty is blocked by the minority, I do not believe my \nfriends on the other side will be pleased with the consequences.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to see \nnegotiations with Russia on reductions in tactical nuclear weapons. I \nagree. That is going to be a difficult task under any circumstances. \nBut as our lead negotiator Rose Gottemoeller said recently, there is \nzero chance of getting to the negotiating table with the Russians on \ntactical nuclear weapons unless we get this treaty ratified and entered \ninto force.\n  It is also important to note that my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have been delaying consideration of the treaty for some time. \nBack in August, Senator McConnell said, ``The only way this treaty gets \nin trouble is if it's rushed.'' And Senator Kyl told reporters that \nsince it could be hard to get everything done before the November \nelection, the Senate might need a lameduck session to vote on New \nSTART.\n  The administration and Chairman Kerry deferred to those Republicans, \nbut now those same colleagues are saying we can not do it during the \nlameduck session. To them, I say, if not now, when? If we defer and \ndelay further, we risk a collapse in relations with Russia, including \nthe loss of their continued cooperation on the all-important Iran \nissue.\n  Now, the remaining major objection to ratification that Republicans \nhave raised is not a feature of the treaty itself, but maintenance and \nmodernization of our nuclear arsenal and complex.\n  There is bipartisan agreement that as our nuclear arsenal gets \nsmaller through arms control agreements, ensuring that it remains safe, \nsecure, and effective takes on added importance. From my perspective \nthat is the fundamental justification for nuclear modernization. And I \nagree with Senator Kyl, who emphasized in a floor statement, and I \nquote, the ``direct link between nuclear force reductions and \nmodernization of the U.S. nuclear weapons complex.'' Likewise, Senator \nMcCain has noted that, ``as we move to reduce the size of our nuclear \nstockpile, this modernization effort becomes all the more important.''\n  The Obama administration has made a serious commitment to nuclear \nmodernization, and they have paired it with arms control. We have an \nextensive set of programs in place to retain confidence in the \nstockpile without testing. We are extending the life of our current \nnuclear delivery vehicles and studying, planning, and beginning\n\n[[Page S8276]]\n\nthe next generation. And we are continuing to develop plans for major \nimprovements in the complex of facilities that support the nuclear \nenterprise.\n  I support the administration's approach to modernization tethered to \narms control. Now I have to admit, in these tough economic times, I do \nhave concerns with spending $85 billion on an enormous nuclear complex, \nthat is a staggering amount of money. Without a commitment to arms \ncontrol and nonproliferation, it is impossible to justify spending that \nmuch money. This is the 21st century, not the cold war, and our needs \nare different.\n  That is why I will not support this massive investment in \nmodernization without an equal commitment to arms control and \nnonproliferation. That is why earlier this year I joined several \ncolleagues in writing to the Budget Committee in support of the \nadministration's massive Fiscal Year 2011 request for the National \nNuclear Safety Administration, or NNSA.\n  I will continue to fight for nuclear modernization paired with arms \ncontrol. But they must be paired. Our national security requires it. \nAnd political reality requires it.\n  That is what the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of \nthe United States, better known as the Perry-Schlesinger Commission, \nmade clear. The Commission's report has been the main touchstone on all \nsides of the debate over New START.\n  The December 15, 2009 letter to the President from 41 of my \ncolleagues, including all the members of the minority, relies heavily \non the Commission's recommendations in spelling out its requirements \nfor the treaty and modernization. Senator McCain's September 14 letter \nto the Foreign Relations Committee relies on the Commission's \nperspective on the modernization of the nuclear complex. Senator Kyl's \nMay 24, 2010, floor speech on New START also makes prominent reference \nto and endorses the Commission's report.\n  Here is the first page of the report's Executive Summary:\n\n       ``While deterrence plays an essential role in reducing \n     nuclear dangers, it is not the only means for doing so, and \n     accordingly the United States must seek additional \n     cooperative measures of a political kind, including for \n     example arms control and nonproliferation. This is a time \n     when these approaches can be renewed and reenergized.''\n\n  Not only deterrence, but also arms control and nonproliferation. We \nmust be committed to both together. That is why the Commission goes on \nto say, ``These components of strategy must be integrated into a \ncomprehensive approach.''\n  It is just such a comprehensive approach that the administration has \ntaken. In its very first recommendation, the Commission warns of the \nimportance of maintaining both components of strategy:\n\n       The United States should continue to pursue an approach to \n     reducing nuclear dangers that balances deterrence, arms \n     control, and nonproliferation. Singular emphasis on one or \n     another element would reduce the nuclear security of the \n     United States and its allies.''\n\n  I submit that the administration and those of us who have pushed \nnuclear modernization in good faith, to support deterrence and \nnonproliferation and arms control, are following this recommendation. \nThose who have held the New START treaty hostage to ungrounded \ncomplaints about modernization and ever-changing demands are not.\n  I believe many of my colleagues on the other side will vote for this \ntreaty. They understand that it is modest but also important, and they \nwill put national security ahead of partisan political pressures. But \nif a small number of Republicans continue to delay and block this \ntreaty, they will be responsible for the disintegration of the \nconsensus on nuclear modernization, and the complex and arsenal will \nonce again become subject to controversy, dispute, and drift. That is \njust the reality.\n  It is true that Republicans have broadly questioned the \nadministration's commitment on nuclear modernization. But their \ncriticisms do not stand up to scrutiny.\n  Thus, Senator Kyl's criticisms of the Obama administration's pledge \nto spend $100 billion to maintain and modernize nuclear delivery \nsystems, that is right, $100 billion, is that ``the plan makes a \ncommitment only to a next-generation submarine, not to a next-\ngeneration bomber, ballistic missile, or air-launched cruise missile.''\n  This makes it sound like the administration lacks commitment to a \ncredible deterrent, but that is just not true. Where decisions need to \nbe made now, the administration has made them, with respect to the \nSSBN(X), the next-generation submarine. Where decisions would benefit \nfrom further consideration, and do not need to be made now, that is \nwhat is happening.\n  The administration is undertaking a comprehensive set of assessments \nof 21st century threats and needs, and it will then make decisions on \nwhat follows the Minuteman III, the Air-Launched Cruise Missile, and \nthe B-52 and B-2.\n  The Minuteman III missile is, by congressional mandate, having its \nlife extended through 2030. Studies to inform the decision about the \nfollow-on are needed now, and they are happening.\n  Similarly, the Department of Defense is studying the right mix of \nlong-range strike capabilities, and part of that will be the \nappropriate role for successors to the Air-Launched Cruise Missile and \nthe bomber. The decision with respect to our bombers can be made in the \nfuture because the bombers, though old, don't get that much stress and \nstill have a lot of life left in them. The same is true for the Air-\nLaunched Cruise Missile, though a decision on what will follow next \nneeds to be made sooner.\n  The decision on our long-range strike capabilities should be deferred \nin part because, as the Under Secretary of Defense recently explained, \nthe DoD will seek the same productivity growth and cost savings here as \nit is pursuing with the SSBN(X) submarine.\n  On the nuclear stockpile, the administration, with congressional \nsupport, is moving forward with the ongoing Life Extension Program for \nthe W76 and with studies for the B61 Life Extension Program. It will \nalso conduct a similar study for the W78, including exploring the \npotential for a common system with the W88 warhead.\n  Some of my Republican friends have complained that the \nadministration's policy for the refurbishment, reuse, and replacement \nof nuclear components in the warheads unduly constrains the work of \nscientists in the nuclear complex. This is not so, as the lab directors \nhave testified. These lab directors are on the frontlines of \nmaintaining and modernizing the stockpile, and they will have the \nflexibility they need.\n  Then there is the nuclear complex. In the 10-year plan the \nadministration submitted under section 1251 of last year's defense \nauthorization, the administration made an historic investment in the \nnuclear complex. It set a dramatically higher baseline for fiscal year \n2011. It included several years of funding increases consistent with \nwhat the NNSA can absorb and execute. And over 10 years, it initially \ncommitted to an $80 billion investment in the nuclear complex, a $10 \nbillion increase.\n  Now, the Democratic Congress took the extraordinary step this past \nSeptember of including funding at the full fiscal year 2011 level for \nweapons activities in the continuing resolution we passed. Almost \neverything else in the continuing resolution stuck to 2010 levels.\n  The nuclear complex is one of the most controversial parts of the \ndebate over nuclear modernization, particularly the prospect of \nreplacing two major facilities. The first is the chemistry and \nmetallurgy research facility replacement at Los Alamos, which is \ncentral to our plutonium capabilities. The second is the uranium \nprocessing facility at the Y-12 plant in Tennessee.\n  Republicans have complained that there is uncertainty and not enough \nfunding for these two replacement projects. But the administration's \nbudget has shown a significant commitment. Where there is uncertainty, \nit is not due to a lack of commitment on the administration's part, but \nsimply because the design and planning processes for these facilities \nare in an early phase.\n  We simply do not know what construction of the facilities is going to \ncost, and that is something the fiscal year 2011 budget submission from \nNNSA makes abundantly clear. To budget as though we did know those \ncosts would be irresponsible--especially for an agency that has \nhistorically been plagued by cost overruns. It\n\n[[Page S8277]]\n\nis simply too soon to have a solid baseline planning number.\n  To be sure, the administration has been updating and revising its \nplans and estimates. Two weeks ago, it released an update to its \nsection 1251 report with a revised, substantially higher cost estimate \nfor both replacement facilities.\n  It also included yet more funding for the NNSA's overall budget. The \nadministration has proposed an additional $600 million in funding for \nfiscal year 2012 and an additional $4.1 billion over the next 5 years. \nThat brings the total for the next decade to $85 billion. This both \nserves as a reminder that it is too early to have a fixed budget for \nthe new facilities, and also strongly reinforces the administration's \ngood-faith effort and commitment.\n  This brings me back to my fundamental point. I believe that support \nfor the two new facilities can be sustained if we follow the path laid \nout by the Perry-Schlesinger Commission and pursued by the \nadministration. This means balancing deterrence, arms control, and non-\nproliferation. The reality is that there will be significant questions \nand doubts about proceeding with such a costly modernization effort if \nit is not accompanied by equal support for arms control and non-\nproliferation.\n  There is no doubt that the existing facilities are aging and run \ndown. There are even safety problems. Something must be done.\n  But if we are going to move forward effectively, modernization must \nbe paired with arms control. And that starts with a modest first step--\nratification of the New START.\n  Without that step, consensus will break down, the replacement \nfacilities will once again lose a coherent mission, and we will be \nstuck with drift and controversy. The Perry-Schlesinger Commission \nrecognizes that if it is not possible to sustain the budget requisite \nfor both facilities concurrently, choices will have to be made.\n  They give powerful reasons for moving forward with the chemistry and \nmetallurgy research facility before the uranium processing facility. \nThat is the kind of tough choice we will have to make if New START is \nnot ratified. Similarly, real uncertainty will creep into the \nconsideration of just what sort of project the chemistry and metallurgy \nresearch facility should be.\n  Let me conclude by noting that the administration and the Democratic \nCongress have met every demand that many of my friends across the aisle \nhave made on modernization. To my friends on the other side, I say, \nlook at the demands in the December 2009 letter that you all signed. \nThe administration has met each of those demands.\n  Look at what Senator Kyl said in an op-ed in July: ``A key test is \nwhether the Democratic-controlled Congress will approve the president's \nnuclear modernization requests for the coming fiscal year.'' We passed \nthat test, and as I mentioned earlier under an otherwise flat-lined \ncontinuing resolution.\n  In that same piece, and in his March letter with Senator McConnell to \nthe President, Senator Kyl indicated he wanted assurances that the \nfiscal year 2012 budget would include adequate funding as well. \nAlthough next year's budget is not due out until February, as I \nmentioned before, the administration has already announced what it will \nbe requesting, and it will be another enormous increase in the weapons \nactivities budget. Can there really be any doubt that the \nadministration will move aggressively forward with modernization--if \nRepublicans take the first modest step of ratifying New START now?\n  We have passed our key test. The administration has met the demands \nSenator Kyl had laid out. Now the key test for Senator Kyl and others \nis whether they will join us in ratifying the New START. If they don't \ndo that now, the consensus that we have built will fall apart. Our \nnational security will be put at risk. And we will return to the dark \ndays when the nuclear enterprise was the subject of neglect and \ncontroversy.\n  The New START is a modest but very important step. It is one we \nshould all take together, without controversy.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8277-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN.

Mr. President, first of all, let me express my gratitude to \nall of the colleagues and other individuals who have come to the \nChamber at this moment.\n  Everyone who serves in Congress usually recalls two moments in their \nservice: the maiden speech they give shortly after their arrival and \ntheir closing remarks. I can't recall what the first speech I gave as a \nnew member of the House of Representatives 36 years ago was even about. \nI do, however, recall very vividly that there was no one else in the \nChamber when I gave it. It was an empty hall early one evening with the \nexception of one colleague, Johnny Dent from Pennsylvania. He was \nsitting in his chair with his trademark dark glasses, listening \npatiently as I gave my knee-rattling, hand-shaking maiden address. \nMidway through the speech, he walked up to me and said quietly: You \nknow, kid, it is not on the level. Well, that was my first speech \nbefore the House, and I am deeply honored that so many of you have come \nout to listen to my closing remarks today so I do not have to speak to \nan empty Chamber.\n  For more than 200 years, a uniquely American story has unfolded here \nin the Chamber of the United States Senate--a fascinating, inspiring, \noften tumultuous tale of conflict and compromise, reflecting the \nawesome potential of our still-young democracy and its occasional \nmoments of agonizing frustration.\n  For much of my life, this story has intersected with my own in ways \nthat have been both thrilling and humbling. As a 14-year-old boy, I sat \nin the family gallery of this very Chamber watching as my father took \nthe oath of office as a new Senator. A few years later, in 1962, I sat \nwhere these young men and women sit today, serving as a Senate page. \nJohn F. Kennedy was President and Lyndon Johnson presided over this \nbody. Eighteen years later, in the fall of 1980, the people of \nConnecticut gave me the honor of a lifetime when they asked me to give \nvoice to their views, electing me to serve as their U.S. Senator. For \nthe past 30 years, I have worked hard to sustain that trust. I am proud \nof the work I have done, but it is time for my story and that of this \ninstitution, which I cherish so much, to diverge. Thus, Mr. President, \nI rise to give some valedictory remarks as my service as a U.S. Senator \nfrom Connecticut comes to a close.\n  Now, it is common for retiring Senators to say the following: I will \nmiss the people but not the work. Mr. President, you won't hear that \nfrom me. Most assuredly, I will miss the people of the Senate, but I \nwill miss the work as well. Over the years, I have both witnessed and \nparticipated in some great debates in this Chamber, moments when \nstatesmen of both parties gathered together in this Hall to weigh the \ngreat questions of our time. And while I wish there had been more of \nthose moments, I will always remember the Senate debates on issues such \nas Central America, the Iraq war, campaign finance reform, securities \nlitigation, health care, and, of course, financial reform.\n  And when I am home in Connecticut, I see the results of the work we \ndid every day. I see workers coming home from their shifts at Pratt & \nWhitney, Electric Boat, the Sikorsky helicopter plant--the lifeblood of \na defense manufacturing sector so critical to our national security and \nto the economic well-being of my home State. I see communities \npreparing for high-speed rail and breaking ground for new community \nhealth centers. I see the grants we fought for helping cities and towns \nto build sustainable communities and promote economic development.\n  When I am home, I meet parents who, because of the Family and Medical \nLeave Act, don't have to choose between keeping their jobs and taking \ncare of their sick children. I visit with elderly folks who no longer \nhave to choose between paying for their prescription drugs and paying \nfor their heat. I hear from consumers who have been victimized by \nunfair practices on\n\n[[Page S8278]]\n\nthe part of credit card companies and who will no longer be subject to \nthose abuses. And I meet young children as well who, through Early Head \nStart or access to afterschool programs, have blossomed academically in \nspite of difficult economic circumstances.\n  As proud as I am of the work that has made these stories possible \nover the last three decades, I am keenly aware, particularly today, \nthat I did not do any of this alone. Until this last Congress, with \nrare exceptions, every major piece of legislation I authored that \nbecame law--including the ones I have just mentioned--had a Republican \ncosponsor as well as support from my Democratic caucus. So to my \nDemocratic and Republican Senate colleagues who joined me in all these \nefforts over 30 years, I say thank you this afternoon.\n  I also want to thank, if I can, the unsung heroes of this \ninstitution--the Senate staff and my personal staff. It would be a \ngrievous understatement to simply say they make the trains run on time. \nWithout them, as all of us know, the trains would never leave the \nstation at all--the floor staff, the cloakroom professionals of both \nparties, and the hundreds of unknown and unseen people who show up \nevery day in this body to make this critical institution of democracy \nfunction. Without them, no Senator could fulfill his or her obligations \nto the American people.\n  Many of my personal staff and committee staff are present in the \nSenate gallery today. Neither I nor the millions of Americans whose \nlives you have enriched or whose burdens you have lightened can ever \nthank you enough. I only hope your time with me has been as fulfilling \nas my time with you.\n  Of course, I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the people of \nConnecticut, whose confidence, patience, and spirit have given my life \nand its work deep meaning. As rich as our common language is, words \ncannot even come close to capturing the depth of my affection for and \nappreciation of the people of the State of Connecticut. For almost four \ndecades--three terms in the House of Representatives, five terms in \nthis Chamber--you have entrusted me to labor on your behalf, and I \ndeeply thank you for that honor.\n  And lastly, my family. My parents are long since deceased, but their \nguidance, inspiration, and example have never departed. For the past 30 \nyears, I have sat at this very same desk occupied by my father during \nthe 12 years he served in this Chamber. His courage, character, and \nconviction have been a constant reminder of what it means to be a U.S. \nSenator. I thank my siblings and their children and other relatives for \ntheir enthusiastic support, particularly during the rough patches. From \ntime to time, we all need the safe harbor of family at the darker \nmoments. And to Jackie, Grace, and Christina, who have supported and \ninspired me every day: You mean more to me than I could ever say in \nthese few short moments. So come January, I am glad I will have more \ntime to say it to you more often. And to Jackie in particular: You have \nbeen my anchor to windward in the rough and turbulent waters of public \nservice. When it was the darkest, you were the brightest. I love you \nmore than life.\n  As this chapter in my career comes to a close, a new chapter in the \nSenate's history is beginning. When this body is gaveled to order in \nJanuary, nearly half of its Members will be in their first term. And \neven though I could spend hours fondly recalling a lifetime of \nyesterdays, this new Senate and the Nation must confront a very \nuncertain tomorrow. So rather than recite a long list of personal \nmemories or to revisit video highlights of my Senate service, I would \nlike to take this brief time, in these few short moments, to offer a \nfew thoughts to those who will write the Senate's next chapter.\n  I will begin by stating the sadly obvious. Our electoral system is a \nmess. Powerful financial interests, free to throw money about with \nlittle transparency, have corrupted, in my view, the basic principles \nunderlying our representative democracy. As a result, our political \nsystem at the Federal level is completely dysfunctional. Those who were \nelected to the Senate just a few weeks ago must already begin the \nunpleasant work of raising money for their reelection 6 years hence. \nNewly-elected Senators will learn that their every legislative \nmaneuver, their every public utterance, and even some of their private \ndeliberations will be fodder for a 24/7 political media industry that \nseems to favor speculation over analysis and conflict over consensus.\n  This explosion of new media brings with it its own benefits and its \ndrawbacks--and it is occurring simultaneously as the presence of \ntraditional media outlets in our Nation is declining. So while the \ncorridors of Congress are crowded with handheld video and cell phone \ncameras, there is a declining roll for newspaper, radio, and network \njournalists reporting the routine deliberations that are taking place \nin our subcommittee hearings. Case in point: Ten years ago, 11 or 12 \nreporters from Connecticut covered the delegation's legislative \nactivities. Today, there is only one doing the same work.\n  Meanwhile, intense partisan polarization has raised the stakes in \nevery debate and on every vote, making it difficult to lose with grace \nand nearly impossible to compromise without cost. Americans' distrust \nof politicians provides compelling incentives for Senators to distrust \neach other, to disparage this very institution, and to disengage from \nthe policymaking process.\n  These changes have already had their effect on the Senate. The \npurpose of insulating one-half of the national legislature from the \nvolatile shifts in public mood has been degraded. And while I strongly \nfavor reforming our campaign finance system, revitalizing and \nrehabilitating our journalistic traditions, and restoring citizen faith \nin government and politics, I know that wishes won't make it so.\n  I have heard some people suggest that the Senate as we know it simply \ncannot function in such a highly charged political environment; that we \nshould change Senate rules to make it more efficient, more responsive \nto the public mood--more like the House of Representatives, where the \nmajority can essentially bend the minority to its will. I appreciate \nthe frustrations many have with the slow pace of the legislative \nprocess, and I certainly share some of my colleagues' anger with the \nrepetitive use and abuse of the filibuster. Thus, I can understand the \ntemptation to change the rules that make the Senate so unique and \nsimultaneously so terribly frustrating. But whether such a temptation \nis motivated by a noble desire to speed up the legislative process or \nby pure political expedience, I believe such changes would be unwise.\n  We 100 Senators are but temporary stewards of a unique American \ninstitution, founded upon universal principles. The Senate was designed \nto be different, not simply for the sake of variety but because the \nFramers believed the Senate could and should be the venue in which \nstatesmen would lift America up to meet its unique challenges.\n  As a Senator from the State of Connecticut--and the longest serving \none in its history--I take special pride in the role two Connecticut \nYankees played in the establishment of this very body. It was Roger \nSherman and Oliver Ellsworth, delegates from Connecticut to the \nConstitutional Convention in 1787, who proposed the idea of a bicameral \nnational legislature. The Connecticut Compromise, as it came to be \nknown, was designed to ensure that no matter which way the political \nwinds blew or how hard the gusts, there would be a place--one place--\nfor every voice to be heard.\n  The history of this young democracy, the Framers decided, should not \nbe written solely in the hand of the political majority. In a nation \nfounded in revolution against tyrannical rule which sought to crush \ndissent, there should be one institution that would always provide a \nspace where dissent was valued and respected. E pluribus unum--out of \nmany, one. And though we would act as one, and should, the Framers \nbelieved our political debate should always reflect that in our beliefs \nand aspirations, we are, in fact, many. In short, our Founders were \nconcerned not only with what we legislated but, just as importantly, \nwith how we legislated.\n  In my years here, I have learned that the appreciation of the \nSenate's role in our national debate is an acquired taste. Therefore, \nto my fellow Senators who have never served a day in the minority, I \nurge you to pause in your enthusiasm to change Senate rules. And\n\n[[Page S8279]]\n\nto those in the minority who routinely abuse the rules of the Senate to \ndelay or defeat almost any Senate decision, know that you will be \nequally responsible for undermining the unique value of the Senate--a \nvalue, I would argue, that is greater than that which you might assign \nto the political motivations driving your obstruction.\n  So in the end, of course, I would suggest this isn't about the \nfilibuster. What will determine whether this institution works or not, \nwhat has always determined whether we fulfill the Framers' highest \nhopes or justify the cynics' worst fears is not the Senate rules or the \ncalendar or the media; it is whether each of the 100 Senators can work \ntogether, living up to the incredible honor that comes with this title \nand the awesome responsibility that comes with this office.\n  Politics today seemingly rewards only passion and independence, not \ndeliberation and compromise as well. It has become commonplace to hear \ncandidates for this body campaign on how they are going to Washington \nto shake things up--all by themselves. May I politely suggest that you \nare seeking election to the wrong office. The U.S. Senate does not work \nthat way, nor can it, nor should it. Mayors, Governors, and Presidents \ncan sometimes succeed by the sheer force of their will, but there has \nnever been a Senator so persuasive, so charismatic, so clever, or so \nbrilliant that they could make a significant difference while refusing \nto work with other Members of this body.\n  Simply put, Senators cannot ultimately be effective alone.\n  As I noted earlier, until last year's health care bill, there had not \nbeen a single piece of legislation I had ever passed without a \nRepublican partner.\n  Of course, none of those victories came easily. The notion that \npartisan politics is a new phenomenon, or that partisan politics serve \nno useful purpose, is just flat wrong.\n  From the moment of our founding, America has been engaged in an \neternal and often pitched partisan debate. That is no weakness. In \nfact, it is at the core of our strength as a democracy, and success as \na nation.\n  Political bipartisanship is a goal, not a process.\n  You do not begin the debate with bipartisanship--you arrive there. \nAnd you can do so only when determined partisans create consensus--and \nthus bipartisanship.\n  In the end, the difference between a partisan brawl and a passionate, \nbut ultimately productive, debate rests on the personal relationships \namong those of us who serve here.\n  A legislative body that operates on unanimous consent, as we do, \ncannot function unless the Members trust each other. There is no hope \nof building that trust unless there is the will to treat each other \nwith respect and civility, and to invest the time it takes to create \nthat trust and strengthen those personal bonds.\n  No matter how obnoxious you find a colleague's rhetoric or how odious \nyou find their beliefs, you will need them. And despite what some may \ninsist, you do no injustice to your ideological principles when you \nseek out common ground. You do no injustice to your political beliefs \nwhen you take the time to get to know those who don't share them.\n  I have served with several hundred Senators under every partisan \nconfiguration imaginable: Republican presidents and Democratic \npresidents, divided government and one party control.\n  And as odd as it may sound in the present political environment, in \nthe last three decades I have served here, I cannot recall a single \nSenate colleague with whom I could not work.\n  Sometimes those relationships take time, but then, that is why the \nFramers gave us 6-year terms: so that members could build the social \ncapital necessary to make the Senate function.\n  Under our Constitution, Senators are given 6 years, but only you can \ndecide how to use them. And as one Senator who has witnessed what is \npossible here, I urge each of you: Take the time to use those years \nwell. I pledge to those of you who have recently arrived, your tenure \nhere will be so much more rewarding.\n  More importantly, you will be vindicating the confidence that the \nFramers placed in each person who takes the oath of office, as a U.S. \nSenator, upholding a trust that echoes through the centuries.\n  I share the confidence that Roger Sherman, Oliver Ellsworth, and the \nFramers placed in this body and in its Members. But I am not blind. The \nSenate today, in the view of many, is not functioning as it can and \nshould.\n  I urge you to look around. This moment is difficult, not only for \nthis body, but for the nation it serves. In the end, what matters most \nin America is not what happens within the walls of this Chamber, but \nrather the consequences of our decisions across the Nation and around \nthe globe.\n  Our economy is struggling, and many of our people are experiencing \nreal hardship--unemployment, home foreclosures, endangered pensions.\n  Meanwhile, our Nation faces real challenges: a mounting national \ndebt, energy, immigration, nuclear proliferation, ongoing conflicts in \nAfghanistan and Iraq and so much more. All these challenges make the \ninternal political and procedural conflicts we face as Senators seem \nsmall and petty.\n  History calls each of us to lift our eyes above the fleeting \ncontroversies of the moment, and to refocus our attention on our common \nchallenge and common purpose.\n  By regaining its footing, the Senate can help this nation to regain \nconfidence, and restore its sense of optimism.\n  We must regain that focus. And, most importantly, we need our \nconfidence back--we need to feel that same optimism that has sustained \nus through more than two centuries.\n  Now, I am not naive. I am aware of the conventional wisdom that \npredicts gridlock in the Congress.\n  But I know both the Democratic and Republican leaders. I know the \nsitting members of this chamber as well. And my confidence is unshaken.\n  Why? Because we have been here before. The country has recovered from \neconomic turmoil. Americans have come together to heal deep divides in \nour Nation and the Senate has led by finding its way through seemingly \nintractable political division.\n  We have proven time and time again that the Senate is capable of \nmeeting the test of history. We have evidenced the wisdom of the \nFramers who created its unique rules and set the high standards that we \nmust meet.\n  After all, no other legislative body grants so much power to each \nmember, nor does any other legislative body ask so much of each member.\n  Just as the Senate's rules empower each Member to act like a \nstatesman, they also require statesmanship from each of us.\n  But these rules are merely requiring from us the kind of leadership \nthat our constituents need from us, that history calls on us to provide \nin difficult times such as the ones we're encountering.\n  Maturity in a time of pettiness, calm in a time of anger, and \nleadership in a time of uncertainty--that is what the Nation asks of \nthe Senate, and that is what this office demands of us.\n  Over the past two centuries, some 1,900 men and women have shared the \nprivilege of serving in this body. Each of us has been granted a \ntemporary, fleeting moment in which to indulge either our political \nambition and ideological agenda, or, alternatively, to rise to the \nchallenge and make a constructive mark on our history.\n  My moment is now at an end, but to those whose moments are not yet \nover, and to those whose moments will soon begin, I wish you so much \nmore than good fortune.\n  I wish you wisdom. I wish you courage. And I wish for each of you \nthat, one day, when you reflect on your moment, you will know that you \nhave lived up to the tremendous honor and daunting responsibility of \nbeing a United States Senator.\n  To quote St. Paul, ``. . . the time of my departure has come. I have \nfought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the \nfaith.''\n  So, Mr. President, it is with great pride, deep humility and \nincredible gratitude, as a United States Senator, that I yield the \nfloor.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have on many occasions spoken of my \naffection for my friend Chris Dodd. At the caucus today--the Presiding \nOfficer was\n\n[[Page S8280]]\n\nthere--I indicated very few people have had the opportunity and the \nchallenges in a single Congress as Chris Dodd. He found himself \nchairman of the Banking Committee at a time when the country was \ncollapsing, the banks were collapsing. Yet he led the way to working \nwith the Republican President to do the so-called TARP. It was \nsomething that was done on a bipartisan basis. There was never a better \nexample in my entire government career of a more cooperative group of \nSenators, Democrats and Republicans, House and the Senate, working \ntogether to create something that was badly needed.\n  Then we had, of course, many other issues beginning with Wall Street \nreform. Then, to complicate his life and to add to the challenges in \nhis life--the best friend a man could ever have was Chris Dodd's best \nfriend, Ted Kennedy--Ted Kennedy was stricken very ill. Senator Dodd \nknew he would not be back to the Senate. Very few people knew that, but \nhe knew that. He, in effect, was chairing two major committees at the \nsame time, the HELP Committee and the Banking Committee. He did it in a \nway that is so commendable, so exemplary.\n  I have so much, I repeat, affection for Chris Dodd that I am not \ncapable of expressing how deeply I feel about this good man. I will \nhave more to say later, but I did want to take this opportunity, as \nsoon as the Republican leader makes his remarks, to allow his colleague \nfrom the State of Connecticut to speak following the two leaders, if \nthat is OK.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of Senator \nMcConnell, Senator Lieberman be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, like most Members of this body, I am \nrarely at a loss for words, but I think we have just had an opportunity \nto hear one of the most important speeches in the history of the Senate \nabout our beginnings, about our traditions, about what is unique about \nthis institution which makes it different from any other legislative \nbody in the world. I have heard many people discuss that over the years \nbut never anyone so cogently point out why the uniqueness of this \ninstitution is so important to our country as the senior Senator from \nConnecticut has done it today. So while we have a huge number of \nSenators on the floor, I am going to strongly recommend that those who \nwere not here have an opportunity to take a look at his remarks because \nI think they are an enormously significant and important contribution \nto this institution and to its future.\n  On a personal basis, I want to say to my good friend from Connecticut \nhow much I am going to miss him--his wonderful personality, his ability \nto talk to anybody--a uniquely effective individual.\n  So we bid adieu to the senior Senator from Connecticut and hope our \npaths will cross again in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, for 22 years it has been a blessing for \nme to have served with Chris Dodd in the Senate as my colleague from \nConnecticut, as my dear friend, as my legislative partner. I am going \nto miss him a lot, as everybody in this Chamber will. I think when we \nlistened to the words he spoke to us just a few moments ago--how full \nof wisdom and warmth they were--we knew how much we are going to miss \nhim and how much we should consider what has made him not only our \ngreat friend but a truly great Senator.\n  Chris mentioned Sherman and Ellsworth, whose pictures are out in the \nreception area just off the Senate, who crafted the Connecticut \nCompromise, really created the Senate. I think Chris Dodd, who is the \n54th Senator from the State of Connecticut in our history, took this \ninstitution that Sherman and Ellsworth created in the Connecticut \nCompromise and made it work to the great benefit of the people of \nConnecticut and the people of America.\n  To the great benefit of the people of Connecticut and the people of \nAmerica, Chris Dodd was born to a legacy, an honorable legacy of public \nservice, which he watched, as so many of us did in Connecticut, and, of \ncourse, learned from, from his father, Senator Thomas J. Dodd. I could \nsay a lot about Senator Dodd, Sr. He was a prosecutor at the Nuremberg \ntrials, remarkably principled, skillful prosecutor, who became a Member \nof the Senate.\n  I will tell you that as a young man in Connecticut, me, growing up, \nthinking about a political career, when I heard that Senator Tom Dodd \nwas somewhere within range of where I lived or went to school, I went \nto listen to him speak. He was a classic orator, an extraordinarily \nprincipled man who had a great career in the Senate.\n  As we know from the years we have served with Chris, the \ncharacteristics I have described of his father were taken and put to \nextraordinarily good use in the Senate.\n  Chris's words were very important, and, as Senator McConnell said, \nshould be studied by all of us and by anyone thinking about coming to \nthe Senate. We all talk about this being an age of hyperpartisanship. \nBut I think that misses the point because, as Chris said, he is a \npartisan in the best sense of the word. He is a principled partisan. He \nis passionate about what he believes in. But he knows we come to a \npoint when partisanship ends, and you have to get something done for \nthe public that was good enough to send you here.\n  Over and over again, any of us on both sides of the aisle who have \nwatched Chris work a bill know how persistent, how open, how anxious he \nwas to try to find common ground, yes, to compromise because ultimately \nour work is the art of the possible. Somebody once said to me: The \nfutility of the failure to compromise, there is no result from it. But \nif you have a goal, a principled goal, you know you can achieve a \nsignificant part of that goal if you can build enough support in this \nChamber, and time and time again Chris Dodd did that.\n  The other reason I think he did it is because of the truth that he \nspoke in his remarks, which is that beyond the great debates and the \nheadlines and the sniping back and forth, the Senate, after all, is 100 \npeople who go to work in the same place every day, and your ability to \nget things done in the Senate, as is true in offices and factories all \nover America and other places of work, your ability to get things done \nhere is affected, in great measure, by the trust your colleagues have \nin you and even the extent to which they like you.\n  I think, by those standards, Chris Dodd has been totally trustworthy. \nAs we were taught when we grew up in Connecticut politics, his word has \nbeen his bond, and his personality has warmed each of us as we have \ngone through the labors we go through here.\n  Chris Dodd has served longer in the Senate than any Senator from \nConnecticut. So on this day--and he will forgive me a little bit of \nhyperbole. I would guess, as a matter of friendship and faith, that he \nhas probably accomplished more than any other Senator in the history of \nthe State of Connecticut, and he has done it because he cares about \npeople. When he takes something on, he simply does not quit.\n  I just want to tell you one story. In 1989, Chris met a woman named \nEva Bunnell at her church in East Haddam, CT. She told him her daughter \nhad been born with a rare brain disease and was fighting for her life \nin the intensive care unit. But when her husband asked his employer for \ntime off to be with his wife and critically sick infant, he was told to \ngo home and never come back, leaving a family without income or health \ninsurance.\n  The story, all too common at the time, is the kind of injustice that \nhas repeatedly moved Chris Dodd to action. He authored, as we know, the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act. He worked, as I said before, on \ncompromises that made it acceptable to a large number of people, stuck \nwith it through two Presidential vetoes, and then finally saw it signed \ninto law by President Clinton in 1993.\n  Today, the records will show that more than 50 million people, 50 \nmillion people, have been able to take time off from work to care for a \nloved one or give birth to a child without fear of losing their jobs.\n  That is a lifetime achievement, but it is only one of many such \nachievements Chris Dodd has had in the Senate. Senator Reid talked \nabout this\n\n[[Page S8281]]\n\nlast session of his Senate career, extraordinary accomplishments: \nhealth care reform, Wall Street reform, the Iran sanctions bill which \ncame out of the Banking Committee, which is, in my opinion, the \nstrongest such bill we have ever passed and the last best hope to avoid \nthe necessity to take military action against Iran. This is the kind of \nrecord Chris has built.\n  Up until this time, I have been serious, and when you talk about \nChris Dodd, it would be wrong to be totally serious because one of the \nthings we are going to miss is that booming laugh and the extraordinary \nsense of humor. I have had many great laughs with colleagues here. I \nhave probably given too many laughs to colleagues, as I think about it. \nBut I have never laughed louder or more over the years than I have with \nChris Dodd.\n  Perhaps it is not totally appropriate on the Senate floor, but I have \ntwo of his comments, one about me, that I wish to share. I notice the \nformer comedian is here. A while ago, only Chris Dodd would have told \nan audience here in Washington that he thought enough time had passed \nin my career that he could reveal that Joe Lieberman actually had not \nbeen born Jewish but was born a Baptist and raised a Baptist, and then \nwhen I got into politics and saw how many events I would have to go to \non Friday night or Saturday, I converted to Judaism to take the Sabbath \noff. Then Chris said: And, you know, I am thinking of converting to \nJudaism myself but only for the weekends.\n  Another quick quip. As my colleagues in the Senate know, it is our \nhonor to walk our State colleagues down the center aisle in the Senate \nto be sworn in for a new term. The first time I did that, we walked arm \nin arm, as we always have. Chris turned to me and said: You know, Joe, \nthere are people who are worried that you may be the only person I will \never walk down an aisle with.\n  Well, fortunately, that was not true because, Chris and Jackie got \nmarried and had these two wonderful daughters, Grace and Christina, who \nhave provided so much joy and satisfaction and hopefulness to Chris.\n  We are going to miss you. I am going to miss you personally. I speak \nfor myself, but I speak, I would bet, for just everybody in this \nChamber in saying we feel so close to you that we know our friendship \nwill go on.\n  I would say Chris Dodd leaves, to sum up an extraordinary Senate \ncareer, having achieved a record of results that benefited the people \nof Connecticut and America in untold ways. He has a wonderful family \nwith whom he looks forward to spending time, and he has oh so many \ngreat years ahead of him, including, I hope and believe, times when he \nwill again be of service to our country.\n  God bless you, Chris, and your family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to join with my colleagues in \nsaluting the departure of one of our best, Senator Chris Dodd. I first \nsaw his father, though I did not meet him, when I was a student intern \nfor Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois, who had an office that was next \ndoor to Chris Dodd's father's. I saw Senator Thomas Dodd leaving that \noffice and was certainly aware of the great contribution he made to \nAmerica.\n  Little did I know some 16 years later, when I would be a candidate \nfor the House of Representatives, that his son would come to Decatur, \nIL, to do an event for me in my campaign. It was a smashing success, \nthe biggest turnout ever. I am sure Senator Dodd believes it might have \nbeen because of his presence. It also could have been because it was a \n$1 chicken dinner and people came from miles around. But I was happy to \nadvertise him as the star talent at that event.\n  What a great life story. Christopher John Dodd, the fifth of six \nchildren of Thomas and Grace Dodd, was born in 1944 with a caul, a thin \nveil of skin thought to be a sign of good luck, covering his head. The \ndoctor who delivered him told his mother that with this sign of good \nluck, this baby might grow up to be President, to which Mrs. Dodd \nreplied: ``What is the matter with Franklin Roosevelt?''\n  It was a great line, but the truth is, while Grace and Tom Dodd were \nboth ardent New Dealers, they knew America would not depend on one \nleader forever, not even FDR. They knew and they taught their children \nthey all have an obligation in our own time to try to move America \ncloser to a more perfect Union.\n  Thomas Dodd, Senator Dodd's father, worked to fulfill that obligation \nin his time. He chased John Dillinger as an FBI agent, prosecuted war \ncriminals and KKK members as a government lawyer, and served in both \nthe House and Senate. His son Chris followed his father's example, \nfound his way to serve America by serving in the Peace Corps as a \nvolunteer in the Dominican Republic, where he lived for 2 years in a \nmountaintop village in a house with a tin roof and no running water or \ntelephone.\n  In that village he started a maternity hospital, family planning \nprogram, a youth club, and a school. Those were the first installments \nof what would become, for Chris Dodd, a lifetime of work protecting \nwomen and children worldwide.\n  Senator Dodd was elected to the Senate in 1980, at the ripe age of \n36. He is both the youngest person ever elected to the Senate in \nConnecticut history and the longest serving, as has been said. Early \non, his colleagues recognized his talents and named him one of the \nthree most effective freshman Senators. He has never let up on his \nefforts to help America and help Connecticut.\n  He is a passionate, articulate voice for economic justice, for civil, \nconstitutional and human rights and for America's role as a moral \nleader in the world. He is a champion of fairness, cofounder of the \nSenate Children's Caucus, lead sponsor, as Senator Lieberman mentioned, \nin 1993, of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which has helped \ncountless millions of Americans.\n  He has achieved more in the last 2 years, though, than most Senators \nachieve in long careers. As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, \nhe led the fight in the Senate for the most important Wall Street \nreform since the Great Depression. He picked up the fallen standard \nfrom his dear friend Ted Kennedy and helped lead the fight Ted Kennedy \nalways dreamed of for affordable health care for all Americans. For \nthat achievement alone, Chris Dodd has earned a place in history.\n  Chris Dodd has, as Eugene O'Neill might say, ``the map of Ireland on \nhis face,'' but he has the promise of America written in his heart. His \nwork in the Senate has made that promise real for millions of \nAmericans. In his office in the Russell Senate Office Building, an \noffice once occupied by his father, are portraits of two Thomases: \nThomas Dodd, his father, and another of his heroes, Sir Thomas More.\n  I listened to Chris's speech just a moment ago, and I was reminded of \nwhat Thomas More wrote in his masterwork, ``Utopia.'' He said:\n\n       If you can't completely eradicate wrong ideas, or deal with \n     inveterate vices as effectively as you could wish, that is no \n     reason for turning your back on public life all together. You \n     wouldn't abandon a ship in a storm just because you couldn't \n     control the winds.\n\n  For 30 years in the Senate, even when he has had to sail through \nfierce headwinds, Chris Dodd has kept his compass fixed on the ideals \nthat make America both great and good. In doing so, he has made the \nSenate, Connecticut, and America a better place.\n  I am proud to have served with him and call him a friend. I thank him \nfor his efforts that brought me to the House of Representatives so many \nyears ago. I thank him for his service in the Senate and a special \nthanks to his wonderful family; Jackie, a great friend, and those two \ngreat daughters, Grace and Christine, whom I have seen as swimmers at \nthe Senate pool, good health and good luck to the whole family for many \nmore chapters in their lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to my \ndear friend and colleague and, in a very real sense, mentor. I can \ntestify from the experience of the last 2 years to his remarkable \ncontributions to this country.\n  I don't believe any other Senator could have navigated the \ntreacherous\n\n[[Page S8282]]\n\nwaters of the Dodd-Frank bill. It was like watching a great conductor \nconduct a complicated piece of music: knowing when to pause and let \ntempers cool, knowing when to pick up the tempo, knowing when to come \nto the final conclusion. It was a virtuosos performance, in keeping \nwith a career of contributing to Connecticut and to this country.\n  The most remarkable tribute I have ever heard about this wonderful \nman was in a very unusual place by a person who honestly probably \ndoesn't know who he is. It was May 21, 2010. I was visiting a wounded \nsoldier at Walter Reed Army Hospital, a member of the Second Battalion, \n508 Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division. He had \nbeen wounded around Kandahar by an IED. Fortunately, he was on the road \nto recovery. We joked for a moment and talked about his experiences, \nand I turned to his mother, who was sitting there watching her son, her \nlife, her hope make a full recovery, and I said: How are you doing?\n  She said to me very simply: I am doing fine. You see, I was able to \ntake family medical leave and be with my son while he recuperated.\n  She probably doesn't know who Senator Dodd is or what he did, but \nshe, along with 50 million other Americans, was by the hospital bed of \na wounded son or a sick child or an ailing parent. To me, that is the \ngreatest tribute to what Senator Dodd has done.\n  There is a great line I recall about Franklin Roosevelt. His cortege \nwas winding its way through Washington. A man was sobbing, sobbing, \nsobbing. A reporter rushed up to him: Well, you are so affected. You \nmust have known the President. Did you know the President?\n  He said: No, I never knew the President, but he knew me.\n  Chris Dodd knew the people of Connecticut and the people of the \nUnited States, and in every moment, he served them with integrity and \ndiligence and honor.\n  Chris, to you, to your family--and I say this because your mother is \nfrom Westerly, RI, God bless her; and your beloved sister, our dear \nfriends Martha and Bernie, from Rhode Island--as an adopted son of \nRhode Island, thank you for your service to the Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, may I associate myself with the \nremarks of my distinguished senior Senator and reemphasize our pride in \nthe contacts that Chairman Dodd, Senator Dodd, our friend Chris Dodd \nhas with Rhode Island.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wish to take a couple of minutes to \nsalute the service of one great Senator, Chris Dodd.\n  Chris and I have served together for more than 25 years. When I \narrived here--and I was not one of the youngest people to get here at \nthat time, but Chris was someone I knew from other walks of life--I \nturned to him, as well as my dear friend who used to occupy this seat, \nTed Kennedy, for advice and counsel. Sometimes the counseling was \nbetter than the advice, but we were younger then.\n  Chris Dodd has that incredible personality that gets things done, \nthat presents a leadership position on issues. He has shown incredible \npatience in the way he dealt with financial reform and with health \ncare. But never, as I saw it, did Chris leave the people who disagreed \nwith him with anger, with a feeling of anger or with anything other \nthan respect and friendship.\n  Chris comes from a distinguished family. His father occupied a seat \nhere for a dozen years. Now Senator Chris Dodd has decided to leave the \nSenate. It was a decision he made with which I totally disagreed. It \nwas bad judgment, I can tell my colleagues that. When I left after 18 \nyears of service, three terms, I decided I had had enough. I left. Good \nfortune smiled on me, and I came back after 2 years, after a 2-year \nabsence, missing being here maybe more than it missed me.\n  I remember, as I made my outgoing visits--no, my decisionmaking \nvisits--Chris invited me to his office with Ted Kennedy and a colleague \nwhom we had at the time, Paul Wellstone, now deceased but a wonderful \ncolleague. The three of them sat with me in Chris's office, and Chris \ntried to talk me out of leaving. I said: No, it is a decision I made. I \nbegan to have misgivings about it, but by then, the die was cast; there \nwere other people who wanted to run for the job. So I left with lots of \nregrets. I was away from here for a period of time. In 2001 when I \nleft, it was a terrible year--the year of 9/11 and the beginning of a \nrecession and the beginning of war and all of those things. So I tried \nto play turnaround with Chris, and I talked to Chris about leaving and \nI said: Chris, don't leave. Don't do it.\n  Chris Dodd will leave a void. I think it is obvious that someone will \nfollow, take the reins. It doesn't mean they will ever take his place. \nI don't think that is possible. Chris Dodd will have left an impression \nhere of decency and honesty and honor and respect on all of us on both \nsides of the aisle--one of the few times we all agree.\n  So I say to Chris and Jackie and your two little girls that we wish \nyou well. Our friendship will endure way past our time serving \ntogether.\n  Chris, follow my example. Give it a couple of years and get back \nhere, will you. Thank you very, very much, Chris Dodd, for your \nwonderful service. We love you, and we will miss you, and we will \nalways think about you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly in honor of our \nfriend and colleague, the senior Senator from Connecticut. I have \nwatched him from the day I came here. We knew each other a little bit \nwhen I was in the House. He left the House to go to the Senate, but we \nhad many of the same friends when I came to the House. I always \nmarveled at his abilities.\n  For those of us who have served here--I have only been here 12 \nyears--we know the joys and difficulties of legislating in the Senate. \nWe know it is not easy, and we know how satisfying it is. There are \nvery few who reach the acme of how to do it and who devote their lives \nto it. I guess they are given a title--I don't know if it is official; \nit is probably not--they are the ``men and women of the Senate.'' We \nhave had two leave us in the last year: Senator Robert Byrd and Senator \nTed Kennedy. They were truly men of the Senate. It is not a title \nbestowed easily or lightly or frequently.\n  Chris Dodd is a man of the Senate. He is in the category of Ted \nKennedy and Robert Byrd in terms of his ability to get things done, his \nability as a legislative craftsman, as somebody who is able to combine \nidealism and practicality, as somebody who is able to sit down with \nsomeone, as has been mentioned before, with a totally different \nviewpoint and get them to compromise and be on his side and be part of \nthe effort he is leading. He is a man of the Senate. He will always be \na man of the Senate. I will miss him personally for his guidance and \nfriendship, and I think every one of us will.\n  Chris, good luck and Godspeed.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you very, very much.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if there is no other Senator wishing to \nspeak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8282-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8282-S8288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today we have an opportunity to assist \nliterally hundreds of thousands of families across this country who are \nout of work through no fault of their own, who are battling with the \nmost severe economic downturn since the Great Depression, who are \nchasing jobs that have disappeared, and they are looking everywhere to \ntry to find work. We have the opportunity to extend unemployment \nbenefits for an additional year.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, people are in a very serious situation. \nThey are struggling to stay in their homes, to educate their children, \nto deal with the challenges of everyday life. They\n\n[[Page S8283]]\n\nhave worked hard and long all of their lives, and now they are finding \nit difficult to find a job.\n  In every situation previously in this country, we have come to their \nassistance. We have done so by extending unemployment benefits. We have \nnever failed to do that as long as the unemployment rate was above 7.2 \nor 7.4 percent. Today across the country, it is close to 9 percent \nnationally. In my State of Rhode Island, it is much higher. We have \nalways done it on an emergency basis because it truly is an emergency. \nWe haven't had to offset because we have always determined that it was \nnecessary to get the money to the people who could use it, who needed \nit desperately, and we should do that again.\n  I find it difficult to understand how some of my colleagues on the \nother side would object to an extension of unemployment benefits for a \nyear that are not offset but at the same time insist that we provide \ntax cuts to the very richest Americans, without paying for them, and \ninsist that we add approximately $700 billion to our deficit by \nextending tax cuts for people making over $250,000 a year--and many \nmaking many times that amount--yet for unemployed Americans desperately \nseeking work and not finding it, they would insist that we not only \nhave to pay for it, but we have delayed and delayed the process of \ngetting them assistance. It is difficult to justify those two \npositions.\n  It is also difficult to justify those two positions because what we \nknow is that unemployment compensation benefits give us a much bigger \nbang for the buck than the extension of tax relief to upper income \ncitizens. The Congressional Budget Office has rated the effectiveness \nof various techniques to provide assistance and stimulate demand in the \neconomy. They have found that unemployment insurance is far and away \nthe most effective form--much more effective than tax cuts to the \nwealthy.\n  CBO estimates that for every dollar of unemployment compensation \nbenefits that we inject into the economy, we get $1.90 of economic \nactivity, which is almost a 2-for-1 payback. So we are in a situation \nwhere this is not only the appropriate policy to pursue, but it is the \nmost effective one in order to keep demand and the economy and growth \nmoving forward.\n  I am someone who believes in fiscal responsibility. That is why I \ntook, in the 1990s, difficult votes in order to balance the budget \nunder President Clinton, to raise not only our output but also to \nbalance the budget and have a surplus in 2000. I opposed the proposal \nand the tax cuts favored by Republican colleagues in 2000 because I \nunderstood that the difficult, hard fought, fiscal responsibility could \neasily be frittered away because what looked like a surplus in 2000 \ncould be affected by unforeseen events, such as terrorist attacks, \nnatural disasters, or changes in the world economy that we could not \ncontemplate. I knew how difficult it was in the nineties to get our \nhouse in order. I was opposed to these tax cuts. I hope everybody else \nrealizes the demographics of the country at that time.\n  In 1993-1994, we took tough votes to build up a surplus because we \nknew what was coming. We had a demographic wave--the baby boomers--that \nwould qualify for Medicare and Social Security, and that would, by the \nnature of the sheer size of that population, put extra demands upon our \nbudget.\n  Despite all of that, taxes were cut, wars were pursued unpaid for. \nFor the first time in the history of the country, we engaged in major \nmilitary operations and didn't even make an attempt to pay for them. \nThat is not the definition of fiscal responsibility. Yet many of the \nsame proponents of that policy are urging us today that we cannot do \nunemployment compensation insurance unless we pay for it. But, of \ncourse, let's extend the Bush tax cuts for all Americans, including the \nwealthiest, and in that case add another $700 billion to our deficit \nover 10 years. That doesn't seem to make any economic sense.\n  This proposal is supported by people who are knowledgeable about the \nway the economy works. In a statement released today, 33 economists, \nincluding 5 recipients of the Nobel Prize in economics and 5 former \nchairs of the Council of Economic Advisers, have said:\n\n       Continuing the about-to-expire federal emergency \n     unemployment insurance program, which provides extra weeks of \n     benefits to the long-term unemployed, is sensible economic \n     policy that will not only assist the unemployed but help \n     maintain spending, overall demand, and employment at this \n     critical point in the recovery. . . . Eliminating these \n     benefits, on the other hand, will cause hardship for the \n     long-term unemployed, scale back spending, and weaken the \n     economy since unemployment benefits are one of the most \n     effective means available to support overall demand. \n     Unemployment has remained above 9 percent for 18 months \n     already and will likely remain high for some time to come, \n     making a strong case for continuing the current program for \n     another 12 months. Moreover, the special provisions for \n     extending unemployment insurance during recessions have \n     traditionally been financed by short-term fiscal deficits and \n     this remains a prudent approach. The program will not \n     contribute significantly to long-term deficits because its \n     costs will diminish automatically as the economy recovers and \n     unemployment returns to more normal levels.\n\n  Let me say that again in my own words. Our colleagues are suggesting \na permanent extension of tax cuts that will cost, over 10 years, $700 \nbillion, and presumably 10 years after that and 10 years after that. \nThat is a huge structural change to our revenue. Unemployment \ncompensation benefits are cyclical. They rise in difficult times, like \ntoday, and they fall as the economy recovers. So we are not talking \nabout a long-term commitment to a program of deficit enhancement; we \nare talking about short-term relief for struggling Americans.\n  I think these economists make the case extraordinarily well. I ask \nunanimous consent that their letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Economic Policy Institute,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 29, 2010.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President, Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Reid, \n     Congressman Boehner, and Senator McConnell: Congress must \n     decide whether to continue the Emergency Unemployment \n     Compensation program (EUC), a decision that will directly \n     affect millions of families and the entire economy. \n     Authorization for the additional benefits Congress has been \n     providing since the passage of the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act in February 2009 expires tomorrow, November \n     30, and millions of unemployed workers will soon be affected. \n     I write you out of concern for the jobless, who through no \n     fault of their own, cannot find work in an economy with only \n     one job vacancy for every five unemployed workers, and who \n     depend on EUC to pay their rent or mortgage, pay for \n     groceries and gas, and pay for their heating bills and other \n     utilities.\n       But I write also out of concern for the economy. Together \n     with Lawrence Katz of Harvard University, I gathered the \n     signatures of 33 prominent economists on the attached \n     statement, which warns that letting the Emergency \n     Unemployment Compensation program expire will weaken the \n     economy by reducing the spending of the unemployed and \n     overall consumer demand. All of us agree that EUC should be \n     extended for another 12 months and that there is no danger \n     that continuing to provide extended unemployment insurance \n     benefits will materially raise overall unemployment. We also \n     agree that deficit financing for EUC is prudent and will not \n     contribute significantly to long-term deficits.\n       We hope that you act swiftly to renew these benefits, for \n     the good of the economy and the well-being of millions of \n     deserving Americans who depend on them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lawrence Mishel,\n     President, Economic Policy Institute.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Statement From Leading American Economists\n\n       Continuing the about-to-expire federal emergency \n     unemployment insurance program, which provides extra weeks of \n     benefits to the long-term unemployed, is sensible economic \n     policy that will not only assist the unemployed but help \n     maintain spending, overall demand, and employment at this \n     critical point in the recovery. Given that there remains a \n     historically high number of unemployed workers per job \n     opening, there is no danger that continuing to provide \n     extended unemployment insurance will materially raise overall \n     unemployment. Eliminating these benefits, on the other hand, \n     will cause hardship for the long-term unemployed, scale back \n     spending, and weaken the\n\n[[Page S8284]]\n\n     economy since unemployment benefits are one of the most \n     effective means available to support overall demand. \n     Unemployment has remained above 9.0% for 18 months already \n     and will likely remain high for some time to come, making a \n     strong case for continuing the current program for another 12 \n     months. Moreover, the special provisions for extended \n     unemployment insurance during recessions have traditionally \n     been financed by short-term fiscal deficits and this remains \n     a prudent approach. The program will not contribute \n     significantly to long-term deficits because its costs will \n     diminish automatically as the economy recovers and \n     unemployment returns to more normal levels.\n\n\n                                SIGNERS\n\n         Henry J.

As I indicated before, their view has been echoed by the \nCBO. Tax cuts, in their view, are the least effective form of economic \nstimulus, and the most effective is unemployment insurance benefits.\n  On November 16, the Department of Labor released an independent study \nthat was commissioned during the Bush administration. It found that \nsince mid-2008, the Federal unemployment insurance program has saved \n1.6 million jobs in every quarter, averting 1.8 million layoffs per \nquarter at the height of the downturn, and reduced the unemployment \nrate by 1.2 points.\n  Separately, the Economic Policy Institute has found that continuing \nthe programs through the end of 2011 will support the creation of \n700,000 full-time equivalent jobs.\n  People who get unemployment insurance benefits tend to take that \nmoney and go to the grocery store or buy shoes for their children or \npay down, if they can, some of their credit card debt. Maybe in this \nholiday season they will buy an extra present for their children. That \nkeeps our economy moving, and it keeps the people in the grocery stores \nworking, people at department stores working, and the manufacturers \nproducing these goods working.\n  Our economy grew at 2 percent in the third quarter and in a recent \nWall Street Journal article, Goldman Sachs analyst Alec Phillips \nestimated that if unemployment insurance benefits expired, it would \nshave half a percentage point from growth. Such a decline would cost \nhundreds of thousands of jobs. So here is a policy that will expand \njobs, maintain jobs, and if we don't pursue it, we will find ourselves \ncontracting employment at the very time that all Americans are asking \nus to do something very clear-cut: get jobs, keep jobs, produce jobs, \nand find a way to create them. This could also engender a downward \nspiral because if the jobs contract, that could be the beginning of \nfurther contraction, and it could leave us in a worse situation.\n  So not only will families feel the brunt of this lack of unemployment \ncompensation benefits, it is the small businesses throughout every \ncommunity--it is the retailers and the people who depend upon their \nneighborhood customers to come in and buy the goods and services that \nnot only provide them what they need but also provides the cash flow \nfor small businesses to keep operating.\n  Failure to maintain unemployment insurance will mean that 2 million \njobless workers will lose benefits in December. Two million Americans, \nthis December, will stop receiving benefits. Several hundred thousand \nunemployed workers will lose their benefits every month, culminating in \nup to 6 million losing benefits by the end of 2011. Now is the time to \ngovern, the time to act, and now is the time to do what we have always \ndone in a situation like this. It is the time to act promptly and \ntimely and pass an extension of the unemployment insurance benefits.\n  We have seen over the last year delay after delay. We have seen \nbenefits expire only to retroactively be restored through procedural \nvotes and delays.\n  One of the ironies is that we get these procedural votes that we \ncan't move forward on a bill but, finally, when the bill comes up to a \nvote, there is overwhelming support, which suggests to me that the \nprocess of delay has taken primacy over the substance of policy. That \nis not worthy of our constituents and the crisis they face today in \nthis country. We have, as I said, continuously maintained unemployment \ncompensation benefits, and we have extended benefits whenever our \nunemployment rate nationally is above 7.2 percent. Republican \nadministrations, Democratic administrations, Republican Congresses, and \nDemocratic Congresses have always recognized that at the level of 9 \npercent unemployment, extended unemployment benefits were almost \nautomatic--something you had to do for all the reasons I have cited, \nsuch as the economic effects on the economy, but most fundamentally it \nis giving people a chance to just make ends meet until they can find a \njob.\n  So I think we are in a position where we must go forward. Acting now \nis the right thing to do, the responsible thing to do, and the wise \neconomic thing to do. We need to swiftly pass this 1-year extension.\n  Many colleagues are joining Senator Baucus, the chairman of the \ncommittee, in introducing this legislation. I urge at this point that \nwe move forward, and at this point I make the following request.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Before the Senator makes his request, may I pose a \nquestion to the Senator.\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his time and his leadership on \nthis issue. I am happy to join him. I want to make sure we put this \ninto the context of the lameduck session. This is a session when we are \ndebating tax cuts, and the position held by the other side of the aisle \nis that we should give tax cuts to those making $1 million a year in \nincome, which is roughly $20,000 a week. If I understand the \ndifferences in the Democratic position and the Republican position, we \nthink those making $1 million a year should get roughly $6,000 in tax \ncuts. They believe those making $1 million year should get $100,000 in \ntax cuts. I also understand if the Republican position prevails, it \nwill add $700 billion to the deficit over 10 years, just to give tax \ncuts to those making over $250,000 a year or $70 billion a year.\n  So their position, when it comes to tax cuts for the wealthiest in \nAmerica, is that we can afford to add $70 billion to the deficit with a \ntax cut for millionaires each year and not accept the reality that that \nis one of the poorest ways to spark growth in our economy. Our position \nis that, historically, when we reach high levels of unemployment--over \n7.2 percent--we have extended unemployment benefits. We are now at \nabout 9.6 percent. And we believe we should extend unemployment \nbenefits for those who have lost their jobs through no fault of their \nown. The benefits average about $300 a week for someone to keep their \nfamily in food, clothing, pay the utility bills in the winter, that \nsort of thing. And we are told by the Congressional Budget Office that \nunemployment benefits are the best catalyst for sparking growth in the \neconomy. It is money spent immediately by people who need disposable \nincome and who will turn around and purchase goods and services \nimmediately with it.\n\n[[Page S8285]]\n\n  So $70 billion for tax breaks--$70 billion in deficits each year for \ntax breaks for the wealthiest people in America, for something that \ndoesn't spark the economy, versus some $60 billion for extending the \nunemployment insurance benefits for 1 year, which will spark growth in \nthe economy. Is that the choice we are facing?\n  Mr. REED. I think the Senator from Illinois has stated it very \nclearly, very succinctly, and very accurately. That, apparently, is the \nchoice. It is a choice I find difficult to understand for the reasons \nthe Senator has laid out. We want to respond to the needs of so many \nfamilies, working families. And this is one of those programs that, by \ndefinition--if you qualify for unemployment benefits, you had a job, \nyou just lost it. So these are working families who are now looking for \nsome support as they search desperately for jobs.\n  As we pointed out too, not just in terms of the individual recipients \nbut for the economy overall, the benefit is substantial. It is about \n$1.90 in economic activity for every $1 that we put into the benefit. \nOn the other side of the spectrum, economists have looked at the impact \nof these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and find very little \ngrowth in economic activity, and, frankly, that makes sense. This is \nnot economics at MIT or Harvard or anyplace else. If you are struggling \nat $368 a month, it is not going to go into your vacation fund or for \nbuying objects of art. It is going to go to the grocery store and into \nall of the demands of a family. If you are fortunate enough through \nyour hard work and through your ingenuity to be making over $1 million \na year, your consumption package is not going to be altered \ndramatically by these tax cuts. That is the conclusion of the \neconomists, and I think the Senator said it very well.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3981\n\n  So I thank the Senator from Illinois, but at this juncture, I would \nlike to formally, Madam President, ask unanimous consent that the \nFinance Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 3981, \na bill to provide for a temporary extension of unemployment insurance \nprovisions, and that the Senate then proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; that the bill be read three times, passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements \nrelating thereto appear at the appropriate place in the Record, as if \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I object. And I have a \npay-for alternative on which I would like to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REED. If the Senator will pause for a moment, I am concluding, \nand then the Senator will have his own time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Again, I think it is unfortunate that we cannot move this \nbill. I think, to put it very succinctly, we will try again. I hope we \ncan. I hope we will for the sake of our country, small businesses, and \nfamilies across my State and in this Nation who need this help and \nassistance.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I wish to thank the \nSenator from Rhode Island, who passionately spoke about his proposal, \nhis bill to deal with a very important problem we are facing in the \nUnited States.\n  I am not the new person here anymore. Somebody came in yesterday. But \nI will say that it is still new to me that here we are, with 6\\1/2\\ \nhours before the benefits will expire, and we are now discussing this. \nGod forbid we actually think ahead and spend a little bit of \nforethought in preparing and working together to try to come up with \nsome type of solution before being faced with a 6\\1/2\\-hour deadline \nbefore the benefits expire. So, once again, I know I am not the newest \nguy anymore, but I have to say that this is not the way to do business \nin the Senate. And if it is, it needs to change.\n  So here we are. The Senator just spoke about our needing to do this \nto keep the economy moving. No, we have to start focusing on jobs. That \nis what we have to do to get this economy moving. We have to start \nfocusing on the things that are important--the deficit, the spending. \nYesterday, we couldn't even pass the 1099 fix--something small \nbusinesses and all businesses in this country are clamoring for. We \ncould not do that one thing--one thing. Now all of a sudden we are \ngoing to do another extension.\n  I have complete and total sympathy and understanding for this. I want \nto help. More than anybody here, I want to help. But to just keep \nthrowing money at a problem when it is not paid for, with 6\\1/2\\ hours \nleft, to put people on the spot instead of doing it the right way--\nworking together, getting together in an office with the leadership and \nthe people who care about these issues and coming up with a common \nsolution--makes no sense to me.\n  The reason we are having this high unemployment which my colleagues \nkeep referring to--9 percent unemployment--is because there is no \ncertainty in business. There is so much uncertainty right now in the \nbusiness world, whether it is with the financial services people or the \nestate planners. Right now, we have zero percent. If you die--folks say \nit is a good year to die because next year it could be 55 percent or it \ncould be less. Who knows. So there is so much money on the sidelines \nright now that we don't know what to do. It is not coming in to get the \neconomy moving.\n  We can't do the 1099 fix, we can't do the R tax credits, we can't \nwork on accelerated depreciation, and we haven't repatriated any of the \nmonies that are offshore. What do we do? We put up more and more \nroadblocks for businesses, so they do not want to hire these people off \nthe unemployment rolls. Yet here we are with 6\\1/2\\ hours left, people \naren't hiring, and we spent 7 days on food safety. Listen, I love to \neat as much as the next guy, but give me a break. We should have spent \n7 days working on the one thing the people who voted in November \nwanted--and they sent us a very powerful message--and that is getting \nour economy moving again; focusing on jobs, jobs, jobs; streamlining \nthe regulatory process; and firing away to get this economy moving. But \nwe needed to work on food safety. Oh my gosh, that was so important. I \nam glad I rushed back from our break to work on food safety. Now, I \nknow we have some issues in that regard, but don't you think the 1099 \nfix and unemployment benefits and all these other things are a little \nbit more important?\n  Some of my colleagues will say--the Senator from Illinois just said \nit--that we are here debating tax cuts. No, we are not. We are not \ndebating tax cuts. I have been here for every vote we have had. I have \nbeen to every meeting since I have been back here. Where were we \ntalking about tax cuts? Am I missing something? No, we haven't been \ntalking about tax cuts. We haven't debated or discussed anything to do \nwith business and getting our businesses and our economy moving again.\n  The recent job numbers in Massachusetts reflect over 280,000 people \nunemployed in my State alone--over 8 percent of the Massachusetts \nworkforce. As the Senator from Rhode Island mentioned--and I know Rhode \nIsland well; I eat in Federal Hill regularly--the unemployment is much \nhigher there. They have very serious problems. And one of the reasons \nwe have problems is because we are not focusing on anything to do with \nbusiness. We are not giving them the tools and resources they need to \nactually hire the people on the unemployment rolls. It is like a catch-\n22.\n  Nearly 15 million people across the country are unemployed, 6 million \nof them having been without work for 6 months or more. That is roughly \nfive people for every one job opening. Families in Massachusetts, Rhode \nIsland, and Illinois are all struggling. They sent that very powerful \nmessage a couple of week ago. They are struggling to make ends meet \nand, as the Senator from Rhode Island said, to buy food, to buy shoes, \nto buy extra Christmas presents. I understand that. But if they had a \njob and had the pride of going out and working hard each day and if \nbusinesses had that certainty of hiring that new employee, they could \ndo that and a lot more. They could actually invest in the future of our \ncountry.\n\n  We are in the midst of a historic economic crisis. I realize that. \nPeople are unable to find work, and I recognize that as well. The \nlonger they are out of\n\n[[Page S8286]]\n\nwork, the harder it is to actually find work and become employable.\n  I could go on and on as to how Congress has chosen to spend its time. \nI remember that before we went on break, before the elections, we \nwasted so much time on stuff that did nothing to help the economy. So \nhere we are. I figured that when we came back, after the message was \nsent, we would get it loudly and clearly--big change over in the House. \nHere we are. We are going to get right back to the economy. But what do \nwe do? We do food safety. Are you kidding me? People deserve better. \nThe people who are unemployed deserve better.\n  The consequences of our failure to act are the 15 million unemployed \nworkers in our country because they are unable to find that job. So \nhere we are, 6\\1/2\\ hours before the benefits are going to expire. And \nI do not want to see that happen. Let me make it very clear to anyone \nlistening or watching or however the press wants to regurgitate my \nstatements: I don't want this to happen. It doesn't need to happen. As \nmany of my colleagues know, if we fail to act today, 60,000 Bay Staters \nwill see their unemployment checks evaporate at the end of the week and \n800,000 workers will see their checks disappear. That number will \nincrease to 2 million by the end of December.\n  So we are faced with another important decision, as we are with every \nother decision we make here: Do we provide the important benefits by \nburdening future generations, by adding on to that almost $14 trillion \nnational debt, or do we provide the important benefits by raising taxes \non businesses that are already struggling?\n  If you want to talk about the Bush tax cuts, listen, that was a tax \npolicy proposed by a President, supported by Congress, and it has been \nthe tax policy for the last 10 years. To put a tax increase on anybody \nin the middle of a 2-year recession is going to add to these \nunemployment numbers and will be an absolute job killer.\n  So is there a better way? Of course. There is always a better way, \nespecially when we work together. We can always find a better way, as I \nhave tried to work with the Senator from Oregon and other Senators to \nfind commonsense solutions to our very serious problems. That is why I \nam once again offering an offset extension of unemployment benefits.\n  The funny thing is that the proposal--and this is what I find so \nironic. I will see where everyone wants to stand. If my colleagues want \nto do something today, I say to the Senators who are here and \nlistening, we can provide that 1-year extension. In fact, I am offering \nan offset that was supported by 21 Democrats yesterday when we tried to \ndo the 1099 offset bill, which I supported. I was a cosponsor, in a \nbipartisan manner. I supported both the Republican and the Democratic \nproposal just hoping, God forbid, we could get one thing done--just \none. Twenty-one Democrats supported that bill.\n  So here I am with my offer. My proposal is to offset the unemployment \ninsurance--sorry, I need to take a breath here--the offset they \nsupported yesterday would rescind unobligated discretionary funding. It \nis the same offset we did yesterday. So what is the difference? Do you \nknow what the difference is? People are hurting, and they need the help \nin 6\\1/2\\ hours. The 1099 fix we can address down the road, but others \nneed it in 6\\1/2\\ hours.\n  So for those who supported it yesterday, I am certainly hopeful that \nthey will support it again today. I don't know, is it me? I ask my \ncolleagues to join in and be cosponsors. Is it because I am a \nRepublican that we will not pass it? It is because it is my idea? I am \nthe almost new guy. I get that. But what about looking past party \npolitics, as I have done since the day I got here, to try to find \ncommonsense solutions for people who are hurting. And trust me, there \nare a lot of people hurting. Why don't my colleagues join me in \nsupporting this proposal that 21 other Democrats proposed yesterday and \nwho actually went down in the well and voted on? This is a truly \nbipartisan proposal that we should be able to rally around. I am \nconfident that we can work together, as the people demanded only a \ncouple of weeks ago.\n  As we enter the final weeks of this 111th Congress, there are several \npriorities that lie ahead. As I said earlier--I know I am getting \nworked up, but it just incenses me--we are here with 6\\1/2\\ hours \nremaining, and we just found out really today, or late yesterday, that \nwe were even going to talk about this. We have to provide that \ncertainty to businesses, from small mom-and-pop businesses all the way \nto the biggest corporations. They need to know what is up. They need to \nknow they can actually rely on us to set policy that allows them to \nplan for the future, so they can get those 9-plus percent people off of \nunemployment.\n  Do you think we are going to keep creating more and more government \njobs; that is it? We are just going to keep printing the money and \nthere is no consequence? There is plenty of consequence. The \nconsequence is not on our grandchildren now; we are at our great-great-\ngrandchildren as to paying this obligation back.\n  We still have to ensure that the Federal Government keeps running. \nLet me see: We have the estate tax issue, we have dealing with tax \nproposals or policy at all, we are trying to get the regulatory scheme \nin place so we can give businesses the incentive to maybe bring money \nback from the offshore accounts they are holding so they do not invest \nin other businesses in other countries, we have this issue--we have a \nlot of other things on the table and we have done nothing. We spent \ntime on food safety.\n  I love to eat. I have seen many people around here, we all love to \neat. I want my food safe, make no mistake about it. I do not want to \nbelittle that effort. But we need to provide money so people can \nactually go out and buy the food we are trying to make safe. We cannot \nkeep spending and borrowing with no regard to our future, to our fiscal \nfuture. We need to be fiscally responsible and find ways to pay for the \ninitiatives and policies that we think are important.\n  When you talk about the money--listen, it is not the government's \nmoney. It is people's money. When they have money, they traditionally \ninvest it, and they invest in businesses and they continue to get that \neconomic engine going. It is not the government's money.\n  It is also very clear to me that people want to work and they want us \nto focus on that one issue. I do not know why we are avoiding it--I do \nnot. Did you know we are avoiding that one issue that can get our \ncountry back on track? Let's just say we took all the recommendations \nfrom the debt commission that have been proposed. If we do not do the \nother things, it is going to be short-lived, if it works at all.\n  Creating jobs and supporting policies that improve economic growth \nhave been my priority and will continue to be my focus in the Senate. \nThere is nothing more important. I encourage the administration to \nimmediately drop everything and focus on the economy. It is the one \nthing that is our ticket out of the economic mess we are in right now; \ninstead, we are doing food safety.\n  I also think we need to give people that lifeline in order to get \nthem through the tough times. Make no mistake, I agree they need help. \nBut I look at it, are we going to do it from the bank account or are we \ngoing to put it on the credit card--bank account, credit card? How \nabout you folks up there--bank account, credit card? OK. I know what I \nwant to do. I will use the bank account. Let's use money that is \nalready in the system and put it to good use immediately by 12 o'clock \ntonight. Let's do it.\n  We can settle this tonight. We can provide that extension of benefits \ntonight. My bipartisan idea will allow that to happen and will prevent \nmillions of Americans from losing their benefits. Providing this 1-year \nextension will allow us to focus on the many other important priorities \nwe have and that we have to handle before the end of the year.\n  You want to stay through the holidays and everything. Hey, I am here. \nWhatever. My kids are grown; they do their own thing anyway. Do I want \nto stay here? Sure, I will stay. We will stay and we will go out and \ncelebrate Christmas here. Whatever. But we have so many things we need \nto do and we could do them right now.\n  I am glad food safety is done. We do not have to do it anymore. So \nwhat is next? Let me see--just pick something. I guarantee, I bet--I \nknow betting is illegal here--I will bet we do not do anything that has \nto do with the economy. I will bet you.\n\n[[Page S8287]]\n\n  I encourage my colleagues to join with me and stop using the credit \ncard and burdening additional generations with this tremendous debt \nthat we cannot afford.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4915\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the Finance Committee be discharged and the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4915; that all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken and the substitute amendment at \nthe desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, my colleague from Massachusetts has made a \nrather vigorous and impassioned statement. What I sense, though, is he \nis quite willing to put $700 billion of tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans on the credit card but not extend unemployment benefits, as \nwe have done persistently, decade after decade, without offsets, for \npeople who are struggling without work. So if we are talking about \ncoming together, avoiding increased deficits, let's look at this big \nissue of these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Let's look at the \noffsets there, I suggest.\n  I also suggest, in terms of his argument we are not doing anything, \nthat the record, unfortunately, of my colleagues on the other side, \nwith respect to this issue--and we are talking about the issue of \nunemployment compensation benefits extension--has been one of delay and \ndelay and delay. June 17 of this year we tried to extend these benefits \nand it failed in a cloture vote. They would not even let us get to the \nsubstance of the bill or amendments, perhaps, which could have paid for \nthem or tried to offset them.\n  Then we came back on June 24, a week later, and had another vote. Of \ncourse, again, by 57 to 41 it was opposed.\n  Now we come to July 20. It finally passed 60 to 40, the minimum \nnumber of votes. The vast majority of the opposing caucus still says \nno.\n  The notion that we are somehow blocking dealing with the economic \nissues is so far from reality. What we have seen is obstruction, \nparticularly when it comes to unemployment compensation benefits. Now \nhere we are again. As I said, when you look back to Republican \nadministrations and Democratic administrations, when we have had this \nlevel of unemployment, we have always managed to come together and to \ngo ahead and pass these measures on a bipartisan basis and not with \nthree cloture votes but with one perhaps procedural vote and then a \nsubstantive vote.\n  The issue, though, is let's not be selective. If we are serious about \nthe deficit, let's take some positive steps to reduce the deficit. One \nis not to extend tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans at $700 billion \nover 10 years. That is a positive step. If that is something that is \ngoing to be entertained by the other side, I encourage that discussion. \nBut as we go forward, we are going to come back, again, because \nultimately we have these discussions.\n  I think my colleague from Massachusetts has passion, sincerity, and \ngreat energy which he has brought to this body, but ultimately we are \ngoing to have to go to people in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, \nseveral million of them over the next year, and say: Sorry, you are not \ngetting any unemployment compensation benefits.\n  Will we go to the wealthiest and say: Oh, by the way, we took care of \nyou folks; you are getting $100,000 in tax benefits. I think we have to \ndeal with the immediate crisis. I think we have to deal with the \nfamilies who are struggling today. I think we have to do it now. I hope \nour leaders could work out an arrangement where we could come to this \nfloor and, in a scheduled debate, 5 hours on one side, 5 on the other, \nand take the vote. That has not been the record on unemployment \ncompensation in this Congress.\n  Again, I object. The issue, the offset, discretionary spending--I \nthink if you burrowed down into that, you would find that would be \nfunds of a whole category of programs that could be spent, should be \nspent, to help the economy move forward.\n  But I again urge we reconvene, that we once again see if we can work \nour way forward on these unemployment compensation benefits. We have \ndone this before through these procedural delays that were as a result \nof votes by my colleagues on this side not to take up the bill in a \ntimely manner. We had periods of time where unemployment lapsed and we \nhad to retroactively restore it. We may have to do that again.\n  If there is delay, if we are at the 11th hour, I, frankly, looking \nbackward, and others would have preferred an extension of benefits that \nwould have gone way past this point, would have gone into next year if \nwe had to. We are talking about a year's extension now. I hope we can \nget that. We will continue to fight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, once again, make no \nmistake, I have great respect for the Senator from Rhode Island. We \nworked on many regional issues--fishing and military issues. I respect \nhis service not only to the military but also to his State. But I have \nto respectfully disagree with his presentation and representation on \nsome of the issues.\n  He keeps referring back to the tax cuts for the rich. That is great. \nWe are not dealing with that right now. It is not something we are \ndealing with because we have not dealt with anything to do with any tax \npolicy or structure since I have been here--zero. We have not done the \nestate tax, we have not done any tax policies, we have not done \nanything. Now you want to kind of muck it up and talk about if you do \nthis, we should not do that. Listen, we are here, we have 6 hours and \n15 minutes to deal with this issue. I am not quite sure why it took so \nlong to get to this point. Why couldn't we have spent the last 7 days, \nwhen we were doing food safety, dealing with this? Why? Because there \nis no priority in taking care of people who are hurting and dealing \nwith the issues that are affecting our economy and our country on a \nvery real and personal basis.\n  My colleague says there have been delays, we should just do it for \nlonger than 1 year. He wants to do it for longer than 1 year? Great. \nPay for it. The reason there have been delays is because we wanted to \nfind a funding source. We could have initially taken it out of the \nunallocated stimulus dollars that were being used as special slush \nfunds for folks and agencies. That was one of the delays, I remember, \nbeing part of that. That didn't pass. I think I got two Democrats.\n  Yesterday, we did a 1099 fix and 21 Democrats supported it. What is \nthe difference? Now we are talking about real people--about kids. It is \nabout the kids. I keep saying it is about the kids. It is not just \nabout the kids who are here right now; it is about the future \ngenerations who are going to have to try to figure out a way to pay for \nthis insurmountable debt.\n  I reiterate, it is pretty simple--bank account, credit card. That is \nall I am saying. Happy to help, folks. The folks up there listening, go \nback and say to your friends and family: Senator Brown of Massachusetts \nsaid bank accounts, credit card. It makes sense.\n  I want to help. But I also want to streamline, consolidate this, weed \nout any fraud, waste, abuse, any money we are not using properly, and \nget it out the door into businesses and families and get the economy \nmoving again.\n  So here we are. I am very curious to see what is next. I enjoyed the \nfood safety. I voted for it. I gave some input on it, and I voted for \nit. I am happy to help. It is not going to be implemented in 6 hours \nand 15 minutes. The people need our help right now.\n  Madam President, I appreciate your paying attention and leading us. I \nam just hopeful that we can come together and use some common sense and \nstart to focus on the economy. It is the economy, period.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, every once in a while, Congress is faced \nwith a policy choice that clearly defines for the American people \nexactly who each member is fighting for.\n  We are nearing one of those clarifying moments here on the Senate \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S8288]]\n\n  Today, the authorization for emergency unemployment insurance \nexpires.\n  For the 15 million Americans who are struggling to put food on the \ntable as they look for work during this Great Recession, the \nRepublicans are demanding that we cancel the extra assistance we have \nprovided since the economic crisis began.\n  The Democrats will fight to ensure that this assistance to struggling \nmiddle class families continues through the holidays and through next \nyear.\n  Even as emergency unemployment assistance expires, the Republicans \nare demanding that the Bush-era tax cuts be extended for everyone.\n  Most importantly for them, the Republicans are demanding that the \nwealthiest people in America receive a massive tax cut, on top of the \nhundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts they have already pocketed \nover the last 10 years.\n  The Republicans don't think a $6,300 tax cut per year is good enough \nfor millionaires. They are demanding that millionaires receive $100,000 \nin tax cuts every single year--and if not, no one should receive \nanything.\n  The cost for permanently extending the Bush tax cuts for people \nmaking over $250,000? About $700 billion over the next 10 years alone. \nPlus interest.\n  Meanwhile, the Republicans oppose extending emergency assistance to \nthe unemployed, supposedly because it costs too much.\n  The cost for extending emergency unemployment assistance for 1 year? \nAbout $60 billion.\n  Just as importantly, the Republicans are demanding that we spend \nanother $700 billion on what CBO has determined is one of the weakest \noptions we have for spurring job growth.\n  The wealthy don't spend extra money they receive. That doesn't drive \nup demand for goods and services. Employers don't hire more people if \nthey can't sell more things.\n  At the same time, the Republicans oppose spending $60 billion on what \nCBO has determined is one of the strongest options we have for spurring \njob growth.\n  The unemployed spend every extra penny they receive as they buy the \nbare necessities, so aggregate demand gets a boost. Employers hire more \npeople when they can sell more things.\n  Democrats oppose spending $700 billion we don't have on tax cuts that \ndon't help people get back to work.\n  We support spending less than 10 percent of that amount--$60 \nbillion--on assistance to the unemployed that does help people get back \nto work.\n  We have seen this movie before, of course.\n  Republicans opposed extending the TANF Jobs program, which helped \ncreate 250,000 new jobs and which even some Republican Governors \napplauded as an example of smart government. That program expired at \nthe end of September.\n  They oppose extending the Obama tax provisions from the Recovery Act \nwhich benefit middle-class Americans, including the earned-income tax \ncredit, the child tax credit, and the making work pay credit. Those \nprovisions expire at the end of the year.\n  We can't afford those, the say. But we can afford to give another \n$700 billion to the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans, according to the \nRepublicans.\n  We have the money for the equivalent of another economic recovery \nbill but we can't afford a small fraction of that cost to help middle-\nclass families who need a helping hand.\n  The difference between the Republicans and Democrats couldn't be more \nclear.\n  Republicans won't allow tax cuts for anyone unless the rich get a far \nbigger share, and won't allow those looking for work to receive any \ncontinued emergency assistance.\n  The Democrats, on the other hand, want to give 98 percent of \nAmericans a tax cut, and want to help the unemployed keep food on the \nable for their children while they compete with the other 15 million \nunemployed Americans in looking for work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3987, introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3987) to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act \n     with respect to the applicability of identify theft \n     guidelines to creditors.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                         DEFINITION OF CREDITOR\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I wish to engage my colleagues Senator \nDodd and Senator Begich in colloquy.\n  I rise today in support of S. 3987, the Red Flag Program \nClarification Act of 2010, legislation that Senator Begich and I have \nintroduced to narrow the scope of section 114 of the Fair and Accurate \nCredit Transactions Act of 2003--the FACT Act. This section of the FACT \nAct directed financial regulatory agencies, including the Federal Trade \nCommission, FTC, to promulgate rules requiring ``creditors'' and \n``financial institutions'' to implement programs to detect and respond \nto red flags--patterns, practices, or specific activities--that could \nindicate identity theft.\n  The purpose of the Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010 is to \nidentify and limit the type of ``creditor'' that must be covered. If \nthe FTC's final red flags rule is implemented, this rule could require \nsmall businesses to undertake costly, burdensome measures to prevent \nidentity theft in industries where it poses little threat. Identity \ntheft is a serious problem, but the definition of ``creditor'' for \npurposes of the FTC's red flags rule is too broad and would cover small \nbusinesses that pose little risk to consumers.\n  Under the legislation that Senator Begich and I are proposing, only a \n``creditor'' that regularly and in the ordinary course of its business \nobtains or uses consumer reports in connection with a credit \ntransaction, furnishes information to consumer reporting agencies in \nconnection with a credit transaction, or advances funds would be \nrequired to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention \nand detection program.\n  So, for example, an accountant would not become a creditor simply for \nobtaining a consumer report--with the permission of any consumer whose \nreport is obtained--in order to examine the integrity of a company's \nmanagement.\n  And the legislation makes clear that an advance of funds does not \ninclude a creditor's payment in advance for fees, materials, or \nservices that are incidental to the creditor's ability to provide \nanother service that a person initiated or requested, such as the \nadvance payment of expert witness fees by a lawyer to support the \nrepresentation of a client.\n  Any other type of creditor may only be covered through a rulemaking \nbased upon an agency's determination that these types of creditors \noffer or maintain accounts that pose a reasonably foreseeable risk of \nidentity theft. Such creditors would receive notice that they could be \ncovered by a rule, and there would be a public airing of the issues \nwhen the proposed rule is published for notice and comment.\n  Could Senator Dodd, as chairman of the committee of jurisdiction, the \nSenate Banking Committee, provide us with some context regarding the \nlegislation under which the FTC's rule was promulgated?\n  Mr. DODD. Gladly. The FTC's red flags rule implementing section 114 \nof the FACT Act became effective on January 1, 2008. The rule applied \nto ``creditors,'' defined under the FACT Act the same way as in the \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act, ECOA, to include any person that sells a \nproduct or service for which the consumer can pay later.\n  After the red flags rule became final, many businesses and other \nentities indicated that they were not aware that they would be covered \nby this rule. At first, the FTC delayed enforcement of the rule several \ntimes to allow these entities time to come into compliance with the \nrule. Then, a number of professional organizations, including the \nAmerican Bar Association and the American Medical Association, sued the \nFTC for taking the position that professionals were ``creditors'' when \nthey allowed consumers to pay later, and would have to comply with its \nred\n\n[[Page S8289]]\n\nflags rule. On May 28, 2010, the FTC announced that it would delay \nenforcing its red flags rule through December 31, 2010, and asked \nCongress to pass legislation that would resolve any questions about \nwhich entities should be covered as ``creditors'' and to obviate the \nneed for further enforcement delays.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I thank the Senator. Unless this bipartisan bill becomes \nlaw, many small businesses for which identity theft is not a threat \ncould be required to spend time and effort to comply with the red flags \nrule implementing the FACT Act. This could require them to take time \naway from growing their businesses and creating jobs. Small businesses \nare the economic driver of our country, and in a time of high \nunemployment and stagnant economic growth, businesses should be focused \non job creation, and should not have to spend the money to comply with \nregulatory burdens disproportionate to the scope of the identity theft \nproblem.\n  This bill would address what the chairman of the FTC, Jon Leibowitz, \ncalled ``the unintended consequences of the legislation establishing \nthe red flags rule.'' While this list isn't exclusive, many small \nbusinesses such as doctor's and dentist's offices, pharmacies, \nveterinary clinics, accounting offices, and other types of health care \nproviders and other service providers were classified as ``creditors'' \nbecause they sometimes let clients pay after they provide their \nservices. This legislation makes clear that these small businesses \nshould not be swept under the red flags rule in the future just because \nthey allow payment to be deferred, when they don't offer or maintain \naccounts that pose a reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft.\n  I would ask the chairman of the Banking Committee if he agrees with \nmy description of what the Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010 \nwill accomplish?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, I agree that this bill narrows the applicability of \nthe red flag identity theft provisions of the FACT Act to cover those \ncreditors where identity thieves can do the most harm--creditors that \nuse consumer reports, furnish information to consumer reporting \nagencies, and other creditors that loan money, such as payday lenders, \nthat do not necessarily use consumer reports or furnish information to \nconsumer reporting agencies.\n  The legislation also makes clear that lawyers, doctors, dentists, \northodontists, pharmacists, veterinarians, accountants, nurse \npractitioners, social workers, other types of health care providers an \nother service providers will no longer be classified as ``creditors'' \nfor the purposes of the red flags rule just because they do not receive \npayment in full from their clients at the time they provide their \nservices, when they don't offer or maintain accounts that pose a \nreasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft.\n  Mr. THUNE. I applaud the FTC's cooperation in delaying implementation \nof their red flags rule to wait for congressional clarification on this \nissue and thank Senator Dodd for his assistance in drafting this \nlegislation. I am confident that our efforts to provide a legislative \nsolution that protects consumers and businesses alike can be achieved \nthrough this legislation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3987\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I came to the floor this afternoon to \nspeak on behalf of thousands of families in my home State of Washington \nwho stand to lose everything they have because a few Republican \nSenators continue to put politics ahead of policy. Men and women in my \nState from Seattle to Spokane, who lost their jobs through no fault of \ntheir own, get up every single day; they scour the want ads; they send \nout their resumes and desperately try to find work in an economy that \ncontinues to struggle. These workers do not want to be where they are. \nThey would like nothing more than to be back on the job doing what many \nof them have been doing for years--working hard and adding value to \ntheir companies and contributing to their communities and providing for \ntheir families.\n  But while they struggle to find work, many of them depend on the \nunemployment insurance programs we put in place to keep their heads \nabove water. This support has allowed these families to put food on the \ntable, to stay in their homes, and to pay for their children's health \ncare. These programs are not extravagant. But for a lot of our workers \ntoday, they made all the difference.\n  Workers such as a woman named Judy Curtis, who lives in Mill Creek, \nWA, wrote to my office urging us to do everything we could to \nreauthorize this program. She is a single mom who worked hard her whole \nlife to support herself and her developmentally disabled son Sean. She \ntold me she has been laid off twice since this downturn began and has \nbeen looking for a new job every day but without any luck.\n  Her unemployment insurance is going to be cut off on January 15 \nunless we reauthorize it. She does not know how she and her son are \ngoing to make it if that happens. So it is because of stories like hers \nthat I am so disappointed we are once again throwing families into a \nstate of uncertainty and turmoil by allowing these emergency \nunemployment programs to expire today. It does not make any sense.\n  Our economy still has a long way to go on the road to recovery. There \nare five job seekers for every open position today. The unemployment \nrate stands at 9.6 percent, and Senate Republicans think now is a good \ntime to cut families off from the support on which they depend? We \ncannot allow this to happen. We cannot sit on the sidelines while more \nfamilies are pushed into bankruptcy and lose their health care and \ntheir homes are foreclosed on. We cannot stand by and watch as our \nworking families who have already been pushed to the brink by this \nfinancial crisis--that they did not create by the way--are now shoved \nto the edge through no fault of their own. It is wrong and it does not \nmake sense. It does not make sense to pull billions of dollars out of \nour economy. It does not make sense to remove purchasing power from so \nmany families. And it does not make sense to lose the multiplier effect \nof these funds that keep millions of workers on the job. It certainly \ndoes not make any sense to do this right before the holidays.\n  I have to say, I find it very interesting that some of the Senators \nwho oppose extending this support for middle-class families are the \nvery same ones who have no problem extending\n\n[[Page S8290]]\n\nthe Bush tax cuts for the richest Americans that will cost us almost $1 \ntrillion. They talk about helping the economy. But economists across \nthe board agree that unemployment insurance programs are one of the \nbest ways to provide a much needed boost. So for those Republicans it \nis not about the deficit, it is not about what is best for the economy, \nit is certainly not about good policy, it is about politics, plain and \nsimple.\n  I am going to keep fighting to maintain these emergency unemployment \ncompensation benefits through next year for Judy Curtis's family, for \nthousands of families like hers across Washington State, and for \nmillions in America. These programs were not meant to continue \nindefinitely. But until our economy gets back on track, it would be \ndevastating to cut those families off from this critical lifeline now.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8290-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8290-S8291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I come to the floor to share \nletters from Ohioans from all corners of my State, letters mostly from \npeople who have lost their jobs and depend on something called \nunemployment insurance. It is insurance, not welfare, not giveaways. \nPeople work at a business. Their employer pays into the unemployment \ninsurance fund. Obviously, it is money the employee does not get as \nincome, so we could say it either way: the employee pays or the \nemployer pays. Either way it is insurance. They pay into a fund. When \nsomeone loses their job, they get assistance from the fund. This is why \nit works so well.\n  When the unemployment rate is above a certain level, a relatively \nhigh unemployment rate, we always have extended and maintained \nunemployment insurance benefits for those workers who have lost jobs. \nWe do that for two reasons: One, because it is the right thing to do if \nsomeone loses their job. Whether it is in Boulder in the State of the \nPresiding Officer or in Galion, OH, it is the humanitarian thing to do. \nThat worker who has lost their job can at least pay most of their bills \nthen, at least stay in the apartment or house and pay the mortgage, pay \nthe rent, pay for food, take care of the kids. They wouldn't be able to \nwithout the unemployment insurance monthly payments.\n  The second reason we do it is, as one of John McCain's chief economic \nadvisers said repeatedly, a dollar in unemployment benefits is about \nthe best stimulus for the economy one could have. When we give a tax \ncut to a millionaire, as most of my Republican colleagues want to do, \nif we give $10,000 to a millionaire, they will likely not spend it. \nThey have already spent their money on what they want because they have \nmore than enough to do that. So a tax cut doesn't mean much to them. \nBut an unemployment check means that an unemployed worker will spend \nthat money in the community, at the grocery store, buying shoes for the \nkids, paying the property tax, paying for their rent and gas bill, \npaying for gas in the car to go around looking for jobs. The money is \nrecirculated. It is a good economic stimulus and the right thing to do \nfor the worker who has lost their job. That is why the Presiding \nOfficer and others have fought so hard to make sure those benefits are \nthere. It is not welfare; it is insurance.\n  In spite of what some conservative politicians like to suggest, that \nit is people sitting around who don't want to work, almost everybody I \ntalked to--whether it was in Conneaut or Middleton or Sidney or \nPortsmouth--who lost a job wants to go back to work. Unemployment \ncompensation is never as much as the person is making on the job. That \nis under a formula. That is why they want to go back to work. Plus \nthese are hard-working people who understand that they need to keep \nlooking for a job.\n  For every job out there, there are roughly five people seeking a job. \nThat is a national figure. But in Ohio, it is no better. That is why I \nam going to share these letters.\n  I will start with Timothy from Fairfield. That is a prosperous \nsuburban Cincinnati community in Butler County in southwest Ohio. It \nhappens everywhere, not just the inner city, not just rural Appalachia. \nIt is not just small towns or medium-size cities. It is generally \npretty affluent suburbs.\n  He writes:\n\n       Unemployment extensions end in about two weeks and once \n     again my family worries about what the future will bring.\n       The last delay made us unable to pay many bills on time and \n     we still have not fully recovered.\n       If another delay happens we will certainly be put in such a \n     hole that I don't see us getting out of.\n       Not to mention it's the holiday season and I really don't \n     know what I would tell my 4 and 7 year old if Christmas \n     wasn't as it has been in the past.\n       I am in the manufacturing field. I worked as an inspector \n     and quality engineer.\n       This next week will be my first of my final 20 weeks of \n     Ohio emergency unemployment. I search for openings in quality \n     inspectors and quality engineers within a 50 mile radius of \n     our town.\n\n  How is he going to afford gas if his unemployment extension runs out?\n\n       I found zero results. I have been applying for retail jobs, \n     janitorial jobs, and maintenance jobs.\n       If I even get to interview the answer is the same. You are \n     way overqualified for this job.\n       I was told that the new sporting goods store had over 3,000 \n     applicants.\n       Are both sides willing to do what needs to be done to avoid \n     another delay? I don't know what we will do if the extension \n     is not passed in time.\n\n  It is unbelievable that my conservative colleagues are willing to \ngive tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires but are unwilling to \nmaintain unemployment benefits for people such as Timothy. When one \nthinks about that, it is also the anxiety that somebody like Tim feels \nabout his children, about his house, about his being able to provide \nwhat he needs during the Christmas season or any other season. So many \npeople in this country have to wait until the Republicans drop their \nfilibuster in order for us to maintain these benefits. That is pretty \nunconscionable.\n  Kelly from Summit County, the Akron area in northeast Ohio, writes:\n\n       Please help get the unemployment extension passed during \n     this session.\n       I am about to exhaust my benefits in three weeks. Everyday \n     I look for employment, but to no avail.\n       My mortgage company leaves no room for late or missing \n     payments.\n       I don't need the money for Christmas--I need it to pay my \n     bills and my mortgage.\n       There will be no Christmas this year, especially when I \n     begin to get behind on payments.\n\n  Kelly says what so many are saying in letters to our office, that \nthis is essential. Getting this relatively meager unemployment \nassistance, not a lot of money but enough to at least pay her rent--\nalthough I don't know if Kelly is male or female--but to pay the rent, \nnot Christmas presents, nothing elaborate, not even Christmas dinner \nbut to just pay the rent.\n  Richard from Summit County says:\n\n       I am writing to share the reality of my situation that I'm \n     sure millions are also experiencing. Today I filed my final \n     claim for unemployment. This is the moment that made me lay \n     awake at night. The reality is at our home there will be no \n     Thanksgiving and no Christmas this year. I hear carols being \n     played, I see ads for Christmas sales. It makes me depressed \n     like never before. I feel the gifts and celebrations are \n     meant for other people--the ``haves.'' No more money for my \n     diabetes medicine, dental checkups, eye drops for glaucoma. \n     Never have I felt like throwing in the towel before now.\n\n  I just wish my colleagues would talk to people like Richard: When I \nhear carols being played for Christmas sales, it makes me depressed \nlike never before. I feel the gifts and celebrations are meant for \nother people. No more money for my diabetes meds, no more dental \ncheckups, no more eye drops for glaucoma.\n  Unemployment benefits are not going to make him comfortable or rich, \nbut it will help him get through these rough times. Instead, to make a \npolitical point, my colleagues are saying we are not going to maintain \nunemployment benefits.\n  The last one I will read is from Jacqueline from Cuyahoga County in \nthe Cleveland area:\n\n\n[[Page S8291]]\n\n\n       I have been an unemployed human resources professional for \n     a year and a half. Even after having applied for over 170 \n     jobs, I am still very active in my job search.\n\n  These are not people sitting around cashing their checks. She is \nstill very active in her job search.\n\n       I go to at least 2 networking events/meetings per week and \n     I keep a positive attitude in spite of my situation. Yes, I \n     have applied for jobs in other fields or professions which \n     use similar and transferable skills. I get no response. I \n     have worked with recruiters and head hunters, online \n     networks, and have appealed to friends and family members to \n     look for opportunities. I have worked full-time since I was \n     16 years old, even through college.

We have been through this for \nthe third time, I believe, in the last year or so where we have begged \nand cajoled and pleaded and asked and done whatever we can to get our \ncolleagues to say yes, to not filibuster, to get our colleagues to say \nyes, to get the supermajority, the 60 votes we need to extend the \nunemployment benefits.\n  There is a lot of fear out there. Whether it is in Denver or \nCleveland, whether it is in Trinidad or Mansfield, there is all kinds \nof anxiety and fear and anguish out there.

Over the last few months, our Nation has mourned \nthe loss of several lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender teenagers \ndriven to suicide because of hateful and ignorant bullying and \nharassment. These tragic circumstances brought families, friends, and \nconcerned citizens together through vigils on public squares in \ncommunities all over this country and on college campuses throughout \nthe Nation. Together, millions of fellow Americans have drawn attention \nto intolerance and violence that LGBT Americans face each day. \nTogether, we can ensure all LGBT Americans that life will get better \nfor them.\n  As a father, I cannot bear to imagine the unspeakable pain endured by \nthe parents of those teenagers who tragically took their own lives. No \nparent should have to bury a child. No child should ever feel so \nhopeless and so forgotten and so alone and so isolated that suicide \nseems like their only escape. But the rash of highly publicized \nsuicides of LGBT students not only highlights the national epidemic of \nbullying these students face, it also reminds us that we all as adults, \nas clergy, as educators, or as peers of these students--we all have a \nrole to play in preventing discrimination.\n  Bullies target the vulnerable and subject them to cruelty through \ntaunts in the classroom or on the Internet, through chants on the \nplaying field or physical abuse in the neighborhood. Prejudices based \non religion or race or disability or sexual orientation or gender or \nphysical or intellectual differences too often translate into physical \ntorment and isolation and abuse against others.\n  LGBT youth, in particular, are frequently targeted by bullies. Public \nsurveys indicate that 80 percent of LGBT students report regular \nharassment by fellow students--a rate three times that of heterosexual \nteens, three times the rate of their heterosexual peers. Seventy-five \npercent of high school students routinely hear homophobic remarks in \nschool, reinforcing stereotypes and prejudices. Without a safe space to \nspeak openly with a caring adult or a like-minded peer, victims are \nleft to question their self-worth.\n  On top of the self-doubt and insecurity that all young people feel \nalready regardless of gender or race or sexual orientation--we have all \nbeen through that certainly as young teenagers and older teenagers, \ntoo, for that matter, but add to that the kind of insecurities that are \nput on them by bullying tactics, by so many people spouting homophobic \nremarks.\n  Too many young gay men and women, boys and girls, are forced into \nsecrecy about who they are rather than affirming the person they should \nproudly be.\n  A brave young Ohioan named Nicholas sent me a letter detailing an \nattack by a schoolyard bully. Here is what Nicholas wrote:\n\n       On September 18th, 2009 I was attacked by a student at my \n     school for being gay. This student beat me in the head with a \n     hammer three times. He chased me down so he could get the \n     last two hits. The student attacked me for being gay. I have \n     no way of using this attack to promote gay rights, to promote \n     gay equality, but you do. And you could do this for me. I \n     need your help more than anything. No one deserves to go \n     through what I went through.\n\n  My message to Nicholas and to all LGBT Americans is this: You are not \nalone. Life will get better. You can find the love and acceptance you \ndeserve, and you will find the love and acceptance you deserve, free \nfrom fear and hate. You will realize your full potential every bit as \nmuch as anyone else because things are changing in this country.\n\n  There is no acceptable justification for the violence experienced by \nNicholas or the physical and emotional mistreatment of LGBT students in \nour schools and in our communities. That is why the Senate must take \ncrucial steps to ensure that schools are safe places for learning, safe \nplaces for students, and not breeding grounds for bullying.\n  First, we must pass the Safe Schools Improvement Act which would help \nschools implement LGBT-inclusive programming to combat bullying and \nharassment. Second, we must pass the Student Nondiscrimination Act \nwhich would bar schools which receive public money from implementing \nprograms that discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.\n  Legislation alone, of course, will not eradicate or put an end to \nbullying, but we also know what legislation did for women, for \nchildren, for civil rights. Attitudes change over time. Legislation \nhelps accelerate that change. That is why those two pieces of \nlegislation matter. They will be major steps toward ensuring safety and \nequal treatment for all students in our school systems.\n  Parents and teachers also have a special responsibility to help LGBT \nyouth confront the bullying they face at school. They, too, should \nensure that every student knows she is valued, knows he is valued, \nregardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  LGBT community centers or national organizations such as the Gay, \nLesbian and Straight Education Network are valuable resources for \nstudents, parents, and educators.\n  I remember several years ago an event where students sat together as \npart of a gay/straight alliance at a high school in western Cuyahoga \nCounty. There were 10 students at 2 different tables, 5 gay students, 5 \nstraight students, all supporting one another, understanding each other \nand accepting their differences. They can still care about one another, \nand they can protect them, in many cases, from some of the bullying \nthat might have befallen some of them.\n  To our own LGBT students who are either forced to live a lie or face \nhostility for simply living their lives, all\n\n[[Page S8292]]\n\nof you should know there are resources to help you in times of need. \nThe Trevor Project is the leading national organization focused on \ncrisis and suicide prevention among lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, and questioning youth. For more information, if you are \nfeeling alone, anyone watching today feeling alone, helpless, or in \ncrisis, people can visit the Trevor Project's Web site, \nthetrevorproject.org, or they can call the hotline at 866-488-7386.\n  For anyone who is in suicidal crisis or in need of help, the National \nSuicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week \nby calling 1-800-273-TALK.\n  To Nick: I don't normally come to the floor and talk about a service \nlike this. I think, though, when people feel alone, they don't always \nknow there is help out there for them. Young people need to know that \nit is getting better, that life will get better for them, so it is \nimportant to share that information on the Senate floor.\n  To Nicholas: History is on your side. It will, in fact, get better. \nWorkers fought for the right to organize, women fought for the right to \nvote, African Americans fought for equal justice, and now LGBT \nAmericans of all backgrounds are fighting for equality.\n  It is up to us to join this fight. It is up to us to be on the side \nof people whose lives are a little bit more difficult, perhaps, than \nothers' lives. It is that spirit of inclusion, it is the pursuit of the \nAmerican dream, that will, in fact, make it better for these young \npeople, and it will make it better for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Pearson\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of LCpl Brandon W. Pearson. Lance \nCorporal Pearson, who was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine \nRegiment, Regimental Combat Team-2, I Marine Expeditionary Force \nForward, 1st Marine Division, out of Camp Pendleton, CA, died on \nNovember 4, 2010, from wounds he received while supporting combat \noperations in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. He was 21 years old.\n  A native of Colorado, Lance Corporal Pearson graduated from Ralston \nValley High School in Arvada. He was serving his second tour of duty. \nAlthough this was his first tour in Afghanistan, his battalion was \nassigned to one of the most dangerous districts in Helmand Province.\n  During his 3 years of service, Lance Corporal Pearson distinguished \nhimself through his courage, dedication to duty, and willingness to \ntake on any job. He was given numerous awards and medals, including the \nMarine Corps Good Conduct Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the National Defense Service \nMedal.\n  Lance Corporal Pearson worked on the front lines of battle, serving \nin the most dangerous areas of Afghanistan. He is remembered by those \nwho knew him as a consummate professional with an unending commitment \nto excellence. Friends and loved ones remember Lance Corporal Pearson's \ndedication to friends and family. He was always there when someone was \nin a tight spot. His decision to serve influenced a close friend to \njoin the Marines as well. All remember his unwavering bravery.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Lance \nCorporal Pearson's service was in keeping with this sentiment by \nselflessly putting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He \nlived with a sense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones \nthroughout Afghanistan. And though his fate on the battlefield was \nuncertain, he pushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her \nsafety, and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he \ntouched, Lance Corporal Pearson will forever be remembered as one of \nour country's bravest.\n  To Lance Corporal Pearson's entire family--I cannot imagine the \nsorrow you must be feeling. I hope that, in time, the pain of your loss \nwill be eased by your pride in Brandon's service and by your knowledge \nthat his country will never forget him. We are humbled by his service \nand his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8293-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8293-S8294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNITED STATES-KOREA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as our economy struggles to recover from \nthe worst recession since the Great Depression, we must look at all \nways to create jobs here at home. One obvious way to create jobs is to \nsell more products to overseas markets. That's why President Obama has \nannounced the goal of doubling U.S. exports by the year 2015. That is \nan admirable goal and one that I support.\n  To achieve that goal we have to examine our trade policies and change \nthem when they are not working. That is surely what we need to do when \nit comes to the so-called U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement and \nautomotive trade.\n  This agreement, still being negotiated, would perpetuate an unlevel \nplaying field that unfairly disadvantages U.S. automotive exports. One \nof the reasons the agreement has not been brought before the U.S. \nCongress for approval is because the agreement is skewed in favor of \nKorean automakers.\n  The Bush administration made a major error in how it approached the \ngrowing field of electric vehicles during treaty negotiations. The \nagreement would allow for a 10 year phase-out of the 8 percent Korean \ntariff on hybrid electric passenger vehicles and the 2.5 percent U.S. \ntariff. This is not a fair deal for U.S. electric car exports. It's bad \nenough that the current Korean electric car tariff is more than three \ntimes the U.S. tariff. This agreement would lock in place for 10 years \nKorea's electric car tariff advantage as it is phased out. Why in the \nworld would we agree to that?\n  It is as if you beat me up eight times a day and I beat you up two \ntimes a day and you expect me to be happy when you reduce that beating \nto seven times per day--that is still not much of a deal for me.\n  It is a stubborn thing this image some people have of free trade. It \nis like a blind faith belief that any trade agreement is automatically \ngood for the United States. This seems to hold true no matter how many \nAmerican jobs may have been lost as a result of unfair trading \npractices by our trading partners and no matter how bad a deal a \nspecific free trade agreement might be for certain sectors in the \nUnited States. The response always seems to be the same for those that \ncriticize an unbalanced free trade agreement: they call the critics \nprotectionists.\n  The protectionism enmeshed in the U.S.-Korea trade relationship is \nprotectionism by Korea. Until 1989 Korea did not even allow imported \nautos into its market. Once it did officially allow imported vehicles \ninto its market, Korea found other, less visible ways of keeping them \nout, including maintaining tariff and nontariff barriers, such as \ndiscriminatory taxes based on engine size, unique standards, inadequate \nregulatory transparency, and inadequate ability of stakeholders to \nprovide input at an early stage into the development of regulations and \nstandards.\n  When it comes to automotive trade with Korea, the numbers tell the \nstory. Korea has free unfettered access to the U.S. market and we have \nextremely limited access into Korea's market.\n\n[[Page S8294]]\n\n  Last year Korea shipped 476,833 autos to the United States. And while \nKorea relies on exports to support its domestic auto makers, Korea \nremains one of the most closed auto markets in the world. In a market \nof almost 1.5 million annual vehicle sales, the U.S. exported just \n5,878 autos to Korea last year. And it's not just American autos that \nare being kept out. Vehicles made in Korea account for 94 percent of \nthe Korean market--only 6 percent of vehicles sold in Korea are \nimports. That is lower than every other developed country except Japan. \nIn the U.S., over 41 percent of our auto market is made up of imports. \nIn Germany that number is 55 percent, in Mexico it is 57 percent, and \nin Spain, Canada and Italy it is over 70 percent or higher.\n  Korea's protected automotive market provides a huge source of profit \nand jobs for Korea and, in contrast, it is a huge source of trade \ndeficits and job loss for the United States. About 74 percent of the \n$10.6 billion U.S. trade deficit with South Korea is in automotive \ntrade.\n  So to those who say we are protectionist when we complain about this, \nI respond that we are not the protectionists and we have not protected \nour automotive market. The nearly 500,000 Korean-made vehicles that \ncome into the U.S. market each year validate this point, as does our \n2.5 percent auto tariff compared to Koreas 8 percent auto tariff and \nnumerous non-tariff barriers that keep our vehicles out of Korea.\n  Despite efforts by the U.S. Government for over a decade to open the \nKorean auto market, Korea has successfully kept its market closed. \nAuto-specific agreements negotiated in 1995 and 1998 failed to make any \nprogress in opening Korea's automotive market. Although the previous \nagreements were intended to sweep away some of the most overt non-\ntariff barriers, Korea quickly replaced them. For instance, the year \nafter the 1998 auto-specific agreement was signed committing Korea to, \n``Not take any new measures that directly or indirectly adversely \naffect market access for foreign passenger vehicles'' Korea introduced \nthree new and unique auto safety standards: front tow hook, headlamp, \nand remote keyless entry. In the 3 years after that, Korea introduced \nseven more auto safety and emissions regulations. And in the 4 years \nafter that, Korea introduced another seven, and the list continues. Our \nprotests were for naught.\n  Any trade agreement with South Korea should level the playing field \nfor U.S. auto exports. Unfortunately, the pending agreement, reached \nmore than 3 years ago but now being renegotiated, leaves South Korea \nwith the effective ability to use rules and regulations to continue \nlimiting automotive imports into the Korean marketplace. Korea has used \nsuch rules and regulations before to discriminate against imported \nvehicles and they will be used again unless we have a strong mechanism \nto remove them. This agreement does not include such a mechanism to \ndeal with any new nontariff barriers, such as auto safety standards or \nemissions regulations that Korea could introduce once the current draft \nagreement is entered into and approved by the Congress.\n  The agreement is strongly opposed by Ford and Chrysler because the \nagreement does not ensure that South Korea will not take measures to \nimpede access of imported U.S. made cars. GM is neutral on the \nagreement because it gained access to the Korea market by buying \nDaewoo, not by exporting cars to Korea from the United States.\n  Ensuring fair access to the Korean market would have an important \nimpact on our auto industry's drive to regain its competitive strength \nand health. We need to fight for American jobs, not let them go \noverseas as a result of poorly negotiated trade agreements. We need to \nfind a way to gain meaningful access to Korea's auto market and so far \nthis trade agreement has not achieved that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8294-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8294-S8295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CLAIMS RESOLUTION ACT OF 2010\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today regarding the Claims \nResolution Act of 2010. It is a rare day in the Congress that we have \nan opportunity like this to end, once and for all, decades-old \ninjustices and water related claims against the government so that we \ncan move forward together. I am proud that the House of Representatives \npassed the Claims Resolution Act, which passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent on Friday, November 19.\n  The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 includes the Cobell settlement, \nwhich settles claims resulting from mismanagement of trust accounts of \nclose to 300,000 American Indians.\n  It includes the Pigford settlement, which settles discrimination \nclaims by black farmers against the USDA.\n  It settles water related claims of tribes in Arizona, New Mexico, and \nMontana.\n  The bill is fully offset.\n  Each settlement in this package has its own history--each compelling \nin its own regard--that has brought us to this day of resolution. I \nwant to focus in particular on the Cobell settlement and the Crow Water \nCompact, which are both so important to Montana.\n  Tribal members comprise over 6 percent of Montana'spopulation. \nAmerican Indians live in every county in Montana, and our State has \nseveral counties where more than half of the population is comprised of \ntribal members. Nine percent of Montana's land base is located within \nthe boundaries of our State's seven Indian Reservations.\n  The Cobell settlement resolves the class-action lawsuit brought by \nNative American representatives and lead plaintiff Elouise Cobell, a \nmember of the Blackfeet Tribe in northwestern Montana, against the U.S. \nGovernment. This case dealt with the mismanagement of Indian trust \nassets by the U.S. Government.\n  In 1887 the Federal Government allotted tribal lands to individual \nIndians in parcels between 40 and 160 acres. The Department of Interior \nwas supposed to hold these parcels in trust for a period of 25 years \nand then turn them over to the individual Indians. The Department of \nInterior has held these allotments in trust until the present day. \nDuring the 123 years since 1887, these lands have become highly \nfractionated as successive generations of Indian owners bequeathed the \nland to their children.\n  Today the Department of the Interior holds about 56 million acres of \nland in trust for individual Indians. These 56 million acres generate \napproximately $357 million annually in coal sales, timber sales, oil \nand gas leases, and grazing leases. This $357 million is supposed to be \ndispersed to the over 230,000 Indians who have an interest in various \nparcels.\n  In the Cobell case, the plaintiffs sought a historical accounting of \nwhat individuals were owed and the Department of Interior contended \nthat it could not provide such an accounting.\n  This case has been going on for 14 years, leaving the plaintiffs \nwithout resolution of their claims and diverting attention and \nresources away from other projects in Indian Country. On December 8, \n2009, Secretary Salazar and the plaintiffs agreed to a $3.4 billion \nsettlement. It is a testament to both sides in this litigation that a \nfair agreement has been reached.\n  The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 provides the funding needed to \nimplement this settlement. I am proud of the diligence and focus with \nwhich Eloise Cobell pursued justice in this case. I am proud that she \nis a Montanan, proud of the result, and proud of the Congress for doing \nthe right thing.\n  I am just as proud of the action we took with regard to the Crow \nWater Rights Settlement Act of 2010. The Crow Tribe has a membership of \napproximately 12,000 people. About 7,900 reside on the Crow Indian \nReservation in Montana. It is the largest of Montana's seven \nreservations, comprising approximately 2.3 million acres. The current \nreservation was established by the Treaty of Fort Laramie with the \nUnited States dated May 7, 1868. At the time of its establishment, the \nreservation comprised nearly 5.9 million acres in both Wyoming and \nMontana. However, over time the reservation was reduced by nearly 3.6 \nmillion acres. The last cession of Crow land, in 1904, included what \ncame to be known as the Ceded Strip, 1 million acres on the north side \nof the reservation.\n  There are a number of large streams that flow through the Crow Indian \nReservation, including the Bighorn River and its tributaries, one of \nwhich is the Little Bighorn River. Another significant stream on the \nwestern portion of the Crow Indian Reservation is Pryor Creek and its \ntributaries.\n\n[[Page S8295]]\n\n  The Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2010 ratifies the Crow-\nMontana Water Rights Compact, which was adopted by the Montana State \nLegislature in 1999. It establishes tribal water rights and settles \nclaims against the government. The bill provides for funding that will \nbe used to more fully develop tribal water resources. This water \ncompact was endorsed by the administration--one of the first to receive \nthis level of consensus and support.\n  I commend the tribe and the administration, particularly Chairman \nCedric Black Eagle and the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, \nMike Connor, and their respective teams for their hard work on this. I \nalso want to thank the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Chairman Dorgan \nand Ranking Member Barasso, for their work reaching consensus. Finally, \nI want to thank my colleague from Montana, Senator Jon Tester, who has \nworked so hard to push this through the Senate.\n  This was truly a bi-partisan effort with cooperation here in the \nSenate from Senator Bingaman, Senator Kyl, Senator Dorgan, and Senator \nGrassley, all of whom worked together and compromised so that we could \ncome together today and do the right thing.\n  With the House passage of this bill, we are settling decades-old \ninjustices and claims against the government. We are bringing our \nNation closer together. I am proud to stand here today, having been a \npart of making this happen, and I look forward to the day that we see \nPresident Obama's signature on this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8295-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO GREYSON BUCKINGHAM\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

COLLIER\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I congratulate Professor \nJohn Collier for being recognized as the 2010 New Hampshire Professor \nof the Year. This prestigious award recognizes Professor Collier's \nextraordinary dedication to undergraduate teaching and his positive \ninfluence on the lives and careers of his students.\n  Professor Collier is the Myron Tribus Professor of Engineering at \nDartmouth, and has been teaching the introductory engineering course at \nDartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering since the 1980s. His course is \nextremely popular among students because of its emphasis on practical, \nhands-on skills and problem solving. With Professor Collier's expert \nguidance, students in his introductory engineering course work in teams \nto solve real-world engineering problems in creative ways. Many former \nstudents of Professor Collier's note that the system of thinking they \nlearned in his classes proved to be not only a cornerstone of their \nundergraduate educations but also their chosen professions.\n  Professor Collier is an expert on orthopedic implant design and \nengineering, and one of the world's foremost researchers on how and why \nimplants fail. Failed implants are sent to his lab by the thousands, \nand his research is often used by implant manufacturers to improve the \nquality of their products.\n  The U.S. Professors of the Year program acknowledges the most \nexceptional undergraduate instructors in the country--those who stand \nout in their teaching and are a positive influence on the lives and \ncareers of their students. It is important that we recognize the \ncontributions that dedicated professors like John Collier make in \neducating young people. I am extremely proud that Professor Collier has \nbeen recognized with this distinguished honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "30", "month": "11", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/11/30/senate-section/article/S8295-6", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8295-S8296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRANSMITTING NOTIFICATION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ALTERNATIVE PAY \nPLAN FOR LOCALITY PAY INCREASES FOR CIVILIAN FEDERAL EMPLOYEES COVERED \nBY THE GENERAL SCHEDULE AND CERTAIN OTHER PAY SYSTEMS IN JANUARY 2011--\n                                 PM 68\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  The law authorizes me to implement an alternative pay plan for \nlocality pay increases for civilian Federal employees covered by the \nGeneral Schedule\n\n[[Page S8296]]\n\nand certain other pay systems in January 2011, if I view the \nadjustments that would otherwise take effect as inappropriate due to \n``national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the \ngeneral welfare.''

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nan offset against income tax refunds to pay for restitution and other \nState judicial debts that are past-due; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, along with my colleagues Senators \nSessions, McCaskill, and Thune, I am introducing a bill to help crime \nvictims and state courts recover the restitution and fees that are owed \nto them. This bipartisan bill would accomplish this worthy goal by \nintercepting tax refunds of deadbeat debtors who've failed to pay \nrestitution or court fees. If enacted, this bill would essentially \nallow state courts to cross-reference outstanding debts with the IRS \nand use existing procedures to withhold tax refunds in order to satisfy \npast due debts.\n  This bill would not only deliver justice to crime victims who are \nowed restitution, but would also provide much-needed resources to help \nkeep court rooms open and court programs operating. At a time when our \nState and local governments are struggling to find funding for vital \nprograms--including keeping courthouse doors open--unpaid court fees \nrepresent an important source of revenue that should be captured. This \nbill would help close budget gaps and provide additional revenue \nwithout raising taxes or imposing any new costs or burdens. In fact, \nparticipation in the program would be optional for states, but I expect \nmost states to participate and to benefit greatly from this bill.\n  This bill would operate the same way as the very successful child \nsupport debt collection system. The bill will allow states to share \ninformation on outstanding restitution owed and court debts with the \nIRS, which would then be required to intercept any Federal tax refunds \nof debtors and send that money to the victim or court owed that debt.\n  It has been estimated by the National Center for State Courts that \noutstanding court debts across the country total approximately $15 \nbillion. In my home State of Oregon alone, the outstanding restitution \nand court fee debt amount is $987 million. Only a portion of \noutstanding debts are owed by individuals who will receive Federal tax \nrefunds, so a portion of court debts would not be collected \nimmediately. Nonetheless, the State of Oregon estimates that passage of \nthis bill would allow the state to collect $30 million per year.\n  Without this straight-forward and efficient mechanism, the collection \nof victim restitution and court debts is a costly and time-consuming \nprocess. Enactment of this bill would reduce the fiscal cost and \nadministrative burden that victims and courts bear in attempting to \ncollect those debts. Again, in the midst of a challenging fiscal \ncrisis, it only makes common sense to collect revenues that are already \nowed--through an efficient and convenient method.\n  Because this bill would benefit both the court system, and those who \nrely upon it, the Court Fee Tax Intercept Act is endorsed by a broad \narray of court, government, law enforcement, and crime victims \norganizations. The bill is supported by the National Center for Victims \nof Crime, the National District Attorneys Association, the American \nProbation and Parole Association, the Conference of Chief Justices, the \nConference of State Court Administrators, the National Association for \nCourt Managers, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the \nNational Association of Counties, and the Government Finance Officers \nAssociation.\n  I urge all colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 3991. A bill to provide collective bargaining rights for public \nsafety officers employed by States or their political subdivisions; \nread the first time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3991\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies, it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) State and local public safety officers play an \n     essential role in the efforts of the United States to detect, \n     prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks, and to respond to \n     natural disasters, hazardous materials, and other mass \n     casualty incidents. State and local public safety officers, \n     as first responders, are a component of our Nation's National \n     Incident Management System, developed by the Department of \n     Homeland Security to coordinate response to and recovery from \n     terrorism, major natural disasters, and other major \n     emergencies. Public safety employer-employee cooperation is \n     essential in meeting these needs and is, therefore, in the \n     National interest.\n       (3) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and the representatives of their employees to reach \n     and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and \n     working conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts \n     through negotiations to settle their differences by mutual \n     agreement reached through collective bargaining or by such \n     methods as may be provided for in any applicable agreement \n     for the settlement of disputes.\n\n[[Page S8300]]\n\n       (4) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n       (5) Many States and localities already provide public \n     safety officers with collective bargaining rights comparable \n     to or greater than the rights and responsibilities set forth \n     in this Act, and such State and local laws should be \n     respected.\n\n     SEC. 3.

or\n       (8) to preempt or limit the laws or ordinances of any State \n     or political subdivision of a State that provide for the \n     rights and responsibilities described in section 4(b) solely \n     because such law or ordinance does not require bargaining \n     with respect to pension, retirement, or health benefits.\n\n     For purposes of paragraph (6), the term ``employee'' includes \n     each and every individual employed by the political \n     subdivision except any individual elected by popular vote or \n     appointed to serve on a board or commission.\n       (b) Compliance.--\n       (1) Actions of states.--Nothing in this Act or the \n     regulations promulgated under this Act shall be construed to \n     require a State to rescind or preempt the laws or ordinances \n     of any of the State's political subdivisions if such laws \n     provide rights and responsibilities for public safety \n     officers that are comparable to or greater than the rights \n     and responsibilities described in section 4(b).\n       (2) Actions of the authority.--Nothing in this Act or the \n     regulations promulgated under this Act shall be construed to \n     preempt--\n       (A) the laws or ordinances of any State or political \n     subdivision of a State, if such laws provide collective \n     bargaining rights for public safety officers that are \n     comparable to or greater than the rights enumerated in \n     section 4(b);\n       (B) the laws or ordinances of any State or political \n     subdivision of a State that provide for the rights and \n     responsibilities described in section 4(b) with respect to \n     certain categories of public safety officers covered by this \n     Act solely because such rights and responsibilities have not \n     been extended to other categories of public safety officers \n     covered by this Act; or\n       (C) the laws or ordinances of any State or political \n     subdivision of a State that provide for the rights and \n     responsibilities described in section 4(b), solely because \n     such laws or ordinances provide that a contract or memorandum \n     of understanding between a public safety employer and a labor \n     organization must be presented to a legislative body as part \n     of the process for approving such contract or memorandum of \n     understanding.\n       (3) Limited enforcement power.--In the case of a law \n     described in paragraph (2)(B), the Authority shall only \n     exercise the powers provided in section 5 with respect to \n     those categories of public safety officers who have not been \n     afforded the rights and responsibilities described in section \n     4(b).\n       (4) Exclusive enforcement provision.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of the Act, and in the absence of a waiver of \n     a State's sovereign immunity, the Authority shall have the \n     exclusive power to enforce the provisions of this Act with \n     respect to employees of a State.\n\n     SEC. 9.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Restore Online Shoppers' \n     Confidence Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Internet has become an important channel of \n     commerce in the United States, accounting for billions of \n     dollars in retail sales every year. Over half of all American \n     adults have now either made an online purchase or an online \n     travel reservation.\n       (2) Consumer confidence is essential to the growth of \n     online commerce. To continue its development as a \n     marketplace, the Internet must provide consumers with clear, \n     accurate information and give sellers an opportunity to \n     fairly compete with one another for consumers' business.\n       (3) An investigation by the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation found abundant evidence that the \n     aggressive sales tactics many companies use against their \n     online customers have undermined consumer confidence in the \n     Internet and thereby harmed the American economy.\n       (4) The Committee showed that, in exchange for ``bounties'' \n     and other payments, hundreds of reputable online retailers \n     and websites shared their customers' billing information, \n     including credit card and debit card numbers, with third \n     party sellers through a process known as ``data pass''. These \n     third party sellers in turn used aggressive, misleading sales \n     tactics to charge millions of American consumers for \n     membership clubs the consumers did not want.\n       (5) Third party sellers offered membership clubs to \n     consumers as they were in the process of completing their \n     initial transactions on hundreds of websites. These third \n     party ``post-transaction'' offers were designed to make \n     consumers think the offers were part of the initial purchase, \n     rather than a new transaction with a new seller.\n       (6) Third party sellers charged millions of consumers for \n     membership clubs without ever obtaining consumers' billing \n     information, including their credit or debit card \n     information, directly from the consumers. Because third party \n     sellers acquired consumers' billing information from the \n     initial merchant through ``data pass'', millions of consumers \n     were unaware they had been enrolled in membership clubs.\n       (7) The use of a ``data pass'' process defied consumers' \n     expectations that they could only be charged for a good or a \n     service if they submitted their billing information, \n     including their complete credit or debit card numbers.\n       (8) Third party sellers used a free trial period to enroll \n     members, after which they periodically charged consumers \n     until consumers affirmatively canceled the memberships. This \n     use of ``free-to-pay conversion'' and ``negative option''\n\n[[Page S8306]]\n\n     sales took advantage of consumers' expectations that they \n     would have an opportunity to accept or reject the membership \n     club offer at the end of the trial period.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITIONS AGAINST CERTAIN UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE \n                   INTERNET SALES PRACTICES.\n\n       (a) Requirements for Certain Internet-Based Sales.--It \n     shall be unlawful for any post-transaction third party seller \n     to charge or attempt to charge any consumer's credit card, \n     debit card, bank account, or other financial account for any \n     good or service sold in a transaction effected on the \n     Internet, unless--\n       (1) before obtaining the purchaser's billing information, \n     the post-transaction third party seller has clearly and \n     conspicuously disclosed to the purchaser all material terms \n     of the transaction, including--\n       (A) a description of the goods or services being offered;\n       (B) the fact that the post-transaction third party seller \n     is not affiliated with the initial merchant, which may \n     include disclosure of the name of the post-transaction third \n     party in a manner that clearly differentiates the post-\n     transaction third party seller from the initial merchant; and\n       (C) the cost of such goods or services; and\n       (2) the post-transaction third party seller has received \n     the express informed consent for the charge from the consumer \n     whose credit card, debit card, bank account, or other \n     financial account will be charged by--\n       (A) obtaining from the consumer--\n       (i) the full account number of the account to be charged; \n     and\n       (ii) the consumer's name and address and a means to contact \n     the consumer; and\n       (B) requiring the consumer to perform an additional \n     affirmative action, such as clicking on a confirmation button \n     or checking a box that indicates the consumer's consent to be \n     charged the amount disclosed.\n       (b) Prohibition on Data-Pass Used To Facilitate Certain \n     Deceptive Internet Sales Transactions.--It shall be unlawful \n     for an initial merchant to disclose a credit card, debit \n     card, bank account, or other financial account number, or to \n     disclose other billing information that is used to charge a \n     customer of the initial merchant, to any post-transaction \n     third party seller for use in an Internet-based sale of any \n     goods or services from that post-transaction third party \n     seller.\n       (c) Limitations on Use of Negative Option Feature in \n     Internet-Based Sales Transactions.--It shall be unlawful for \n     any person to charge or attempt to charge any consumer for \n     any goods or services sold in a transaction effected on the \n     Internet through a negative option feature, unless--\n       (1) before obtaining the purchaser's initial agreement to \n     participate in the negative option plan, the seller has \n     clearly and conspicuously disclosed all material terms of the \n     transaction, including--\n       (A) the name of the entity offering the goods or services;\n       (B) a description of the goods or services being offered;\n       (C) the cost of such goods or services;\n       (D) notice of when billing will begin and at what intervals \n     the charges will occur;\n       (E) the length of any trial period, including a statement \n     that the consumer's account will be charged unless the \n     consumer takes affirmative action and the steps the consumer \n     must take to the avoid the charge; and\n       (F) instructions for stopping the recurring charges in \n     accordance with the requirements of paragraph (3);\n       (2) the seller has obtained the express informed consent \n     described in subsection (a)(2) from the purchaser before \n     charging or attempting to charge the purchaser's credit card, \n     debit card, bank account, or other financial account on a \n     recurring basis; and\n       (3) the seller enables the purchaser to stop recurring \n     charges from being made to the purchaser's credit card, debit \n     card, bank account, or other financial account through a \n     simple process that is available via--\n       (A) the Internet; or\n       (B) e-mail.\n       (d) Application with Other Law.--Nothing in this Act shall \n     be construed to supersede, modify, or otherwise affect the \n     requirements of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. \n     1693 et seq.) or any regulation promulgated thereunder.\n       (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Initial merchant.--The term ``initial merchant'' means \n     a person that has obtained a consumer's billing information \n     directly from the consumer through an Internet transaction \n     initiated by the consumer.\n       (2) Negative option feature.--The term ``negative option \n     feature'' has the meaning given that term in section 310.2(t) \n     of the Federal Trade Commission's Telemarketing Sales Rule \n     regulations (16 C.F.R. 310.2(t)).\n       (3) Post-transaction third party seller.--The term ``post-\n     transaction third party seller'' means a person that--\n       (A) sells, or offers for sale, any good or service on the \n     Internet;\n       (B) solicits the purchase of such goods or services on the \n     Internet through an initial merchant after the consumer has \n     initiated a transaction with the initial merchant; and\n       (C) is not a subsidiary or corporate affiliate of the \n     initial merchant.\n\n     SEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Restore Online Shoppers' \n     Confidence Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Internet has become an important channel of \n     commerce in the United States, accounting for billions of \n     dollars in retail sales every year. Over half of all American \n     adults have now either made an online purchase or an online \n     travel reservation.\n       (2) Consumer confidence is essential to the growth of \n     online commerce. To continue its development as a \n     marketplace, the Internet must provide consumers with clear, \n     accurate information and give sellers an opportunity to \n     fairly compete with one another for consumers' business.\n       (3) An investigation by the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation found abundant evidence that the \n     aggressive sales tactics many companies use against their \n     online customers have undermined consumer confidence in the \n     Internet and thereby harmed the American economy.\n       (4) The Committee showed that, in exchange for ``bounties'' \n     and other payments, hundreds of reputable online retailers \n     and websites shared their customers' billing information, \n     including credit card and debit card numbers, with third \n     party sellers through a process known as ``data pass''. These \n     third party sellers in turn used aggressive, misleading sales \n     tactics to charge millions of American consumers for \n     membership clubs the consumers did not want.\n       (5) Third party sellers offered membership clubs to \n     consumers as they were in the process of completing their \n     initial transactions on hundreds of websites. These third \n     party ``post-transaction'' offers were designed to make \n     consumers think the offers were part of the initial purchase, \n     rather than a new transaction with a new seller.\n       (6) Third party sellers charged millions of consumers for \n     membership clubs without ever obtaining consumers' billing \n     information, including their credit or debit card \n     information, directly from the consumers. Because third party \n     sellers acquired consumers' billing information from the \n     initial merchant through ``data pass'', millions of consumers \n     were unaware they had been enrolled in membership clubs.\n       (7) The use of a ``data pass'' process defied consumers' \n     expectations that they could only be charged for a good or a \n     service if they submitted their billing information, \n     including their complete credit or debit card numbers.\n       (8) Third party sellers used a free trial period to enroll \n     members, after which they periodically charged consumers \n     until consumers affirmatively canceled the memberships. This \n     use of ``free-to-pay conversion'' and ``negative option'' \n     sales took advantage of consumers' expectations that they \n     would have an opportunity to accept or reject the membership \n     club offer at the end of the trial period.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITIONS AGAINST CERTAIN UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE \n                   INTERNET SALES PRACTICES.\n\n       (a) Requirements for Certain Internet-Based Sales.--It \n     shall be unlawful for any post-transaction third party seller \n     to charge or attempt to charge any consumer's credit card, \n     debit card, bank account, or other financial account for any \n     good or service sold in a transaction effected on the \n     Internet, unless--\n       (1) before obtaining the consumer's billing information, \n     the post-transaction third party seller has clearly and \n     conspicuously disclosed to the consumer all material terms of \n     the transaction, including--\n       (A) a description of the goods or services being offered;\n       (B) the fact that the post-transaction third party seller \n     is not affiliated with the initial merchant, which may \n     include disclosure of the name of the post-transaction third \n     party in a manner that clearly differentiates the post-\n     transaction third party seller from the initial merchant; and\n       (C) the cost of such goods or services; and\n       (2) the post-transaction third party seller has received \n     the express informed consent for the charge from the consumer \n     whose credit card, debit card, bank account, or other \n     financial account will be charged by--\n       (A) obtaining from the consumer--\n       (i) the full account number of the account to be charged; \n     and\n       (ii) the consumer's name and address and a means to contact \n     the consumer; and\n       (B) requiring the consumer to perform an additional \n     affirmative action, such as clicking on a confirmation button \n     or checking a box that indicates the consumer's consent to be \n     charged the amount disclosed.\n       (b) Prohibition on Data-Pass Used To Facilitate Certain \n     Deceptive Internet Sales Transactions.--It shall be unlawful \n     for an initial merchant to disclose a credit card, debit \n     card, bank account, or other financial account number, or to \n     disclose other billing information that is used to charge a \n     customer of the initial merchant, to any post-transaction \n     third party seller for use in an Internet-based sale of any \n     goods or services from that post-transaction third party \n     seller.\n       (c) Application with Other Law.--Nothing in this Act shall \n     be construed to supersede, modify, or otherwise affect the \n     requirements of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. \n     1693 et seq.) or any regulation promulgated thereunder.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Initial merchant.--The term ``initial merchant'' means \n     a person that has obtained a consumer's billing information \n     directly from the consumer through an Internet transaction \n     initiated by the consumer.\n       (2) Post-transaction third party seller.--The term ``post-\n     transaction third party seller'' means a person that--\n       (A) sells, or offers for sale, any good or service on the \n     Internet;\n       (B) solicits the purchase of such goods or services on the \n     Internet through an initial merchant after the consumer has \n     initiated a transaction with the initial merchant; and\n       (C) is not--\n       (i) the initial merchant;\n       (ii) a subsidiary or corporate affiliate of the initial \n     merchant; or\n       (iii) a successor of an entity described in clause (i) or \n     (ii).\n\n     SEC. 4. NEGATIVE OPTION MARKETING ON THE INTERNET.\n\n       It shall be unlawful for any person to charge or attempt to \n     charge any consumer for any goods or services sold in a \n     transaction effected on the Internet through a negative \n     option feature (as defined in the Federal Trade Commission's \n     Telemarketing Sales Rule in part 310 of title 16, Code of \n     Federal Regulations), unless the person--\n       (1) provides text that clearly and conspicuously discloses \n     all material terms of the transaction before obtaining the \n     consumer's billing information;\n       (2) obtains a consumer's express informed consent before \n     charging the consumer's credit card, debit card, bank \n     account, or other financial account for products or services \n     through such transaction; and\n       (3) provides simple mechanisms for a consumer to stop \n     recurring charges from being placed on the consumer's credit \n     card, debit card, bank account, or other financial account.\n\n     SEC. 5.
