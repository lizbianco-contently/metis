Mr. President, it is appropriate for us to honor, from \ntime to time, outstanding public servants whose work on behalf of the \nAmerican people might otherwise be overlooked.\n  Next week, Ambassador Ryan Crocker will return home to Washington \nState after a remarkable career promoting America's interests abroad. \nIn a career spanning nearly 40 years, Ambassador Crocker has \nrepresented the United States in some of the most challenging \nenvironments. So it is fitting that we pause to honor him for a job \nwell done.\n  A graduate of Whitman College in Washington, Ryan Crocker joined the \nForeign Service in 1971, beginning a career that would take him to \ndiplomatic posts in Iran, Qatar, Egypt, Lebanon, and Iraq. Ambassador \nCrocker served as Ambassador to Syria, Kuwait, Lebanon, Pakistan, and, \nmost recently, Iraq. Clearly, he has not shied away from a challenge. \nAnd he has excelled at every one.\n  Earlier in his career, Ambassador Crocker served in Lebanon during \nthe Israeli invasion of 1982 and the bombing of the U.S. Marine \nbarracks in 1983--experiences from which he would later draw important \nlessons while serving in Iraq, particularly in 2007, when Shia militias \nand Sunni insurgents fed sectarian tensions and tribal feuds.\n  Ambassador Crocker's career spanned the entire Middle East and recent \nU.S. history. But he will undoubtedly be remembered most for his \nservice in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S3740]]\n\nSuccess in Iraq was never ensured, but it was made far more likely by \nthe presence of Ryan Crocker. As Ambassador from March 2007 to February \n2009, he was instrumental in carrying out the diplomatic tasks required \nto implement the counterinsurgency strategy, and to successfully defend \nthat strategy before a skeptical Congress. He also carried out the \nnegotiation that produced the Status of Forces Agreement, and he helped \nIraqis through provincial elections. In all this, Ambassador Crocker \nforged a strong partnership with GEN David Petraeus that protected our \nNation's interests in Iraq at a moment of peril.\n  Ryan Crocker has served his Nation with honor, and our country owes \nhim a debt. He is a diplomat's diplomat, the best of the best, and a \ntribute to the State Department that he has served. He is also a very \nfine man, and I wish him well in retirement and the best of luck in the \nfuture. Ambassador Crocker may be leaving the stage, but his service to \nour Nation will not be forgotten.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

I came to the floor to talk about the budget debate. I \nthink it is very important that we let the American people know where \nwe are on the budget and what this debate is really all about.\n  We have a new President and we have a new budget, thank goodness. We \nhave a budget that reflects the hopes and dreams of the American \npeople. We have a budget that is going to cut the deficit in half by \nthe time this President's term is over. We have a budget that is \nabsolutely open in terms of the way it spends our money and the way it \nsaves our money.\n  It is important that we take a look at the type of economy this young \nPresident inherited: Record deficits. Record deficits that President \nGeorge W. Bush's own party supported. It is very important that we \nremember that when George W. Bush got the key to the Oval Office, we \nhad surpluses. Then we saw a 50-percent increase in spending. We saw a \ndebt that was about to be put away go up in major proportions. We are \nseeing the playing out of the worst recession since the Great \nDepression, a financial market in crisis, and a housing market in \ncrisis because of the deregulation that was the centerpiece of George \nW. Bush's and the Republicans' leadership.\n  We are paying the price of those years today. We have a young \nPresident who came into office and said: Be patient, we are going to \nchange the way we do business in this country. And we are going to do \nthat. We started with the stimulus bill that got not one Republican \nvote on the House side, although some of my Republican friends over \nthere are running around my State taking credit for the bill they voted \nagainst. We had three Republicans over here, whom I praise mightily for \nhaving the courage to do the right thing and get this economy back on \ntrack.\n  We have seen the loss of 3.3 million jobs in the last 6 months. The \nPresident is dealing with two ongoing wars that, by the way, were never \npaid for in the budget. They were taken off the budget. He now puts \nthem in the budget so that the American people can see the truth. \nPresident Bush put them in emergency spending even though we knew he \nneeded to fund them.\n  What we have in the President's budget is a refreshing change of \nreality, honesty, integrity, and investments that have to be made. What \nare we getting from our Republican friends? We are getting just what we \ngot when the Clinton budget passed without one Republican vote. I want \nto take us back to that because I think it is very interesting, \nintriguing, and enlightening to see what our Republican friends said \nabout the last Democratic President's budget. You would have thought \nthe sky was falling. You would have thought the universe would never \nsurvive. I have some of the quotes they made about the Clinton budgets.\n  If people will remember, Al Gore, as Vice President, had to come over \nhere and cast the tie-breaking vote on that budget. Here is what \nhappened as a result of that budget; we will talk about that first. As \na result of the Clinton budget, we saw 23 million new jobs created in \nthis country--not millions of jobs lost but 23 million jobs created. \nWhat happened to the deficit under the Clinton budget? It went down, \ndown, down, and we wound up with a surplus. We voted for the Clinton \nbudget, the first Democratic budget in a while, and what happened? \nTwenty-three million new jobs were created and the budget was in \nbalance.\n  As a matter of fact, George W. Bush, when he took the keys to the \nOval Office, had a surplus. What happened with the Republican rule? \nDeficits as far as the eye can see. These are the facts. This isn't \nrhetoric--debt of $10 trillion, $11 trillion.\n  Let's look at what the Republicans said about the Clinton budget that \nwe know, because time has passed, history has shown, created 23 million \njobs, stopped the deficits, turned them into surpluses, and got the \ndebt going on the way down. What did our Republican friends say then?\n  Wayne Allard said then as a Representative:\n\n       In summary, the plan has a fatal flaw--it does not reduce \n     the deficit.\n\n  Wrong. Wrong. Wayne Allard continued:\n\n       So we are still going to pile up some more debt, but most \n     of all, we are going to cost jobs in this country.\n\n  That is what Republican Wayne Allard said about the Clinton budget--\n``. . . we are still going to pile up some more debt, but most of all, \nwe are going to cost jobs. . . .'' Wrong--23 million jobs created.\n  Senator Pete Domenici said of the Clinton budget that created 23 \nmillion jobs and turned the deficit into a surplus:\n\n       It's just a mockery.\n\n  Our friend, Senator Orrin Hatch, a leader of the Republicans, still \nhere and going strong, I am happy to say, he is my friend--he said:\n\n       Make no mistake, these higher rates will cost jobs.\n\n  Talking about the Clinton budget and the taxes in it.\n\n       Make no mistake, these higher rates will cost jobs.\n\n  Wrong--23 million jobs created.\n  How about Senator Phil Gramm, one of the leaders of the Republicans \nin the Senate at the time of the Clinton budget that created 23 million \njobs, took the deficit, turned it into surplus, what did he say?\n\n       I want to predict here tonight that if we adopt this bill, \n     the American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger, \n     the deficit 4 years from today will be higher than it is \n     today and not lower. . . . When all is said and done, people \n     will pay more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, \n     Government will spend more money, and the American people \n     will be worse off.\n\n  Wrong. Phil Gramm was wrong. Oh, Phil Gramm, he is the one who said \nthis recession was in our minds.\n  Here is another quote of Phil Gramm--remember, he was a leader of the \nRepublicans then--talking about the Clinton budget that created 23 \nmillion jobs and cut our deficit and turned it into a surplus:\n\n       . . . [T]his program is going to make the economy weaker. . \n     . . Hundreds of thousands of people are going to lose their \n     jobs as a result of this program.\n\n  Guess what he also said:\n\n       I believe that hundreds of thousands of people are going to \n     lose their jobs as a result of this program. I believe that \n     Bill Clinton will be one of those people.\n\n  Bill Clinton got reelected and the economy created 23 million jobs, \nthe\n\n[[Page S3741]]\n\ndeficits went down, we had a surplus, and the debt was almost \neviscerated.\n  What did our good friend Chuck Grassley say? Chuck Grassley is our \ngood friend. He has taken a lead against this budget document. He is \none of the leaders against the Obama budget. Let's see what he said \nabout the Clinton budget that created 23 million new jobs and cut the \ndeficits, turned them into surpluses, and had the debt going down, one \nof the most prosperous times in our history as a result of the Clinton \nbudget. What did Chuck Grassley say?\n\n       I really do not think it takes a rocket scientist to know \n     this bill will cost jobs.\n\n  Wrong.\n  Connie Mack, another leader, a friend of mine, now retired, a \nRepublican leader--this is what he said about the Clinton budget:\n\n       This bill will cost America jobs, no doubt about it.\n\n  Bill Roth said:\n\n       It will flatten the economy. . . . I am concerned what it \n     will do to jobs. I am concerned what it will do to our \n     families, our communities, to our children's future.\n\n  Senator Roth was wrong--23 million jobs created, one of the most \nprosperous times in our Nation's history, deficits went down, debt on \nthe way out.\n  So our Republicans have a visceral reaction when there is a \nDemocratic President. They come and they excoriate our Democratic \nPresident, and they are wrong. They are wrong. Look at the record. This \nis the beauty of what I am saying. I do not have to defend it. I know \nwhat they said, and I know what happened to the economy.\n  Newt Gingrich--still a major leader in the Republican Party, some \npeople say the leader--about the Democratic President's budget, Bill \nClinton: ``It will kill jobs.'' Wrong. It will ``lead to a recession, \nand the recession will force people off of work and onto unemployment \nand will . . . increase the deficit.'' Wrong.\n  John Kasich--we have seen him on television a lot. He was a leader \nthen in the Republican Party. This is what he said about Bill Clinton's \nbudget, not dissimilar to the Barak Obama budget in the sense that it \nis a plan to cut the deficit and make investments--make good \ninvestments. This is what he said:\n\n       This plan will not work. If it was to work, I'd have to \n     become a Democrat . . .\n\n  John, if you are watching me, it is your time because the plan \nworked--23 million jobs. You didn't become a Democrat. You said you \nwould.\n  Peter King--what did Peter King say about the Clinton budget that \ncreated 23 million jobs and cured the deficit problem?\n\n       [I]t is because of budgets such as this that the economy is \n     going to be damaged.\n\n  Wrong. Wrong.\n  Flash forward. We know what happened under Bill Clinton. We know \nabout the 23 million jobs. We know what happened to the debt. It went \ndown. We know what happened to the deficits. They turned into \nsurpluses. George W. Bush takes the White House, the Republicans take \nover, and what happened? The worst recession since the Great \nDepression, terrible loss of jobs, deficits record high, which they \nnever complained about, debt record high. We get a new President who \ncomes in and says: I have a plan to turn it all around. What do they \ndo? They come down to the floor with the same old politics.\n  If I gave you the quotes I am hearing of my colleagues--Senator \nShelby is all over, they are all over the place--disaster, Armageddon, \nthe world is ending, we are going to lose jobs, we are going to have \ndeficits as far as the eye can see; what a nightmare. It is the same \nold politics and, by the way, the same old policies, which is tax \nbreaks for the wealthiest among us, shorting the investments that the \npeople of this country need, not tackling health care, not tackling \nenergy, not tackling education--all the things this President wants--\nnot tackling the deficits, and we have to know they got us into this \ncrisis.\n  I do not enjoy reiterating all of this because it brings back some \nfights I was in. But I am going to do it every day as long as I hear \nthe same rhetoric, the same politics, the same policies that got us \ninto this mess in the first place.\n  The American people had a choice in November. They had a choice in \nSenate races, they had a choice in House races, they had a choice in \nthe Presidential race. Did they want the same old politics, did they \nwant the same old policies that got us into the crisis? Guess what they \nsaid. They wanted change, and they are getting change. We have the same \nrhetoric flowing from my friends on the other side of the aisle. I \nthought they were going to change the image of their party. I thought \nthey were going to change the message of their party. It is the same \nold stuff. You could substitute a name for a name. It is the same thing \nthey are saying about the Barak Obama budget that they said about the \nClinton budget, and it doesn't fly because our new President \nunderstands we have to make some changes. He understands we need to \ninvest in America's future, in jobs, in health care, in energy \nindependence, and in education.\n  We know the deficit predictions are different coming out of the \nCongressional Budget Office than they are coming out of the White House \noffice. Everybody knows we are going to adjust this budget here and \nthere to make sure the numbers reflect reality. This President \nunderstands that. I watched him at his press conference. He said: What \nI care about is jobs, health care, energy independence, education, and \ndeficit reduction, he added. That is a major focus of his agenda. He \nsays: As long as I get jobs, health care, energy independence, \neducation, and deficit reduction, I am a happy person.\n\n  The President is coming today to the Hill to meet with us. I am very \nmuch anticipating his presentation.\n  We know what this President inherited. We know the fiscal \nmismanagement. We know the misplaced priorities. We know, we know, we \nknow. The American people understand that is why this President, \ndespite getting pounded day after day on this floor, on the airwaves, \nand on conservative talk shows, is still maintaining a strong majority \nof Americans who say: Give this man a chance.\n  Who else in history inherited two wars and the biggest economic \nnightmare since the Great Depression? Nobody. The wars were not of his \nmaking, and the economic mess is not of his making. He is addressing \nthem. He addressed it in the stimulus package that is going to start to \npay off for us.\n  It is tough times, but he is doing what has to be done. He went \nforward and he said: You know what, I have a plan to get these banks on \ntheir feet. He was honest. He said: I have bad choices and worst \nchoices.\n  If there is a tragedy in our families and we find out one of our \nloved ones has cancer and the doctor comes to us and says: There are \ntwo treatments. There is a tough chemotherapy treatment and there is a \ntough radiation treatment. You have to pick between those two \ntreatments to cure this cancer. It is a hard choice. Our President \nfaces very hard choices when it comes to straightening out this mess. \nBut the American people want him to try and try he is.\n  If we can get these bad assets off the hands of these banks and get \nthem lending again, we basically save the financial system. If we don't \nsave the financial system, we are going to have to take it over. This \nPresident does not want to do that and I do not want to do that and I \ndo not think most Americans want that. So he is doing what it takes.\n  The housing crisis--I am so happy to hear people are refinancing. It \nis very important. That is going to put more money in the pockets of \npeople. It is going to make it more affordable for them to stay in \ntheir homes.\n  Our President has a budget blueprint to get us out of this mess. We \nall know he is not going to get every line in there he wants. He knows \nthat. Senator Conrad is working with him. We will have a reserve fund \nin there for the things we want to do for health care and energy, and I \nam going to work very hard so we can, in fact, have a cap-and-trade \nsystem that brings funding in and puts people to work, it gets us off \ndirty energy. We will have the ability to do that. The point is, this \nPresident deserves to have his priorities in place.\n  I wish to say in closing to my Republican friends: Go back a few \nyears in time. See how wrong you were. Admit that you were wrong. Then \ngo back and see what you said about the Bush budget. I didn't get a \nchance to go through\n\n[[Page S3742]]\n\nthose quotes. I will do that the next time I take the floor. When the \nBush budget came down and we saw what happened with the Bush budgets, \nthey were adopted by Republicans, and they received lots of votes from \ntheir side, unanimous. All we had out of that was unemployment and \ndeficits. They said: Oh, this is going to be a great budget. They are \nwrong. They have been wrong--wrong on the Clinton budget, wrong on the \nBush budget, and now they are wrong on the Obama budget.\n  As one Senator, I wish to say this: I never forget. I forgive all the \ntime, but I never forget. I have these quotes. They are real. They are \nin the Record. I am going to bring them out constantly.\n  Remember, when you hear these Republicans come out and trash Barak \nObama's budget, it is the same thing they did to the Clinton budget and \nthey were wrong--wrong then and they are wrong now.\n  We have to give this President the support he needs. Not that we are \ngoing to give every line--I don't agree with every line in it--but \nbasically the thrust of what he wants, the investments and the deficit \nreduction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \nappropriations process we conduct here in the Senate, and have come \nhere, as you have, in the not too distant past and been absolutely \namazed by the lack of fiscal discipline that exists here in Washington. \nI know the Presiding Officer probably shares some of my views about the \nway we go through the appropriations process and the fact that at the \nend of the year, on many occasions, we end up with a large omnibus bill \nthat does not give the American public, certainly not Senators and \nHouse Members, the ability to actually go through this process in a \nthoughtful way that respects the fact that these are our citizens' \nresources which we tend to bulk together in a way that it is not \ntransparent.\n  Our President, on March 11--and I agree with him very much on this--\nsaid that future spending bills should be debated and voted on in an \norderly way and sent to his desk without delay or obstruction so we \ndon't face another massive last-minute omnibus bill like this one--and \nhe was talking about the bill that we passed. I could not agree more \nwith the President in that regard. I think what we have seen is that we \nhave not had the ability to examine the thousands of earmarks that are \nplaced in these bills. We have not had a process that is transparent. \nIn an effort to aid this process in such a manner that we do have some \ndegree of fiscal discipline in this body, 41 Republican Senators have \nsigned a letter which states that we believe that by the August recess \nat least eight appropriations bills should be voted on in singular \nfashion--eight single bills by the August recess.\n  This body has on many occasions taken up each appropriations bill by \nitself, fully debated it, discussed the earmarks, discussed the things \nthat cause these bills not to be appropriate, had amendments, and \npassed these bills out of the Senate. So these 41 Republicans stand \ntogether urging the leader of the Senate, urging the Appropriations \nCommittee to follow this best way of doing business, and that is to \nvote on these bills individually. Obviously, we hope this occurs. And \ncertainly as part of the Senate process, in the event that we are not \nable to meet those objectives, we will avail ourselves of all \nappropriate procedural methods to ensure that is the case.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time this morning, and I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter signed by \nall 41 Republican Senators.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC,\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid: As you develop the legislative \n     calendar for the rest of this fiscal year we believe it is \n     critical to allocate an appropriate amount of time for the \n     Senate to consider, vote and initiate the conference process \n     on each of the twelve appropriations bills independently \n     through a deliberative and transparent process on the Senate \n     floor.\n       For a variety of reasons, over the past several years, the \n     Senate has failed to debate, amend and pass each of the bills \n     separately prior to the end of the fiscal year. Far too often \n     this has resulted in the creation of omnibus appropriations \n     bills that have been brought to the floor so late in the \n     fiscal year that Senators have been forced to either pass a \n     continuing resolution, shut down government or consider an \n     omnibus bill. These omnibus bills have not allowed for \n     adequate public review and have clouded what should otherwise \n     be a transparent process. As our President said on March 11, \n     2009, he expects future spending bills to be, ``. . . debated \n     and voted on in an orderly way and sent to (his) desk without \n     delay or obstruction so that we don't face another massive, \n     last minute omnibus bill like this one.''\n       The Senate should begin floor consideration of the \n     appropriations bills during the early summer months to ensure \n     that an appropriate amount of time is available to examine, \n     debate and vote on amendments to the bills. We believe the \n     Senate should pass at least eight of the appropriations bills \n     by the August recess. In order to press for a more \n     transparent process, we will consider using all available \n     procedural tools to guarantee regular order for \n     appropriations bills.\n       Noting our intentions, we hope you will plan accordingly as \n     you work with the leadership of the House to develop the \n     legislative calendar for the rest of this fiscal year.

Mr. President, one of the encouraging things that \nhappened in Washington this year is that the President sent us a budget \nthat was more transparent and more open than previous budgets. It was a \n10-year budget instead of 5 years. It gave us a blueprint for the \nfuture in that way, the way we ought to be thinking about things. It \nincluded some things that had not been included before: the cost of the \nwar; the so-called AMT fix--to address the millionaire's tax the \nCongress passed in the 1960s designed to catch 155 people who were not \npaying any taxes, but today will catch 28 million people, mostly \nmiddle-class Americans, unless we fix it; and what around here is \nirreverently called the ``doc fix,'' to deal with the mandated 20-\npercent cut in what Medicare pays its physicians. That cut in physician \npayments is not going to happen, we know that, so the President \nincluded that in the budget. There was money for helping to fix the \nbanks, to get the toxic assets out of the banks and get credit flowing \nagain, get the economy moving again, and that was in the budget.\n  On big issues like health care, the President said: Let's work in a \nbipartisan way. I invite the Congress to come up with a bill. Many \nMembers of Congress said the same thing. The President held a health \ncare summit earlier this month. I agree with the President we should \ntry to reform\n\n[[Page S3743]]\n\nhealth care this year. Most Republicans agree with that, that we need \nto make it possible for every single family to afford health insurance. \nPeople who are losing their jobs today or were between jobs ever \nunderstand what difficulty this causes families. So that was \nencouraging.\n  Now, I hear some very different sounds coming from around the \nCongress. It makes me wonder who is in charge here. I hear that instead \nof a 10-year budget, we may have a 5-year budget. The problem with the \n5-year budget is most of the problems in the 10-year budget are in the \nsecond 5 years. This budget spends too much, taxes too much, borrows \ntoo much. It doubles the debt in 5 years, the national debt, and it \nnearly triples the national debt in the 10-year period. So we need to \nknow where we are headed with this budget, and we will not know if we \njust talk about the next 5 years.\n  I hear that we are going to act like the so-called millionaire's tax, \nthe AMT, is fixed. That is not fixed; we have to deal with it. The \n``doc fix'' to avoid cuts in physician payments? We are just not going \nto include that in the budget, so I hear. We are going to have to deal \nwith that. We all know we are going to have to deal with that. We ought \nto put that in the budget. The cost of the war should be there. We need \nto recognize the first order of business in this country is to fix the \nbanks and get credit flowing again.\n  Secretary Geithner came forward with a plan on Monday that I hope \nworks. At least for the first time we are beginning to address the \ncentral problem of what we do about the toxic assets in the banks that \nare causing the banks to freeze up and not loan, bringing everything to \na halt. Get the toxic assets out and lending increases, houses begin to \nsell, jobs begin to be created again, people go back to work, the \neconomy improves.\n  So it was a very prudent thing for the President to put in his budget \na $250 billion placeholder for the banks. He may need to ask us for \nthat. In my view, I thought he should have asked us for it in January.\n  I thought, instead of passing a $1 trillion stimulus bill, borrowing \nand spending money we don't have, that it would have been better for \nPresident Obama to do now as President Eisenhower did in 1952 when he \nsaid: I shall go to Korea. And he went to Korea. That was the issue \nthen. It was not the only issue then, just like today there are lots of \ndifferent things Presidents need to do. But Eisenhower said: I will go \nto Korea. He arrived there just a few days after Thanksgiving. He said: \nI will honorably focus my attention on the war until it is ended. The \npeople elected him for that and he did that and he gained the \nconfidence of the American people.\n  I and most Americans have great confidence in this President. If \nPresident Obama, in the same way that President Eisenhower said he \nwould go to Korea, says he will fix the banks and he will get credit \nflowing and he will honorably concentrate his focus on that until the \njob is done--I think we believe he can do that. So he was right to put \nthe money in the budget, which I understand now may be coming out.\n  So we have a budget that is not really a budget anymore. It is not a \nclear picture. While I have been very complimentary of the President \nfor his straightforwardness in the budget, that does not mean I have to \nlike what is in the budget because I do not. But before I get to that \npart of it, let me talk about the two things that concern me most about \nwhat may be coming down the road and which I hope do not come. One of \nthem is the idea that we would use the budget to pass a health care \nbill to transform the health care system and the American economy. The \nsecond is the idea that we would use the budget to impose a national \nsales tax on electric bills, gasoline prices, and all energy--in other \nwords, to impose a cap-and-trade system on virtually the whole economy.\n  We need to reform health care. We need to debate climate change and \ncap and trade. But we need to do it in the way the Congress is supposed \nto do it, not by slipping it through with 51 votes when we are supposed \nto be making a budget, just because we can do that.\n  Think about that for a moment. The President has created this \ntremendously good environment for dealing with health care. He ran on a \ncampaign: I am going to change the way things are done in Washington. \nPeople need to work across party lines to get things done on big issues \nthat affect the country.\n  That is what the President said. He is right about that. There are a \nlot of new Senators who were elected saying the same thing. There are a \nlot of Senators who have been here before, like me, who said exactly \nthis--I am here to try to work across party lines to get results on big \nissues. There is not a bigger issue than health care, after we get \nthrough fixing the banks.\n  The President had, as I mentioned, the health care summit at the \nWhite House--off to a much better start, this President, than President \nClinton was when he tried to deal with the same issue early in his \nadministration. The President also had a fiscal responsibility summit \nin February that I attended where health care was a major topic. We \nwere all there, and various people got up and said: We need to work on \nthis, do this together. The President wisely said: I am not going to \nsend a proposal. I am going to let the Congress develop a proposal. We \nwill work with you on these things.\n  Well, all of a sudden, we hear that the health care plan might be \ncoming through on the budget. How can we possibly do that? If the \nPresident and Senate Democrats try to use this arcane budget procedure \nto reform health care, it will be the Parliamentarian and his wonderful \nstaff who will end up writing the health care bill.\n  Health care is 17 percent of the American gross domestic product. \nThese are big issues. Are we going to have a single-payer system? Is \neverybody going to have Medicare? Is anybody going to have a choice of \na doctor? Is anyone going to have a choice of an insurance policy? What \nabout the guaranteed costs? Will all Americans have the same kind of \nhealth coverage that Federal employees, including Senators, have? Is \nthat a good idea? Will we give more permission to large employers to \nconnect behavior to health care premiums so that we can have more \nprevention of disease? How much do we spend on people who are older and \nwhere we are spending more time?\n  Mr. President, I do not believe there is another Republican speaker. \nI ask unanimous consent to speak another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The health care bill ought to be written by, as \nSenators Baucus and Grassley have said, the Health and Finance \nCommittees, by the full Senate, with full participation. I mean, \ntechnically, you know, the Democratic majority can say: We won the \nelection, we will write the bill. President Bush was Commander in \nChief, and technically he could wage war in Iraq without the bipartisan \nsupport of Congress. But that helped him lose the support of the \ncountry. It damaged his Presidency. And it will do the same for \nPresident Obama if he is not allowed to continue on the path he began \non, which is a bipartisan effort in the Congress to bring a health care \nbill this year.\n  I mean, the Republican leader of the Senate, in his first speech, \nwent to the National Press Club here in Washington and he said: Mr. \nPresident, I am ready to work with you across party lines on \nentitlements. The most explosive, runaway cost in Government is \nMedicare and Medicaid. And it is better to reform health care before we \nput reduced costs on Medicaid. If we just put caps on the existing \nsystem, it would blow up.\n  So we are ready to do that. I don't know what more the Republicans \ncould say to send this clear message: We are ready to work across party \nlines. And the President has said it himself. So why are we having this \ndebate about whether to pass a health care bill as part of the budget. \nThat is not right for the country, and it needs to stop today.\n  The idea of passing a so-called cap-and-trade energy tax in the \nmiddle of a recession as part of the budget--that is equally unwise. \nThis is a major new idea and proposal, to impose this national tax on \nthe country that produces 25 percent of all of the money in the world \nand 25 percent of all of the energy in the world. And we have no idea \nwhat it would do. We do know one thing it would do: it would raise \nprices a lot. It would raise the price of your electric bill by a lot, \nand it would raise\n\n[[Page S3744]]\n\nthe price of your gasoline at the pump by a lot. That may not be as \nmuch of a problem today as it was a year ago. When gas goes back up to \n$3 or $3.50, you can be sure there will be plenty of people worrying \nabout it. And when they hear that a national energy tax applied to \ngasoline, to fuel, has the effect in the first several years of raising \nthe price of gasoline but not reducing the carbon that causes climate \nchange, they are going to be really mad about that because they will \nsay: Then why did you do that? I care about climate change, they may \nsay, but why would you impose a remedy on me that raises my price but \ndoesn't do anything about the carbon I am worried about?\n  Some might say: Well, what we should have done is have a low-carbon \nfuel standard that would gradually kick in, give the economy a chance \nto adjust, so that we can, for example, be driving electric cars which \nwe can plug in at night using power generated by existing nuclear \nplants and coal plants. We don't have to build one new power plant, not \none new coal plant, not one new windmill for the purpose of charging \nthese new electric cars. So we could have a low carbon fuel standard, \nplug our plug-in cars in at night, and that would be a better result \nthan putting a big, new national sales tax on the economy in the middle \nof a recession.\n  There are a lot of questions about this proposal even if we weren't \nin a recession. Creating a big slush fund here in Washington--nothing \nmore dangerous than that. You saw that with the stimulus bill. Put a \ntrillion dollars out here, and Congress goes crazy. Everybody has an \nidea about what to do. We can all spend money. And if we bring all of \nthis money in here, Congress will find a way to spend it. And I \nguarantee, it is a lot of money. This tax would raise $60, $80, $100 \nbillion a year and bring it to Washington. The President says: Well, we \nought to give most of it back to the people. Well, which people? In \nwhat way? Why not all of it? That should be a debate.\n  Should this tax be economy-wide, if we ever have it? Why not do as I \nhave suggested and just put a cap and trade on power plants--that is 40 \npercent of carbon--and a low-carbon fuel standard on fuel--that is \nanother 30 percent. So why do you need an economy-wide cap and trade to \naffect small business and farms and manufacturing?\n  And then who gets all of the money raised from this energy tax? A lot \nof the big companies came up to Capitol Hill when they first heard \nabout this cap and trade proposal. They saw a lot of money coming into \nWashington and they thought they might get free allowances to produce \ncarbon. But now the President wants to spend all of that money, and the \ncompanies are not so sure they like the idea anymore.\n  What about offsets? Offsets are a racket. You know, they have become \na racket. Somebody saves a little carbon in Madagascar. Well, you get \ncredit for it in the United States. There is not much of a way to \npolice that, and it is not a very good idea.\n  This carbon tax, this national sales tax, goes all the way to 2050. \nSo it takes $60, $80 $120, $150 billion a year out of the economy--\nmaybe not doing everything it's expected to do--in the name of dealing \nwith climate change.\n  Well, the first thing is, imposing this new tax in the middle of a \nrecession is a supremely bad idea.\n  Second, that doesn't mean we have to stop our efforts to deal with \nclimate change and clean air. In fact, we can accelerate our clean \nenergy efforts. They begin with the 2005 Energy bill. I see the ranking \nmember of the Energy Committee on the floor, Senator Murkowski. She was \na major part of that, and she will be a major part of this debate as we \ngo along. But we can promote conservation and efficiency without having \na national tax on every electric bill.\n  As Al Gore has said, buildings are 40 percent of carbon. So let's go \nto work on that. I know that in Tennessee we waste more energy than any \nother State. We have the highest use per capita of electricity. If we \njust changed 12 lightbulbs in each house, we could save the equivalent \nof a nuclear power plant. That would be a smart thing to do. Let's \nstart with conservation and efficiency. Let's electrify half of our \ncars and trucks. We can do that because the automobile companies are \nbuilding the cars and trucks. Let's plug them in at night when the \nelectricity is cheap. We don't have to build one new power plant, the \nBrookings Institute says.\n  Three, let's make solar power cost competitive with power from fossil \nfuels. We have been really miserly about energy research and \ndevelopment, and we ought to be bending over backward to put money \nwisely to make solar costs competitive, as the National Academy of \nEngineering says, to find a way to capture carbon from existing coal \nplants, to find ways to reprocess nuclear waste.\n  While we are worrying about carbon, why don't we set as a goal to \nbuild 100 new nuclear power plants. Nuclear power is 20 percent of our \nelectricity, but it is 70 percent of our carbon-free, nitrogen-free, \nsulfur-free, and mercury-free electricity. Why are we going slow on it?\n  So we would say no to higher taxes, higher prices, and more \nsubsidies--certainly not in the middle of a recession--and yes to more \nconservation, more efficiency, more nuclear power, more electric cars, \nand more research and development on solar, advanced biofuels, nuclear, \nand carbon capture. That is a pretty good agenda for dealing with clear \nair and climate change, and it doesn't impose an unwise, multibillion \ndollar national tax on electric bills in the middle of a recession, \nwhich would hurt the economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na couple of letters. One is a letter from a number of Senators--looks \nlike more than two dozen--opposing using the budget reconciliation \nprocess to expedite passage of climate legislation. A second letter \ncomes from the Republican members of the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works. It objects to collecting $646 billion in new climate \nrevenues from the American people in the middle of a recession.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2009.\n     Hon.

Legislation so far-\n     reaching should be fully vetted and given appropriate time \n     for debate, something the budget reconciliation process does \n     not allow. Using this procedure would circumvent normal \n     Senate practice and would be inconsistent with the \n     Administration's stated goals of bipartisanship, cooperation, \n     and openness.\n       We commend you for holding the recent hearing, entitled \n     ``Procedures for Consideration of the Budget Resolution/\n     Reconciliation,'' which discussed important recommendations \n     for the upcoming budget debate. Maintaining integrity in the \n     budget process is critical to safeguarding the fiscal health \n     of the United States in these challenging times.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mike Johanns; Robert C.

We are writing this letter to alert you to this \n     situation and ask that you join us in a budget resolution \n     amendment to strike any such provision.\n       Specifically, the President's 2010 Budget proposal asks to \n     collect $646 billion dollars in new ``Climate Revenues'' from \n     the American people. The government will collect these new \n     revenues through a cap and trade scheme in which \n     ``allowances'' are sold to the highest bidder. The government \n     won't tax consumers directly, but it will impose new costs on \n     energy producers and users who will in turn pass those higher \n     costs on to consumers, which will result in higher \n     electricity bills, gasoline prices, grocery bills, and \n     anything else made from conventional energy sources. In \n     short, consumers will feel as if they are paying a new tax on \n     energy.\n\n[[Page S3745]]\n\n       The stated price tag for this new energy tax is $646 \n     billion, yet recent news reports indicate that administration \n     officials are privately admitting their program will actually \n     generate between ``two and three times'' this amount of \n     revenue, or between $1.3 trillion and $1.9 trillion, However, \n     these numbers represent only the cost from 2012 through 2019. \n     The budget summary describes the energy tax extending at \n     least through 2050. At the 2012 through 2019 average annual \n     rate, families and workers would face through 2050 between \n     $6.3 trillion and $9.3 trillion in higher energy taxes.\n       On the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, we \n     have had experience with these types of proposals. We, and \n     the full Senate, debated a proposal by Senators Boxer, \n     Lieberman and Warner that the sponsors themselves indicated \n     would generate $6.7 trillion from consumers. As you may \n     recall, the Senate defeated this proposal, in part because \n     the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated that \n     by 2050 it would annually cost the average family $4,377 and \n     raise gasoline prices $1.40 per gallon. Experts estimated it \n     would kill up to 4 million jobs by 2030. As you can see, a \n     $4,377 per family total cost or a lost job would greatly \n     outweigh any $800 per family payroll tax break offered by the \n     administration.\n       The budget resolution is not the right place for the \n     careful bipartisan dialogue we need to get these issues \n     straight, or to fully account for the legitimate concerns of \n     energy consumers, economists, and industry. While the budget \n     resolution the Senate will debate is not yet available, we \n     will offer an amendment to strip any climate revenue \n     provision it contains. We urge you to be ready to join our \n     efforts to resist the erosion of proper democratic \n     principles.\n           Sincerely,\n     Senator James M. Inhofe,\n       Ranking Member.\n     John Barrasso,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     David Vitter,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Mike Crapo,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Christopher S. Bond,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     George V. Voinovidh,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Arlen Specter,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Lamar Alexander,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Byrd, our senior Member of this body, wrote \nthe budget legislation that created the reconciliation process. He has \ntold us that. He has reminded us of that. He talked about how he sat in \nhis office for 10 days and did it to get it right. This is what he \nsaid:\n  I was one of the authors of the legislation that created the budget \nreconciliation process in 1974. I am certain that putting health care \nreform and climate change legislation on a freight train through \nCongress is an outrage that must be resisted.\n  That is Senator Robert Byrd, the senior Democrat, the senior Senator \nwho wrote budget reconciliation.\n  Senator Conrad, Senator Baucus, Senator Dorgan, Senator Carper, and \nmany others have said basically the same thing: We agree. Don't use the \nreconciliation to ram through health care reform.\n  So let's take the budget in the next 10 days, let's debate it, let's \nhave our differences of opinion, but then let's follow the President's \nwise beginning on health care and reform it this year in the way he has \nsuggested and the way he campaigned on. And let's take the energy issue \nand the climate change issue and let's look carefully at how we have \nthe right clean energy strategy, which some of us believe is different \nfrom just taxes and high prices and more subsidies.\n  As far as the budget in general, we believe it spends too much, it \ntaxes too much, and it borrows too much. If I could conclude with only \none example of how that excessive borrowing will hurt the economy and \nhurt the country--an example that helps to illustrate why this 10-year \nbudget the President set is a blueprint for a different kind of \ncountry, one with less freedom, one with more Government, and one which \nour children cannot afford--if there were any one example of why that \nis true, this would be it: It would be the amount of interest on the \ndebt we will be paying in the 10th year of the budget sent by President \nObama.\n  In that year, interest on the debt will be $806 billion. The amount \nof spending on defense by the Federal Government in that year is \nprojected to be $720 billion. So we will be spending more on interest \nthan we do on defense.\n  Federal spending on education in that year would be $95 billion. So \nwe would be spending eight times as much on interest as we would on \neducation.\n  In the 10th year of the budget, $100 billion is allocated for \ntransportation spending by the Federal Government on things like roads \nand bridges that need to be fixed--we agree on that, and we would like \nto have the money to do it. But we will be spending on interest alone \neight times what we will be spending on transportation.\n  When I was Governor of Tennessee, we were a low-tax, low-debt State. \nThe reason we did not have much debt is because for every penny we did \nnot have to pay in interest, we could pay it for a teacher's salary, we \ncould improve a prenatal health care clinic, we could build a road, we \ncould have a center of excellence at the university. So low debt means \nmore money for the things we really want to have to invest in this \ncountry to make it a better place.\n  The President's budget is straightforward. Give the President credit. \nThe attempts by Congress to make it gimmicky and less transparent are \ndeplorable. The idea of trying to pass a health care reform proposal \nthat affects 17 percent of the economy and to impose a national sales \ntax on the entire energy system during a recession is a bad idea.\n  What we should do is take this 10-year budget, whittle it back to \nsize so it doesn't spend so much, doesn't borrow so much and doesn't \ntax so much and move ahead with a blueprint that maintains our freedom, \nthat limits our Government, that preserves choices and that our \nchildren and grandchildren can afford.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/25/senate-section/article/S3745-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I speak to the amendment I have \nsent to the desk on behalf of my colleague, Senator Dorgan, and others, \nI would like to speak generally to the measure before us, the Serve \nAmerica Act. I am a strong supporter of volunteer service, including \nGlobal Youth Service Day. I am proud and pleased that this \nreauthorization has been developed and brought to the floor in a \nbipartisan manner. The work done on this legislation is the product of \nthe best tradition of the Senate HELP Committee and of the Senate \nitself. I offer my congratulations to those who have worked very hard \non this--Senators Kennedy, Mikulski, Hatch, Enzi--and all their very \nhard-working staff who do a good job.\n  I also thank some very professional and dedicated people in the State \nof Alaska for their thorough review of and comments on the various \ndrafts of the legislation. We would send it off to them and get good \nresponse back, good feedback. I appreciate that.\n  They include: Nita Madsen, executive director of Serve Alaska, and \nher staff; Rachel Morse and all the great people at RurAL CAP who \nimplement AmeriCorps and VISTA programs; Denise Daniello at the Alaska \nCommission on Aging; Angela Salerno at the Alaska Department of Health \nand Social Services; and many others who were helpful in providing \ninsights from the providers' perspective.\n  AmeriCorps and the VISTA programs are a vital part of Alaska's \ncommunities. I would like to take a few minutes this morning to give \nsome of the examples of their valuable work in the State and to \ncongratulate the volunteers for their service.\n  For more than 10 years, AmeriCorps volunteers with the Student \nConservation Association have served Alaska and the Nation on our \npublic lands in Denali National Park and Preserve, the Kenai Fjords, \nand Lake Clark National Park and Preserve. Every year over 1 million \npeople visit Alaska to see these natural resources, to hike and camp \nand fish and explore. The conservation service provided by these \nstudents helps protect scenic beauty of our State, including the \nvolcanoes, glaciers, wild rivers, and waterfalls.\n  My family and I hiked the Chilkoot Trail a couple years ago and ran \ninto a group of AmeriCorps volunteers who were out on the trail \nbuilding and refurbishing some of the old historic cabins along the way \nand making the trail safe for its many visitors.\n  The students also research and monitor fish and wildlife populations \nas well as watersheds that are essential for the red salmon. This year \n80 of SCA's AmeriCorps volunteers will work in Cook Inlet in the \nwatershed there to monitor and support active fish management. In \naddition to providing natural resource stewardship, visitor services, \nand environmental education, their work supports Alaska's key economic \nengines which are our fisheries and tourism.\n  In 2008, SCA placed over 236 high school students and college interns \nin Alaska who provided over 76,000 service hours, valued at over $1.5 \nmillion. In Alaska last year, there were also 64 VISTA volunteers who \nserved with 18 project sponsors. I will give a little snapshot of one \nof those projects. It was at Juneau-Douglas High School, the CHOICE \nproject. The CHOICE Program, which is Choosing Healthy Options in \nCooperative Education, focuses on improving the academic achievement of \n100 at-risk students at Juneau-Douglas High School. The VISTA \nvolunteers help the students develop a sense of belonging and ownership \nwithin CHOICE, the high school, and the community at large. So VISTA \nnot only involves the CHOICE students in the community; they also \ninvolve the community in the education and learning of the students. \nOur VISTA coordinator, Jennifer Knaggs, recruited 42 community members \nto provide internships in State and local offices in the agencies and \nin the local businesses. In conjunction with the National Council on \nAlcohol and Drug Dependency, she helped facilitate three Alaska teen \ninstitute retreats. She also organized and coordinated the Beyond \nSchool Program, in which six community volunteers teach small groups of \nhigh school freshmen a hands-on, real life skill, such as Tlingit \ncarving, writing and producing radio public service announcements about \nhealthy choices, creating short video biographies of tribal elders, and \nvisual promotions of healthy choices within the school.\n  In a small community such as Juneau, retention of internships is no \nsmall feat. Students have reported very positive experiences with their \ninternships and their hosts, and the performance we are seeing coming \nout of these kids is great. They are proud of their accomplishments. \nThe students have become involved in the community, and it is a real \nwin.\n  The great public servants who run Alaska's national service programs \nhave noted the many positive aspects of this reauthorization for \nincreasing the recruitment and retention of volunteers, focusing on \ndirections Alaska has already begun to move toward, and increasing the \naccountability for positive outcomes. In their view, there are a few \nitems they look to in the Serve America Act that are especially \nhelpful. The first is the increase in the living allowance and \neducation awards. It has the potential to increase the recruitment and \nthe retention of AmeriCorps members, especially from rural Alaskan \ncommunities. Also, it allows senior volunteers to transfer the \neducation award to a child or a grandchildren. Again, this will help \nwith recruitment efforts. It increases focus on individuals with a \ndisability, paralleling one of the focus areas of our Alaska State \nCommission. Increasing the connection with the Commission on Aging and \nIntergenerational Programs also meets another one of Alaska's \nperformance measures. So having this provision in the act will assist \nwith moving this partnership forward.\n  The accountability provisions will strengthen the State service plan. \nHaving a minimum amount for the formula grants for both AmeriCorps and \nLearn and Serve is very good for the State of Alaska and other States \nthat have equally small populations. The increase for the operation of \nthe State Commission is a positive; even if obtaining the required 1-\nto-1 match will be challenging for a State such as ours, we believe it \nis a positive step.\n  From the perspective of one of Alaska's largest service grantees, \nthey noted the following: The effort to expand and improve \nopportunities for national and community service should positively \nbenefit Alaska's engagement in the service; the grouping of ``corps'' \nfor the service programs into Education Corps, Healthy Future Corps, \nClean Energy Service Corps, Opportunity Corps or Veterans Corps, \ncoupled with defined performance indicators, will add value to the \nexisting Corporation for Community and National Service framework; \nlinking the value of the education award to the maximum value of the \nPell grant will improve the strength and success of AmeriCorps programs \nin Alaska; increasing the AmeriCorps living allowance from $16,000 to \n$18,000 will especially benefit the programs serving rural Alaskan \ncommunities.\n  Let me speak to the amendment I have called up. This is amendment No. \n691, offered on behalf of my colleague, Senator Dorgan. This amendment \nto the Serve America Act designates a tribal liaison for the \nCorporation for National and Community Service and keeps Indian tribes \nas eligible under existing law for nationally competitive grants. The \ncorporation has recognized the need for a tribal liaison position and \nhas designated an individual to reach out to Native American \ncommunities. This amendment will make that position permanent. The \ntribal liaison will work across all programs and support units to \nincrease Native participation in national service and help to develop \nand enhance programming to address the unique needs of Native American \ncommunities.\n  In addition, we propose to keep Indian tribes as eligible under \nexisting law for nationally competitive grants. Current law allows \ntribes to compete for funds with States and national nonprofit \norganizations. This amendment would maintain the eligibility of tribes \nto compete with States and national nonprofit organizations for \nnational competitive grants. Many of these activities and indicators \nunder the proposed corps in this act are directly applicable to Indian \nCountry, and access to these grants with the assistance of a\n\n[[Page S3747]]\n\ntribal liaison is important. We recognize that the education of \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives lags far behind that of the rest of \nthe country, and the provisions of the Education Corps will help \naddress these needs by providing mentors and tutors to Native students. \nLikewise, the Healthy Futures Corps would help address the lack of \naccess to health care on many of our reservations.\n  Likewise, the Healthy Futures Corps will help address the lack of \naccess to health care on many of our reservations. American Indians \nhave higher disease rates and lower life expectancy than the general \npopulation. Volunteers serving in the Healthy Futures Corps could \nassist those who live on reservations or in Alaskan communities in \nobtaining health services.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look at the amendment and provide \nsupport for this important tribal liaison and in retaining tribal \neligibility for competitive grants within the Corporation for National \nand Community Service.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy, Mikulski, Hatch, and Enzi for their \ndedication to public service and congratulate them on what I believe is \ngood legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I, personally, congratulate the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska for her comments. She has a very \nimportant amendment to this bill. I assure her we will work that out so \nwe don't have to have a vote on it. If we do have to go to a vote, we \nwill, but the fact is I think we can work that out. It is a very good \namendment. Personally, we want to have those funds as part of this \nbill. We will work it out.\n  I want to take a few minutes and pay tribute to some of the wonderful \nnational service efforts that have gone on in my home State of Utah. As \nI have said throughout this debate, Americans are the most generous and \nenergetic people in the world. Indeed, a volunteer spirit is encoded \ninto our country's cultural DNA. Nowhere is this concept better \nexemplified than in my home State.\n  According to the Corporation for National and Community Service, \nbetween 2005 and 2007, an average 792,000 Utahns gave 146.9 million \nhours of service every year. Using Independent Sector's estimate of the \ndollar value of a volunteer, the estimated contribution of these \nefforts is $2.9 billion annually. Nearly 44 percent of all Utahns do \nsome sort of volunteer service every year, making Utah's volunteerism \nrate No. 1 in America, more than 4 percent higher than the State ranked \nsecond.\n  Salt Lake City, UT the second-highest volunteerism rate of any major \nmetropolitan area in the country at 37.2 percent. Among midsize cities, \nProvo, UT has the Nation's highest volunteerism rate at 63.8 percent, \nwith Ogden, UT coming in at No. 4 with a rate of 41 percent. Much of \nthis volunteer work is done by members of the Mormon church in food \ncanneries and storehouses as they stockpile food and supplies for those \nin need, whether they be members of the church or nonmembers. As with \nany community, volunteerism in Utah comes in a variety of forms.\n  In addition to the privately-led projects throughout the State, \nnational service programs have had a profound impact on communities \nthroughout the State of Utah. For example, there is the Utah AmeriCorps \nLiteracy Initiative, which currently manages programs in 66 schools \ncovering the entire State of Utah, including both urban and rural \ncommunities. There are 87 AmeriCorps members in the program who recruit \nand train community volunteers to tutor struggling readers.\n\n  Unfortunately, the current budget situation in Utah is similar to \nthose faced by State governments around the country. As a result, Utah \nschools have been required to cut their budgets 4 percent this year and \n5 percent for next year. However, national service participants have \nbeen able to step up and fill the void in schools left by the reduction \nin the State education workforce. Several teachers' aides whose \npositions have been downsized due to the budget cuts will be qualified \nto participate in the Literacy Initiative next year and, accordingly, \nwill receive a small living allowance and an educational award which \nwill allow them to get further training, broadening their skills to \nobtain gainful employment.\n  Over the past 5 years, this program has helped over 8,000 elementary \nschoolchildren serve as mentors, helping younger children improve their \nreading. The average growth in reading for both the mentor and the \nmentee they are helping has been one full grade level over the course \nof the 9-week program. In addition, through this initiative, over 2,000 \nchildren have received one-on-one tutoring from community volunteers \ntwice a week over the course of a 30-week program. These are children \nwho did not pass the Utah State End of Level tests the previous year. \nAfter 1 year of tutoring through the Utah AmeriCorps Literacy \nInitiative, 62 percent of the students passed that test at a proficient \nlevel.\n  I think this program exemplifies what we are trying to accomplish \nwith this legislation. All of this work, which has improved the \neducation of literally thousands of students and leveraged the efforts \nof thousands of other students and community volunteers, has been \nanchored by a small group of only 87 AmeriCorps members. That is pretty \nphenomenal when you think about it. Why wouldn't we want to expand this \napproach? It seems to me it is something we ought to be doing \neverywhere.\n  I am convinced that, once this bill is passed, we will see more \nprograms such as this spring up over time, not only in Utah but \nthroughout the country. They will be buoyed by the increased direction, \nefficiency, and accountability that this legislation will add to the \nexisting national service structure. In the end, more people will be \nhelped, more traditional volunteers will be put to work in their \ncommunities, and more of our Nation's problems will be solved.\n  That is precisely the point of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, thus far, we have had what I believe to be \na constructive discussion regarding the Serve America Act. We have seen \nsome fine amendments, and Senator Mikulski and I are working together \nto try to accommodate as many Members as possible. I said at the outset \nthat I hope we can avoid a situation where too many changes to this \nbill would eventually split the bipartisan support the bill has \nenjoyed. So far, this does not appear to be a problem.\n  As we continue to debate this important piece of legislation, it is \nmy hope these constructive efforts will continue. This is a good \nopportunity for us to set aside partisan differences and do some good \nfor the American people. I once again thank Senator Mikulski for her \nefforts here on the floor to see this effort through.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy as well. Even though he has not been here, \nexcept for the last cloture vote, he certainly has been working it from \nhome, and he has been on the phone regularly. We also have others who \nhave worked on our side very diligently to try to make sure this bill \npasses, and in the form it is in.\n  I mentioned yesterday that I believe the Serve America Act should be \na bipartisan bill, not because I believe it is either liberal or \nconservative but because it is both. I think the bill plays to the \ngreatest strengths of those on both sides of the aisle. It marries what \nis typically thought of as a ``liberal'' instinct for Government to \nmake proactive efforts to help those in need with the typical \n``conservative'' desire to place more power in the hands of individuals \ninstead of the Government. It is not all that often we are able to work \ntogether to find ways to satisfy both of these ideals, but I believe we \nhave done so with this legislation.\n  For me, the conservative case for this legislation has been obvious \nfrom the beginning. Indeed, many of the provisions in the bill have \nwhat I consider to be very conservative roots. In 1990, William F. \nBuckley, Jr., one of the fathers of modern conservatism, who had served \nin World War II, published a wonderful book called: ``Gratitude: \nReflections on What We Owe to Our Country.'' He became a staunch \nadvocate of\n\n[[Page S3748]]\n\nnational service, which he believed, ``like gravity, is something we \ncould accustom ourselves to, and grow to love.''\n  Buckley believed we owe a debt of gratitude to our country and \noffered creative ideas for a plan for universal voluntary national \nservice for men and women 18 years and older. While the Serve America \nAct is not so ambitious as to contemplate that national and community \nservice will become universal, it does provide more Americans \nopportunities to serve, in the belief that our democracy and the values \nof our free society take constant vigilance to preserve their vitality \nand health. It is citizens, acting at the local level, who should play \nthe prominent role, not Government.\n  For the past several years, I have supported efforts to reposition \nour Government's support of national and community service from the \nperception of paying Federal ``volunteers'' to a more effective model \nwhere Government provides a small amount of infrastructure and support \nto community-based groups that are recruiting, training, and deploying \ntraditional volunteers. That model has worked. The number of \ntraditional, nonsubsidized volunteers who are leveraged into service by \nexisting national service programs dwarfs the number of participants \nreceiving Government assistance--by a ratio of nearly 30 to 1. We have \nheard that statistic quoted many times during this debate, but I \nbelieve it bears repeating.\n  This model is based on our faith in civil society--not distant \nGovernment agencies--and a focus on the efforts of the traditional \nvolunteer. We know so many Americans show up to volunteer--to help with \na cause or to serve in the aftermath of a disaster--and are turned away \nor are not well used. This is a waste of very precious resources. The \nServe America Act will help fix that by establishing a volunteer \ngeneration fund that will help already successful service programs \ndevote more resources for the recruitment of volunteers, allowing them \nto expand their efforts.\n  Help offered by a compassionate neighbor will always be superior to \nGovernment-driven approaches designed in Washington. In recognition of \nthis fact, the Serve America Act ensures that the vast majority of \nservice efforts will be generated by local and private organizations \nresponding to community needs.\n  Young Americans, whose rates of unemployment have soared to more than \n21 percent in a tough economy, with college graduates having the \nhighest unemployment rates ever, will be given new opportunities to \nserve. The good news is that research tells us this is a sound and \nefficient investment. Not only does it put many unemployed Americans to \nwork at a low cost to Government and meet urgent national needs, those \nyoung adults most at risk in our communities gain more by serving \nothers than they do by being passive recipients of services. During \ntheir terms of service, they gain valuable skills that help them secure \npermanent employment at higher wages. They also outpace their \nnonnational service peers in remaining committed to volunteer service \nfor the rest of their lives.\n  These platoons of civil society more often than not consist of faith-\nbased institutions. More Americans perform volunteer service through \nchurch-sponsored and faith-based organizations than any other venue. \nThe Serve America Act continues the tradition of enabling volunteers to \nserve through faith-based institutions in a variety of different ways, \nincluding its new Serve America Fellowships and the State competitive \nand formula grants that may be given to faith-based institutions \nproviding social services. This legislation also introduces new \nindicators of accountability to ensure that investments generate \nsignificant returns. For the Education Corps, for example, we want to \nknow how programs are improving student engagement, attendance, \nbehavior, academic achievement, graduation rates, and college-going \nrates at high schools with high concentrations of low-income students. \nEligible entities for funding through the Education Corps must have a \nproven record of improving or a promising strategy to improve \nperformance based on these indicators.\n\n  The days of simply funding programs that might make us feel better \nbut not generate results are over. Effective programs over time should \nand will continue to get support, and ineffective programs will \nultimately be closed down. These indicators will help us make those \ndecisions.\n  America utilizes a number of indicators to regularly track the \ncountry's economic progress, including unemployment, GDP, housing \nstarts, and more. But our country does very little to measure \nindicators of our civic health. Even though an active, well-connected, \ntrusting, and engaged citizenry is fundamental to our vibrant \ncommunities, a strong democracy is important, and our personal welfare \nis important as well. So the Serve America Act provides for the \ncollection of data that can give us a snapshot every year of how \ncommunities throughout the country are stacking up with respect to \nrates of volunteering, charitable giving, connections to civic and \nreligious groups, knowledge of American history and government, and \nmore. Policymakers can use this data to strengthen efforts to increase \nthese activities. Indeed, this civic health index will pay dividends \nthrough the policy spectrum.\n  Although some of my colleagues may argue otherwise, the Serve America \nAct reflects what I believe are conservative values, and because of \nthis I believe many of my Republican colleagues will be on board with \nthis legislation. The bill is founded on a fundamental belief in the \npower of people working at the local level to improve their communities \nand country, a belief in looking first to community and faith-based \ninstitutions to help solve our toughest challenges, a belief in public-\nprivate partnerships where the cost is low to the Federal Government \nand the return on investment very high, and a belief in tough \naccountability for results and making sure we support only programs \nthat work and end the programs that don't.\n  But the Serve America Act is also about something deeper that we all \nvalue whether we are liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat. \nIt is about fostering a spirit of patriotism, a love of country, at a \ntime when that patriotism has been fractured somewhat by a tough \neconomy, institutions that fail, individuals whose schemes hurt people, \nand distrust in government itself to have the answers.\n  Benjamin Rush, one of our Founding Fathers, wrote a brief text called \n``On Patriotism'' in 1773 that captures my view of the subject and the \nrole that service plays. Here is what Benjamin Rush, one of the \nFounders of this country, said:\n\n       Patriotism is as much a virtue as justice, and is as \n     necessary for the support of societies as natural affection \n     is for the support of families. The love of country is both a \n     moral and a religious duty. It comprehends not only love of \n     our neighbors, but of millions of our fellow citizens, not \n     only of the present, but of future generations.\n\n  I often think of our Nation's veterans when I read those words. I \nthink of the men and women serving during wars and campaigns from the \nAmerican Revolution through Operation Iraqi Freedom who literally had \nus in mind when they sacrificed their own lives so those in future \ngenerations might be free. Those who serve today--whether it is in the \nmilitary, in government, in national community service, or as \ntraditional volunteers--truly connect themselves to millions of their \nfellow citizens, not only of today but of the future. Such service is \nnot only the means to our own happiness, it strengthens and makes this \ncountry better. It makes better this country that we love so much.\n  These principles and ideals are the driving force behind this \nlegislation. Every Member of this body, whether they support this bill \nor not, loves this country and has devoted his or her life to serving \nit. I believe it is this devotion that we all share--the common belief \nin something bigger than ourselves--that has led so many to support \nthis legislation. While I am convinced the final result will be pretty \nlopsided in favor of passing this bill, I am going to keep trying to \nget it as close to unanimous as I can. Toward that end, I urge all 99 \nof our Senate colleagues to support the Serve America Act.\n  I notice the distinguished majority whip is here and would like to \nspeak, so I will reserve my time and speak a little later on some of \nthe other aspects of this bill.\n\n[[Page S3749]]\n\n  So with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch--and he is my friend. We have had many \npolitical battles in the past, but we have also joined forces in doing \nsome things that I think are important for our Nation. I wish to thank \nhim for his continued support of the DREAM Act. This is a bill which we \nkind of fought over on initial introduction; we both had the same idea. \nWe are going to continue to work together on that in years to come and, \nI hope, see it to its successful conclusion. It is the kind of \ncommitment Senator Hatch has made to the ideals of our Nation which he \nmakes again in this Serve America Act.\n  This act is known on the Senate floor, depending on which side of the \naisle you sit, as the Kennedy-Hatch Act or the Hatch-Kennedy Act. It is \nfitting that Senator Hatch would be teamed up with his old friend and \npolitical rival from time to time, Senator Ted Kennedy, as they both \ncame together in a common effort to pass this important legislation.\n  I spoke earlier this week about the Serve America Act which is now \npending before the Senate and what it would mean to our Nation. Let me \ntell my colleagues a few stories that I think illustrate it.\n  In my home State of Illinois, each year, 2.7 million volunteers \ndedicate 302 million hours of service. The estimated economic worth of \nthat contribution and voluntary service is almost $6 billion a year. \nMore than 66,000 of these volunteers participate in national service \nprograms through 144 different projects and programs. Each of them has \na story to tell about a life they have influenced or changed: a mother \nthey have helped feed her family, a child they have helped to learn, or \na community that is cleaner and safer because they are working and \nvolunteering to make it that way.\n  All of these volunteers can also tell about how their time and \nservice improved their lives. Let me mention a few stories.\n  In Chicago, the City Year Program places young volunteers to work \nfull time in some of Chicago's neediest schools. They serve as tutors \nand mentors and role models to the kids. A volunteer I talked to \nrecently tutored a young girl named Zariah. She was struggling with a \nlot of problems in school, with reading and behavior. I won't hold it \nagainst her--her behavior problem; I had the same problem, and I ended \nup in the Senate. Zariah was in jeopardy of failing the fourth grade, \nso this volunteer showed up and decided to take a personal interest in \nher.\n  A few weeks after tutoring Zariah, this volunteer heard a little \nvoice cry out as he walked by the school. It was little Zariah, and she \nwas yelling to this volunteer tutor: I passed fourth grade. I passed \nfourth grade.\n  What a reward for that volunteer and what a happy moment for that \nchild.\n  In Waukegan, IL, four AmeriCorps volunteers helped Habitat for \nHumanity construct homes and train and recruit volunteers. One of the \nAmeriCorps members told a story that I think is so heart-warming about \ndriving by a school every morning as an AmeriCorps volunteer, in their \nnotable jackets, and seeing a woman wave and cheer as they came by. She \nwasn't a homeowner or volunteer herself. She was just a member of the \ncommunity, and she recognized the AmeriCorps jacket. She knew what the \nvolunteers were doing, and she wanted to say thank you with a wave and \na cheer each morning.\n\n  Throughout Illinois, the Equal Justice Works Summer Corps Program \nprovides crucial legal assistance to communities. Law students give \ntheir time and talents in exchange for a very modest AmeriCorps \neducational award of $1,000 for a summer of work, many of them turning \ndown far more lucrative opportunities in the private sector.\n  In 2008, the Summer Corps Program had 23 members serving in my State, \nand they served over 1,000 low-income people who couldn't afford a \nlawyer any other way. One of those corps members was Nichole Churchill \nof Chicago. She spent a summer serving with the Children's Project of \nthe Legal Assistance Foundation working with parents, foster parents, \nand adoptive parents. This is what she said about her time there:\n\n       It has opened my eyes to the myriad of problems that many \n     of our low-income clients face on a daily basis. This \n     experience has only strengthened my resolve to continue this \n     kind of work and to effectuate meaningful change in their \n     lives.\n\n  Those are only a few of many stories told from my State of Illinois.\n  This week we are considering a bill that will dramatically expand the \nopportunities for voluntarism and service across America. The Serve \nAmerica Act will triple the number of national service participants to \n250,000 participants within 8 years. Along with this dramatic \nexpansion, it is going to create a new corps within AmeriCorps focused \non areas of national need such as education, environment, health care, \neconomic opportunity, and giving a helping hand to our veterans.\n  We are expanding opportunities to serve for Americans at every stage \nof life, too. Middle and high school students will be encouraged to \nparticipate in service projects during the summer or during the school \nyear. By serving their communities early in life, these students will \nbe put on a path to a lifetime of service.\n  For working Americans who can't commit to a full-time volunteer job, \nthe bill provides opportunity for them to work part time in their \ncommunity. Retirees can be given a new opportunity to serve with the \nexisting Senior Corps and through new expansion.\n  The bill also increases the education award for the first time since \nthe creation of the national service program. I think that is a perfect \ncomplement, that these good, well-meaning Americans would serve their \nNation and in return we would help them, give them a helping hand with \ntheir education at a time when education is so expensive for so many \nstudents. The education award in this program will be raised to the \nPell grant level which makes it easier for college students with \nsignificant student loan debt to consider national service. The award \nis transferable so that older volunteers can transfer the education \naward to their children or grandchildren--a perfect generational \nlegacy.\n  Each American has the power to make a small difference in the success \nof a child, the health of the environment, or the lives of their hungry \nneighbors. All of those small differences repeated over and over again \ncan add up to something truly powerful, truly inspiring. This bill will \nexpand the opportunities for Americans to serve their communities. \nPresident Obama has urged us to pass this on a timely basis, and I am \ngoing to encourage my colleagues to fight off the amendments which have \nnothing to do with this bill. Let's get this one done and done right. \nLet's not get bogged down in a lot of other issues that might be \npresented. They are all, I am sure, equally meritorious and worth our \nconsideration, but we need to finish this one. Let's get this bill done \nso that we can expand service and make an even stronger Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Serve \nAmerica Act, which expands opportunities for Americans to serve their \ncountry at a time of critical need. I thank Senator Kennedy and Senator \nHatch for their willingness to work with my staff to include language \nthat ensures the volunteers funded by this bill can also work on \nservice projects that expand access to affordable housing in our \ncommunities. Providing more affordable housing is one of Wisconsin's \nmost pressing needs and language that Senator Reed and I worked to \ninsert will help ensure that volunteers can build, improve, and \npreserve affordable housing throughout the country.\n  Just as voluntarism plays a crucial role in strengthening our \ncommunities and building a stronger America, that same energy, \ncompassion, and knowledge must also be harnessed to help rebuild our \nimage abroad as it has been severely damaged over the past 8 years.\n  The amendment I am offering today with Senator Voinovich encourages\n\n[[Page S3750]]\n\nthose efforts by strengthening and expanding the Volunteers for \nProsperity program authorized in title V of the bill. This program \nprovides a valuable tool to assist international volunteer service, and \nwith my improvements I believe we can make it even more effective.\n  A recent survey released by the Pew Global Attitudes Project \nindicates that between 2002 and 2008, opinions of the United States \ndeclined steeply in 14 out of the 19 countries polled. And a similar \n2007 survey of over 45,000 people in 47 countries found that \n``[o]verall, the image of American people has declined since 2002,'' \neven among those who used to count us as friends and allies.\n  The Obama administration has already taken some important steps to \nrebuild our image abroad, such as the President's decision to close \nGuantanamo and redeploy troops from Iraq, and his recent address to the \npeople of Iran. But individual Americans can contribute, too, and we \ncan support those efforts by increasing the opportunities for Americans \nfrom all backgrounds and experiences to volunteer abroad.\n  While the surveys I mentioned showed worsening attitudes toward \nAmericans and the declining popularity of the United States, studies \nhave shown that in places where U.S. citizens have volunteered their \ntime, money, and services, opinions of the United States have improved.\n  To put it simply, some of our best diplomats are our private citizens \nwho spend time overseas working closely with small communities and \nspending time with the citizens of other countries. Their volunteer \nwork is enhanced by their ability to share stories and create \nindividual connections. Collectively the two are a force for positive \nglobal change and greater cultural understanding.\n  One example is a story from a constituent, Kathy Anderson from \nMarathon, Wisconsin, who shared with me her thoughts on the exchange \nopportunities she and her husband Mike have experienced, including a \nrecent trip to Ukraine to discuss farming methods with folks under the \nCommunity Connections program:\n\n       We have lots and lots of stories, but the headline may be \n     that people interact with people at a very different level \n     than countries interact with countries. I may not like what \n     your country is doing, but if I get to know you as an \n     individual, I can still build a connection. Programs like \n     these put a face on the country, making it less abstract and \n     impersonal. Once the guests get to know a farmer from \n     Wisconsin, I'm sure they also have a better understanding \n     that our country is more than the image they see presented by \n     the politicians, or the sports figures, or the media folks. \n     It's real folks with the same kind of dreams, hopes, and \n     wishes for the future that they have. And perhaps we get a \n     bit closer, one relationship at a time.\n\n  Our Federal Government should continue to recognize the important \nrole that people-to-people engagement can play in countering negative \nviews of America around the world and help facilitate such \nopportunities by promoting both short- and long-term international \nvolunteer options for U.S. citizens. Existing programs such as the \nPeace Corps, Volunteers for Prosperity, and the exchange programs \nadministered through the Department of State's Bureau of Education and \nCultural Affairs already do tremendous work in this area. But even with \nthese existing programs, we need greater, more varied and more flexible \ncitizen diplomacy initiatives. Mr. President, we can and should be \ndoing more.\n  In 2007, I introduced the Global Service Fellowship bill to offer \nU.S. citizens the flexibility and support they need to pursue \ninternational volunteering opportunities. This bill reduced barriers to \nvolunteering by offering financial assistance and flexibility in the \ntime period Americans could spend abroad--opening the door for more \nAmericans to participate. This bipartisan bill was approved by the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee last Congress.\n  Now, in title V of the Serve America Act, we have the opportunity to \nsee a very similar program become a reality. This section authorizes \nthe Volunteers for Prosperity Office created by Executive Order 13317 \nunder President Bush. This program promotes short- and long-term \ninternational volunteering opportunities with specific development \nobjectives, and establishes the Volunteers for Prosperity Service \nIncentive Program or VfPServe program which provides eligible skilled \nprofessionals with grants to offset the cost of volunteering abroad. \nThis is a modest program costing only $10 million per year and yet it \nwill significantly expand the numbers of Americans who can participate.\n  I support Volunteers for Prosperity and, in fact, my global service \nfellowship bill would have authorized that program. The amendment I am \noffering, which is based on my legislation, makes a few changes to the \ncurrent language in title V. This is a modest amendment but reflects \nsuggested improvements I have received from constituents, experts and \norganizations active in the field of international voluntarism. As we \nauthorize the Volunteers for Prosperity office, we should make sure the \noffice has the utmost ability to reach as many interested Americans as \npossible, particularly those who face financial barriers or time \nconstraints.\n  In the current bill, VfPServe would help offset the cost of \ninternational volunteering expenses for prospective volunteers, \nprovided that they match dollar-for-dollar any grant awarded through \nthe program. VfPServe will enable many dedicated volunteers to raise \nthe additional funds needed to pursue international projects--but by \nrequiring the dollar-for-dollar match grants, participants in VfPServe \nwould still be required to cover a substantial amount of their \nexpenses.\n  Financial limitations are a common obstacle to international \nvolunteering by Americans, and I have heard from many constituents who \nare interested in volunteering internationally but are unable to do so \ndue to the cost. My amendment goes an extra step to ensure that even \nmore Americans from a range of backgrounds can volunteer abroad--not \njust those with the resources or time to pay for half of their \nexpenses.\n  My amendment complements VfPServe by establishing the VfP Leader \nProgram to award fixed grants that would offset up to 80 percent of the \ncosts of volunteering abroad, including any sponsoring organization \nfees. In return for this higher Federal contribution, VfP Leaders must \ncommit to sharing their experiences with their communities when they \nreturn. By continuing to serve as ambassadors once they return home, \nVfP leaders will be ensuring that more Americans learn about the \nbenefits of international volunteering, and about people and places \nbeyond our borders. In addition, my amendment would give VfPserve \nparticipants the option of raising or providing private funds to meet \ntheir matching requirements. I have heard from many organizations that \nthe inability to raise adequate funds has stymied a number of \nindividuals from fully participating in the program. This small tweak \nwill open the door wider to those interested to participate in either \nVFP program, who may be willing and able to spend some of their own \nmoney to do so.\n\n  The VIP Leader Program would be administered by the VfP office, along \nwith the VfPserve program in the bill. The USAID Administrator would be \nin charge of awarding VfP leader grants and would develop the \nguidelines for selecting recipients, based on the objectives laid out \nin the underlying bill, which include a commitment to helping reduce \nworld hunger and combating the spread of communicable diseases. My \namendment adds a few mote objectives: providing disaster response, \npreparedness and reconstruction, providing general medical and dental \ncare and promoting crosscultural exchange. These are all important \npriorities, and opportunities for Americans to bolster our global image \nwhile providing essential services.\n  Other than these additions, my amendment does not change the \nunderlying authorization of VfP, nor does it change the total cost of \ntitle V. Authorization for title V will remain at $10 million annually \nfor the fiscal years 2010 through 2014, with half of the money \nappropriated for grants going to the VIP Leader Program.\n  I would like to thank Senator Voinovich, who cosponsored the Global \nServices Fellowship Acts of 2007, 2008, and 2009 and who is a cosponsor \nof this amendment. This amendment is supported by 82 international \nvolunteer organizations such as American Jewish World Service, Cross-\nCultural Solutions, and the National Peace Corps Association as well as \n91 university\n\n[[Page S3751]]\n\ninternational programs including the University of Maryland's Office of \nInternational Programs, its School of Public Policy and its Study \nAbroad office, and the Fletcher School at Tufts University in \nMassachusetts. I would like to submit the lists with all the supporting \norganizations and university international programs in their entirety \nfor the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                College & University Members--March 2009\n\n       American University; Boston College--The Center for \n     Corporate Citizenship; Boston University; Boston University--\n     Center for International Health and Development; California \n     Colleges for International Education; California State \n     University, San Marcos--Office of Community Service Learning; \n     Cardinal Stritch University; Catholic University; Central \n     Michigan University Volunteer Center; City College of New \n     York; Chilean Ministry of Education--National Volunteer \n     Center; College of William and Mary--Office of Student \n     Volunteer Services; Columbia University--School of \n     International Public Affairs; Cornell University; Dowling \n     College; Drexel University; Duke University--Center for \n     Engagement & Duke Engage; Duke University--Global Health \n     Institute; Emory University; and Everett Community College--\n     World Languages.\n       George Mason University--Multicultural Research and \n     Resource Center; George Washington University; Georgetown \n     University--Center for Social Justice; Georgia Institute of \n     Technology--Community Service; Global Citizen Year; Hartwick \n     College; Hillsborough Community College Grants Development; \n     Iowa State University; James Madison College; John Hopkins \n     University; Kennesaw College; Kingsborough Community College/\n     CUNY--Academic Affairs; Lone Star College--Tomball; Lone Star \n     College--Tomball--Academic and Student Development; Lone Star \n     College System--International Programs and Services; Miami \n     Dade College; Missouri State University--International \n     Programs and Affairs; Monroe Community College Foundation; \n     Montgomery College Office of Equity & Diversity; and Moore \n     School of Business.\n       Mount Wachusett Community College; Mount Wachusett \n     Community College--Community Relations; NC Campus Compact; \n     New York Medical College; New York University--Office of \n     Global Education; North Arkansas College--Institutional \n     Advancement; Norwalk Community College--Academic Affairs; \n     Ohio University; Onondaga Community College--Career and \n     Applied Learning Center; Oregon University System; Palm Beach \n     Community College; Palm Beach Community College--President's \n     Office; Polk Community College--Grants; Ramapo College of New \n     Jersey; Rutgers University; Santa Monica College--\n     Communication; Skagit Valley College--College Advancement; \n     Southwestern Oregon Community College Service--Leanring; \n     Stanford University--Haas Center for Public Service; and \n     State University of New York--New Paltz Center for \n     International Programs.\n       StonyBrook University; Syracuse University Maxwell School \n     of Citizenship and Public Affairs; Tufts, The Fletcher \n     School; University of California, Berkeley--Blum Center for \n     Developing Economies; University of California, San Diego--\n     International Relations and Pacific Studies; Richard J.

As we debate the Serve America Act and highlight the \nimportant role of volunteer service in our communities, we must not \noverlook the opportunities for volunteers to help restore our image and \nstanding abroad. Wisconsinites have a strong tradition of public \nservice, particularly among young people in my state and it is because \nof their consistent interest in such opportunities that I offer this \namendment today.\n  International volunteering opportunities are an effective method of \naddressing critical human needs, building bridges across cultures, and \npromoting mutual understanding. In turn, this can bolster our national \nand global security. Though they may be working overseas, Americans who \nvolunteer abroad are truly serving the interests of America.\n  The VfPServe and VfPLeaders Programs would be a valuable addition to \nour public diplomacy, to our development and humanitarian efforts \noverseas. I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment I will \noffer at a future time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 688\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Crapo \namendment which incorporates the Dodd-Crapo bill that I have \ncosponsored. Every Senator in this Chamber has heard from folks in \ntheir own communities who have lost jobs, families whose savings are \ndisappearing, businesses that cannot meet payrolls. Unfortunately, \nuntil we solve the root of the economic crisis--our credit crisis--\nthere will not be real relief or recovery for these struggling families \nand businesses.\n  The bottom line is our financial system is not working. It has become \nclogged with toxic assets. Some call them legacy assets, but they are \ntoxic as well as old. Until they are removed, fear and uncertainty will \ncontinue to dominate the markets.\n  Earlier this week, Secretary Geithner released his long-awaited \ndetails on the administration's plan to solve the credit crisis. While \nSecretary Geithner did not take all of my advice, I am heartened that \nthe administration has finally developed a plan to tackle the most \npressing issue facing our Nation and the largest obstacle to economic \nrecovery.\n  All Americans need this plan to work. Our Nation cannot afford \nanother lost decade such as Japan faced in the nineties. No one wants \nto doom the Nation's families and workers to a recession any longer and \ndeeper than the one we have already experienced. But before the \nGovernment commits trillions more in tax dollars, I hope Secretary \nGeithner will recognize that he owes the taxpayers some answers to some \nvery important questions.\n\n[[Page S3752]]\n\n  Unfortunately, under the previous administration and the current \nadministration, there have been too few answers and too many questions \nfor taxpayers about how economic rescue dollars are being spent. \nInstead, under both Treasury Secretaries Paulson's and Geithner's \nwatch, billions in taxpayer dollars have been thrown down the rat hole, \nwith no clear plan, no end in sight, and no positive return. So now, \nthis week, the taxpayers need to hear how the administration's plan \nwill provide accountability, transparency, and oversight of taxpayer \nfunds.\n  First, Secretary Geithner needs to tell taxpayers how this plan will \nprotect their hard-earned dollars. Taxpayers have the right to question \nwhether they are getting a fair deal since the taxpayers are taking on \nthe vast majority of the risks under the new public-private investment \npartnership initiative.\n  Right now, private investors only stand to lose a small amount with \ntheir invested capital, with opportunities for great returns. In other \nwords, are we again privatizing profits but socializing losses? Do we \nrun the risk that this ends up being ``heads they win, tails taxpayers \nlose''? This plan is dependent on taxpayers subsidizing and excessive \nleveraging of private resources to purchase these toxic assets. While \nit is important to encourage private capital, and I believe that is the \nbest solution, we seem to be using the same formula--but this time \nrisking billions of taxpayer dollars--that got us into the present \nsituation. I am concerned that the administration's plan appears to be \ntoo generous to Wall Street investors, some of whom contributed to the \ncrisis.\n  The second point is, what is the ultimate cost to taxpayers? Right \nnow, the administration projects that its plan will initially require \n$100 billion in taxpayer funds to leverage up to $500 billion in \ntaxpayer dollars. But most estimates show there are about $2 trillion \nof toxic assets in the system. I believe the taxpayers deserve to know \nhow much Secretary Geithner's plan will really cost them.\n  Third, the administration and the Treasury Secretary need to explain \nhow he will prevent the rules of the game from changing again. Since \nthe initial rescue of Bear Stearns last summer, the previous and the \ncurrent administrations have taken an ad hoc approach that has changed \nand shifted numerous times. This ``adhocracy'' has amounted to throwing \nbillions of good taxpayers' dollars into failing banks, treating the \nsymptoms rather than the cause, with no apparent exit strategy. This \n``adhocracy'' has resulted in fear and uncertainty in our markets and \nhas done nothing to hasten the much needed economic recovery. As a \nmatter of fact, one skilled observer, Professor John Taylor, said the \nlack of certainty has been a great cause in the failure of the markets \nto respond positively to any of the previous activities.\n  Is the plan announced this week the one and final approach? Will the \nadministration stick to the plan? And just as important, what about \nCongress? Will we allow the plan to work or will we come in later and \nchange the rules of the game after they have been set? The \nadministration, and I think we in Congress, must convince Wall Street \nand Main Street that the rules will not be changed again midgame. What \nexpert after expert has told me, people who are looking at the market, \npeople who want to see the market succeed, what the markets desperately \nneed is certainty in a plan.\n  Finally, will banks and financial institutions holding toxic assets \nbe willing to participate in the program? Despite what seems to be \ngenerous incentives for private investors to purchase the assets, it is \nnot clear whether the banks will be willing to negotiate a fair deal \nwith the Government and the partners. If banks are not willing to \nparticipate, then toxic assets will continue to clog the system. If \nthey do not participate, will the administration finally turn to the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation to resolve these problem banks?\n  Before closing, I note that we all understand we need to strengthen \nthe ability of our regulators to prevent this kind of systemic failure \nfrom occurring in the future, but we need to consider any changes \ncarefully. A critical first step would be our pending amendment which \nincorporates the Dodd-Crapo bill, S. 541, the Depositor Protection Act, \nto boost the FDIC's borrowing authority to deal with larger \ninstitutions and to prevent further substantial fee increases on good \nbanks.\n  I heard from smaller, well-performing banks in Missouri that did not \nparticipate in the subprime and exotic loans that will bear more costs \nto cover the failures of the large banks that did. These smaller banks \nshould not have to be a casualty of the mistakes of the larger \nfinancial institutions. Will the FDIC use the expanded authority that I \nhope we will give them to return FDIC premiums to their previous level? \nWe need a diverse banking system. We need a system. There are over \n8,000 banks of all sizes in communities and States throughout the \nNation. It is my hope that this financial crisis resolution preserves \nthat system instead of allowing it to be dominated by a few ``too large \nto fail'' institutions.\n  What else will the Treasury do? How will the Treasury assure these \nother banks will be strengthened when they are not in the top 20 on \nwhich the Treasury seems to focus?\n  These are just a few of the critical questions about Secretary \nGeithner's untested, complicated plan. We, on behalf of taxpayers, \ndeserve answers. Taxpayers deserve to hear solutions that will work. It \nis more important than anything else in solving the economic crisis \nthat we solve the credit crisis.\n  Our banking and financial system affects every American's standard of \nliving, our ability to create and maintain jobs, and our ability to \ncompete globally. We must tackle the root of this problem--the toxic \nassets--and lead us out of the economic crisis and help Americans get \nback to work.\n  I, like most Americans, am suffering from bailout fatigue. Rightfully \nso. Taxpayers are fed up over the waste of hard-earned tax dollars and \nthe plans that have wandered all over the lot in the past. Secretary \nGeithner now has a tough challenge, and that is to convince the \ntaxpayers that this plan is a smart investment that will solve the root \nof our economic crisis.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Dodd amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                      Nomination of David S. Kris\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak \nbriefly on the nomination of David S. Kris to be Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in the National Security Division of the Department of Justice.\n  Let me say preliminarily how nice it is to see the other--I shouldn't \nsay ``the other Senator''--the Senator from Pennsylvania presiding \ntoday. I compliment Senator Casey on an outstanding tenure for, let me \nsee, 2 years and almost 3 months. I express my appreciation for his \ncooperation in working together on so many projects.\n  May I say further for the Record, since it is in black and white and \nnot in Technicolor, I think there is a slight blush on Senator Casey \nfor the warranted praise.\n  Now on to the other subject at hand.\n  David Kris has been nominated for this very important position. He \ncomes to it with excellent credentials. He is a graduate of Haverford \nCollege, a college I know very well, being my oldest son, Shanin, \ngraduated there, and the Harvard Law School, an institution I don't \nknow quite so well but one I hear is a very good school, not perhaps up \nto--well, I won't comment about that. After graduation from law school, \nMr. Kris served as clerk to Judge Stephen Trott on the Ninth Circuit; \nwas in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice for 8 years; \nwas Deputy Attorney General for 3 years. He has excellent academic and \nprofessional standards.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have Mr. Kris's resume printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Mr. Kris has the commendations and \nrecommendations of both Attorneys General for whom he worked--Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno and Attorney General John Ashcroft. John Ashcroft, \nour former colleague in the Senate who sat on the Judiciary Committee, \ndescribed Mr. Kris's ``intelligence, independence,\n\n[[Page S3753]]\n\nand wisdom'' as ``valuable national assets.''\n  After years of public service, Mr. Kris joined Time Warner and even \nfound time to write a legal treatise on national security \ninvestigations and prosecutions. He is considered an expert on the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act and leading authority on national \nsecurity law.\n  I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n David S.

KRIS TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of David S. Kris, of \nMaryland, to be Assistant Attorney General.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate has confirmed four nominees to \nfill top leadership positions at the Justice Department officials, and \ntoday we take another step forward to put in place Attorney General \nHolder's leadership team. Today, the Senate turns to the nomination of \nDavid Kris to lead the National Security Division.\n  I thank the Democratic and Republican members of the Judiciary \nCommittee for working with me to expedite this nomination when it was \nin committee. Senator Feinstein chaired our Judiciary Committee hearing \non his nomination on February 25. We were able to report his nomination \nout of the committee by a voice vote on March 5. The Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence worked quickly to consider and report his \nnomination as well. Finally, the Senate today considers his nomination \nto this critical national security post.\n  The Judiciary Committee's renewed oversight efforts in the last 2 \nyears brought into sharper focus what for years had been clear--that \nduring the last 8 years, the Bush administration repeatedly ignored the \nchecks and balances wisely placed on executive power by the Founders. \nThe Bush administration chose to enhance the power of the President and \nto turn the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice into \nan apologist for White House orders--from the warrantless wiretapping \nof Americans to torture.\n  Attorney General Holder has already taken steps toward restoring the \nrule of law. With the confirmation of David Kris to lead the National \nSecurity Division, we fill another key national security position in \nthe Department.\n  David Kris is a highly regarded veteran of the Department of Justice. \nHe is former Federal prosecutor who spent 8 years as a career attorney \nin the criminal division at the Department, handling complex cases in \nFederal trial and appellate courts, including the Supreme Court. Mr. \nKris was then a political appointee under both President Clinton and \nPresident Bush, serving as Associate Deputy Attorney General from 2000-\n2003, supervising the government's use of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, FISA, representing the Justice Department at the \nNational Security Council and in other interagency settings, briefing \nand testifying before Congress, and assisting the Attorney General in \nconducting oversight of the U.S. intelligence community.\n  Mr. Kris understands the role the Bush administration's excesses have \nplayed in undermining the Department of Justice and the rule of law. In \n2006, Mr. Kris released a 23-page legal memorandum critical of the \nlegal rationale offered by the Bush administration, and in support of \nthe legality of the National Security Agency's warrantless wiretapping \nprogram. Mr. Kris was an early advocate for the creation of the \nNational Security Division he has now been confirmed to lead, leaving a \nlucrative practice as an in-house counsel for a major corporation to \nreturn to government service.\n  Mr. Kris' nomination has also earned support from both sides of the \naisle. Former Bush administration Solicitor General Ted Olson, who \nworked with Mr. Kris at the Department, describes Mr. Kris as ``a very \nsound lawyer,'' who ``is committed to the defense of the United States \nand its citizens, and respects the rule of law and civil rights.'' \nFormer Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, who asked Mr. Kris to \nremain in his post during the Bush administration, writes that he asked \nMr. Kris to stay after finding that ``he had a passion for national \nsecurity issues but also a deep respect and appreciation for the \nrelated civil liberties concerns.'' Former Bush administration Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Michael Chertoff and former Attorneys General Janet \nReno and John Ashcroft have all written in support of Mr. Kris' \nnomination.\n  President Obama has reminded Americans and the world that, ``to \novercome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the values \nour troops defend--because there is no force in the world more powerful \nthan the example of America.'' The President reminded us that ``living \nour values doesn't make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us \nstronger.''\n  David Kris understands the moral and legal obligations we have to \nprotect the fundamental rights of all Americans and to respect the \nhuman rights of all. He knows, as do the President and the Attorney \nGeneral, that we must ensure that the rule of law is restored as the \nguiding light for the work of the Department of Justice.\n  I congratulate Mr. Kris and his family on his confirmation today.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nnomination of David S. Kris to be Assistant Attorney General for \nNational Security.\n  Mr. Kris was nominated by President Obama on February 11, 2009, to \nfill this important position. Since then, his\n\n[[Page S3754]]\n\nnomination has been considered by the Judiciary Committee and then \nsequentially by the Intelligence Committee. I had the honor of chairing \nboth of these hearings, so am as familiar with any Member with his \nrecord.\n  Both the Judiciary Committee and Intelligence Committee favorably \nreported the nomination without dissent.\n  The position of the Assistant Attorney General for National Security \nwas created in the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of \n2005 out of recognition that there should be a single official in the \nDepartment of Justice who is responsible for national security.\n  The Assistant Attorney General is the bridge between our Nation's \nintelligence community and the Department of Justice. He or she \nrepresents the Government before the FISA Court and is also the \nGovernment's chief counterterrorism and counterespionage prosecutor.\n  David Kris is highly qualified for this critically important national \nsecurity position.\n  He has both figuratively and literally ``written the book'' on \nnational security.\n  Mr. Kris spent 11 years as a prosecutor in the Justice Department, \nand he knows its national security functions well.\n  During the Bush administration, he was the Associate Deputy Attorney \nGeneral for national security, where he litigated national security \ncases and oversaw intelligence activities. When Congress considered \nmerging the Department's national security functions under a single \noffice, Kris was one of the experts consulted.\n  After leaving Federal Government service, Mr. Kris remained very \nactive in the field of national security law. He coauthored of the most \nwidely used legal treatise in this area. His book, titled ``National \nSecurity Investigations and Prosecutions'', provides a step-by-step \nanalysis of all of the law that governs Government activity in response \nto terrorist threats.\n  During the debate last year over rewriting the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, Mr. Kris spent significant amounts of his personal \ntime meeting with personnel from both the Judiciary and Intelligence \nCommittees to offer his expertise and judgment.\n  In addition to his expertise, Kris has received high marks for his \ncommitment to the rule of law. Both committees to consider his \nnomination received numerous letters of support from distinguished \nlegal and privacy rights officials and experts. Those letters are in \nthe hearing records at both committees.\n  It is important for the Senate to consider this nomination and \nconfirm Mr. Kris. Simply put, the Department of Justice needs him to \nget to work.\n  The Assistant Attorney General position, currently vacant, is the \nprimary official overseeing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nimplementation and signs applications going to the FISA Court.\n  Because of the legislation passed last year, Mr. Kris will need to \nstart immediately to prepare new certifications and supporting \nmaterials that the executive branch will have to submit to the FISA \nCourt. As such, he would be the official at the Department of Justice \nmost directly involved in questions of setting minimization and \ntargeting procedures, reviewing the Attorney General's guidelines under \nthe act, and making sure that the intelligence collection is carried \nout faithfully under the law.\n  Separately, an Assistant Attorney General should be playing a key \nrole in the executive branch review of how to handle individuals \ncurrently held at Guantanamo Bay. Mr. Kris has answered numerous \nquestions on this topic during his confirmation hearings and shares my \nview that there must be an appropriate legal process upholding any \ndecisions to detain individuals. However, he also believes, correctly \nin my view, that great care must be taken to ensure that anyone at \nGuantanamo who is transferred to other nations must not be allowed to \npose a continuing threat to our national security.\n  I am pleased that this nomination has finally reached the floor, and \nI urge the confirmation of David Kris.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     American and Chinese Economies\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the current financial crisis paints our \neconomic relationship with China in broad relief. Our economies are not \nhealthy, China's economy, the economy of the United States. And worse, \nthese two countries' economies, ours and China's, are codependent.\n  The U.S. official unemployment rate is 8.1 percent. In my State of \nOhio, it is 9.4 percent, the highest rate inflicted on our State in 25 \nyears. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of factories in China have closed \nover the past 6 months.\n  China is one enormous export platform, and the United States is its \nbiggest customer. We, for all intents and purposes, have stopped \nbuying. Morgan Stanley economists report that exports account for 47 \npercent of the economies of China and other East Asian nations. \nLiterally 47 percent of their economy, almost half of their economy, is \ndevoted to export in China and other Eastern Asian countries, while in \nour country, the United States, consumption accounts for 70 percent of \nour GDP. This economic codependency has bred a dangerously skewed \nfinancial relationship. As revenues flow out of the United States and \ninto China, China has become our biggest lender. Imagine what that is \ngoing to look like if we continue these policies in the years ahead. \nWhat it means for sovereign wealth funds, the collection of United \nStates dollars held by Chinese banks, Chinese Government treasury, \nChinese businesses, the number of United States dollars, because of \ntheir trade surplus, coming from our trade deficit situation--I do not \nneed to detail the\n\n[[Page S3755]]\n\nrisk that relationship breeds. But its roots lie in our economic \ncodependency, and our economic codependency is rooted in our Nation's \npassive trade policy.\n  Senator Sanders and Senator Whitehouse, joining me on the floor, with \nthe Presiding Officer, all understand what these trade agreements have \ndone, this passive trade policy that we have practiced for more than a \ndecade, what that has done to our country.\n  Ohio is one of the great manufacturing States in our Nation. We make \npaper, steel, aluminum, glass, cars, tires, solar panels--one of the \nleading States in the country manufacturing solar panels--polymers, \nwind turbines, and more. Look around you today and you will see, \nwherever you go, something that was made in Ohio.\n  So let's look at a typical Ohio manufacturer and compare that with a \nChinese manufacturer. The Ohio manufacturer has a minimum wage to pay \nhis workers, as he should. The Ohio manufacturer has clean air rules, \nsafe drinking water rules, workplace rules, product safety standards by \nwhich to abide, helping to keep our workers healthy and productive, \nhelping to keep customers safe, helping to create a better, more humane \nsociety.\n  Worker safety, environment, public health, treating workers properly, \nthese are all things our country and the values it represents has \nbrought to us. The Chinese manufacturer has no minimum wage to \nmaintain, is allowed to pollute local water sources, is allowed to let \nworkers use dangerous and faulty machinery and, frankly, whether it is \nin a vitamin or food of some kind, is allowed to use, too often, toxic \nsubstances, such as on children's toys with lead-based paint, things \nsuch as that. Chinese manufacturing doesn't do any of the things the \nOhio manufacturer does.\n  The Ohio manufacturer pays taxes, health benefits, pays into Social \nSecurity and Medicare, typically allows family leave, and gives WARN \nnotices when there is a plant closing. The Chinese manufacturer does \nlittle of that, but the Chinese manufacturer also allows child labor, \nwhich is expressly forbidden in this country. The Ohio manufacturer \ngenerally receives no government subsidies. The Chinese manufacturer \noften receives some subsidies for the development of new technologies \nand, often, subsidies for export assistance. The Chinese manufacturer \nbenefits from China's manipulation of its currency which gives it up to \na 40-percent cost advantage.\n  The Ohio manufacturer is going green, investing in new technologies \nand efficiency to create more sustainable production practices. Ohio \nmanufacturers are part of the movement to become more energy efficient. \nThey will do their job to reduce carbon emissions but not at the \nexpense of jobs if China and other countries don't take comparable \naction. When an Ohio manufacturer petitions for relief, when he says, \n``I can compete with anyone, but this is not a level playing field;'' \nwhen the Ohio manufacturer says he wants to emit less carbon but needs \nto see that his competitors from China bear the same cost on similar \ntime lines, what does the Chinese Government say? They call it \nprotectionism.\n  Last week Energy Secretary Chu noted in a hearing that unless other \ncountries bear a cost for carbon emissions, the United States will be \nat a disadvantage. The Chinese official responded:\n\n       I will oppose using climate change as an excuse to practice \n     protectionism on trade.\n\n  Chinese officials are quick to call us protectionist, a country that \nhas an $800 billion trade deficit, despite all the protections the \nChinese afford its manufacturers. Meanwhile, the United States has the \nworld's most open economy, as we should.\n  Of course, Chinese officials are often joined by highly paid American \nCEOs, by Ivy League economists, by editorial boards at darn near every \nnewspaper in the country in calling any effort to rebuild American \nmanufacturing protectionist. In newspapers around the country, when we \nfight for American jobs and say we need a level playing field, \nnewspapers will say we are protectionist. That is why there is such a \nsense of urgency about changing this manufacturing policy. China's \nindustrial policy is based on unfair trade practices. It involves \ndirect export subsidies and indirect subsidies such as currency \nmanipulation and copyright piracy, hidden subsidies such as lax \nstandards and low labor costs, and unenforced environmental rules. In \ntotal, it results in millions of lost jobs--in Erie, Pittsburgh, \nPhiladelphia, Cleveland, Youngstown, Sandusky, Zaynesville, and Lima, \nall over the States.\n  It is also depressing wage and income levels worldwide, while China's \nexploitation of environmental and health and safety standards injures \nChinese, sometimes kills Chinese workers and citizens, and adds to our \nclimate change challenges. The health of our economy, the strength of \nour middle class depends on how Congress and how the Obama \nadministration engages with China on these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/25/senate-section/article/S3755-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reed \nfrom Rhode Island be recognized first, for up to 5 minutes, and then I \nbe recognized, following him, for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1388, the \nServe America Act. I particularly commend Senator Mikulski for her \nleadership on this very important initiative. She has done more than \nanyone to bring this bill to the floor and it being on the verge of \nsuccessful passage. I say thank you, Madam Chairwoman as well as \nSenators Kennedy, Hatch, and Enzi for your excellent work on this bill.\n  This bipartisan legislation reauthorizes the National and Community \nService Act for the first time since 1993. It strengthens our \ncommitment to the importance and value of national and community \nservice for individuals of all ages.\n  I was pleased the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that was \nsigned into law last month included $154 million for AmeriCorps State \nand national programs and AmeriCorps VISTA. This funding is estimated \nto engage 13,000 additional individuals in service to their \ncommunities. In his address to Congress last month, President Obama \nencouraged ``a renewed spirit of national service for this and future \ngenerations'' and called for quick congressional action on the \nlegislation we seek to pass today.\n  There are a variety of ways to serve your country. You can serve in \nthe Armed Forces, as I did, or you can serve in your community, as so \nmany Americans are doing today. More than ever, being a good citizen \nmeans not only working hard and providing for one's family but also \nbeing an engaged and contributing member of the community, and \nparticularly to those most in need in your community.\n  We make ourselves better by engaging in service that gives back to \nour communities and makes our society better, through teaching, \nmentoring and tutoring children, cleaning up rivers and streams, \nbuilding housing for the homeless, and addressing the medical needs of \nthe ailing, to name a few endeavors that are so critical.\n  The AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve America, and Senior Corps programs \nhave greatly benefitted my State. Rhode Island has a proud tradition of \nservice and was one of the first States to embrace the AmeriCorps \nprogram. More than 14,000 Rhode Islanders participated in those \nprograms last year.\n  Participants in these programs are given an opportunity to learn as \nwell as an opportunity to serve. In the act of serving their community, \nparticipants often make a difference in their own lives--developing \ntheir own knowledge, skills, character, and self-esteem, and \nincorporating an ethic of civic responsibility for the rest of their \nlives.\n\n[[Page S3756]]\n\n  As a cosponsor of this legislation, I am particularly pleased that \nthis bill includes changes I advocated to maximize Rhode Island's \nfunding through the AmeriCorps and Learn and Serve programs. The Serve \nAmerica Act includes a statutory small State minimum for the AmeriCorps \nand Learn and Serve formula programs for the first time. It also \nincludes a provision I authored to ensure that small, innovative \nAmeriCorps programs such as those found throughout Rhode Island get \ntheir fair share of competitive grant funding. Additionally, I am \npleased that this legislation includes changes I sought to encourage \nvolunteers to focus on helping low-income individuals find affordable \nhousing.\n  This is legislation that is important. It is critical. It lives up to \nour highest traditions as a nation; that is, to be something more than \none who enjoys their rights but also who discharges their \nresponsibilities through service to the community and the Nation. I \nurge passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am a member of the Budget Committee. \nSenator Conrad is our chairman. Senator Gregg is our ranking member. As \nthe Senate knows, this week we will be taking up the President's \nproposed budget, and I want to speak for a few minutes about that \nsubject.\n  Yesterday I had the opportunity to speak to a number of students who \nwere here because they want to make sure Congress continues to provide \nthem an opportunity to study at our Nation's community colleges. I am a \nstrong believer in the role of community colleges as a less expensive \nyet outstanding opportunity to earn a good education, but it being also \na part of our workforce development and training, where industry can \ncome in and match up a curriculum to train people to perform jobs for \nwhich they can receive well-paying salaries.\n  But yesterday these community college students, of course, were here \nto talk about the issues that are on their mind. They heard from Dr. \nJill Biden and Secretary Duncan, among others. I appreciate how eager \nthey were to learn what is going on here in Washington. Indeed, I bet \nthere are a lot of people who would like to know what is going on here \nin Washington.\n  I encouraged them to learn about the issues and express their views. \nI told them that as far as I can tell, their generation will bear the \nconsequences of the reckless spending this Congress is engaged in, in a \nbudget that simply spends too much, taxes too much, and borrows too \nmuch.\n  Students will ultimately end up--after they finish their education \nand enter the workforce--paying those higher taxes under this proposed \nbudget. This proposed budget calls for $1.4 trillion in additional net \ntaxes over the next 10 years.\n  Students are trying to figure out how these higher taxes will \nactually impact the opportunities they will have as they enter the \nworkforce. Some of these taxes will hit these students at the toughest \ntime; that is, right as they enter their first job.\n  We know the engine of job creation in America is our small \nbusinesses. In fact, of those small businesses that employ between 10 \nand 500 employees--which are the principal job creators in our \ncountry--50 percent of them will experience higher tax rates because \nmany of them are not incorporated. They are sole proprietorships. They \nare partnerships. They are subchapter S corporations, where the income \nactually flows through and is reported on an individual tax return.\n  So it is not true to say these will only affect the rich. Indeed, \nthese taxes will affect the very job engine that creates the jobs we \nought to be worried about retaining and indeed creating more of.\n  I also talked to these students about how they will feel the impact \nof higher energy costs on their electric bill. You may wonder what I am \ntalking about. Well, we all care about the environment. As a matter of \nfact, I reject the notion of people who actually say: Well, we care \nabout the environment, and you do not care. I think we all care about \nthe quality of the air we breathe, the quality of the water we drink. I \ncannot imagine someone who does not.\n  These students, though, I think are understandably skeptical of the \ncomplex and unproven cap-and-trade scheme the President's budget wants \nto import from Europe, which will actually ultimately increase the cost \nof energy, including electricity. That is why some people have called \nit a national sales tax on energy, if, indeed, this complex and \nunproven cap-and-trade plan is passed as part of the President's \nbudget.\n  Then there is the issue of the caps placed on charitable deductions \nfor taxpayers who take advantage of that tax break when they contribute \nmoney to good and worthy purposes. Many community college students \nreceive scholarships from foundations that are funded by charitable \ncontributions. As a matter of fact, charitable giving is one of the \nthings that is part of our Nation's great tradition of voluntarism--\nsomething Alexis de Tocqueville called ``public associations''--things \nyou do not get paid for but things that people do because they think it \nis the right thing to do and they have the opportunity to do in our \ngreat country.\n  This budget would actually cap charitable contributions, which will \nactually reduce the tax incentive for individuals to contribute money \nto good causes such as the Tyler Junior College Foundation in Tyler, \nTX. The foundation is understandably concerned that raising taxes \nwithout increasing the charitable tax deduction will limit their \nability to offer as many scholarships in future years.\n  So these tax increases will, in effect, limit the opportunities for \nthese community college students, including folks in my State, in east \nTexas, in Tyler, TX.\n  Then there is the issue of raising taxes generally and spending. \nThese students know Congress is already spending a whole lot of their \nmoney because it is all borrowed money. In fact, we have spent more \nmoney since this Congress convened this year than has been spent for \nthe Iraq war, the war in Afghanistan, and in Hurricane Katrina \nrecovery. We have done that already. And this budget calls for doubling \nthe debt in 5 years and tripling the debt in 10 years.\n\n  These students, understandably--because they are going to be the ones \nwe are going to look to to pay that money back or bear that tax \nburden--should be concerned and, indeed, they are concerned that so \nmuch money is being spent so recklessly. In fact, it is impossible for \nme to imagine it will be spent without huge sums of money actually \nbeing wasted.\n  We have already seen evidence of that. In the stimulus bill--the \nPresident said he wanted on his desk in short order, which was rushed \nthrough the Senate and through the Congress--$1.1 trillion, including \nthe debt and interest on the debt--we found out, once we passed the \nnext bill, which was a $410 billion Omnibus appropriations bill, that, \nlo and behold, Congress had actually doubly funded 122 different \nprograms in the bill. We acted with such haste, with such little care, \nwith such little deliberation, that we found out we doubly funded 122 \nprograms.\n  Indeed, we found out in recent days that in the conference report on \nthe stimulus bill, there was a provision stuck in the conference report \nthat protected the bailout bonuses for the executives of AIG. Then, of \ncourse, there was the understandable uproar over that. That is what \nhappens when a bill is printed and circulated at 11 o'clock at night, \non a Thursday night, and we are required to vote on it in less than 24 \nhours the next day. That is not the kind of transparency, that is not \nthe kind of accountability, that is not what will actually give people \nmore confidence in their Government-elected officials. To the contrary. \nThere is another provision in this omnibus bill that has essentially \nstarted a trade war with Mexico, something that causes me grave \nconcern.\n  So as we consider the President's $3.6 trillion budget proposal, we \nshould remember the lessons of the past 2 weeks: spending so much \nmoney, so quickly, can lead to unintended consequences, to say the very \nleast, but the biggest consequence of this budget is the amount of debt \nwe are accumulating. I have already talked about it a minute.\n\n[[Page S3757]]\n\n  But, of course, we were shocked, and I think even the President and \nthe administration were shocked, by the Congressional Budget Office, \nthe nonpartisan office which evaluates financial matters for Congress, \nwhich said the President's budget will actually create deficits \naveraging nearly $1 trillion a year for the next decade.\n  I mentioned the fact that it would double the debt in 5 years, triple \nit in 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office said the size of the \nnational debt as a percentage of the economy will become the highest \nsince the years after World War II.\n  So these students who start college this year will see their share of \nthe national debt grow from $19,000 per student to more than $36,000 \nper student after graduation from a 4-year program. By 2019, their \nshare of the debt will grow to more than $55,000 per person. Can you \nimagine, with the money they have to borrow to fund their education, \nwith their credit card debt--and I do not know any student who does not \nhave sizable credit card debt--we are going to heap $55,000 in \nadditional debt on these students. That is a tough way to start out \nyour life after school as you start your first job. Today's college \nstudents will ultimately have to pay back the debt, as well as the \ngenerations that succeed them. All bailouts, one way or another, will \ncome out of their pocket.\n  I urge my colleagues to understand the impact on this younger \ngeneration of a budget that taxes too much, spends too much, and \nborrows too much. Because of our actions, the next generation will \neither have to raise more taxes or cut programs that are necessary or \nlower their standard of living.\n  I know from my parents, members of the ``greatest generation,'' the \none thing they aspired to more than anything else was that my brother \nand my sister and I would have a better life, more opportunities, more \nfreedom, a better standard of living than they did. And they were \nwilling to sacrifice for that, and sacrifice they did. But it seems to \nme the sacrifices we are calling for today are all on our children and \ngrandchildren, and none upon the present generation.\n  The President says he wants to make hard decisions. But I do not see \nany hard decisions in this budget. All I see is more borrowing, more \ntaxing, and more spending, and that is exactly the wrong way we ought \nto be headed.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we know our planet is in danger, and \nlater this year we will be debating a climate bill to address our \nenvironmental challenges. I am glad to see my colleagues from the other \nside of the aisle are doing their part for the environment by recycling \n15-year-old talking points on the budget.\n  President Bush left us a terrible mess: high unemployment, high \ndeficits, millions without health care. I am referring to the first \nPresident Bush and the mess inherited by President Bill Clinton. One of \nmy colleagues at the time said Clinton's budget would ``destroy the \neconomy.'' Well, I think everyone knows the Clinton years did not \ndestroy the economy. In fact, they created about 22 million new jobs.\n  Let's look at some of the newspaper headlines from back then. First \nof all, just this week, Politico's banner headline was: ``GOP Warns \nAbout Budget Hardball.'' That is what we have been hearing on the \nfloor--hardball, people coming down time after time attacking President \nObama's budget.\n  But back in 1995, we heard the same thing: ``GOP Plan for Budget to \nTake No Prisoners.''\n  In 1993: ``GOP's Politics of No.'' Sound familiar? GOP's politics of \nno.\n  In 1993: ``One-Word Vocabulary Hobbles GOP. Republicans Grouse as \nSenate Takes Up Budget Bill.'' You could recycle and, in fact, that is \nwhat they are doing, every single one of these comments and every \nsingle one of these headlines.\n  The American people voted for change last November. They are tired of \nall of this. They are tired of the nay-saying, the doom and the gloom. \nThey deserve better than a Republican repeat, and that is, \nunfortunately, what is happening: a Republican repeat, same old \npolitics, same old politics of no, slow-walking, filibustering; same \nold policies; every problem should have a tax cut for the wealthy. That \nis what got us into this mess.\n  We hear the same old thing from our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. We hear no to health care reform and the budget, no to \ncreating 3.5 million new jobs through the recovery plan. We hear no to \nincreasing oversight of our financial sector. We hear no to extending \nunemployment for those most in need. Certainly, in my great State of \nMichigan the answer has been no. To a commonsense budget that provides \nmiddle-class tax cuts and will cut the deficit in half in 4 years, what \ndo we hear? No.\n  The budget we are working on now focuses on the real problems \naffecting American families, the things that people sit down with their \nfamilies and struggle over every day. The Obama budget invests in \nAmerica's future by focusing on jobs, by focusing on health care, by \nfocusing on energy independence, and education. That is what our \nfamilies are concerned about as they are trying to juggle what to pay \nfirst amidst the crisis they feel today.\n  This is a budget we need to do right now. We need to move past the \npolitics of no and start working together to do what is right for \nAmerican families. I urge my colleagues to look past the next election \ncycle and to pass this budget to get America back on track again.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 688\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak regarding amendment No. \n688, the Crapo-Corker amendment. I say to the Senator from Michigan, \nthis is an opportunity for us all to say yes.\n  This is an amendment that is very important to people all across the \ncountry. What this amendment does is it gives the FDIC the ability to \nhave a line of credit that today is at $30 billion, and it gives them a \nline of credit up to $100 billion. The FDIC was put in place in 1991 \nwhen banking assets in our country were at $4.5 trillion. Today, bank \nassets in our country total almost $14.7 trillion. We have an FDIC \ntoday that is hamstrung because of the financial crisis in which we \nfind ourselves. So this amendment would raise that line of credit from \n$30 billion, which is an ancient establishment, to $100 billion.\n  Secondly, what it would do is give the FDIC--with certain signatures \nrequired from the Fed, from the Treasury, from others--access to a $500 \nbillion line of credit in the event they need it to seize an \ninstitution to protect depositors. So this does two things.\n  To make this relevant to people who will be voting on this amendment, \nhopefully, this afternoon, I think all of my colleagues know the FDIC \nhas just put in place a special assessment. My guess is every person in \nthis body has heard from community bankers and regional bankers and \neven larger establishments about this special assessment.\n  I know in Tennessee, many of the community banks actually would have \nto spend an entire quarter's earnings to pay this special assessment. \nSo by doing what we are doing in this amendment, we actually give the \nFDIC time to amortize that special assessment over a number of years \nwhich will cause it to be far more palatable for community bankers, in \nparticular, who have had nothing whatsoever to do with the financial \ncrisis in which we find ourselves.\n  Secondly--and I think this ought to be equally important to people \nhere--this gives the FDIC the ability to move into an organization \nquickly and to seize it to protect depositors' accounts.\n  I know right now the fund is running thin. My guess is that could \naffect--and actually the FDIC has lobbied for this--this might affect \nfuture actions if they don't feel as though they have the resources \nnecessary to go into an organization to do the things they need to do \nto make sure depositors are protected.\n  This action is action for which I would imagine we could almost get \nunanimous support. As a matter of\n\n[[Page S3758]]\n\nfact, my guess is we could voice vote this. As a matter of fact, I hope \nthat will occur this afternoon.\n  In the past, this legislation has been held hostage to what is called \nthe cram-down provision. The cram-down provision has been before this \nbody. It was defeated overwhelmingly. Numbers of Democrats thought it \nwas bad legislation. There have been a few Senators who have tried to \nattach cram-down to this legislation that we will be voting on this \nafternoon and tried to extort action on cram-down by virtue of holding \nthis very good piece of policy at bay.\n  It is my hope this afternoon that we will do something that is very \nimportant, especially to community bankers across the country but also \nto depositors to make sure we have the ability to protect them: that \nthe FDIC has the ability to move quickly. Move aside from extortionary \npolitics and move toward doing something that is good for our country, \ngood for community bankers, and certainly very good for depositors all \nacross this country.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first, I wish to say with respect to the \nServe America Act, let me compliment the committee chair and the \nranking member. This is a good piece of legislation. I am proud to \nsupport it. I also wish to say I have an amendment I hope we will be \nable to accept by voice this afternoon. It is the amendment that calls \nfor a tribal liaison to the Corporation of National and Community \nService in order to keep Indian tribes in this country fully involved \nin this process.\n  Some of the highest rates of unemployment in this country exist \nwithin Indian tribes. The opportunity to participate in, for example, \nthe National Committee Service Program would be very important. So I \nknow this amendment is supported by the chair and the ranking member, \nand I hope we can accept it by voice vote at some point this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I would inform Senator Mikulski that I wanted to \ndescribe to my colleagues something that is happening in our State as I \nspeak, and I wanted to do so in morning business so it doesn't \ninterrupt the flow of the debate over this bill. So I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak as in morning business to describe the flooding threat \nthat is occurring in my State at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Dorgan are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, later this afternoon we are going to be \nvoting on the Crapo amendment, No. 688, to increase borrowing authority \nfor the FDIC. I will not be supporting the Senator's amendment even \nthough I agree there is much about the policy in the amendment that I \nagree with. It might be a good idea, but it is in the wrong place.\n  The bill pending before the Senate is the national service bill. It \nis the result of bipartisan, bicameral work--very complicated \nbipartisan, bicameral negotiations--on which we have strong support \nfrom a range of Senators and strong support from the administration. \nIntroducing contentious housing and economic issues into this debate \nwould jeopardize the bipartisan support we have on this bill and could \nwreak havoc in the conference we will be facing with the House. We \ndon't want to be in havoc with the House. It is one thing to be \nnegotiating assertively, representing a Senator's viewpoint with the \nHouse on national service and what is the best, most prudent, and \naffordable way to do it, but if we have to carry over to the House an \namendment dealing with FDIC and insurance--that really belongs on \nanother bill.\n  I encourage our colleague, Senator Crapo, to withdraw the amendment. \nI really would not like to reject the idea, but that is the Banking \nCommittee's jurisdiction. As I understand it from the chairman and \nranking member of the Banking Committee, this is a substantive issue \nthey intend to take up in their committee.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, if Senator Crapo \ninsists upon a vote, that we really not pass his amendment. For all of \nthose who think the policy has merit, I don't dispute that. But that is \nfor another forum. That is for a Banking Committee forum. That should \nbe hashed out in the Banking Committee, and then recommendations would \nbe brought to the respective caucuses of both the Democrats and \nRepublicans so that we can have a substantive discussion.\n  I must say that to increase the borrowing authority of the FDIC from \n$30 billion to $100 billion should not be done on a shoot-from-the-lip. \nThat is what this amendment is, all due respect to my colleague. Just \nkind of dumping it on national service is a shoot-from-the-lip \namendment. I think it deserves more caution and consideration. We are \ntalking about raising the borrowing authority by $70 billion just when \neverybody is saying: Hey, Obama is taking on too much. I think we are \ntaking too much on in an amendment with the national service bill.\n  I say to my colleague, please withdraw your amendment. If you insist \nupon a vote, I am afraid I will have to oppose you in a very vigorous \nway. Perhaps, if done appropriately through the Banking Committee and \nit comes before the Senate in the regular order, I might be in the \n``aye'' column.\n  So when we do vote on that, that is the category I will be in. As I \nunderstand it, we will be voting on that amendment this afternoon. \nThere is still time for the Senator to come over and withdraw his \namendment. I say this in the most respectful way because I know how \nstrongly he feels about it. He has a lot of expertise on that, and I \nwould like to see that expertise channeled to the right place, at the \nright time, with the right amendment, on the right bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3 p.m., \nthe Senate resume consideration of amendment No. 688; that if a budget \npoint of order is raised against the amendment and a motion to waive \nthe applicable point of order is made, that immediately thereafter the \nSenate proceed to vote on the motion to waive the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, President Obama has said he wants to \nencourage ``a renewed spirit of national service for this and future \ngenerations.'' I submit that we can all agree on the value of promoting \nvoluntarism. Volunteers are essential to the survival of many \ncharitable organizations in America. But I believe S. 277 diminishes \nthe true spirit of volunteering, first, by providing taxpayer-funded \nbenefits such as monthly stipends and housing to participants--this \nfinancial support for volunteers will cost over $5 billion, which is a \nlot of money for volunteering--and secondly, by redefining volunteering \nas a taxpayer-funded political exercise in which Government bureaucrats \ncan steer funding to organizations they select.\n  In the past, service organizations mandated by the Government have \nnot been constrained from providing funds to organizations with \npolitical agendas, and this bill is no different. While the Mikulski \nsubstitute amendment to the bill adds a limited constraint, the \npolitical direction of the bill is still apparent. It attempts to \ndirect resources to five newly created corps--three that aim to \ninfluence health care, energy and the environment, and education; that \nis, groups that reflect the key aspects of President Obama's domestic \nagenda. For instance, the bill would allocate funds to a newly created \nClean Energy Corps in which participants would improve energy \nefficiency in low-income households. All well and good, but the bill \nwould also require the Clean Energy Corps to consult with energy and \nlabor and the Environmental Protection Agency. Among the activities of \nthe new Clean Energy\n\n[[Page S3759]]\n\nCorps would be reducing carbon emissions. How reducing carbon emissions \ncan be achieved by volunteers has not been made clear. Is this, in \nfact, an attempt to create federally subsidized ``green jobs'' in areas \nalready served by other Government programs or traditionally served by \nState, local, and private community service organizations?\n  Another problem with the bill is its failure to eliminate programs \nthat are not working. Current national service programs being funded, \nsuch as Learn and Serve and the AmeriCorps National Civilian Community \nCorps, have not been successful. On its Web site, expectmore.gov, which \nprovides a database of Federal program performance results, the Office \nof Management and Budget has categorized both of these programs as not \nperforming and ineffective.\n  Finally, there are the costs associated with the programs. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that the costs this year will top \n$1 billion and will cost another $5.7 billion from 2010 to 2014 to \nexpand the program from the current 75,000 participants to 200,000 \nparticipants by 2014.\n  There is ample reason to conclude that these programs are not worth \nanother $5.7 billion. I realize we have gotten to the point where $1 \nbillion does not mean what it once did. But S. 277 would saddle \ntaxpayers with another multimillion dollar bill at a time when we \nshould be cutting back, not finding new ways to spend.\n  The spirit of voluntarism is alive and well in America. I see it in \nmy own State of Arizona. Could we agree that maybe there is one area of \nour society in which we do not have to add more Government? I think \nvolunteering to help our neighbors might be a good place to start.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, I gather Senator Mikulski has \nalready addressed this point, but I see my very good friend from Idaho, \nMr. Crapo, here as well, the author of the amendment. I commend him for \nit. I know this is going to sound awkward because there is going to be \na procedural issue we are going to vote on shortly.\n  My colleague should understand the procedural differences should not \nreflect substantive differences at this point. We agree with what he is \ntrying to achieve. There is an issue here involving a budget point of \norder, as well as a determination, I know, by the authors of this \nbill--Senator Mikulski, Senator Kennedy, Senator Hatch, Senator Enzi, \nthe principal authors--to try to achieve a bill that can move quickly \ndealing with national service.\n  But the underlying amendment by Senator Crapo is one that I think is \nuniversally supported--there may be some who disagree, but I do not--\nthat this has a lot of merit and we need to deal with it in conjunction \nwith other matters, with which my colleague from Idaho is very \nfamiliar, dealing with the FTC, some safe harbor provisions from \nSenator Martinez dealing with the foreclosure issue, and several other \npoints as well. We are trying to include these as an overall package \nwhich we are working on and hopefully can complete maybe before the \nrecess. I don't want to commit to that but certainly quickly because \nthere is a sense of importance to these matters.\n  I want my colleagues to know, particularly my friend from Idaho, that \nsupporting a motion dealing with a budget matter here is not a \nreflection of the substance of his amendment.\n  We talked privately about this issue, but I wanted to say so publicly \nas well, and that as chairman of the committee of jurisdiction, we will \nmove as quickly as we possibly can to deal with this and related \nmatters.\n  Again, I wish my colleagues to know that as well, but that is the \nrationale behind this particular moment.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Idaho for raising this important \nissue. He is a valued member of the committee and made a very \nworthwhile suggestion, certainly one we will, in my judgment, \nincorporate as part of this larger package.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I thank my committee chairman, Senator \nDodd, of the Banking Committee for his comments. I appreciate our \nworking relationship and the commitment he made on not only this issue \nbut a number of issues of importance facing our financial institutions \nand the reform we need to deal with in Congress. I look forward to \nworking with him on that matter.\n  I also thank Senator Mikulski for her patience as we brought this \nissue up on her bill. I truly do appreciate her patience and her \nunderstanding. I understand what the procedure is going to be and what \nthe votes are going to be in a few minutes. I recognize that. I do \nrealize we have a procedural issue here, but we also have a very \ncritical financial issue.\n  As Senator Dodd has so well stated, this is an issue on which we have \nbroad bipartisan agreement. I appreciate his commitment to work with us \nin an expeditious manner so that we can get this legislation put into \nlaw as soon as possible. There is an urgency. It is not an emergency \nyet and we have a little bit of time to deal with it, but there is an \nurgency. I appreciate Senator Dodd's recognition of that and his \nwillingness to work with us on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to ask the manager of the bill if I \nmay bring up a couple of my amendments. We gave the amendments to her \nstaff about 4 hours ago. I was recently informed I was not going to be \nable to get those amendments up and pending. The majority leader of the \nSenate asked us to get amendments up. I cleared my schedule to make \nsure I could come over and get my amendments up. Now I am told by \nSenator Mikulski's staff that there would be objection to getting any \nmore amendments pending.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Nevada, there \nseems to be some confusion about this matter. We do want to address his \namendments. We have been working on his side trying to queue up those \namendments. Perhaps during this vote he and I can talk. I think there \nwas confusion about where there are some roadblocks. Let's talk during \nthe vote.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wonder if I may have permission to ask \nthe Senator from Connecticut a question.\n  Mr. President, I stepped in after the dialogue was taking place on \nthe floor. My understanding is that the Crapo amendment that actually \nis part of the original bill--that you are very much a part of and have \nallowed--is going to come up in an expeditious manner. I wonder if we \nhave a commitment from the chairman, whom I respect and certainly enjoy \nworking with very much, that it come up unattached to a cram-down so \nthat we don't have the extortion of that issue being attached to this.\n  I didn't hear that, so I wanted to know if that was also part of the \ncommitment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Tennessee \nhaving very good ears in all of this. I can't dictate what all is going \nto be included in the amendment. My colleague, of course, is aware that \nthere are a number of our colleagues who are very interested in the \ncram-down--as you call it--provision dealing with the bankruptcy law \nand primary residences. So I cannot give the assertion that a final \npackage will or will not include that. That will largely depend on how \nthese negotiations proceed.\n  That is the reason we are not prepared today to go forward with this \nproposal, along with others as part of this package. And I know there \nare strong feelings on both sides of that question in this Chamber. So \nI know I have been asked to give that assertion, which I cannot give, \nobviously, any more than I could give an assertion that other pieces \nMembers are interested in would be excluded or included at a moment \nlike this.\n  What I have said to my colleague--and I will repeat to my good friend\n\n[[Page S3760]]\n\nfrom Tennessee, with whom I enjoy a very good relationship--is that \nthis is a very important matter my friend has raised. I agree with him \non the substance of it. It needs to be done expeditiously. It is a \nserious issue. There are others, dealing with the Federal Trade \nCommission and others, which need to be a part of a package that our \nbankers--particularly our community bankers--are very interested in.\n  I also know there are strong feelings about the cram-down provisions. \nBut as I have said to my colleague from Idaho and others, I cannot \ntoday stand here and dictate the outcome of a matter on which there are \nstrong feelings and opinions in this Chamber. We will deal with that as \nwe normally do, through the normal process, one way or the other.\n  At this particular moment, given the fact that we need to deal with \nthis in a more complete fashion, there is a budget point of order on \nthis matter and, clearly, the authors of this bill, the pending matter, \nwould like to move this matter without having extraneous material added \nto it. So for all those reasons, I will be supporting the motion of the \nSenator from Maryland so we can move along with the matter. But that is \nthe answer to the question of my good friend from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, if I could have just 30 seconds, I \ncertainly thank the Senator from Connecticut and, again, will certainly \nwork with him. I might add that the strong feelings that are felt sort \nof go in this manner: that there is unanimous or overwhelming support \nfor this particular provision, and this body is very divided on this \nother issue. So it does, in effect, keep us from having a very good \npolicy that is very much supported from becoming law.\n  It is broken down by the fact we have tremendous dissension in this \nbody--or let me say this: a difference of opinion in this body--over \nthe cram-down issue. But that is stating the obvious, and I am sure the \nAmerican public understands that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nChambliss be added as a cosponsor of the Crapo amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 688 offered by the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable provisions \nunder the Budget Act with respect to my amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what is the order, a vote or a quorum?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum is in order if someone suggests the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act in \nrelation to the Crapo amendment, No. 688. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Wyoming (Mr. Enzi).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 48, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 110 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Enzi\n     Kennedy\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 48, the nays are \n49. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected, the point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 715 to Amendment No. 692\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the regular order concerning the Baucus \namendment and I send a second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 715 to amendment No. 692.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To clarify that nonprofit organizations assisted under the \n Nonprofit Capacity Building Program include certain crisis pregnancy \ncenters, and organizations that serve battered women or victims of rape \n                               or incest)\n\n         On page 2, line 20, insert before the period the \n     following: ``which shall include crisis pregnancy centers, \n     organizations that serve battered women (including domestic \n     violence shelters), and organizations that serve victims of \n     rape or incest''. These organizations must be charities \n     within the meaning of the United States tax code.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. The \nBaucus amendment wants to pay legal fees for some of these \norganizations that are volunteer organizations. Sometimes these \norganizations have significant legal fees. What my amendment says is, \neven though the bill doesn't specifically exclude any organizations, I \nwish to make sure that several of these organizations or types of \norganizations are able to be included and eligible for some of those \nlegal fees. In my amendment, it points out things such as crisis \npregnancy centers, battered women shelters, rape crisis centers, \nvarious organizations that are specifically geared toward helping \nwomen. I wished to make sure that somewhere down the line somebody at \nan administrative level doesn't exclude somebody because they have a \ndifferent political philosophy. We want to make sure the people in \nthese organizations are included. These are people, obviously, from \nboth sides of the political aisle whom we have included in our \namendment. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we can appreciate this amendment and the \nthrust behind it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Ensign amendment would make an \nunnecessary and divisive change to the bipartisan amendment offered by \nSenators Baucus and Grassley. The Baucus-Grassley amendment would \ncreate\n\n[[Page S3761]]\n\na nonprofit capacity building program. It would fund a grant program to \nprovide education opportunities to small charities, primarily designed \nfor those in rural areas. The education opportunities would teach \ncharities how to manage finances and fundraise effectively, how to \naccurately file complicated tax forms, adopt new computer technologies \nor even plan a long-term budget. Capacity in rural communities, such as \nI see in my own areas, do need help. I think the Grassley-Baucus \namendment has merit. In the Baucus-Grassley amendment, there is no \nlimitation on the types of charities that can access these training \nprograms. Therefore, the amendment of the Senator from Nevada is \nunnecessary.\n  Support for the Baucus-Grassley amendment is quite broad. The \nNational Council of Nonprofits, the Independent Sector, and the \nAlliance for Children and Families have voiced their strong support for \nthis amendment. I urge colleagues to oppose the Ensign amendment.\n  I wish to also comment on his desire to include crisis pregnancy \ncenters. That is a broad definition. I am not sure what he means by a \ncrisis pregnancy center. There are those that are ones with a \nparticular philosophical viewpoint as compared to broad pregnancy \ninformation. These centers are already covered by language in the \ncurrent bill. The amendment is not needed. There is a question about \nadding that explicit language. I urge Members not to adopt the Ensign \nsecond-degree amendment. It is unnecessary and unneeded and would cause \nquite an intense negotiation with the House when we go to conference. \nThe whole idea of the way we have been working so faithfully on a \nbipartisan and even bicameral basis is to not to have a long conference \nso we are able to move the national service bill to signing by the \nPresident so it could be included in this year's appropriations. By \nadding the Ensign second degree, this would result in jeopardizing the \npassage of the bill.\n  I urge defeat of the Ensign amendment and would so recommend to my \ncolleagues.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment so my amendment No. 712 can be called up for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THUNE. Reserving the right to object, I would also ask, as part \nof that agreement, that I have an amendment that also be made pending \nas part of the request of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we didn't know the Senator had an \namendment. We need to have a copy of the amendment. If we could have a \ncopy, we would be willing to discuss it.\n  Mr. THUNE. I would be happy to make it available to the distinguished \nmanager of the bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, if I may say to the Senator from South \nDakota, we are looking at his amendment to see if there is something we \ncan accommodate. Would it be agreeable to him if the Senator from New \nHampshire offered a bipartisan amendment that she and the other Senator \nfrom New Hampshire are offering? She will offer it and speak briefly, \nunderstanding that the Senator had sought recognition before she did.\n  Mr. THUNE. Let me ask through the Chair, so the understanding would \nbe that the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire would become \nthe pending amendment?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Is there any understanding beyond that about amendments \noffered by Members on our side, mine included?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. It is a matter of expediting the time. We are reviewing \nyour amendment, which is a sense of the Senate. We are viewing it from \nnot only a policy standpoint but with this arrangement of discussing \nissues with the House. It is more of a time management issue than a \ncontent issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that upon completion of the offering of the \namendment by the Senator from New Hampshire, the Senator from South \nDakota's amendment be pending.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Senator from Maryland. I withdraw my \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 712 to Amendment No. 687\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment so amendment No. 712 can be called up for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mrs. Shaheen], for herself \n     and Mr. Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 712 to \n     amendment No. 687.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that an Education Corps may carry out activities \n         that provide music and arts education and engagement)\n\n       In section 122 (a)(1)(B) of the National and Community \n     Service Act of 1990, as amended by section 1302 of the bill, \n     insert at the appropriate place the following:\n       ``(__) providing skilled musicians and artists to promote \n     greater community unity through the use of music and arts \n     education and engagement through work in low-income \n     communities, and education, health care, and therapeutic \n     settings, and other work in the public domain with citizens \n     of all ages;''.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I appreciate your assistance in moving \nthis amendment forward and certainly appreciate the Senator from South \nDakota and, of course, the Senator from Maryland for helping me move \nforward with this amendment.\n  I bring this amendment forward on behalf of my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, and myself. The Shaheen-Gregg amendment would \nsimply add to the menu of activities that can be included in the \nEducation Corps. It would include musicians and artists to promote arts \nin education. That, very simply, is the amendment.\n  I would also like to speak briefly to the pending legislation, S. \n277, the Serve America Act. I want to begin by commending my \ncolleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch, for their leadership in \nworking on this legislation and bringing it forward and, of course, \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Enzi for their work in making sure the \ndiscussion on this bill can go forward, so hopefully we can pass this \nlegislation this week.\n  This Serve America Act clearly embodies the spirit of America--a \nspirit that calls on all of us to give back to our country and to work \ntogether to build a nation that can continue to offer endless \nopportunity to generations to come.\n  This bill could not come at a more critical time in our Nation's \nhistory. More and more people need help getting by in this tough \neconomic climate, while more and more of even the most generous among \nus have less and less to contribute to charitable activities. That is \nwhat makes this legislation so special. It has nothing to do with \nstatus, with background, with privilege or circumstance. Every American \nis equal in their ability to give of themselves and their time. As \nMartin Luther King said so eloquently: Every American can be great \nbecause every American can serve--to paraphrase what he said a little \nbit. The Serve America Act encourages voluntarism at every stage of \nlife--from students, to full-time workers, to senior citizens.\n  Throughout American history, the compassion of our people has gotten \nus\n\n[[Page S3762]]\n\nthrough the most difficult of times. That spirit exists today in \ncommunities across America, and the Serve America Act taps into the \nstrong desire of Americans to do their part to help our country recover \nand prosper.\n  No deed is too small. While the average American may not be able to \nsave struggling banks from financial crisis, they can help a family to \nweatherize their home so they can save money on their heating or \ncooling bills. They can mentor a child so that child can reach his or \nher greatest potential, so they can hopefully go to college and compete \nin this global economy.\n  The Serve America Act will usher in a new era of service and civic \nengagement in our country, where we can solve our most difficult social \nchallenges by using entrepreneurial spirit to bring about social \nchange. It will build upon great success stories in voluntarism, such \nas AmeriCorps, by increasing the numbers of volunteers involved in \nvolunteer programs nationwide from 75,000 to 250,000.\n  It also creates several new volunteer organizations with missions in \nspecific areas of national deed, including a Clean Energy Corps. While \nCongress works to position America as a leader in clean energy and \nenergy efficiency, this group of volunteers will enhance our efforts by \nencouraging efficiency and conservation measures in communities and \nneighborhoods. It is an idea that makes so much sense. In New \nHampshire, I know volunteers stand ready, for example, to make homes \nmore energy efficient, or work to preserve our State's many parks, \ntrails, and rivers for future generations to enjoy.\n  As Governor of New Hampshire, I saw firsthand the difference that \nprograms such as AmeriCorps and other volunteer programs can make. Plus \nTime New Hampshire is one of those programs. It provides afterschool \nhelp to vulnerable students who would otherwise go home to empty \nhouses. And New Hampshire's City Year program has been successful in \ndecreasing the high school dropout rate.\n  I just point out that City Year was started by a New Hampshire \nnative, Alan Khazei, who, with some of his friends from Harvard, was \nable to start a wonderful program that has now expanded across the \ncountry.\n  One young volunteer in New Hampshire for City Year, Jennifer Foshey, \nvolunteered at Hampton Academy through the City Year program. During \nher year of service, she worked with sixth grade boys who were \nstruggling academically and failing most of their classes. Jennifer \nprovided one-on-one academic support, individual mentoring, and \nencouraged these students to get involved in extracurricular \nactivities.\n  Because of her hard work, the boys' grades improved dramatically, and \none of them joined the community service afterschool club Jennifer ran. \nHe was later quoted in the school paper as saying:\n\n       There are kids in our neighborhoods that need help, and \n     it's our job to help them.\n\n  There could not be a better testament to the ripple effect programs \nsuch as City Year that are supported in this legislation have in our \ncommunities.\n  I have long been an advocate for national service because I have seen \nthe power of these volunteers--power not only to help those in need but \nto empower citizens and strengthen communities. There is no question \nthat the Serve America Act expands opportunities for all Americans to \nbecome involved in service in a wide range of areas of need.\n  Today, this amendment I offer will further extend the work of the \nservice corps by offering opportunities for skilled musicians and \nartists to expand educational opportunity, promote greater community \nunity, and bridge cultural divides through the use of music and arts \nengagement.\n  The Serve America Act is so important to those in New Hampshire and \nacross the country. I am very pleased and honored to join with Senators \nKennedy, and Hatch, and Mikulski, to cosponsor such an important piece \nof legislation that invests in new, innovative solutions to our \nNation's most persistent social problems, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in support of the Serve America Act. I hope they will also \nsupport the amendment Senator Gregg and I are offering.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, \nalong with her colleague, the senior Senator, Mr. Gregg, for offering \nthis amendment. It does make sure that service programs in the \nEducation Corps are also allowed to incorporate art and music. We in \nthe committee on both sides of the aisle support this. We support it \nboth for content reasons and process reasons.\n  In the area of process, what the Shaheen-Gregg amendment does is \nactually incorporate art and music as eligible for funding, as do our \ncolleagues in the House. So it puts it in symmetry with the House. This \nis what we like. It is when we are out of symmetry with the House that \nwe do not like it. This makes it a high note for art and music.\n  Second, we know that for many of our boys and girls, the involvement \nin art and/or music can have a profound impact on, No. 1, school \nattendance--they really want to come to school to follow their passion; \nNo. 2, it also seems to have a particularly positive effect in the area \nof behavior for special education children. Special education children \nseem to have a real affinity in engaging in music and art activity and \noften by the enrollment in those activities.\n  What we see in our public schools is that art and music programs have \nbeen the first on the budget block when it comes to the reduction of \nfunds. Having talented young people come in with this kind of approach \ncan really help school attendance, help with behavior problems in \nschools, and also unlock a talent in a child.\n  If a child grows up, as I see in Baltimore in that show called ``The \nWire''--where neighborhoods that are so drug saturated that there is \nconstant police activity, and the informants become the wire--the \nchildren of those communities are so terribly disadvantaged. The \nteachers work under such Spartan circumstances that AmeriCorps being \nable to come in could change lives--could actually change lives.\n  The Shaheen-Gregg amendment is an excellent concept to add to our \nEducation Corps. We, under normal circumstances, would accept it, but \nwe understand a vote will be required. But when they call my name, I am \ngoing to be in the ``aye'' column.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, President John F. Kennedy said:\n\n       The raising of extraordinarily large sums of money, given \n     voluntarily and freely by millions of our fellow Americans, \n     is a unique American tradition. . . . Philanthropy, charity, \n     giving voluntarily and freely . . . call it what you like, \n     but it is truly a jewel of an American tradition.\n\n  In 2007, Americans gave more than $300 billion to charitable causes, \nan amount equal to roughly 2 percent of the gross domestic product. The \nvast majority of those donations, roughly 75 percent, or about $229 \nbillion, came from individuals who willingly gave their hard-earned \ndollars for causes greater than their own.\n  Studies have shown that Americans give far more to charity than the \npeople of any other industrialized nation. In fact, relative to the \nsize of our economy, Americans gave more than twice as much as the \ncitizens of Great Britain and 10 times more than the citizens of \nFrance.\n  We should be proud of this tradition. Congress should continue to \nsupport the 70 percent of all American households that donate to \ncharities to support a wide range of religious, educational, cultural, \nhealth care, and environmental goals. These charities provide \ninvaluable public service to society's most vulnerable citizens during \ndifficult economic times. In many cases, these services go above and \nbeyond what any conceivable Government program could provide.\n  For years, Congress has provided incentives through the Internal \nRevenue Code to encourage charitable giving by allowing individuals to \ndeduct income given to tax-exempt charities. Over time, 41 million \nAmerican households have taken advantage of this deduction to give to \nthe charities of their choice.\n  Unfortunately for these generous families and individuals, President \nObama and his administration have proposed, as part of their budget \noutline, reducing the allowable deduction for charitable giving. \nAccording to one study, President Obama's proposal would reduce \ncharitable donations by as much as $8 to $16 billion per year.\n  Particularly in a time when many charities are already struggling on \naccount of the economic downturn, these entities do not need a change \nin the Tax Code that would further discourage charitable giving. These \norganizations that educate our children, care for the sick and the \npoor, and facilitate religious opportunities should not have to pay the \nprice for additional spending on new Federal programs, as is proposed \nin the administration's budget.\n  Over the past several days, this proposal has been criticized by \nRepublicans and Democrats, large companies and small companies, \nuniversities and churches, constituents and charities of all shapes and \nsizes. Therefore, I have offered an amendment to H.R. 1388, the \nnational service bill, which is before the Senate right now, which \nwould express the ``sense of the Senate that Congress should preserve \nthe full income tax deduction for charitable contributions through the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 and look for additional ways to encourage \ncharitable giving rather than to discourage it.''\n  Americans have a proud tradition of voluntarily giving to those who \nare in need. Even in these tough economic times, when there is great \ntemptation to save any earned income for better days, families and \nindividuals continue to support our charities. I believe Congress \nshould continue to support those who voluntarily make that sacrifice, \nand I hope my colleagues will, when this amendment comes up for a vote, \nsupport it.\n  I also point out that a Washington-based coalition of 600 different \nnonprofit groups opposes this measure and has characterized it as a \nfurther disincentive to giving in challenging economic times. It is \nhard enough, with the economy being in the condition it is these days, \npeople and charitable organizations trying to rely heavily on \nvolunteers and voluntary giving to make ends meet, but it makes it even \nmore complicated when we put policies in place that discourage that.\n  I wouldn't suggest for a minute that anybody who makes a contribution \nto a charitable organization does that because of the tax treatment \nonly, but I do believe there is an interaction between our tax policy \nand charitable giving, and that it definitely affects the amount of \nthose gifts. So rather than dialing back the tax treatment we provide \nto those who make charitable contributions, in my view, we ought to be \nencouraging more of that. Certainly the administration's proposal, \nwhich would take away the favorable tax treatment for those above \ncertain income categories, is going to cost those organizations who \nrely heavily upon charitable giving an enormous amount of additional \ndollars they would receive.\n  I hope my colleagues would find their way to support my amendment and \nexpress the sense of the Senate that we ought not be going down that \npath, that we ought to retain the current tax treatment that we have \nfor charitable giving, particularly in a time when the economy is \nstruggling and many people, many organizations that rely on that type \nof giving, are struggling to make ends meet.\n  I ask that my colleagues, as they consider this particular issue, in \nlight of the underlying bill that does make available new monies for \ngovernment programs, also give consideration to all of those charitable \norganizations out there and all of those individuals across this \ncountry who, out of the goodness of their hearts, have contributed \nmightily to make the good causes that are served by these charities \nmove forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, if I could comment on the Thune \namendment, it is a sense of the Senate that Congress and Federal law \nshould continue the current tax deduction rate of 35 percent, and we \nunderstand the thrust of the argument behind the Senator's sense of the \nSenate. I wish to comment both on process and on content. This is a \nFinance Committee and a Budget Committee matter; this is not a national \nservice matter, though I can see why the Senator would say that, \nbecause the uniqueness of America is that we have always had these \ngreat public-private partnerships. In fact, so many of the AmeriCorps \nvolunteers will work exactly in the nonprofits that benefit from the \ncharitable giving. Boys and Girls Clubs would be an example of that \ntype of work.\n  Now, the budget will be on the floor of the Senate next week. Why is \nthat not the right place for the Senator to offer his amendment, not \nonly as to the sense of the Senate, but to actually make a change? The \nPresident has recently proposed to limit the tax benefits of itemized \ndeductions for those in the top two income brackets--to limit it to 28 \npercent. So in the President's budget we will be considering, there is \nthe change in tax deduction rates from 35 percent to 28 percent. Next \nweek is the right time for not only a sense of the Senate but actually \ndirect action. I actually hope that the Senator from South Dakota would \nconsider withdrawing his amendment and dealing with it on the budget \nwhen the budget is before us next week.\n  We believe that the President's proposal would retain a generous \nbenefit. There still would be a tax deduction equal to 28 cents on the \ndollar for every dollar contributed to charity. Less than 10 percent of \nthe taxpayers who do claim a charitable deduction are in that 35-\npercent category the Senator from South Dakota has outlined. We believe \nthese taxpayers, fortunate enough to be doing well, and who also wish \nto do good, will continue to give, even if it is at a 28-percent rate.\n\n[[Page S3764]]\n\n  I could debate the substance, but I would prefer that the substantive \ndebate come from the Budget Committee members and the Finance Committee \nmembers who have poored over this. No one on either side of the aisle \nwants to limit charitable giving or penalize people for giving. We \nunderstand that this is exactly what we need during these tough times. \nI believe this amendment should be debated and voted on in the budget \nbill, but if it is going to be here, again, I will have to oppose it, \nnot necessarily on substantive grounds, though. I will support the \nPresident's budget.\n  We are proud of the tradition we have with giving. We should \nencourage people to keep on giving. One of the ways we do that is \nthrough an itemized deduction for charitable giving. I think both sides \nof the aisle agree on that. We very much support the idea of an \nitemized deduction for charitable giving. Both sides of the aisle agree \non that. Certainly I do. But what the Senator's amendment misses is \nthat all Americans give, all Americans who itemize deductions as well \nas Americans who don't. In fact, CRS says that only 30 percent of \ntaxpayers claim a deduction for charitable giving. Yet we know that \nmany more than 30 percent of taxpayers give to charity. In fact, the \nindependent sector the Senator has quoted has a study that indicates 89 \npercent of households in America give in some charitable way. Isn't \nthat wonderful. I mean isn't that fantastic. So many taxpayers make \ncharitable contributions, even though they are not getting a tax \nbenefit at all.\n  So to place the national service bill in one more quagmires with the \nHouse--because when we send this over, it means that national service \nwill not only be conferenced by our counterpart in the Education and \nLabor Committee, but it is going to have to go to the Finance \nCommittee--excuse me, their Ways and Means Committee. Once again, \nbecause of a sense of the Senate, we are going to be put in a quagmire, \nwhen the Senator wants to deal with the policy of 35 percent versus 28 \npercent, and he would have that opportunity on the budget debate.\n  I disagree with this amendment not only because it is bad policy, but \nit is absolutely the wrong place to bring this up. I am going to oppose \nthis sense of the Senate and I encourage the Senator from South Dakota, \nwho has many excellent points to be made, that he bring it up on the \nbudget bill.\n  So I oppose the amendment based on process as well as on substantive \ngrounds.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I note that the Senator from \nOregon is standing. May I inquire what the purpose of his statement \nwill be--because the Senator from Louisiana has been waiting to offer \nan amendment. Did the Senator wish to speak on the Thune amendment?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. No. I am going to return to morning business, so I will \ndefer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 717 to Amendment No. 687\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I so appreciate the Senator from \nMaryland for managing this important bill and the Senator from Utah, \nboth of whom have done an excellent job, along with Senator Kennedy's \nguidance and support during the times he could be with us to move this \nbill, because it has been a great work of many Members of this body, \nboth Democrats and Republicans. Of course, Senator Enzi has also been a \ngreat leader in this effort. It is such a timely and important subject \nas Americans are searching amidst all of the difficulties faced in the \neconomic climate and uncertainty on the international front.\n  Americans are realizing the importance of loved ones and family. They \nare realizing the importance of the community that is around them. For \nbetter or worse, even though we are a great travel destination--and I \ndo want to encourage people to continue traveling as they can, \nparticularly to places such as New Orleans and Louisiana that see a \nnumber of visitors--I think Americans are turning a little bit more \ninward and want to spend more time with their families and right at \nhome in their communities.\n  So this bill is timely because it basically calls America to come \ntogether, and it recognizes that some of our greatest assets are not \njust our money--which is fleeting, as we can tell these days. I \nremember my father used to tell me when I was growing up, he said: The \neasiest thing for me to give you, sweetheart, is a $20 bill, even \nthough we didn't have a lot of them floating around the house, but the \nhardest thing for me to give you is my time. That is what this bill \ncalls for. This bill calls for us to give our time and our talents. God \nhas given us all an equal amount; we all get 24 hours in a day. A life \nis made by how people spend that time, either serving themselves, \nworshiping idol gods, or spending their time on the things that matter.\n  I think this bill has such significance for us as a Nation now as we \nthink about how to revitalize our service programs, update them, \nmodernize them, particularly in light of the fact that we have so many \nhealthy seniors, men and women who have achieved unimaginable success, \ndifferent than many generations in the past. They find themselves at a \ngreat point in their life, in their late sixties or early seventies, \nvery healthy, or even mid fifties. They are retiring and want to serve. \nSo I think this is an excellent bill.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor only to again congratulate the \nleaders and offer an amendment that gives a slight twist to a piece of \nthis that I think is very important. I know a lot of great work has \ngone on. The amendment I wish to call up is amendment No. 717.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment No. 717 to amendment No. 687.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To add a foster care program to the national service corps \n                               programs)\n\n       On page 92, strike line 1 and insert the following:\n       ``(H) A program that seeks to expand the number of mentors \n     for youth in foster care through--\n       ``(i) the provision of direct academic mentoring services \n     for youth in foster care;\n       ``(ii) the provision of supportive services to mentoring \n     service organizations that directly provide mentoring to \n     youth in foster care, including providing training of mentors \n     in child development, domestic violence, foster care, \n     confidentiality requirements, and other matters related to \n     working with youth in foster care; or\n       ``(iii) supporting foster care mentoring partnerships, \n     including statewide and local mentoring partnerships that \n     strengthen direct service mentoring programs.\n       ``(I) Such other national service programs\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to take a minute to explain the \namendment. I understand both Senators managing have looked at this and \nboth their staffs have looked at it as well. It is a slight change to \nthe mentoring portion of this bill dealing with children at risk.\n  If you think of America having 300 million people, about a third of \nthose would be children. So we have about 100 million children in \nAmerica, I guess between the ages of zero and 18 or 21. That is a lot \nof kids to care for. We as a nation are trying to do our best as \nindividual parents and families and communities. However, there is a \nspecial group of children--and I am going to take a minute more--there \nis a special group of children who are actually our children. All of \nthese 100 million are ours theoretically. But definitely--and not in \ntheory, but in actuality there are 500,000 children--as the Senator \nfrom Maryland knows very well because her career started as the only \nsocial worker, I think, in this body--500,000 children who are in \nfoster care actually are children of the government, of the State, of \nour national and State governments. We are primarily responsible as a \ngovernment for their care, their welfare, and their education.\n  So my amendment is quite simple. It adds a provision for a mentoring \nprogram for this special group of children, foster children who \nsometimes spend a few years there--sometimes a long time, \nunfortunately. Despite our great efforts to make foster care temporary, \nwe know there are barriers for reunification or adoption. We are trying \nto work through those barriers. But we have some extraordinary, I say \nto my colleagues Senator Hatch and Senator\n\n[[Page S3765]]\n\nMikulski, some extraordinary pilots underway in this country.\n  In States such as California, where Governors Gray Davis and Arnold \nSchwarzenegger joined to support this program, there are promising \nresults coming back about foster children in elementary and high \nschools who have mentors of their same age. We have always had \ngrandparent mentoring, and that is very effective, where seniors are \nmentoring children. But, as you know, if you have teenagers, as I do, \nsometimes teenagers don't like to listen to adults. But teenagers will \nlisten to their peers.\n  This is a great opportunity to have mentors from colleges and high \nschools coming to mentor our children who are in foster care. I will \nsubmit for the Record--because my colleague is going to speak--some \nexciting results.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of these results be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       98 percent of the foster children in this program have \n     stayed in school.\n       There has been a 50 percent drop in teen pregnancy among \n     the foster youth.\n       There has been a 1.7 year increase in academic progress per \n     year.\n       50 percent increase in turning in assignments and homework.\n       100 percent in taking state standardized tests.\n       The program is now testing the students every 8 weeks to \n     measure achievement.\n       In about 80 percent of the cases, there has been evidence \n     of increase in grades within the first 8 months.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, that is basically the substance of my \namendment. It doesn't add a special corps, but it is an amendment that \nsays when we care for children in need, let's look especially at foster \ncare children and promote those kinds of mentorship programs that we \nknow work and that can make a difference.\n  Of all the children in America, I say to the Senator from Maryland, \nthese children really need our focus, our attention, our love and our \nsupport. I understand this amendment can be taken up at any time that \nis appropriate for the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is not only a good amendment, it is \na fantastic amendment. I really compliment the Senator from Louisiana \nnot only for the amendment but for her steadfast commitment to children \nin foster care, and also children in need of adoption--not only the \ncute, cuddly infants but the older children and the children who are \nhandicapped. The Senator has also been a leader in the international \nfield, working on a bipartisan basis.\n  This amendment is fantastic because it will help more foster children \nget the social and academic mentoring they need. It doesn't create a \nnew corps. We are going to put it under AmeriCorps and leave it to the \nflexibility of government at the local level to do this in a way that \ncoordinates with their departments of human services.\n  It is true there are 500,000 children in foster care in this country. \nWhen I started out my career as a social worker, after I graduated from \ncollege, I worked for Associated Catholic Charities. I was a foster \ncare worker, so I know this up close and personal. I was also a home \nworker, so I know it personally.\n  When I was in my twenties, I often worked with children being cared \nfor by nuns in group homes. The nuns themselves were in their forties, \nfifties, or older. They were sweet, caring, and compassionate. We could \nnot do it without them. But those young preteens and adolescents needed \ndifferent kinds of help.\n  I organized women I graduated with at my Catholic college, and we did \nhair-dos and curlers and lipstick with them and the kinds of things \nyoung girls needed to do. I was once in that age group myself. But \nthose preteen girls were transitioning to womanhood. My classmates and \nI helped them, and it increased their interest in school, their \ninterest in working with the sisters. When those girls were ready to \nleave the group home, either to go out into the world or to return to \ntheir parents, they were in a better place because of the nuns and \ntheir loving care and the work of Catholic Charities, and because of \nwhat the volunteers did.\n  I think what the Senator is offering is going to make a difference. I \nlook forward, when we have the vote, to supporting it.\n  Our colleague from Oregon has been waiting to offer a very compelling \nspeech, which I eagerly await to hear. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Defense of the American Home\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to call on my colleagues, \nand indeed upon all Americans, to rally to the defense of the American \nhome.\n  Sometime soon, within the next few weeks, this esteemed Chamber will \nbe taking up this issue. So this seems to be an appropriate time to \nreflect on how to improve our policies for promoting homeownership.\n  There is nothing that characterizes the American dream better than \nowning your own home. The homeowner is the king--or queen--of his or \nher castle. You decorate and remodel it to suit your own taste and \nstyle. You are your own landlord; no one can tell you what you can or \ncan't do. You fence the yard so you can finally have a dog. You put in \na skylight because you want more light. You plant tiger lilies and \nhyacinth in the yard because they are the most beautiful flowers in the \nworld. You create a stable and nurturing environment for raising your \nchildren.\n  In your own home you control your own destiny.\n  Moreover, it is through home ownership that you secure your financial \ndestiny. By and large, everything you buy in life loses value quickly--\nyour car, your furniture, your clothing. But not so with your home. The \nfamily home is, for most families, the biggest nest egg they will build \nin their lifetime.\n  At a minimum, owning a home--with a fair mortgage--locks in and caps \nyour monthly housing expenses. That is a great deal compared to \nrenting, where rents go up and up over the years.\n  In addition, your monthly payments steadily pay off your mortgage, \nyou own an increasing share of your home, and the bank owns less.\n  You can look down the road and see the possibility of owning your \nhome free and clear before you retire, making it possible to get by \ndecently in your golden years. To make the deal even better, your home \nappreciates in value. The home you bought for $80,000 in 1980 might be \nworth $250,000 in 2010. In many cases, it might be that appreciation, \nthat growing home equity, that enables you to travel a bit during \nretirement, or that enables your son or daughter to afford to go to \ncollege.\n  So homeownership really is a magical part of the American dream--\nopening the door to our aspirations and building our financial \nfortunes. Thus, you would expect that our leaders would do all they \ncould to protect and advance homeownership.\n  Unfortunately, however, I am here today to say that we really haven't \ndone such a good job. In fact, all too often this past decade, we have \nallowed the great American dream of homeownership, to turn into the \ngreat American nightmare. We can and must do better.\n  What has gone wrong? In short, almost everything.\n  Most fundamentally, we have abused one of the most amazing \ninventions, one of the most powerful wealth building tools, we have \never seen: The fully amortizing mortgage.\n  Let's turn the clock back 77 years to the Great Depression. Before \n1932, house loans were normally 50 percent loan to value with 3- to 5-\nyear balloon payments. This worked fine as long as a family could get a \nnew loan at the end of 3 to 5 years to replace the old loan. With the \ncrash of our banking system in 1929, however, replacement loans were no \nlonger available. Thus, as balloon payments came due, millions of \nfamilies lost their homes.\n  The solution was the fully amortized mortgage, which eliminated the \nchallenge of replacing one's mortgage every 3 to 5 years, thereby \ninsulating families from frozen lending markets. Indeed, the Roosevelt \nadministration's decision to help millions of families replace their \nballoon loans with fully amortized loans was a major factor in ending \nthe Great Depression and putting our national economy back on track.\n\n[[Page S3766]]\n\n  This system of amortized mortgages worked very well for over half a \ncentury. But in recent years, we have allowed two developments that \nhave deeply damaged the stabilizing power of the amortizing mortgage \nand helped produce our current economic crisis. Those two factors are \ntricky mortgages and steering payments.\n  One tricky mortgage, for example, was the teaser loan--sometimes \ncalled the ``2-28'' loan. In this loan, a low introductory rate \nexploded to a much higher rate after 2 years. In many cases, the broker \nknew that the family could never afford the higher rate, but the broker \nwould persuade the family that the mortgage presented little risk since \nthe family could easily refinance out of the loan at a later date. This \nargument was misleading, of course, since the family was locked into \nthe loan by a sizable prepayment penalty.\n  Another tricky mortgage was the triple-option loan, in which a family \ncould make a month-to-month choice between a low payment, a medium \npayment, or a high payment. What many families didn't understand, \nhowever, was that the low payment could only be used for a limited \nperiod before the family was required to make the high payment, which \nthe family couldn't afford.\n  These tricky loans, however, would probably not have done much \ndamage, because their use would have been rare--except for a second \nmajor mistake; namely, we allowed brokers to earn huge bonus payments--\nunbeknownst to the homeowner--to steer unsuspecting homeowners into \nthese tricky and expensive mortgages.\n\n  These secret steering payments turned home mortgages into a scam. A \nfamily would go to a mortgage broker for advice in getting the best \nloan. The family would trust the broker to give good advice because, \nquite frankly, they were paying the broker for that advice. The payment \nto the broker was right there, fully listed and disclosed by law, on \nthe estimated settlement sheet.\n  But what the borrower didn't realize was that the broker would earn \nthousands of bonus dollars from the lender--so called ``yield-spread \npremiums''--if the broker could convince the homeowner to take out a \ntricky expensive mortgage rather than a plain vanilla 30-year mortgage.\n  This scam has had a tremendous impact. A study for the Wall Street \nJournal found that 61 percent of the subprime loans originated in 2006 \nwent to families who qualified for prime loans. This is simply wrong--a \npublicly regulated process designed to create a relationship of trust \nbetween families and brokers, but that allows payments borrowers are \nnot aware of that stick families with expensive and destructive \nmortgages.\n  It is difficult to overstate the damage that has been done by these \ntricky loans and secret steering payments.\n  An estimated 20,000 Oregon families will lose their homes to \nforeclosure this year.\n  Nationwide, an estimated 2 million families will lose their homes \nthis year and up to 10 million over the next 4 years.\n  In every single case, the foreclosure is a catastrophe for the \nfamily. Each foreclosure is a shattered dream. The family has lost its \nfinancial nest egg. It has lost the nurturing environment the parents \ncreated for the children. The family has lost its dream of building a \nfoundation for retirement. And don't doubt for a second the stress that \nthis catastrophe places on the parents' marriage, or on the children, \nmultiplying the damage.\n  The foreclosure is also a catastrophe for the neighborhood, because \nan empty foreclosed home can lower the value of other homes on the \nstreet by $5,000 to $10,000.\n  The foreclosure is, in addition, a catastrophe for our financial \nsystem. A lender often loses half the value of the property by the time \nit has been publicly auctioned. And as we now know all too well, \nforeclosures undermine the value of mortgage securities and mortgage \nderivatives, damaging the balance sheets of financial institutions in \nAmerica and throughout the world and throwing our banking system and \nglobal economy into chaos.\n\n  That frozen lending and economic chaos, of course, further hurts our \nfamilies. Oregon's unemployment rate has gone from 6 percent to 11 \npercent in just 5 months, nearly doubling the number of Oregon families \nout of work, and unemployment, in turn, drives additional foreclosures.\n  How did we let this happen? This fiasco is, first and foremost, the \nconsequence of colossal regulatory failure. Let me count the ways.\n  First, in 1994, Congress required the Federal Reserve Board to \nprohibit mortgage lending practices that are abusive, unfair or \ndeceptive. That was a very good law. But for 14 years, the Fed sat on \nits hands, failing to regulate abusive and deceptive practices such as \nteaser loans, prepayment penalties, and steering payments.\n  Second, in 2002, after the State of Georgia adopted comprehensive \nmortgage reform legislation, the Comptroller of the Currency, John \nHawke, overturned the Georgia reforms and banned all States from making \nsuch reforms affecting federally chartered institutions. This action \nmade it difficult for States to pass reforms covering State-chartered \nlenders as well, since such action generated the powerful argument that \nit would create an unfair disadvantage for State-chartered banks. I can \ntestify to this firsthand because that is exactly what happened when \nlast year, as Speaker of the Oregon House, I worked to pass such \nmortgage reforms in Oregon. As a former attorney of North Carolina \nsummarized it, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ``took 50 \nsheriffs off the job during the time the mortgage lending industry was \nbecoming the Wild West.''\n  The third failure was in 2004. The Securities and Exchange Commission \nexempted the five largest investment banks from its leverage \nrequirements. This dramatically amplified the funds available to the \nbanks to purchase mortgage-backed securities, funding a tsunami of \nsubprime loans. Let's take a look at a chart.\n  We see that impact in 2004, when subprime loans, which had been at a \nrelatively stable level, grew dramatically and suddenly. To make it \nworse, the Securities and Exchange Commission failed to regulate credit \ndefault swaps, which became a $50 trillion industry, that contributed \nto the appeal of mortgage-backed securities by insuring those \nsecurities against failure.\n  The fourth failure was in the Office of Thrift Supervision. That \noffice was asleep at the switch. The office failed to halt risky \nlending practices that doomed numerous thrifts. An inspector general's \nreport after the failure of NetBank in September of 2007 concluded that \nthe Office of Thrift Supervision ignored warning signs about the bank's \nrisky lending. OTS continued to snooze, however, while numerous thrifts \nfailed, including IndyMac, Washington Mutual, and Countrywide.\n  The fifth failure. While Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac set standards \nlimiting their purchase of subprime mortgages, they nevertheless poured \nfuel on the subprime fire by investing in subprime securities, thereby \ndriving the financing of the subprime market.\n  Taken together, these five circumstances composed a colossal failure \nof regulation. Even Alan Greenspan, former Chair of the Fed who \nprominently advocated that banking practices should not be regulated \nbecause Wall Street, in its own long-term interest, would regulate \nitself, now renounces that philosophy.\n  I say to my friends and colleagues, what a mess. Congress got it \nright in 1994, when it asked the Fed to prohibit mortgage lending \npractices that were abusive, unfair, and deceptive. But Congress shares \nthe responsibility for not following up aggressively when the Fed \nfailed to act on this requirement.\n  The result is that home ownership has suffered and our national \neconomy is in deep trouble. So now is the time for us to honestly \nassess the damage and to repair the damage as best we can. It is time \nto end the deception and abuse in Main Street mortgages and in Wall \nStreet mortgage securitization.\n  The American dream of home ownership, with all that it means for the \nquality of life of our families, depends on our effective action.\n  To repair the damage, we need to support aggressive efforts to enable \nfamilies trapped in subprime mortgages to negotiate modifications to \nthose mortgages. President Obama and his team have taken many steps in \nthe right direction on this issue, but we\n\n[[Page S3767]]\n\nneed to monitor the progress and help pave the way for success.\n  If mortgage modifications fail due to the extraordinary difficulty of \nconnecting borrowers to lenders in a market where the loan has been \nsliced and diced into 100 pieces, we need to support the ability of \nbankruptcy judges to operate as an arbitrator to adjust the terms of \nthe loan. We grant this power to judges for loans for yachts, loans for \nvacation homes for our more privileged citizens. Certainly, ordinary \ncitizens should have the same recourse for a far more important \npossession--the family home.\n  Consider the experience of Lisa Williams, who spoke at a mortgage \nforeclosure summit I hosted in Oregon last month. Lisa spoke about the \nlengths to which she went to get in touch with someone to help her \nrenegotiate her loan. She would call and call her bank and never get \nthrough or she would be put on hold for more than an hour at a time or, \non the rare occasion that she did get through, she could not reach \nanyone in a position of authority to talk with her. Five months ago, \ndespite her innumerable and consistent efforts, she lost her home. An \naggressive loan modification program or a last resort--and I stress \n``last resort''--bankruptcy arbitration would have saved Lisa's home \nand, looking forward, would save the homes of millions of other \nAmerican families.\n  We also need to restore the same guidelines to Wall Street--cap \nexcessive leverage, regulate credit default swaps, prevent the creation \nof firms too big to fail, end regulator shopping, and evaluate and \ncontrol systemic risks.\n  Finally, we need to end deceptive and abusive mortgage practices. The \nregulations adopted by the Federal Reserve last year are a decent \nstart. It is time for us to make sure teaser loans, triple option \nloans, and secret steering payments never again haunt American \nfamilies.\n  I say to my friends and colleagues, I end this appeal as I started \nit. Let us rally to the defense of the American home. We will have that \nchance when we consider legislation in the near future addressing \nmortgage practices. As we prepare to do our thoughtful best to craft \nmortgage and housing policy that will strengthen our American families, \nwe might do well to consider the advice of President Franklin \nRoosevelt, since it was, indeed, Roosevelt who steered us out of the \nNation's last enormous housing crisis.\n  Roosevelt, speaking in his April 2, 1932, radio address entitled \n``The Forgotten Man,'' declared:\n\n       Here should be the objective of Government itself, to \n     provide at least as much assistance to the little fellow as \n     it is now giving to large banks and corporations.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Oregon. I \nunderstand it is his very first speech he has given on the Senate \nfloor; is that correct?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. That is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Well, how wonderful, I say to the Senator from Oregon, \nhis very first speech was important because it was about home ownership \nand how we have to make sure the American dream continues to be within \nreach for most Americans, that they are able to afford a home and have \nthe jobs that pay those wages, and that when they go to buy a home, the \nrates are reasonable, that they are not a victim of a scam or scum.\n  I would like to say, if that is his first speech, I am looking \nforward to hearing many more and working with him on access to the \nAmerican dream--home ownership, the opportunity to pursue a higher \neducation, and to either own a business or have a job that pays a \nliving wage. Senator Merkley is a welcome addition to the Senate. \nSpeaking, I know, on behalf of those who have been here a while, that \nwas a great speech, and we look forward to many more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I simply thank the Senator from Maryland \nand look forward to working with her.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Christopher Hill\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the \nopportunity to speak now on a critical issue that is facing us. There \nare a number of nominations coming before this body. We need to move \nforward on a lot of these nominations and move forward aggressively. \nThere is one I wish to talk about with my colleagues, one about which I \nam deeply concerned. We held a hearing today on the nominee for the \nambassadorship to Iraq.\n  Christopher Hill has been nominated to serve as Ambassador to Iraq. \nThis is our most important diplomatic post in that region, arguably the \nmost important diplomatic post to the United States in the world today. \nWhile it is important we have an Ambassador in place as soon as \npossible, what is most important is that we get the right person in \nplace.\n  The next Ambassador to Iraq faces a daunting array of issues, such as \npreserving Iraq's fragile security, the drawdown of our troops, Arab-\nKurdish tensions, oil distribution, and Iranian aggression, to mention \na few.\n  Quite simply, the stakes could not be higher for the administration \nto find the right person to conduct our diplomacy in Baghdad and that \nregion.\n  In providing our advice and consent to the President, our duty is to \nensure that his nominee for this most sensitive and complicated post \nwill not only carry out faithfully the policies of the administration \nbut also will implement the laws of this country.\n  Moreover, the nominee should have a strong track record of diplomacy, \nforthrightness, professionalism, and achievement to bolster his or her \ncredibility with the American people, with the Iraqi people, and the \nnumerous regional actors. And in this respect, Mr. President, I \nregretfully say that I do not believe Ambassadors Hill's career in the \nForeign Service reflects the needs we have for this position in Iraq or \nthis country. I think his record and his actions fall short of the \nqualifications we need. I want to articulate why I believe that, and \ntherefore I will be objecting to his nomination as we move forward.\n\n  Let me begin by saying that I do not deny that Chris Hill is an \nexperienced negotiator. He negotiated Bosnia in the 1990s and then \nnegotiated North Korea for some period of time. But negotiation is only \none component of diplomacy. In addition to being able to converse with \nforeign actors, we also expect our diplomats to respect the chain of \ncommand, to work closely with colleagues in the State Department, the \nDepartment of Defense, and all other relevant agencies, and we expect \nour Ambassadors to respect the laws of the United States expressed by \nstatute and through proper oversight. But in his role as Assistant \nSecretary of East Asia and Pacific Affairs, as well as head of the U.S. \ndelegation to the six-party talks, too often Ambassador Hill found that \nkey officials and the law got in the way of his agenda. He found that \nsidelining those officials and ignoring congressional will was \nexpedient, if not acceptable. I regret to have to say that. Such \nbehavior establishes a precedent that can only hamper his efforts to \ncoordinate the immensely complicated U.S. Government effort in Iraq, \nand that brings me to the focus of my concerns and the specific \ndealings I had--and extensive they were--on human rights in North \nKorea, where these troubling aspects of Chris Hill's diplomatic conduct \nall come together.\n  I have a picture next to me here that is a very lamentable one from \nNorth Korea. It is a kindergarten in North Korea, and you can see the \nstarving children who are there. This was during the late 1990s when \nthere was starvation taking place in North Korea,\n\n[[Page S3768]]\n\nand the North Korean Government was not asking for assistance or \nsupport and the people were dying of starvation. The human rights \nsituation is deplorable in North Korea. I believe it is the worst in \nthe world, and that is saying something given some of the other actors \nthat exist.\n  Let me start by reminding my colleagues of all of this--the situation \nin North Korea. North Korea is ruled by a totalitarian regime rigidly \ncontrolled by a single dictator, Kim Jong Il. Human rights in North \nKorea do not exist. The state regulates all aspects of individual life, \nfrom food ration, to speech, to employment, to travel, and even to \nthought. Under Kim Jong Il's watch, millions of North Korean citizens \nhave perished from starvation, while thousands of others have died \nduring imprisonment in the regime's extensive political system and \ngulags.\n  I will show a picture here of the location of one of the prison \ncamps--or a number of prison camps in Russia. I have given a speech, \nand I have pointed this out. Google Earth has made witnesses of us all. \nNow you can see these on Google Earth.\n  North Korean defectors have testified about the conditions in these \ncamps. Prisoners face torture, hard labor, starvation, forced abortion, \ninfanticide, public executions, chemical and medical experimentation on \nprisoners, and gas chambers. They experience detention without judicial \nprocess, and family members of dissenters, including children and the \nelderly, are also shipped to the gulag as part of the policy of guilt \nby association. It is thought that over 400,000 people have died in the \ngulags over the years, and currently there are 200,000 North Korean \nprisoners in the gulag system.\n  I want to read to you an account from the Washington Post about the \nonly known living escapee from a North Korean gulag, and Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent to have the full article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 15, 2008]\n\nThree Kernels of Corn--The State Department Has More Pressing Concerns \n                        Than a Modern-Day Gulag.\n\n       We tend to think of concentration camps as belonging in \n     history books, but Shin Dong-hyuk reminds us of the uglier \n     truth. Mr. Shin, who is 26, was born in such a camp in North \n     Korea and lived there until he escaped in 2005. He is, in \n     fact, the only person known to have made a successful escape \n     from one of that nation's prison camps, which hold an \n     estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people.\n       Mr. Shin's story, which Post reporter Blaine Harden \n     movingly recounted in an article last week, was horrifying on \n     a couple of counts. The casual, routine brutality of the \n     camps is, as the article noted, almost unfathomable. Part of \n     Mr. Shin's finger was cut off as punishment for accidentally \n     dropping a sewing machine in the factory of the camp where he \n     was held. He bears scars from the torture of being, \n     essentially, roasted over a charcoal fire. When he was 14, he \n     watched as his mother was hanged and his brother shot to \n     death, ostensibly for trying to escape. In a memoir, he \n     writes of the ``lucky day'' when he found, in a pile of cow \n     dung, three kernels of corn that he was able to wash off and \n     eat.\n       It's horrifying, on another level, that only 500 people in \n     South Korea, where Mr. Shin lives, have bought his book. Many \n     Koreans don't want to hear about human rights abuses in the \n     north; they're worried that the Communist regime might \n     collapse and leave the more prosperous south with a costly \n     burden of rehabilitation. And South Korea isn't alone in \n     tuning out the horrors. The United States is more concerned \n     with containing North Korea's nuclear ambitions. The State \n     Department's stunning lack of urgency was captured in a \n     recent statement from its assistant secretary for Asia, \n     Christopher R. Hill: ``Each country, including our own, needs \n     to improve its human rights record.'' Japan is focused on \n     Japanese citizens abducted forcibly to North Korea. China \n     doesn't want instability across its border.\n       Mr. Hill's larger point is that the United States should be \n     practical in relations with the north and not simply denounce \n     abuses so that America can feel good about itself. We support \n     his efforts to negotiate with the regime. It's worth noting, \n     though, that last week the north yet again backtracked on a \n     nuclear-related agreement it had made and Mr. Hill had \n     vouched for. It will continue to honor such agreements, or \n     not, based on a reading of its own interests, not on whether \n     its negotiating partners do or don't speak honestly. We think \n     there's an inverse relationship between a regime's \n     trustworthiness on any subject and its propensity to abuse \n     its own people. We also believe that it should not be left to \n     the lone escapee from North Korea's gulag to speak out about \n     its horror.\n       High school students in America debate why President \n     Franklin D. Roosevelt didn't bomb the rail lines to Hitler's \n     camps. Their children may ask, a generation from now, why the \n     West stared at far clearer satellite images of Kim Jong Il's \n     camps, and did nothing.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, here is the quote I want to read from \nthe article about Shin Dong-Hyuk:\n\n       . . . his finger was cut off as punishment for accidentally \n     dropping a sewing machine in the factory of the camp where he \n     was held. He bears scars from the torture of being, \n     essentially, roasted over a charcoal fire. When he was 14, he \n     watched as his mother was hanged and his brother shot to \n     death, ostensibly for trying to escape. In a memoir, he \n     writes of the `lucky day' when he found, in a pile of cow \n     dung, three kernels of corn that he was able to wash off and \n     eat.\n\n  This was from the full piece from the Washington Post that I have had \nprinted in the Record.\n  Here is an aerial picture of what one of the camps looks like. This \nis camp 18--and you can get these off Google Earth--and the execution \nsite within this camp. Imagine if during World War II and the Holocaust \nwe had these kinds of pictures and this sort of knowledge. Would we say \nwe want to really do something about this or would we not? I think all \nof us would say: Well, absolutely. We would want to be very vocal about \nthis. We would want to be addressing this issue if we knew it took \nplace. Well, this is happening today. It happened during Chris Hill's \nwatch in that position, it happened during the six-party talks, and he \ndidn't address it and he didn't work on it.\n  The desperate situation has caused tens of thousands of North Koreans \nto risk their lives and their families' lives to flee across the border \ninto China, seeking food, shelter, and livelihood. But the Chinese \nGovernment blocks international access and aid to these refugees, \nleaving them helplessly exposed to severe exploitation, particularly in \nthe form of sex trafficking. The refugees also face repatriation if \ncaught by Chinese authorities, which for most of them means automatic \nimprisonment, torture, or execution once returned to North Korean \nofficials.\n  As Holocaust-survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel said, the North \nKorean regime ``. . . is responsible for one of the most egregious \nhuman rights and humanitarian disasters in the world today.''\n  I want to quickly show two satellite photos showing the prison \nbarracks of two camps, one in North Korea and the other in Auschwitz. \nNow, my point is not to say these situations are the same--they are \nnot--but, rather, that there are similarities, and people should know \nthis kind of evil still exists in the world today. I want people to \nlook at this prison situation. This is one of the camps--and again, \nthis is from Google Earth--one of the prison camps in North Korea. Then \nI want to hold up here as well a picture of Auschwitz. I ask people to \nlook at the similarity of these situations and of these settings. I \nknow when I first saw this, I thought, this is really eerie, that these \nlook alike this much. Now, I am not saying these are the same \nsituations. What I am saying is we continue to have this evil in the \nworld. We continue to have thousands of people killed in a gulag system \nin 2009. This continues to happen in the world.\n  Mr. President, as you may recall, the Congress sought to address this \nhorrifying situation back in 2004 with the North Korean Human Rights \nAct. This was passed and signed into law in October of that year. The \nSenate even passed that bill by unanimous consent--a proud day in the \nhistory of this body as we strengthened the moral fibers of this \nNation. The purpose of that law, as defined in its introduction, was to \npromote respect for and protection of fundamental human rights in North \nKorea; to promote a more durable humanitarian solution to the plight of \nNorth Korean refugees; to promote increased monitoring, access, and \ntransparency in the provision of humanitarian assistance inside North \nKorea; and to promote the free flow of information into and out of \nNorth Korea.\n  Let me also read aloud the very first section of title I of that act. \nIt says this:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the human rights of North \n     Koreans should remain a key element in future negotiations \n     between the United States, North Korea, and other concerned \n     parties in Northeast Asia.\n\n  So this is a statement to the six-party talks--to our negotiators--\nthat\n\n[[Page S3769]]\n\nhuman rights should remain a key element in future negotiations. This \nwas in 2004. Mr. President, 4\\1/2\\ years have transpired since the \npassage of this legislation. During that time, the issue of North \nKorean human rights quite simply has been subordinated, ignored, cast \naside, and indeed swept under the carpet, in complete contradiction of \nthe law of this country and against our Nation's most basic moral \nobligations and against the witnesses that we are that it is taking \nplace even as we see it.\n  In all the bluster and dealmaking over the past few years, our \nnegotiators have failed to exert any serious effort to address this \ndire issue. In fact, the situation has only worsened, according to any \nindependent benchmark. And the individual responsible for this account \nduring this period of time is Ambassador Chris Hill, who, according to \nthe Washington Post Editorial Board, displayed a ``stunning lack of \nurgency'' to deal with human rights and, according to the Washington \nTimes, ``deliberately minimized focus on the bleak human rights \nrecord.'' This is the nominee to be the Ambassador to Iraq--the most \nimportant account for us, I believe, in the world.\n  The cochair of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, Frank Wolf, \nagreed, stating in a recent letter to Hill that he is concerned with \nHill's ``marginalization and utter neglect of human rights.''\n  Just 1 year ago, Chris Hill himself said the following, asked about \nthe human rights situation in North Korea:\n\n       Each country, including our own, needs to improve its human \n     rights record.\n\n  In the face of the most horrific and ongoing human rights catastrophe \nin the world and instructed by Federal statute to address it, \nAmbassador Hill instead saw fit to associate the record of Kim Jong Il \nwith that of the United States of America.\n  Some have said that the policies implemented by Ambassador Hill were \nmerely the articulation of the Bush administration, but this is not the \ncase. I spoke several times directly with President Bush about North \nKorean human rights. I know his passion for it and his real commitment \nto addressing the issue. He proudly signed the North Korean Human \nRights Act and then again its reauthorization last year. He appointed a \ngood, qualified man in Jay Lefkowitz as the Special Envoy for North \nKorean Human Rights. But somewhere between the Oval Office and the six-\nparty negotiation room, the message got lost. On this, we have strong \nevidence that the broken link was Ambassador Hill.\n  First, at his nomination hearing this very morning, Ambassador Hill \nadmitted that on at least one occasion he exceeded his instructions by \nmeeting bilaterally with the North Korean Government. This went against \nthe clear public position of the President. He explained this by saying \nhe had to ``call an audible.'' This was in testimony this morning. But \nto others, this looks like a freelancing diplomat. When it comes to \nworking in a country with neighbors such as Iran and Syria, the stakes \nare too high to have diplomacy run anywhere other than by the Secretary \nof State and the President.\n  We also know from a number of sources that Ambassador Hill used his \nposition to sideline key officials in the administration who were \ncharged with addressing the human rights situation in North Korea. One \nof these individuals was Jay Lefkowitz, who struggled during his entire \ntenure as Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea to gain tracks \nand support for his efforts among the East Asian Bureau and the team \nled by Hill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter I sent, and was sent back in answer by Jay Lefkowitz today, \nwhere we asked him if was he ever invited to the six-party talks--ever.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 25, 2009.\n     Mr. Jay P. Lefkowitz, P.C.,\n     Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Citigroup Center, New York, NY.\n       Dear Jay: Christopher Hill testified today before the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In response to a question \n     by Senator Lugar, he failed to specifically address whether \n     he invited you to participate in the Six Party Talks to \n     address North Korean human rights. As you recall, in his \n     testimony before the Senate Armed Service Committee on July \n     31, 2008, he promised to invite you to participate in all \n     future negotiation sessions, without qualifying the nature of \n     those sessions.\n       Based on my knowledge of the situation, I believe he \n     violated his commitment. Can you please respond to me as to \n     whether or not Christopher Hill or anyone acting on his \n     behalf invited you to the Six Party Talks subsequent to July \n     31, 2008?\n       I look forward to your swift reply, and appreciate your \n     cooperation in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Sam Brownback,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n       Dear Senator Brownback: At no point during my tenure as \n     Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea, either before \n     or after July 31, 2008, did Chris Hill or anyone acting on \n     his behalf invite me to participate in any Six Party Talks.\n                                                              Jay.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is what Mr. Lefkowitz says in his \nresponse to my letter:\n\n       Dear Senator Brownback: At no point during my tenure as \n     Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea, either before \n     or after July 31, 2008, did Chris Hill or anyone acting on \n     his behalf invite me to participate in any Six Party Talks.\n\n  This is the Special Envoy for Human Rights to North Korea.\n  Another key official cut out of the loop by Hill was former \nAmbassador to Japan, Tom Schieffer. The Washington Post reported in \n2007 that Ambassador Schieffer received assurances from the \nadministration that he could tell the Japanese Government that North \nKorea would not come off the terrorism list until the abduction issue \nthat was central to the Japanese had been resolved. But Ambassador \nSchieffer found out later that Chris Hill had cut a deal ignoring that \npledge and, without advance notice or information from Ambassador Hill, \nhad to backtrack--our Ambassador to Japan--and try to mollify our \nstalwart ally, Japan, whose Government felt upset and betrayed.\n  Finally, at least one senior intelligence officer has said Ambassador \nHill sidetracked and bypassed procedures designed to inform the \nintelligence community of the substance of his discussions with the \nNorth Koreans.\n  Such conduct in the course of negotiations should give serious pause \nto those concerned about the sensitivity of diplomacy in Iraq and in \nthe Middle East at this time.\n  In addition to this undiplomatic conduct with respect to his \nexecutive branch colleagues, Ambassador Hill has a disturbing track \nrecord of evasiveness, and I believe dishonesty, in dealing with \nCongress. In statements made for the record in congressional testimony, \nAmbassador Hill made promises that he did not, could not, or had no \nintention to keep.\n  Regarding the prospect of normalization with North Korea, Ambassador \nHill assured a skeptical House Foreign Affairs Committee in February \n2007 that improvement in human rights would be part of any deal struck \nwith North Koreans. But 1 year later, Ambassador Hill indicated to a \nreporter that normalization could proceed before such things took \nplace. He stated:\n\n       Obviously we have continued differences with North Korea, \n     but we can do that in the context of two states that have \n     diplomatic relations.\n\n  On the issue of human rights last year, before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I asked Ambassador Hill whether he would invite the \nSpecial Envoy for Human Rights to all future negotiation sessions. His \nanswer, and I quote it directly:\n\n       I would be happy to invite him to all future negotiating \n     sessions with North Korea.\n\n  That answer was given without qualifiers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the relevant portion \nof that committee transcript from July 31, 2008, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     The North Korean Six-Party Talks and Implementation Activities\n\n\n Hearing before the committee on armed services, united states senate, \n                             july 31, 2008\n\n       Senator Brownback. I want to, because my time will be \n     narrow here: will you state that the Special Envoy will be \n     invited to all future negotiating sessions with North Korea?\n       Ambassador Hill. I would be happy to invite him to all \n     future negotiating sessions with North Korea.\n       Senator Brownback. Thank you.\n       Mr. Ambassador, you noted this earlier, that there are \n     political gulags and concentration camps in North Korea. Will \n     you\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\n     state that any prospect of normalization with North Korea is \n     contingent upon the regime shutting down the political gulags \n     and concentration camps?\n       Ambassador Hill. I can say to you, Senator, that we will \n     definitely raise these issues as an element of the \n     normalization process. I'm not in a position at my level to \n     state to you today what the specific conditions of \n     normalization were, but they will be raised as part of that \n     and clearly, we will be looking for more satisfactory answers \n     on this.\n       Senator Brownback. Mr. Ambassador, the Illinois delegation \n     in total in a letter dated in 2005--noted the abduction of \n     Reverend Kim Dong Shik, who's a U.S. citizen, and his wife is \n     an Illinois resident, children U.S. citizens. I'm going to \n     enter this letter in the record. It's from the Illinois \n     delegation. They have said they would not support any \n     normalization with North Korea until his abduction is dealt \n     with.\n       [The information referred to follows:]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I already entered the note I received \nfrom the Special Envoy saying he was never invited, but there is \nanother case--one I know is of great concern to the ranking member of \nthe House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen--where Chris Hill \ntold a reporter that he had no recollection of receiving a letter from \nand had provided no response to the spouse of Rev. Kim Dong-Shik, a \nU.S. permanent resident and father of a U.S. citizen, who was kidnapped \nin North Korea in 2000.\n  Yet a photo obtained by the media showed Mr. Hill receiving this from \nthe Congresswoman herself.\n  On the issue of nuclear disarmament, Ambassador Hill also misled \nCongress. During his February 2007 testimony, Hill insisted that North \nKorea must disclose ``all'' of its nuclear programs, and specified that \n``All means all, and this means the highly enriched uranium program as \nwell.''\n  But when the North Koreans' belated declaration of nuclear activity \ndid not even mention their uranium program, even when there were \nreports that the documents themselves that they gave us had traces of \nuranium on them, Ambassador Hill still insisted on rewarding the North \nKorean regime with delistment from the terrorism list.\n  On dealing with proliferation, later that year before the House \nsubcommittee, Ambassador Hill said:\n\n       Clearly, we cannot be reaching a nuclear agreement with \n     North Korea if at the same time they are proliferating. It is \n     not acceptable.\n\n  Yet only months later, Hill reached just such an agreement before \nCongress had a chance to answer key questions about North Korea's \nalleged nuclear proliferation to Syria, taking place during Hill's own \nnegotiations.\n  What all this shows is a disturbing pattern by Ambassador Hill to \ntell Congress one thing, and then do another.\n  Congressional testimony is not a formality. It is not a venue for \nexecutive officials to parrot what Members of Congress want to hear--\nregardless of whether such parroting reflects reality.\n  Rather, congressional hearings provide a means to reassure the \nAmerican people that their tax dollars are being spent wisely, and \ntheir interests are being preserved.\n  In this case, we had a right to know that the tens of millions of \ndollars worth of heavy fuel oil sent to Kim Jong Il, and the other \nserious concessions Ambassador Hill was handing over, were at least \ngoing to improve our national security, if not help end the oppression \nof the North Korean people.\n  And in that respect, I would like to address the substance of \nAmbassador Hill's deals with the North Korean regime. The record can be \nsummarized by stating the concessions that both sides obtained through \nthe negotiations.\n  First, Ambassador Hill is credited with a victory in bringing the \nNorth Koreans back to the table in 2005. But in doing so, he admits to \nexceeding his instructions to avoid bilateral talks with the regime.\n  Second, Hill oversaw and managed a complicated process that involved \nRussia, China, South Korea, and Japan, in addition to the U.S. and the \nDPRK.\n  Neither of these gains in process provided us with concrete evidence \nof progress on denuclearization, despite the fact that the North \nKoreans traded them for substantial material gain from our side.\n  Ambassador Hill did obtain a declaration of nuclear activities from \nthe regime. But as noted earlier, this declaration was half a year \noverdue and so incomplete as to render it useless. The declaration \nprovided no confirmation of the number of bombs that were made, no \nadmission or information on the uranium program, and nothing on \nproliferation. It was a radioactive set of documents of dubious worth.\n  Additionally, Ambassador Hill was able to get the DPRK to implode the \ncooling tower at Yongbyon. But according to many analysts, the step was \nmostly a symbolic gesture in that North Korea is still able to run its \nplutonium reactor, just with more environmental consequences.\n  In exchange for these minimal gains in process and symbolism, the \nconcessions we forked over were substantial. Tens of millions of \ndollars worth of heavy fuel oil were shipped over to supply the regime \nwith ``energy assistance,'' ostensibly so that it could continue to \ncarry out its policies of belligerence and oppression.\n  Congress was asked to pass legislation waiving Glenn amendment \nsanctions against North Korea. These sanctions were designed to \nprohibit assistance to states that detonate illegal nuclear weapons, \nand were automatically triggered when DPRK tested a nuclear bomb in \n2006. We gave them a pass on that.\n  We delisted the DPRK from the list of state sponsors of terror, \ndespite their failure to account for the Japanese abductees and U.S. \npermanent resident Reverend Kim Dong-Shik, not to mention their failure \nto even slightly diminish the terror they inflict upon the North Korean \npeople.\n  We removed sanctions pursuant to the Trading with the Enemy Act, and \nfacilitated the transfer of money to the regime that otherwise should \nhave been confiscated by the Treasury Department under financial \nregulations for nuclear proliferators.\n  We looked the other way on the role that the DPRK played in \nconstructing a nuclear reactor in Syria, choosing instead to plow ahead \nwith the negotiations.\n  What is worse, after we gave up so much leverage, the DPRK is now \njust as hostile and dangerous as ever. Next week the regime plans on \nlaunching a ballistic missile over Japan that could reach the outskirts \nof the United States, a provocative act of the gravest significance.\n  And to push the limits of our tolerance even further, on March 17, \nNorth Korean border guards abducted two American journalists--Laura \nLing and Euna Lee--and reports indicate that since their capture they \nhave been subjected to ``intense interrogation.''\n  Taken all together, this is an unfortunate legacy for Ambassador \nHill. Broken commitments to Congress, freelancing diplomacy, \ndisregarding human rights, and giving up key leverage to the DPRK in \nexchange for insubstantial gestures.\n  Such things have harmed our national security and ignored our moral \nobligations, a legacy ill-suited for the next Chief of Mission to Iraq.\n  I will conclude not with my own words, but with the words of Rabbi \nAbraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, who \nwrote a piece for the Korea Times last month, which I will ask to be \nincluded in the Record.\n\n       By exclusively pursuing the nuclear tail around the six-\n     party table, we have contributed to the horrible suffering of \n     the people of North Korea and degraded the United States' \n     long-standing commitment to fundamental human rights.\n       Like the inmates of the Soviet Gulag or the Nazi \n     concentration camps of the 1930s, about 200,000 to 300,000 \n     hapless victims in North Korean camps wait for help. Our \n     silence to these and other outrages is perhaps Pyongyang's \n     greatest victory to date. We want them to dispose of fearsome \n     weapons--they want our silence. And too often, we have \n     acquiesced.''\n\n  Mr. President, I do not acquiesce to this nomination.\n  I now ask unanimous consent the full article by Rabbi Abraham Cooper \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Clinton Strikes Blow for North's Human Rights\n\n                       (By Rabbi Abraham Cooper)\n\n       Give Hillary Clinton her due. Her first overseas foreign \n     policy trip as secretary of state pits her against an \n     adversary, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, who over the last \n     16 years effectively took both the Clinton and Bush \n     administrations to the cleaners.\n\n[[Page S3771]]\n\n       Despite profoundly different worldviews, the United States \n     has played pretty much the same cards at the six-party table. \n     The main goal: securing a nuclear-defanged North Korea.\n       ``Complications,'' like human rights, were effectively \n     sidelined. Incredibly, some ``Korean experts'' are pushing \n     hard for Secretary Clinton to pursue the same approach.\n       Nuclear deal, uber alles. They still imagine that North \n     Korea has the same objectives as we do: that Pyongyang wants \n     to seek benefits for their starving people, that it wants to \n     advance economically, and that it pursues political \n     objectives because of nationalistic fervor.\n       And, most dangerously, some experts dismiss the regime's \n     missile-rattling as merely a means to attract attention and \n     extract a higher price when they eventually give up their \n     nuclear bargaining chips. The operative assumption is that \n     they, like us, ultimately want to succeed in achieving a \n     negotiated agreement.\n       But in pursuit of the prize, we have ignored Pyongyang's \n     statements that they will never compromise on military \n     objectives and will never relent on its nuclear program.\n       We have failed to recognize that the North Koreans leverage \n     the process of negotiations to get benefits, while using any \n     pretext to avoid fulfilling verifiable agreements on the \n     issues that trouble the rest of the world.\n       If this process also degrades our alliances with Japan and \n     South Korea and stymies the advance of good relations and \n     China, their true objectives--putting us and our regional \n     friends in a difficult position--will have been achieved . . \n     . again.\n       By exclusively pursuing the nuclear tail around the six-\n     party table, we have also contributed to the horrible \n     suffering of the people of North Korea and degraded the \n     United States' long-standing commitment to fundamental human \n     rights.\n       Like the inmates of the Soviet Gulag or the Nazi \n     concentration camps of the 1930s, about 200,000 to 300,000 \n     hapless victims in North Korean camps wait for help.\n       Every day, they are forced to renounce their very humanity. \n     How else to survive when prison guards threaten to chop off a \n     child's hand to force a confession from a parent?\n       Why doesn't that guard, or those who've run gas chambers or \n     performed experiments on political prisoners, have any reason \n     to fear punishment under international law?\n       Our silence to these and other outrages is perhaps \n     Pyongyang's greatest victory to date. We want them to dispose \n     of fearsome weapons--they want our silence.\n       And too often, we have acquiesced. For the past two years \n     we have let Japan go it alone in its fight to bring back \n     citizens who were abducted by North Korea, kidnapped as they \n     walked the streets of their hometowns in Japan.\n       As many as 80 Japanese are estimated to have been taken \n     against their will to North Korea, where they are forced to \n     train North Korean spies, enter arranged marriages and serve \n     other interests of the Kim Jong-il regime. Kim himself \n     admitted to 13 abductions.\n       In our eagerness to obtain that elusive agreement in which \n     we imagine North Korea might divest itself of a bargaining \n     chip it has devoted decades to develop at great expense, we \n     sacrifice our own commitment to human rights.\n       The logic of doing so was never stated more vapidly than in \n     the written statement of a private witness at last week's \n     hearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee: ``Japan \n     will continue to be part of the problem rather than part of \n     the solution when it comes to engaging North Korea, despite \n     being one of our most important allies. By allowing the \n     abduction of a handful of its citizens decades ago to \n     dominate all policy considerations when it comes to the \n     North, Tokyo has become irrelevant at the nuclear talks,'' \n     the statement said, implying that being part of a negotiating \n     process should outweigh a nation's interest in the rights of \n     its own citizens. Thankfully, Hillary Clinton disagrees.\n       Secretary Clinton's visit to Asia is extremely important. \n     So far, she's been making it clear that we are willing to \n     negotiate with North Korea, but at the same time, by meeting \n     with the families of some of the abductees, she is signaling \n     that the United States will no longer abandon them or our \n     fundamental values.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:15 \np.m. today, the Senate resume consideration of the Ensign second-degree \namendment, No. 715, and that the amendment be modified with changes at \nthe desk and there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form prior to a vote in relation to the \namendment; that upon the use of that time, the Senate proceed to a vote \nin relation to the amendment; that upon the disposition of amendment \nNo. 715, as modified, the Baucus-Grassley amendment, No. 692, as \namended, if amended, be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that the Senate then resume consideration of \namendment No. 693 and that the amendment be modified with the changes \nat the desk; that once modified, the amendment be agreed to, as \nmodified, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the \nSenate then resume consideration of amendment No. 717, and that the \namendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that no amendments be in order to any of the amendments \ncovered in this agreement prior to a vote in relation thereto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 715), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 20, insert before the period the following: \n     ``which shall include crisis pregnancy centers, organizations \n     that serve battered women (including domestic violence \n     shelters), and organizations that serve victims of rape or \n     incest''.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 715, as modified\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided before \na vote on amendment No. 715, as modified.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Which is the Ensign second-degree amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you. As I understand it, the Senator from Nevada \ndoes not wish to speak.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield back my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I will comment that the Ensign amendment would make an \nunnecessary, divisive change to the bipartisan amendment offered by \nSenators Baucus and Grassley. Senators Baucus and Grassley create a \nnonprofit, capacity-building program that would fund grant programs to \nprovide technical assistance to small charities: how to manage \nfinances, accurately file tax returns, et cetera.\n  There is no limitation in the Baucus-Grassley amendment on the type \nof charities that can access these training opportunities. Therefore, \nthe Senator from Nevada's amendment is unnecessary.\n  Therefore, I move to table the Ensign amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I \nappreciate very much the hard work of Senator Mikulski and appreciate \nthe cooperation we have received on this side of the aisle. We are \ngoing to work through more amendments tomorrow--if, in fact, there are \nother amendments. It is my understanding the Thune amendment is one we \nwill vote on. We will not do that tonight. We will do it in the morning \nat a convenient time for everyone. I am going to file cloture tonight. \nI hope it is not necessary that we vote to invoke cloture. We should \nnot have to invoke cloture on a bill such as this. This is a bill that \nis unquestionably bipartisan. We have given hours and hours of time for \npeople to offer amendments, to speak on the bill, speak on the \namendments. As everyone knows, this is our last weekend prior to the \nEaster recess and next week is going to be a real difficult week. They \nalways are when we do the budget. So it would be a good idea if we \ncould finish tomorrow so people could go back to their States and do \nwhat they need to do before the difficult week we have next week. But \nif we can't finish this, we will have to vote for cloture and either \nthe Republicans will allow us to move the vote up to Thursday or we \nwill have to do it Friday morning. That means if people want to \ncontinue being difficult--and I am confident that will not be the \ncase--then we would have to finish this on Saturday. We have to finish \nthis legislation before Monday. We have to start on the budget Monday. \nThere is 50 hours of statutory time. That time has to start running \nMonday. We will come in at an early time on Monday to get that going.\n  I had a small conversation today with Senator Gregg. He has an idea \nof how many amendments the Republicans wish to offer.

I didn't know about it until 4 o'clock today. I am sorry about \nthat. I know attendance may not be perfect because at 12 noon, there is \ngoing to be a series of votes in the Budget Committee. There will also \nbe a series of votes at 3:30 tomorrow afternoon in the Budget \nCommittee. What we accomplish on the floor, we are going to work around \nthese votes that come from the Budget Committee. I would hope we could \nwrap up this bill right after that briefing, which will end at 5 \no'clock tomorrow afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I believe we can wrap up this bill. I am \nnot aware of many more amendments on our side of the aisle. We will be \nable to come to closure on ours, I believe, even before noon tomorrow, \nacknowledging what will happen in the Budget Committee. So we would \nlike to be able to move expeditiously.\n  I would hope we would not have to be in session late on Friday or on \nSaturday. And, in fact, I would suggest that Members go home to their \ncommunities and volunteer. There is always some good work to be done. \nThis is about national service. We have heard about the good 'ol \nplatoons all over America. There are communities that need our help \nmore than they need long-winded speeches on the Senate floor. So let's \ndo some heavy lifting in the Senate, and let's do some heavy lifting in \nour communities. But let's bring this bill to an end tomorrow night.\n  I really want to thank my colleague, Senator Hatch, for the excellent \ncooperation he and his staff have given us, along with Senator Enzi, \nwho I know continues to be snowed-in in Wyoming. We do not want to be \nsnowed-in in the Senate. We have now filed cloture. Let's get this bill \ndone.\n  Mr. President, questions have been raised about the intent of section \n1705 giving the chief executive officer authority to delegate specific \nprogrammatic authority to the States. In particular, strong concerns \nhave been raised that corporation officials would use this authority to \neliminate the State offices of the corporation and adversely impact the \noperation of VISTA and the Senior Corps.\n  The committee intends that the chief executive officer will use this \nauthority judiciously to improve the operation of the all of the \ncorporation's programs by using a consultative process that includes \nall of the stakeholders in the affected programs. The committee expects \nthe corporation to continue the staff from State offices at an \noperational level that is at least equal to the current one.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on my amendment that \nhas been offered to the Serve America Act. I would first like to thank \nmy colleague, Senator Murkowski, for offering this amendment on my \nbehalf. She is a cosponsor to this amendment along with a number of my \nother colleagues, including Senators Bingaman, Johnson, and Barrasso.\n  My amendment will accomplish two things: First, it will designate a \npermanent Strategic Advisor for Native American Affairs at the \nCorporation\n\n[[Page S3773]]\n\nfor National and Community Service. And second, it will ensure that \nIndian Tribes remain eligible to compete for national service grants.\n  I want to applaud the Corporation for National and Community Service \nfor recognizing the need for a tribal liaison over the past year. That \noffice has helped make tribal communities more aware of the \nopportunities that the Corporation offers.\n  Making this position permanent will further increase tribal community \nin all national service programs. In addition, the office would collect \ninformation on challenges to tribes to better address tribal program \nneeds.\n  The amendment places the designation of this position under the \nduties of the chief executive officer of the Corporation for National \nand Community Service and would greatly help to develop and enhance \nprogramming to address the unique needs of Indian tribes.\n  The second part of this amendment would ensure that tribal \ngovernments remain eligible for nationally competitive grants. Existing \nlaw allows tribes to compete for funds with states and national \nnonprofit organizations. The bill as currently written would remove \ntribal eligibility to compete for these grants. My amendment merely \nmaintains existing law, and acknowledges Indian tribes as eligible \nentities for these competitive grants.\n  As my colleague from Alaska noted, many of the proposed Corps in this \nact address the very issues which are most critical in Indian Country. \nGrants under the activities and indicators of the Education, Healthy \nFutures, Clean Energy, Veterans and Opportunity Corps would provide \nmany volunteers from tribal organizations, States, and national \nnonprofits numerous opportunities to work on reservations.\n  My hope is that the Corporation will continue to encourage the use of \nthese Corps on Indian reservations though the proposed strategic \nadviser for Native American affairs in a way which will help tribal \ncommunities and individuals.\n  American Indians have the lowest level of educational attainment of \nany racial or ethnic group in the United States. Only 13.3 percent of \nNative Americans have an undergraduate degree, compared to the national \naverage of 24.4 percent. Volunteers in the Education Corps who offer \ntheir time as mentors and tutors in Indian Country could help improve \nthese numbers for our First Americans.\n  Moreover, the Health Futures Corps could assist with volunteers for \nindividual American Indians who need help obtaining health services or \nnavigating the health care system. The Clean Energy Corps might \nfacilitate volunteers for Indian Country to assist with weatherization \nof homes on Indian reservations. The Veterans Corps is able to send \nvolunteers to work with American Indian families who have a family \nmember deployed overseas. Finally, the Opportunities Corps could \nprovide volunteers to increase financial literacy in Indian communities \nwhere this assistance is desperately needed.\n  In addition, organizations who participate in the national service \nprograms, such as the Boys and Girls Club, are active through these \nnational service programs in Indian Country and they provide a much \nneeded positive environment where Native American youth can go to \ncelebrate their culture and community.\n  I would like to reiterate how important these national service \nprograms are to Indian Country and thank the Corporation for National \nand Community Service for recognizing that importance. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment to the Serve America Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/25/senate-section/article/S3773-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nPresident's proposed budget.\n  A real sense of unease is pervading the country right now, and it is \nnot just the stock market or unemployment fears or the housing crisis. \nThere is a genuine apprehension about where our Nation is headed \nfinancially.\n  In my travels throughout my home State this past weekend, I had the \nopportunity to talk to Georgians from Atlanta, to Waycross, to Blakely, \nto Macon, and to hear what is on their minds. One of their main \nconcerns is the budget the President has sent to the Hill and the \nfinancial hole into which it will put this country, our children, and \nour grandchildren.\n  They are right to be worried. The independent, nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office released its analysis of the President's \nproposed budget on last Friday. Its assessment is very troubling. The \nCBO's estimate for the cost of this budget exceeds that of the Obama \nadministration's estimate by $2.3 trillion over a 10-year period. By \nborrowing and spending so much money, the CBO projects that the public \ndebt--the amount we have to pay back to our creditors--will grow to 82 \npercent of GDP by 2019. The last time that happened, America was paying \noff a massive debt it incurred from fighting in World War II. According \nto the CBO, this year, 2009, the total deficit is estimated to hit $1.9 \ntrillion. By 2018, the CBO projects annual deficits to be more than $1 \ntrillion every year, and rising. Under the terms of this budget, the \nannual deficit, in 2013, is slated to be $672 billion--or more than 4 \npercent of estimated GDP. That is one of the largest deficits in \nAmerican history, but it is actually the smallest projected deficit in \nthis entire budget.\n  Back in 2004, before he was the President's Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, current OMB Director Peter Orszag wrote that \nrepeated deficits of 3.5 percent or more will put this country on an \n``unsustainable path'' and would result in ``a related loss of \nconfidence both at home and abroad.'' He was right. But we are feeling \nthat loss of confidence among Americans now, much less among those whom \nwe are looking to to buy that huge debt we are creating.\n  To put it plainly, people are worried. These are people such as Phil \nPerlis, who owns a family clothing business in Tifton, GA. Phil's \nfamily has owned The Big Store for almost a century, and it employs \napproximately 20 people. I know Phil and his family very well. Phil \nsaid this is the toughest year he has ever had. He has been ``squeezed \nin every place imaginable.'' The days of feeling comfortable about \nmaking a profit no longer exist, and he simply hopes to be in business \nthis time next year. His confidence is shaken. And given the business \nclimate and the economic issues in Washington--and despite his positive \nattitude--Phil predicted to me the other day that very trying times are \nahead for his store, as well as all other small businesses across \nAmerica.\n  He is not alone. Americans, despite the optimism that is our \nbirthright, already feel a sense of disquiet about the direction our \nNation is headed economically. As an example, the national savings rate \nhas gone from zero in 2005 to 8 percent today. For the good of their \nfamilies, Americans are trying to hold on to what they have, not \nthrowing caution to the wind and hoping for a future financial miracle. \nFor the good of our country, our children, and our grandchildren, our \nGovernment should do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/25/senate-section/article/S3773-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3773-S3776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, next week the Senate is going to take up \nthe budget. The budget, of course, is one of the most important \ndocuments the Congress considers each year. It is really the blueprint \nfor spending. At the end of that debate in the Senate, hopefully the \nbudget will pass and the same thing will happen in the House. The two \nChambers will come together and agree on a spending pattern for the\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\nnext fiscal year, which begins October 1.\n  It is an elaborate process, a lengthy process, many times a divisive \nprocess, but one that is absolutely essential because this budget book \nreally reflects who we are and where our values are. That is why we \nspend so much time thinking about it and planning it. We have to look \nahead, and not just to the next fiscal year from October 1 of this year \nthrough September 30 of 2010 but to what the budget will mean in the \noutyears. What will it do for the following year? What do we anticipate \nwill happen?\n  Some of it is speculation. There are great speculators, and people \npaid a lot of money to speculate on what is going to happen to the \neconomy, and they come up with different conclusions. I was thinking \nthe other day, when the Congressional Budget Office came out with \ndifferent projections for economic growth: I wonder if any speculators \non economic growth 2 years ago would have predicted we would be where \nwe are today. I do not think so because there would have been a race \nfor the exits, with people selling their stocks and mutual funds and \nliquidating as fast as they could. We did not receive fair warning this \nwas going to happen, although there were some storm clouds that really \nshould have been heeded.\n  Well, when this President came to office, he inherited quite a \nsituation. We started the year 2009 with President Obama in the midst \nof a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime. As the Budget \nOffice book indicates, our economy is in deep recession that threatens \nto be deeper and longer than any since the Great Depression 75 years \nago.\n  More than 3.5 million jobs were lost over the past 13 months, before \nPresident Obama came to office--more jobs than at any time since World \nWar II. Another 8.8 million Americans who want and need full-time work \nhave had to settle for part-time jobs. Manufacturing employment has hit \na 60-year low. Capital markets are virtually frozen, making it \ndifficult for businesses to grow and families to borrow for a home, a \ncar, or the college education expenses of their kids. Families are \nstruggling to pay their bills and make their mortgage payments. \nTrillions of dollars of wealth have been wiped out. There is hardly \nanyone with a savings account or any kind of investment who has not \nseen it diminished by this economy over the last year. That is just a \nfact.\n  It is in that environment and in that context that we discuss what to \ndo in the next budget. What should the Federal Government do in light \nof these economic realities?\n  Well, the first thing we did for this President was to pass a \nrecovery and reinvestment package, the stimulus bill. The President \ncame to us and said: Here is the fundamental problem we run into. \nPeople are worried. When their confidence is low, they stop spending. \nAnd if they are not spending on basic appliances and cars and things \npeople spend money on, then, of course, there is no demand for goods \nand services. Without that demand, businesses start contracting and \nshrinking, laying off employees, and the situation goes from bad to \nworse.\n\n  So the President came to us and said: I am asking for $800 billion in \na recovery and reinvestment package to try to breathe some life back \ninto this economy, to create jobs and save jobs, so people will have a \npaycheck they will spend for goods and services, which will invigorate \nbusinesses across America.\n  That, to me, was just fundamental. I took some economics courses in \ncollege way back when, and we basically learned what was known as \nKeynesian economics; that is, if you do not have enough aggregate \ndemand in your economy, you can create that demand in three different \nways: consumer spending, investment, or Government spending. Well, we \ncannot get people to invest because they are afraid of the stock \nmarket. Consumer spending is down because people are worried about the \nfuture. That leaves you one option: Government spending.\n  A lot of people say: Well, how can we spend money--$800 billion--\nSenator, when we have all these deficits? You are just piling up more \ndebt for our kids to pay. There is truth to that, but it does not tell \nthe whole story. If we do not turn this recession around, if we do not \nput people back to work and businesses back in business, then, sadly, \nthe recession gets worse, the overall deficit gets worse, and the \nprospects that those kids of yours or grandkids will even find a job \nare diminished. So our investment in the recovery plan is a basic \ninvestment to try to create more consumer demand for goods and services \nand get the economy chugging forward again.\n  The budget the President proposes, the one for the next fiscal year, \nfor our Government that we will be debating next week on the floor of \nthe Senate, is a smart, fair, and responsible budget. The President has \nproposed--and he described it last night in his press conference--to \nrestore fairness for middle-class families, reestablish responsibility \nin the budgeting process, and make smart investments for America's \nfuture. I think we have to do all three.\n  The Republican response to this on the other side of the aisle is \nthat the President's budget just spends too much money. It taxes too \nmuch. It borrows too much.\n  The President's increase in what we call nondefense discretionary \nspending--that is outside of the mandatory programs such as Social \nSecurity and Medicare and Medicaid and other programs, veterans \nprograms, and defense spending--all the rest of the budget is \nrelatively small in comparison. But it is true that the President calls \nfor increased spending in that area--but in two specifics: one, more \nmoney for veterans. You cannot visit a veterans hospital or meet with \nveterans today without realizing that the promise we made to them has \nto be kept, and it will cost money. I had a hearing today where two \ngenerals spoke to us from the Air National Guard and the Army National \nGuard and they talked about returning veterans and the problems they \nface, and we know there are many. Some come home with terrible wounds \nfrom war and have a long period of time ahead of them for \nrehabilitation and recovery. Some, however, come home with invisible \nwounds, psychological wounds, posttraumatic stress disorder and the \nlike. LTG Vaughn from the Army Guard and Reserve said that suicide \nrates are up 140 to 150 percent. The same thing is true with the air \nguard returnees. It is an indication that we have an obligation that \nneeds to be met. We need to spend money to make sure these veterans get \nthe kind of care we promised, to put them back in a position in life \nwhere they can proceed to get a job and build a home and a family and \nhave a good future. They served us. They risked their lives for \nAmerica. We promised we would stand by them. President Obama keeps the \npromise in this budget.\n\n  When the Republicans on the other side say cut spending, I wonder if \nwe will see any amendments from the Republican side to cut President \nObama's requested increase in spending to help our veterans. It is one \nof the highlights of his budget. I don't think they will offer that \namendment. They may complain about the spending level, but I doubt if \nthey will stand up here and say we are spending too much money on our \nveterans.\n  The President, of course, puts money into education, as he should. \nPresident Obama understands that a lot of middle-income families are \nstruggling to keep their kids in school. Sometimes they are not making \nas much money at home as they used to. Some kids have been asked to \ncome home from the campuses and not go back to school for awhile until \nthings get better. Well, that interrupted education is not good, and we \nwant these kids, these young men and women, to have a bright future. \nPresident Obama's budget spends money in providing financial and tax \nassistance to students in school. If that isn't a smart investment for \nour future, I don't know what is. It is critically important.\n  So to my Republican friends who say we spend too much, I guess my \nbasic answer to them is: Please show us your budget. Unfortunately, \nwhat we have heard and what we have seen from the Republican side of \nthe aisle is the same old politics and the same old policies--policies \nthat brought us into this economic mess, and they still cling to them. \nUnfortunately, they don't reflect the reality of where America is \ntoday.\n  They say, of course, on the Republican side that the President taxes \ntoo much--taxes too much in his budget. Well, since 95 percent of \nAmericans would receive a tax cut and any tax increases are for the \nrichest Americans--\n\n[[Page S3775]]\n\nthose at the highest level of income--then apparently the Republicans \nare complaining because those who are well off might end up paying more \nin taxes.\n  Over the last several weeks we have heard quite a bit about how some \nof the wealthiest people in America are getting by and being \ncompensated. I recognize that every wealthy American hasn't contributed \nto the decline in our economy, and not every wealthy American pulls \ndown a hefty AIG bonus each year, but we are in this together. If we \nare asking sacrifice from average working families--and we are--is it \ntoo much to ask those making over $250,000 a year to pay a little bit \nmore in taxes? People making over a quarter of a million dollars a year \nwill have to pay a little bit more under President Obama's budget. That \nis a fact. Their taxes will go up. The complaints from the other side \nmust be about those tax increases, because the overwhelming majority--\n95 percent of American families--will see a tax cut, the President's \nMaking Work Pay tax cut.\n  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle seem to have no \nproblem asking middle-class American workers--people making $35,000 or \n$40,000 a year--to make wage and salary concessions when they \nrenegotiate their contracts, but if you ask those on the other side of \nthe aisle whether people making over a quarter of a million dollars a \nyear or half a million a year or $1 million a year should pay a little \nmore in taxes, they say it goes too far, it is fundamentally unfair. I \ndisagree with that point of view. What the President has proposed is \nsmart, fair, and responsible. Ninety-five percent of Americans will see \ntheir taxes go down, as long as those tax cuts are paid for.\n  To those who say that raising taxes on anyone is a sure way to ruin \nthe economy, look back to how our economy performed in the 1990s. Most \nAmericans would gladly trade the prosperity of that decade for today's \neconomy. No one in America will pay more taxes under the Obama budget \nthan they would have paid in the 1990s under the Clinton \nadministration. This budget takes a fair, responsible, and targeted \napproach to the current imbalance in our taxes.\n  Then, of course, there is the criticism on the Republican side that \nPresident Obama's budget borrows too much, borrows too much money. \nWell, let's reflect on history for a moment. Eight years ago when \nPresident George W. Bush took office, he inherited a surplus from \nPresident Clinton, a 2-year surplus when we were generating more \nrevenue than we were spending in Washington. It hadn't happened in 30 \nyears, but it happened under a Democratic President. George W. Bush \ninherited this. At the time he came to office, the sum total of the \ndebt of America, from the days of George Washington through the Clinton \nadministration, was about $5 trillion. President George W. Bush \ninherited a budget with a surplus and a $5 trillion mortgage on \nAmerica. At the end of 8 years, what did President George W. Bush and \nthe Republican administration leave us? The largest annual deficit in \nAmerican history--$1.3 trillion--and a doubling of the national debt. \nIn 8 years, President George Bush doubled all the debt accumulated by \nAmerica in the entire history of our Nation.\n  That happened on the watch of the Republicans who supported that \nPresident's policies. Now, this President, 65 days into his Presidency, \nis being accused of borrowing too much money, inheriting an economy \nflat on its back, trying to spend money and get us moving forward, and \nthe criticism from the other side is he is going to have to borrow \nmoney.\n  Where was all this worry about borrowing too much when nearly all the \nRepublicans voted to permanently repeal the estate tax, a repeal which \nwould cost the American taxpayers $1 trillion--$1 trillion--in order to \nprovide a tax break to the wealthiest three-fourths of 1 percent of \nAmericans? I can tell my colleagues, many of the same Senators who were \ncrying copious tears over the thought of going into debt were the first \nto step forward and say, Give a tax break to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica and we don't care what debt it incurs. I think their priorities \nare wrong.\n  Where was this worry about borrowing too much when the Bush \nadministration turned that Clinton surplus into the largest pile of \ndebt this Nation has ever seen? Remember Vice President Dick Cheney's \nfavorite quote: ``Reagan proved deficits don't matter.'' Well, I don't \nagree with that view. They do matter, to our kids and our grandkids. \nBut those who should have been worrying about our deficits over the \npast 8 years turned a blind eye to them. They went along with Vice \nPresident Cheney. They said deficits don't count. They refused to do \nanything, while our national debt doubled under the last Republican \nadministration, and we built up enormous debts we still owe to China \nand Japan, OPEC, and many other nations. They refused to act when our \neconomy was growing and could have easily absorbed the necessary \nchange. Now, when our economy is struggling and we need to spend the \nmoney to move forward, these same Republicans have decided that \ndeficits are bad news. They have suddenly gotten a new brand of \nreligion and they want us to end the deficits they supported in the \nfirst place. They were wrong then and they are wrong now. If we want to \nturn around the economy, now is the time for smart investments that pay \noff over the long term. We want to make sure we create jobs and \nbusiness opportunities, investing in things that will pay off for a \nlong time to come. The President spelled them out last night.\n  We know if we invest in health care in America to reduce the cost so \nthat individual families and businesses, State and local governments, \nas well as the Federal Government, have a reduced increase in the cost \nof health care each year, it will help us balance the books. President \nObama is dedicated to doing that. It will not only be good from a \nbudget viewpoint, it is good from a health care viewpoint. It makes \nhealth insurance more affordable. It makes health care more affordable. \nIt will mean that by modernizing and computerizing health records, we \nwill have a better diagnosis and we will avoid the medical errors that \nfrequently occur when information isn't gathered correctly and \ncompletely. So that investment in health care is part of President \nObama's spending, spending to bring us out of the recession the right \nway: investing in our future.\n  He also invests in energy. It wasn't that long ago we were captives \nof the oil cartels that decided how much we would pay for gasoline. It \nwent up to about $4.50 in the Midwest. In Illinois, where I am honored \nto be Senator, people were hurting. Filling a gas tank was a big deal. \nI remember pulling my little Ford pickup truck into a gas station in \nSpringfield to fill it up on the weekend and it was 60 bucks and I \ncouldn't believe it. I had never paid 60 bucks to fill up that little \ntruck, ever. That is what happened. For other folks, they had to fill \nup every other day to get back and forth to work. We were the captives \nof these oil cartels, these dictators, who were draining off hundreds \nof billions of dollars from families and businesses in America for \noverpriced oil--$120 a barrel and beyond. President Obama wants to \nbring that to an end. He wants us to move toward energy independence.\n  He wants to invest in making certain we have green energy sources, \nrenewable and sustainable, right here at home. Is that a good thing for \nthe long term? I think it is one of the best investments we can make. \nIt is the kind of smart investment we need in a budget which many of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle have rejected. They were the \nfirst to complain about gas prices. They are obviously the last to sign \nup for changing our energy economy.\n  The third area, of course, is education. I wouldn't be here today \nwithout it. Most of us have profited from education that has given us \nchances we never dreamed of. President Obama can tell that story \npersonally and many others can as well. His investment in education is \nto make sure we have better teachers, better classrooms, new libraries, \nlaboratories, buildings that will service us in the 21st century. These \nare investments that will pay off for a long time to come as our kids \nget the education they need to compete in the 21st century.\n  We will hear a lot about the budget debate next week. There will be a \nton of amendments. There always have been. Everybody has their favorite \nissue, their favorite amendment. But when it gets down to the bottom \nline,\n\n[[Page S3776]]\n\nthe question is what that budget will say about who we are and what we \nvalue. President Obama has proposed a budget that will make critical \ninvestments in our Nation's highest priorities at a time when America \nneeds them more than ever. This budget would provide a little bit of \nhelp to hard-working families who desperately need it: tax cuts, as \nlong as we pay for them, education assistance, health care, and \nalternative energy investments. That is what this budget is all about. \nThe budget restores fairness, reestablishes responsibility.\n  Incidentally, we are finally going to put in this budget the real \ncost of Iraq and Afghanistan. For 8 years the Republican administration \nignored it, wouldn't count it, said it was some mystery emergency \nspending. We know better. This budget is more honest.\n  We also realize to make smart investments--and this budget will make \na lasting impact on our country by improving our economy, that will \nbenefit our children and grandchildren for many years to come.\n  When the time comes next week, I hope my colleagues will step \nforward, be part of a new era of responsibility, be part of renewing \nAmerica's promises, promises we have made that we will show good \nstewardship in leading this country out of this recession into a bright \nday tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senator Conrad and I and Congressman \nPomeroy, our two colleagues from Minnesota, Senator Klobuchar and \nCongressman Peterson, met with President Obama just a few moments ago \nin the Vice President's Room behind the Chamber to talk about the flood \nthreat in our region. This is today's NOAA flood warning map of our \ncountry, and you will see that North Dakota is entirely green. The \ngreen represents the flood warning areas in our country. We have an \nentire State under a flood watch.\n  The headline in our State today is ``Blizzard Blasts The State.'' We \nhave a raging blizzard that has gone on now for the last day and a \nhalf. It has closed the interstate highways. We have had up to 18 \ninches of snow in some areas, and then we have unbelievable flooding \nthreats up and down the Red River and the Red River Valley of North \nDakota. Now we have an urgent flood threat that exists in Bismarck, ND, \nas I speak.\n  I think it would probably be helpful just to show a few of the \nscenes. This is piling sandbags. They have had nearly 3 million \nsandbags filled in a very short period of time with college and high \nschool students and National Guard and others in the Red River Valley \nfilling sandbags. As I said, 3 million sandbags in a very short period \nof time.\n  This is the North Dakota National Guard filling sandbags inside the \nBismarck Civic Center. Just in the last 24 hours we have seen a threat \nto the capital city--a very significant threat--and that threat is \ndescribed in this photograph. This photograph shows what is called an \nice jam. There are two ice jams at this point on the Missouri River and \nthe Knife River that flows into the Missouri River. This shows an ice \njam. As I speak, they are trying with explosives to deal with this ice \njam. There are two ice jams, and if this happens in the wrong way, and \none ice jam gives at the wrong time, we will see the entire south side \nof the capital city of Bismarck, ND, with a substantial amount of \nwater.\n  Evacuations are underway as I speak in portions of that city. The \nmayor and the Governor and others, the Corps of Engineers, virtually \neveryone is involved, and this is a very significant flood threat that \njust really in the last 24 to 48 hours has developed as a result of \nsignificant ice jams.\n  This is a city that has not had substantial flood threats since the \ndam was built on the Missouri River about 60 miles north of Bismarck, \nND. But these ice jams have completely changed the calculation and pose \na serious threat to the city of Bismarck today. There is a great deal \nof work going on in the city. I say to all of them how much we admire \nthe work they are doing. They are heroes. There are so many in the \nmilitary and volunteers who are filling sandbags and doing the work \nthat is necessary to fight that flood.\n  The Red River Valley flood--this is volunteers in the Fargodome \nfilling sandbags. As I said, several million have now been filled. It \nappears that this flood could very well top the estimates of the 1997 \nflood. In 1997, in the Red River Valley, Grand Forks, ND, a community, \nthen, of about 45,000 to 50,000 people was completely evacuated. I rode \ndown the streets of Grand Forks in a boat in a community that was \ncompletely evacuated. In the middle of that flood, the center part of \nthat downtown city caught on fire, and we had the spectacle of \nfirefighters in the middle of a flood trying to fight a fire in a \ndowntown area that had been completely evacuated.\n  This is the Red River Valley. It is completely flat, as flat as a \ntable top. You can't see a hill in any direction. So because of \nunprecedented amounts of moisture--snowfall and rainfall--and because \nall of that occurred on top of ground that last fall, when it froze up \nwas completely saturated, we now see, once again, the threat of record \nlevels of flooding.\n  This is sandbagging outside of Fargo homes in the last day or two.\n  This is flooding in Beulah, ND.\n  This is 70 to 80 miles north and west of Bismarck, ND.\n  This is a feed lot in Mandan, ND. You can't see any feed, and you \ncan't see a lot.\n  All you can see is water. This is a flooded yard in Fargo, ND. This \nis the\n\n[[Page S3777]]\n\noutskirts of Watford City, ND, which is 175 miles away from Bismarck. \nThis is what the Jamestown Airport runway looks like.\n  The point is that we face a very serious threat. The urgent threat at \nthe moment is in Bismarck, with the determination to try to solve the \nproblem with these ice jams to prevent substantial flooding in the \ncapital city. Our thoughts and prayers are certainly with the folks who \nare there today trying to do that.\n  In the Red River Valley--I will be there tomorrow and, hopefully, in \nBismarck tomorrow night--the crest is expected in Fargo, ND, on \nSaturday. Our hope is that the flood fight that is occurring there goes \nwell. Fargo has a lot of experience fighting flood waters. The mayor \nand others have done an extraordinary job over the years. They are \nbuilding earthen dikes, filling sandbags, doing all they can, in \ncoordination with FEMA, the Corps of Engineers, the National Weather \nService, the North Dakota National Guard, and others.\n  I wanted to simply explain the circumstances of why we met with the \nPresident today, spoke with the Secretary of Homeland Security \nyesterday, and why it is important. The President, by the way, said, as \nPresident Clinton did when Grand Fork was evacuated, that the point is, \nin these circumstances you are not alone. This Government of ours--at \nthe city, State, and Federal levels--brings to a flood fight a \nsubstantial amount of capability and expertise and people who know what \nthey are doing. Added to that, the volunteers from all over our \ncommunities have done an extraordinary job.\n  I spoke this morning to a person who runs what was formerly called \nthe Crippled Children's School in Jamestown, ND, which has been called \nin recent years the Ann Carlson School. Disadvantaged circumstances \nexist for the children in that school, who, when a flood comes, are not \nas mobile as others. They had to evacuate the Ann Carlson School \nyesterday. I think there were 60 to 70 children there who live in that \nschool. They had to be evacuated. Again, these are kids with a lot of \nneeds. They had 75 young student athletes show up from the high schools \nand colleges, and in 4 hours they evacuated that school. They had to \ntake the beds and all of the special equipment those children need. In \n4 hours, all those young athletes did that. The fellow who runs that \nschool told me it was extraordinary to see how many showed up to say: \nLet us help you. So there is a lot going on.\n  I am going to travel to both the Red River Valley and to Bismarck. I \nwanted my colleagues to understand the circumstances. Again, to put the \nfirst chart back up, you will see that today's NOAA estimate of our \ncountry shows that our entire State is under a flood threat. It has \nbeen an extraordinary winter. Even as we have this threat, there is a \nraging blizzard that is shutting down interstate highways in our State \nand is dropping as much as 18 inches of snow. It has been a tough time.\n  North Dakotans are pretty resilient people. We will get through this. \nI wanted to tell my colleagues about this and about why I met with the \nPresident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/25/senate-section/article/S3777-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                188TH ANNIVERSARY OF GREEK INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Greek Independence \nDay. My home state of Nevada is home to one of the most vibrant Greek \ncommunities in the United States, and I am pleased to join in \ncelebration with my fellow Nevadans and Greek Americans all around our \ncountry on this 188th anniversary of the independence of Greece.\n  The political and philosophical legacy of ancient Greece is the very \ncornerstone upon which our great experiment in American democracy \nrests, and the United States and Greece share a proud history of \ncooperation and friendship. Our two countries joined together as allies \nin every major international conflict throughout the 20th century, and \nthe valiant contribution of the Greeks to the Allied effort in World \nWar II in particular cannot be understated.\n  Today, Greek Americans join together in celebrations both religious \nand secular, as Greek Independence Day coincides with the Greek \nOrthodox Church's celebration of the Festival of the Annunciation. As \nfamilies gather to honor their Hellenic heritage with festive parades, \nprominent displays of the Greek flag, and preparation of traditional \nfoods, I invite my fellow United States Senators to join me in \ncongratulating the Greek Americans who have so enriched our country \nwith their many contributions.\n  Earlier this week, I was pleased to support Senate Resolution 82, \nwhich passed the Senate by unanimous consent, and recognizes the 188th \nanniversary of the independence of Greece and celebrates Greek and \nAmerican democracy. The strong partnership between the United States \nand Greece has prospered for nearly two centuries, and I look forward \nto many more years of friendship between our countries.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today marks a truly cherished day for the \nGreek people, Greek-Americans and for all the friends of Greece around \nthe globe. It is the 188th anniversary of the day in 1821 when the \npeople of Greece declared independence from the Ottoman Empire, \nsignaling the beginning of the end of centuries of political, \nreligious, and cultural repression of their proud and ancient culture. \nIt took a further 8 years of heroic struggle before Greece secured its \nfull independence.\n  Americans have long recognized that the ideals which guided our own \nstruggle for independence--liberty, democracy, and human dignity--were \nalso the foundation for Greece's declaration of sovereignty. The United \nStates and Greece were thus destined to become not only faithful allies \nbut close friends. Nearly two centuries after the rebirth of Greek \nindependence, our two nations and their citizens are bound by ever-\nstrengthening bonds which link us through both a shared heritage of \ndemocratic values and a modern alignment of strategic interests.\n  Just as there is much to celebrate in the 188 years of modern \nGreece's independence, there are many challenges which it faces in the \n21st century. Ongoing provocations by Turkey in the Aegean and \nirredentist actions by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia thwart \nGreece's quest for a stable southeastern Europe free of past centuries' \noften cataclysmic territorial adventurism. Ankara's continuing \npersecution of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople--the \nleader of Greek Orthodox Christians around the world--and illegal \noccupation of the north of Cyprus remain an outrageous affront not only \nto Hellenes but to people everywhere who believe in human rights.\n  Therefore, on this anniversary of Greek independence, let us not only \ncelebrate and congratulate our friends in Greece but also rededicate \nourselves to strengthening the relationship that exists between our two \ngreat nations, so as to defend its foundational principles and ensure \nits vitality in the centuries to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/25/senate-section/article/S3777-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3777-S3778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO EDWARD R. WARD\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a member \nof our Armed Forces from my home State of Kentucky, 1LT Edward R. \n``Eddie'' Ward, who is being inducted posthumously into the U.S. Army \nAviation Association of America's Order of Saint Michael.\n  Established in 1900, the Order of St. Michael recognizes individuals \nwho have contributed significantly to the promotion of Army aviation. \nThose selected have demonstrated the standards of integrity and moral \ncharacter, displayed an outstanding degree of professional competence, \nand served the U.S. Army aviation or civilian aviation community with \ndistinction. There are three levels of the Order of St. Michael--\nBronze, Silver, and Gold. First Lieutenant Ward is receiving Gold, the \ntop level, which is awarded when an individual exhibits the highest \nvalues of honesty and ethical character.\n  Ward first enlisted in the Army in 1901 at the age of 19. Six years \nlater, at the age of 25, he was assigned by the signal officer of the \nArmy to take charge of ``. . . all matters pertaining to military \nballooning, air machines, and all kindred subjects.'' Ward became the \nfirst noncommissioned officer of the enlisted nucleus that eventually \nevolved into the present-day Aviation Branch of the Army.\n\n[[Page S3778]]\n\n  His career was comprised of a great deal of leadership. He headed the \nteam that uncrated and prepared the Wright aircraft for military trials \nat Fort Omaha. He also served at several air schools including Fort \nOmaha and the Philippines Air School. However the majority of his \ncareer was spent in the Aeronautic Branch of the Signal Corps until his \nretirement from the armed forces in 1930.\n  The Order of St. Michael uses the story of St. Michael defeating the \ndragon to exemplify the bravery and gallantry associated with the \naviation soldier and the boldness and swiftness of aviation on the \nbattlefield. Edward Ward was a true Kentuckian and an American hero who \nepitomizes the heroism and courage told in this story. He was a prime \nexample of the brave and dedicated soldiers that make our military the \nbest in the world.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in recognizing 1LT \nEdward R. Ward's dedication to our military and our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/25/senate-section/article/S3778-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   OMNIBUS PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today, Congress can be very proud of a \nvery significant accomplishment.\n  Because today, Congress stood up for the enjoyment and protection of \nsome of our nation's most pristine and breathtaking wilderness areas, \nhistorical sites, national parks, forests, trails, scenic rivers, and \noceans. This bill will help our country address the impacts of climate \nchange on our coastal areas, and provide educational opportunities for \nour Nation's children.\n  Today, the U.S. House of Representatives will pass the Omnibus Public \nLand Management Act of 2009 one of the most sweeping conservation bills \nthat Congress has passed in many years.\n  It is a huge victory for the generations of Americans who enjoy these \nsites each year.\n  It is a huge victory for our American heritage.\n  And, it is a huge victory for Washington State.\n  This bill has been through many twists and turns over the last year.\n  But today's successful vote could not have been possible without the \ntenacity and dedication of Majority Leader Reid.\n  I thank the majority leader for his steadfast support and dedication \nto seeing that these important public land and ocean priorities became \nlaw.\n  Today, I would like to highlight some of the provisions in this bill \nthat I am especially pleased to see go to the President's desk.\n  First, this package includes the Snoqualmie Pass Land Conveyance Act, \nwhich I sponsored. This bill would transfer an acre and a half of \nForest Service land to the Snoqualmie Pass Fire District to help them \nbuild a new fire station.\n  For decades, the Fire District has been leasing its current site from \nthe Forest Service. They operate out of an aging building that was not \ndesigned to be a fire station.\n  While they have been able to serve their community despite this \nbuilding's many shortcomings, the time has come for us to pay them back \nfor their hard work and dedication. With traffic on the rise and the \nneed for emergency services in the area growing, the Fire District \nneeds to move to a true fire station and this bill will finally help \nthem do that.\n  Second, the Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail Designation Act is \nincluded in this bill.\n  Since 2001, I have been working with communities in Central and \nEastern Washington, the National Park Service, and community \nstakeholders to create an Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail \nthrough portions of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana.\n  Visitors to the trail will not only provide an important economic \nboost to central and eastern Washington communities, but they will \nlearn about an amazing, and often overlooked, part of our region's \nhistory.\n  You see, most people don't know that during the last Ice Age, when a \nglacial lake in Montana formed and deepened enough, the sheer force of \nthe backed up water undermined the glacial ice-dam. And, the ice gave \nway in a cracking explosion.\n  The huge lake, bigger than all the rivers of the world today \ncombined, was released all at once and carved its way through the \nPacific Northwest. This changed the region's geography. But these \ncataclysmic floods have been a story that's gone largely untold. \nBecause of this bill, more people will know this important part of \nPacific Northwest history.\n  Third, this package includes my Pacific Northwest National Scenic \nTrail Act.\n  The Pacific Northwest Trail runs from the Continental Divide to the \nPacific Coast, is 1,200 miles long, and is one of the most pristine and \nbreathtaking trails in the world.\n  This carefully chosen path runs through the Rocky Mountains, Selkirk \nMountains, Pasayten Wilderness, North Cascades, Olympic Mountains, and \nWilderness Coast.\n  From beginning to end it passes through three states. It crosses \nthree National Parks. And it winds through seven National Forests.\n  Finally, this trail will receive the designation is deserves.\n  This package also includes my Wildland Firefighter Safety \nlegislation.\n  Wildland firefighting and the safety of wildland firefighters is \nvitally important to our brave men and women who battle these blazes, \nand for the communities that depend on them. This legislation will \nimprove accountability and transparency in wildland firefighter safety \ntraining programs.\n  Through training and certification we can lower the risk to the brave \nmen and women who protect our forests and communities. It's critical \nthat Congress is actively engaged to make sure this happens.\n  I would also like to mention the three provisions in this package \naimed and conserving and protecting our nation's oceans and the \ncommunities that depend on them.\n  This is particularly important in these days of economic turmoil, as \nmillions of Americans depend directly and indirectly on healthy oceans \nand coasts.\n  Also, as our climate changes, we must work to address some of the \nissues that have the potential to affect millions of jobs.\n  That is why I was thankful that Majority Leader Reid included several \nprovisions in this package that address our oceans.\n  I am particularly thrilled about the Federal Ocean Acidification \nResearch and Monitoring Act.\n  The world's oceans are absorbing roughly 22 million tons of carbon \ndioxide every day, causing seawater chemistry to become more acidic \npossibly withholding the basic chemical building blocks needed by many \nmarine organisms.\n  This act creates a comprehensive national ocean acidification \nresearch and monitoring program that will take a hard look at the \ndevastating impacts greenhouse gas emissions are having on our oceans.\n  All of this could not have been accomplished without the strong \nsupport and hard work and dedication of the majority leader and I thank \nthe leader for successfully moving these priorities.\n  Today is a proud day for Congress, for Washington State, for our \nworld's ocean and marine environments, and for some of the most \nbreathtaking views and important legacies this Nation has to offer.\n  Because the steps we have taken in this package will protect our \nlands, our coastal areas, and our first responders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/25/senate-section/article/S3778-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3778-S3779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNNECESARY KILLING OF BABY SEALS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Collins and I submitted \nSenate Resolution 84, urging the Government of Canada to end the \nsenseless and inhumane slaughter of seals off the east coast of Canada.\n  To reiterate, on March 18, 2009, just weeks before its hunting season \nwas scheduled to begin, Russia announced that it would ban the hunting \nand killing of baby seals. Youri Trutnev, Russia's Minister of Natural \nResources, who was quoted in the New York Times last week, graphically \ndepicted the shameful practice, saying: ``The bloody sight of the \nhunting of seals, the slaughter of these defenseless animals, which you \ncannot even call a real hunt, is banned in our country, just as well as \nin most developed countries.''\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\n  In addition, the Internal Markets and Consumer Protection Committee, \nIMCO, of the European Parliament approved a prohibition on trade in \nseal products in the European Union. This measure may now be considered \nby the full European Parliament in the coming months.\n  Yet, in Canada, the largest commercial slaughter of marine mammals in \nthe world continues. According to the Humane Society of the United \nStates, HSUS, over one million seals have been killed over the past 4 \nyears. In Canada, seal pups as young as 12 days old can legally be \nkilled. The vast majority of seals killed in these hunts are between 12 \ndays and 12 weeks of age.\n  Canada has officially opened another seal hunting season, paving the \nway for hundreds of thousands of baby seals to be killed for their fur \nin the coming weeks, when the harp seal hunt begins in earnest. I am \npleased to have been joined by Senator Collins in submitting this \nresolution that urges the Government of Canada to end this senseless \nand inhumane slaughter.\n  The U.S. Government has opposed this senseless slaughter, as noted in \nthe January 19, 2005, letter from the U.S. Department of State, in \nresponse to a letter Senator Collins and I wrote to President Bush, \nurging him to raise this issue during his November 30, 2004, visit with \nCanadian Prime Minister Paul Martin. The letter reads, in part, as \nfollows: ``The United States has made known to the Government of Canada \nits objections and the objections of concerned American legislators and \ncitizens to the Canadian commercial seal hunt on numerous occasions \nover recent years. The United States has also opposed Canada's efforts \nwithin the Arctic Council to promote trade in sealskins and other \nmarine mammal products.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the New York Times article of \nMarch 19, 2009, entitled ``Russia to Ban Hunting Baby Seals'' be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  Russia To Ban Hunting of Baby Seals\n\n                  (By A.G. Sulzberger, Mar. 19, 2009)\n\n       Russia announced on Wednesday that it would ban the hunting \n     of baby seals, effectively shutting one of the world's \n     largest hunting grounds in the controversial trade in seal \n     fur.\n       The decision is yet another blow to an age-old industry \n     that has been losing a public relations battle in recent \n     years to animal-rights groups, who have gained public support \n     by using stark photographs of harp seal pups less than a \n     month old being clubbed to death on blood-stained ice flows.\n       In addition, the European Union is considering a ban of all \n     seal products--similar to one that the United States adopted \n     decades ago--which would eliminate a key trade route and end \n     market for the furs. And even in Canada, where the world's \n     largest seal hunt is scheduled to begin later this month and \n     top leaders vigorously defend the industry, a legislator for \n     the first time introduced a proposal to curtail sealing.\n       ``It's highly significant,'' Rebecca Aldworth, director of \n     Humane Society International in Canada, said of the political \n     developments. ``It shows that world opinion is moving away \n     from commercial seal hunting. There's hope on the horizon \n     that this may be the last year that we ever have to witness \n     this cruelty.''\n       In Russia, where the number of new pups has dropped sharply \n     in recent years because of the hunts as well as shrinking ice \n     in the White Sea, the government initially announced a ban on \n     the killing of the very youngest and most highly prized \n     seals, known as ``whitecoats.'' The seals shed the white fur \n     in about two weeks, with the resulting silver coat also \n     coveted.\n       But the government announced in unsparing language that it \n     intended to extend the ban to include all seals less than a \n     year old. (While adult seals are also hunted in smaller \n     quantities, their coarse, scarred fur is generally not used \n     in clothing.) The move, publicly backed by Prime Minister \n     Vladimir V. Putin and coming just weeks before the hunting \n     season was to begin, could save as many as 35,000 seals, \n     according to a spokesman for the International Fund for \n     Animal Welfare.\n       The Associated Press quoted the natural resources minister, \n     Yuri Trutnev, as saying in a statement: ``The bloody sight of \n     the hunting of seals, the slaughter of these defenseless \n     animals, which you cannot even call a real hunt, is banned in \n     our country, just as well as in most developed countries, and \n     this is a serious step to protect the biodiversity of the \n     Russian Federation.''\n       Masha Vorontsova, the head of the International Fund for \n     Animal Welfare in Russia and a biologist who has been pushing \n     for a ban since the fall of the Soviet Union, credited an \n     outpouring of public support for ending the hunt. ``It's a \n     fantastic achievement,'' she said.\n       In contrast, Gail Shea, Canada's Minister of Fisheries and \n     Oceans, did little to disguise her frustration at moves \n     taking aim at the industry both abroad and at home, which she \n     attributed to ``mistruths and propaganda'' spread by special \n     interest groups. ``For some reason the European Union will \n     not recognize what the actual facts are because it's an \n     emotional issue and a political issue,'' she said in an \n     interview.\n       Ms. Shea, who earlier flew to Europe to lobby against a \n     European Union ban, warned that such a move could violate \n     international trade law. An industry spokesman said that \n     nearly all Canadian seal products passed through Europe on \n     their way to major consumers like Norway, Russia and China. \n     It is unclear whether Russia will also ban the import and \n     sale of seal products.\n       Commercial sealing also takes place in a handful of other \n     counties, including Norway, Greenland and Namibia. In Canada, \n     last year's catch of 207,000 seals--or roughly one in every \n     five pups born that year--earned the roughly 6,000 licensed \n     sealers a total of $7 million, down from $33 million in 2006, \n     according to Phil Jenkins, a spokesman for the Canadian \n     fisheries department. The hunting decreased, he said, largely \n     because of a sharp drop in prices for the pelts, from $97 to \n     $33, for a perfect specimen. Seals are killed by rifle or by \n     club.\n       The harp seal population level has held steady at about 5.6 \n     million for the last decade, he said, but anti-sealing groups \n     contest that figure.\n       However, the Canadian industry came under rare official \n     scrutiny last week, when Mac Harb, a senator from Ontario, \n     introduced the legislation to cancel the coming hunt. He \n     argued that the industry was dying, propped up by public tax \n     dollars and costing Canada international good will. But his \n     proposal died when Mr. Harb could not get another member to \n     second his motion.\n       ``There was silence. Total silence!'' he said in a \n     telephone interview on Wednesday. ``I was amazed that not one \n     of my colleagues, from any one of the political parties, \n     would even want to debate the issue.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/25/senate-section/article/S3779-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3779-S3781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am a Meridian resident, who works in Boise, an 8-mile \n     commute for me. I own a 2003 Dodge Dakota, and it was my \n     commuter vehicle until a couple months back. It has a fuel \n     capacity of 23 gallons. Before I stopped driving my truck, it \n     was costing me about $160 per month in gas . . . just for me \n     to get to and from work--8 miles away. That is before gas \n     went over $4/gallon. The reason I do not have to drive my \n     truck anymore, is because my wife got a new job in Boise, a \n     mile from my workplace, and we are now able to carpool \n     together in her car, a 2003 Mazda 6. Previously, she worked \n     in Meridian, just a couple miles from our home. My wife hates \n     driving the truck, which is why I drove it, instead of her.\n       Since my wife got her new job nearly two months ago, my \n     truck has just sat in the garage. I filled it up 6-8 weeks \n     ago--and it still has the same full tank of gas. It hasn't \n     moved an inch. How can I afford to move it, when it only gets \n     12-16 mpg, and gas is now hovering between $4.10-$4.15 a \n     gallon? If I was still driving my truck to work, it would now \n     be costing about $200 a month just to commute back and forth \n     to work. Ridiculous. So my truck sits and waits for something \n     to cause fuel prices to go down.\n       Now for the possible solution I read about the other day. \n     SwiftFuel: I saw a blurb on it on the website, http://\nslashdot.org, which had a link to a full article by Robert X. \n     Cringly on PBS' website. Basically, SwiftFuel is made from \n     ethanol, but contains no ethanol. It is currently being \n     tested by the FAA as a replacement fuel for the current lead \n     based aviation fuels, which must cease to exist in 2010. It \n     has a higher octane rating (about 104); has more energy per \n     gallon, which results in a 15-20 percent increase in fuel \n     efficiency; can be run on existing engines without \n     modification; can be stored in the same\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\n     tanks and shipped in the same pipelines as gasoline; and \n     since it is a biomass, has a net 0 carbon footprint on the \n     environment. Oh, the ethanol used to make it--it is not \n     produced from corn. It is produced from sorghum which \n     produces six times more ethanol than corn, per acre. No \n     higher food costs from the production of its ethanol. \n     Currently, SwiftFuel costs about $1.80 to produce, and we can \n     make it right here, in the good ol' U. S. of A.\n       Obviously, this is just one article, and one side. But if \n     most of what this article claims is true, this could be a \n     very viable, quick remedy to breaking our addiction to oil. \n     Everyone could benefit from it immediately, without having to \n     buy new cars, or paying for expensive modifications. I think \n     it deserves a very serious look from the Government, and I \n     hope you will encourage other lawmakers to look into it.\n       If it makes it to our local pumps, my Dakota can come out \n     of the garage and play.\n     Jared.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for all you are doing to keep energy prices, \n     costs, and options open.\n       Our family is spread all over the country because we gave \n     them wings to fly. Giving them independence sometimes means \n     higher costs for visits. When my husband and I married in \n     1967, the Viet Nam War was the countries overseas \n     involvement. Since then so many, many more overseas events \n     have affected our society.\n       Being part of a world economy is a challenge. I think our \n     country will be challenged beyond our wildest dreams and \n     people from all over the world will be meeting our \n     expectations of being like us. That is not all good. One of \n     the things is energy and high cost of traveling. Staying \n     close to home will be the only option for most people in our \n     world and probably not a bad thing.\n       I would hope that other energy options will finally come \n     out and be fully embraced by the government with incentives \n     and with financial responsibilities that all Americans can \n     understand and live with.\n       We will need another post World War II plan of some sort to \n     put people to work, give them self esteem to continue to work \n     things out.\n       With our medical crisis, overseas wars, and societal \n     morality issues we face a time of great challenge!\n       I hope that you and others in Washington will take the time \n     off and spend time at home and have smaller salaries so we as \n     Americans can have examples of sacrifice and fiscal \n     responsibly.\n       Thank you for your service to our state and our country. I \n     look forward to the next four years and hopefully we will \n     have a more responsible White House and legislative sessions!\n     Nancy.\n                                  ____\n\n       As you have heard from many sources, the high energy costs \n     are providing difficult choices: food or gas, rent or gas, \n     mortgage or gas, utilities or gas, medicine or gas, etc. I \n     just read the results of a survey that indicated that 76% of \n     respondents say that the country is headed the wrong way. \n     This is not only a White House issue. This is a White House \n     and Congress issue. All I see reported is finger pointing; \n     one party blaming the other or the White House. It is time to \n     put aside partisan bickering and seek for bipartisan \n     solutions. OPEC is creating a false supply shortage due to \n     lack of daily production. Oil companies must share the blame.\n       Refineries are creating a false supply shortage by not \n     producing to their capacity. They post record profits but do \n     nothing to increase refinery capacity or build new \n     refineries. Oil production in the United States can and must \n     increase.\n       Conservation by the American people is a must. A change in \n     my driving habits has resulted in a 3 miles per gallon \n     increase. I drive twenty miles a day to and from work. One \n     road posts 65 mph. I drive 55 mph. I coast up to stop signs \n     where safely possible. Where safely possible, I drive 55 \n     miles per hour instead of 65, or 65 instead of 75. One can \n     only imagine what would happen if every driver in America \n     would increase their miles per gallon by changing driving \n     habits.\n       Demand would definitely decrease which should have a \n     positive effect on supply. But, unfortunately, the American \n     people will not conserve on their own. The congress must \n     force conservation. During the early 1970s, America faced an \n     oil crisis. One of the measures the government instituted was \n     lowering the speed limit to 55 miles per hour. Not only did \n     this action reduce demand, it saved lives. This seems to be \n     an inexpensive option. The only cost to the government, as I \n     see it, is in putting up new speed limit signs.\n       The interesting thing to me is that the American public \n     have driven one billion miles less this year compared to last \n     year, yet the price of gas continues to rise. It makes one \n     wonder what kind of coalition has be created to keep supply \n     down and prices up in spite of the minimal conservation \n     efforts of the American people. Does anything the American \n     people say really carry any weight with our government?\n       I know that this is a complex problem. Some stop-gap \n     measures need to be put in place while long-term solutions \n     are reached. Now would be a good time for Congress to step up \n     to the plate and hit a grand slam to win the game for the \n     American people.\n     R.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to share my concern about the \n     rising energy costs in our country. I have a 2001 Toyota \n     Camry and when I first bought the car it cost between $12 and \n     $15 to fill the tank. Last Friday I filled it and it was \n     $56.03! From $15 to $56, and the news says the price of gas \n     is still rising!\n       In the past, whenever something was totally out of control \n     in our country, we could count on our leaders to do something \n     about it. Gas prices have gone up before (but never to this \n     extent) and then came back down? I always felt safe and \n     secure in the United States but now things seem to be totally \n     out of control. Where are our leaders/Senate? What are they \n     doing to help us? With the extremely high gas prices \n     everything else is going up, too. So much so that we all are \n     being forced to cut back everywhere else--even in critical \n     areas such as food and/or medicine. Living in Idaho does not \n     give me an option on not driving my car to work and I have to \n     work in order to survive. I do not want to quit work and be \n     supported by welfare, or any other assistance, simply because \n     I cannot get to work. I am disabled and cannot ride a bicycle \n     to work (which will not work in Idaho during the winter, \n     either).\n       After a horrific divorce, I struggled many, many years as a \n     single woman to get my feet on the ground and be self-\n     sufficient. It terrifies me to think that security can easily \n     be taken away from me\n       Where in the world did the United States ever get the \n     notion we could be dependent on foreign countries for energy? \n     That is absolutely ridiculous! We are supposed to be the \n     leader of the free world, not depending on other countries to \n     survive. We have resources on our own soil so why are we not \n     using them? What is happening with the reserve oil? As the \n     Senate, I implore you to please do something to stop the \n     rising gas prices and get them lowered again!\n     Connie, Post Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a non-traditional student at BSU. I depend on grants \n     and loans to attend college and only work part-time as a \n     tutor on campus. I live relatively close to campus so I can \n     walk or take the bus if need be, but so far I have not had \n     to. The real story I wanted to share is why I am not bothered \n     with the rising prices of gas as much as everyone else seems \n     to be.\n       I was in the US Army from 1968 to 1972 and served in \n     Germany from the fall of 1968 to the spring of 1970. Gas \n     prices in Germany, at that time, after converting from the \n     old Mark to US dollars, were about $3.65 a gallon. We have \n     been very fortunate to have cheap prices for as long as we \n     have. Now it is our turn to pay up.\n       I would say to Congress: Shame on you for not allowing the \n     drilling of more oil reserves in those areas of our country \n     that have it, for you are keeping us dependent upon OPEC and \n     keep us at the mercy of their pocket book needs. I also would \n     ask Congress to seriously consider tholium research to \n     replace uranium in our reactors, for it is considerably more \n     economical, safer for the environment and would go a long way \n     to promote anti-proliferation by terrorists.\n     Kermit.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband works in construction. The good news is: He has \n     had job after job out at the nuclear site west of Idaho \n     Falls. The bad news is: Construction workers do not get to \n     ride the buses. They have to drive out themselves, unless \n     they are lucky enough to work for a company that carpools \n     their men in a company truck. That is not happening right \n     now. Gary drives out to work every day. Even with a fuel \n     stipend to offset his gas purchases each week, we are going \n     in deeper and deeper because of the rising fuel prices. I am \n     sure construction companies can only afford to offset just so \n     much for their employees. It will cap out and we will be left \n     making up the difference. After all, we have to keep Gary \n     working. For my job, I travel the upper Snake River Valley, \n     making visits in the homes of adult clients with \n     developmental disabilities. I am required by the state \n     Medicaid to make these monthly visits. I drive a fairly fuel \n     efficient vehicle, but again, our miscellaneous expense \n     budget has been hacked by increases expense at the fuel pump.\n       I am so hoping the government will explore and implement \n     domestic oil production. Get these foreign countries off our \n     backs! They are grinding the faces of the American citizen \n     into the pavement. Of course, I am in favor of expanded \n     nuclear energy research. We here in southeast Idaho have \n     grown up with the nuclear site in our backyard. Incentives \n     for conservation may help, but do not let too much red tape \n     bind the effectiveness of the incentive or companies will not \n     feel it is worth it. I repeat, the environmentalists have had \n     their day and now we are suffering for it. They need to quiet \n     down and let business address the issues of the American \n     family trying to survive in the United States.\n       Thank you for your interest in our story.\n     Gary and Jana.\n                                  ____\n\n       The increase in prices caused by an increase in demand is \n     not a valid cause for increasing the pressure put on the \n     environment by our society's increasing demand for high \n     quality energy. The price increase is a result of \n     capitalism--imagine that, the U.S. has promoted a change in \n     world economy to be more like ours and it has worked. More \n     demand translates to higher prices. The stock brokers are now \n     speculating on energy futurs.\n       So the solution is efficiency. Start carpooling. The demand \n     could be reduced if people rode together to work and school \n     in their current vehicles. As new vehicles are purchased, \n     energy efficient machines could be\n\n[[Page S3781]]\n\n     purchased instead of the CAFE loop-hole SUVs that the current \n     federal government still subsidizes. Also the speed limit \n     could be reduced. Yes, all the machines on the freeways are \n     more efficient at lower speeds. It is just physics. Then \n     reduce the need for energy by reducing the demand for AC and \n     Heating because of the unrealistic size of homes. Start \n     programs to subsidize development of solar electric to AC \n     systems in the sunbelt of the U.S. Such a program would \n     significantly reduce the electric grid demand.\n       The answer to the impact of energy prices could be altered \n     immediately through conservation, not 5 years from now by \n     increases in exploration.\n     Dale, Coeur d'Alene.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are writing to express our complete exasperation with \n     the U.S. Congress' inaction on vital energy questions or \n     maybe it is a not so subtle attempt to ruin our way of life. \n     We and our neighbors live about 70 miles from adequate \n     shopping and medical services. We spend about $30 for \n     gasoline for each round trip. Ours is a poor, rural community \n     where many people have to commute long distances to work and \n     whose budgets are being wrecked by the current cost of \n     gasoline and diesel fuel. Being a community of mostly self-\n     sufficient, hardworking people who do not have time to \n     publicly complain or demonstrate, we seldom have the \n     opportunity to be heard. We appreciate your invitation to let \n     us express our frustrations.\n       We believe that election year politics is important but \n     that an issue so vital as energy supplies should be something \n     that our representatives should agree upon. Have we reached a \n     point where the elite of our society are so powerful that the \n     pain felt by everyday citizens is of no importance when \n     balanced against their idealistic agendas?\n       I am a retired engineer with adequate retirement reserves, \n     and $4 a gallon gasoline will not bankrupt me. Most of my \n     neighbors are not so fortunate and will be strapped to ever \n     achieve adequate retirement finances if fuel costs and the \n     increased cost of products due to fuel costs are not \n     addressed. The ability to save is being destroyed for the \n     average citizen by increased fuel costs.\n       Again, thank you for the opportunity to state my opinions. \n     I hope that you will do all that is possible for you to do to \n     ease this burden. We are in favor of drilling for oil both in \n     ANWR and offshore. We are also in favor of nuclear energy. It \n     is the fuel of the future and again we are letting a few \n     loudmouthed elitists dictate policy and add to the hardships \n     of the people who make the country work.\n     Karen and Roy, Orofino.\n                                  ____\n\n       I suspect that you have heard quite a few stories about how \n     rising energy costs have impacted Idahoans lives. I want to \n     tell you how mine has been changed. I work at the INL (Idaho \n     National Laboratory) for the CCP (Central Characterization \n     Project) on the ICP (Idaho Cleanup Project). I tried riding \n     the bus service that the site has provided for decades. At \n     the end of last year, the fuel prices prompted a change in \n     the cost of a bus pass from approx $11 a week--more than \n     doubling (I believe) to almost $23 a week. I no longer ride \n     the bus but ride with a co-worker who has been forced to \n     drive because it is cheaper for he and his wife who both work \n     on the ICP to drive than to ride the bus. He is gracious and \n     insists that I do not pay my share of fuel costs or the \n     maintenance on his car. I have filled the car's fuel tank \n     twice, and each time I was caught off guard by my upset wife \n     telling me that the lack of that money was going to cut down \n     on food and other things that we have necessity for in our \n     home. I have been very blessed by the hands of God in which \n     our country and state reside. My family has never gone \n     hungry, but I truly have to hope now that we never will. If \n     there can be a way to improve the value of the dollar, to \n     lower the price in gas (or even maintain it at the ridiculous \n     price that it is currently at), then myself and many other \n     Idahoans and Americans would be greatly appreciative. I \n     continue to support those who are making wise decisions for \n     the people of the United States, and continue to pray to God \n     that he will preserve me and my family from harder times.\n     Stephan.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I both are retired. We recently bought a \n     Silverado pick-up in February, almost $32,000. Do you think \n     we would have bought that had we seen the gas crisis coming? \n     Heavens no! We were going to buy a travel trailer for it to \n     hitch and explore our nation. That thought is completely \n     gone. We have six children, three of whom are married with \n     children, with double incomes to make ends meet. Now, that is \n     all we can do--make ends meet. We are all surviving and, \n     thank God, we are a resourceful nation. We bought a 32 mpg \n     Chevy, and one son bought a motorcycle to commute to work, \n     but we just do not go shopping. We are all making it, but \n     groceries and gasoline seem to be taking our checks. I am \n     worried about the other businesses of our nation who have \n     depended a bit on our incomes.

Mr. President, as we heard in testimony before the \nSenate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship last week, auto \ndealerships are struggling to sell cars in this difficult economy. One \nof our witnesses remarked that in a healthy economy, auto sales make up \napproximately 20 percent of our country's retail spending. Clearly, a \nhealthy automobile industry is critical to our economic success. I rise \nthis week to recognize Hartley Chrysler Dodge Jeep GMC, an outstanding \nauto dealership from my home State of Maine that has remained true to \nits longstanding commitment to serving its customers and its community, \nregardless of economic conditions.\n  Located in the central Maine town of Newport, Hartley's Chrysler \nDodge Jeep GMC is a second-generation family-owned small business. \nHartley's opened its doors in 1946, when Perley Hartley began selling \nused vehicles from a filling station in the neighboring town of \nCorinna. In 1960, the dealership started selling new cars, adding \nChrysler and Plymouth as its first automobile lines.\n  A year after graduating from Eastern Maine Community College in the \nearly 1970s, Steven H. Hartley, now the company's president, went to \nwork for his father in the sales department at Hartley Motors in the \ntown of Dexter. He eventually bought the original dealership from his \nuncle Perley and took over operations in 1983, when he moved the \nbusiness to its current location in Newport. Since then, Steven Hartley \nhas ensured that the dealership is profitable every year. For the \ncompany's dedicated work, Hartley's received Daimler/Chrysler's five-\nstar elite dealership status in 2005, an honor held by only two \ndealerships across Maine.\n  Mr. Hartley donates his time to promoting the well-being of the \nentire auto dealer industry throughout Maine and New England. He is a \nformer director of the New England Chrysler Ad Association, and \npresently serves as a director on the New England Dodge Ad Association. \nMr. Hartley also contributes his time and talents as a Director at the \nMaine Auto Dealers, and a trustee for the Maine Auto Dealers health and \ninsurance trust.\n  In addition to his business and professional accomplishments, Steven \nHartley is a Master Mason and a member of the Shriners. Additionally, \nMr. Hartley has served for 20 years as a volunteer firefighter for the \nCorinna Fire Department, even attaining the rank of department chief. \nLate last year, he was one of just 49 automobile dealers out of more \nthan 19,500 nationwide that were nominated for the TIME Magazine Dealer \nof the Year award. Through this nomination, he garnered national \nrecognition at the National Automobile Dealers Association Convention \nand Exposition in January, where he was honored by TIME and the \nGoodyear Tire and Rubber Company for his honorable community \ncontributions and his service to the auto dealer industry.\n  Driving his dealership to a whole new level of success, Steven \nHartley has led Hartley's Chrysler Dodge Jeep GMC to the top of the \nindustry and the forefront of the community. Entrepreneurs like Mr. \nHartley are striving to ensure that our Nation's auto dealerships are \nhere to stay, and we owe them a debt of gratitude. Congratulations to \nSteven H. Hartley on his most recent accolades, and I wish everyone at \nHartley's Chrysler Dodge Jeep GMC a prosperous year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/25/senate-section/article/S3781-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/25/senate-section/article/S3781-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3781-S3782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S3782]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/25/senate-section/article/S3782-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3782-S3783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-1089.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the Republic \n     of the Philippines, forwarded by the Acting Assistant \n     Secretary, Bureau of Legislative Affairs, Department of \n     State, expressing the sense of the Senate to thank the United \n     States Congress for the approval of the Conference Report on \n     the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which \n     provides the amount of one hundred ninety-eight million \n     dollars for the benefit of eligible Filipino veterans; to the \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                           Resolution No. 161\n\n       Whereas, then President of the United States Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt issued a military order on 26 July 1941, calling \n     into service the organized military forces of the country \n     under the command of General Douglas MacArthur to fight with \n     the American soldiers in World War II;\n       Whereas, President Roosevelt's military order stated that, \n     ``As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United \n     States, I hereby call and order into service of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States for the period of the existing \n     emergency, and place under the command of a General Officer, \n     United States Army, to be designated by the Secretary of War \n     from time to time, all of the organized military forces of \n     the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines'':\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\n       Whereas, on February 20, 1946, then President Harry Truman \n     affirmed the status of these Filipino veterans as ``nationals \n     of the United States'' who ``fought, as American nationals, \n     under the American flag, and under the direction of our \n     military leaders'';\n       Whereas, President Truman likewise recognized that they \n     ``fought with gallantry and courage under most difficult \n     conditions'';\n       Whereas, regrettably, on 18 February and 17 May 1946, the \n     First and Second Supplemental Surplus Appropriation \n     Rescission Acts, collectively known as the Rescission Acts of \n     1946, were enacted, preventing our veterans from receiving \n     benefits which were previously granted to them;\n       Whereas, our veterans have been fighting for more than six \n     decades for the restoration of their honor and the \n     recognition of their dignity as soldiers who fought with the \n     Americans during World War II;\n       Whereas, previous administrations, starting from former \n     President Elpidio Quirino, including Philippine Ambassadors \n     to the United States, have continuously exerted collective \n     efforts for the realization of this goal;\n       Whereas, on June 2007, members of the United States \n     Congress expressed their support for the passage of a \n     legislative measure reversing, the ill effects the Rescission \n     Acts of 1946 and granting pension benefits to our veterans \n     then pending in the US Congress;\n       Whereas, these legislators, however, intimated their \n     concern that upon the passage of this US bill, the benefits \n     currently granted to our veterans would be revoked, as \n     provided under RA 6948, amended by RA 7696;\n       Whereas, to address this concern and to grant full benefits \n     to our veterans which they rightfully deserve, Republic Act \n     No. 9499, otherwise known as the Filipino World War II \n     Veterans Pensions and Benefits Act of 2008, was signed into \n     law on 9 April 2008;\n       Whereas, the law paved the way for the approval by the \n     United States Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     proposed American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, \n     otherwise known as the Economic Stimulus Bill, with the \n     valiant and unfaltering support of Senators Daniel K. Inouye, \n     Harry Reid and Daniel Kahikina Akaka, and Representatives \n     Robert Filner, Mike Honda and Nancy Pelosi, among other \n     legislators;\n       Whereas, on 13 February 2009, both Houses of the US \n     Congress approved the Conference Report on the Economic \n     Stimulus Bill, with 60 affirmative votes and 38 negative \n     votes;\n       Whereas, United States President Barack Obama is scheduled \n     to sign the Economic Stimulus Bill in Denver, Colorado, on 17 \n     February 2009, the eve of the 63rd anniversary of the \n     enactment of the First Rescission Act;\n       Whereas, the end of the decades-long suffering of our \n     veterans is now within reach, for when the Economic Stimulus \n     Bill is enacted into law, our surviving veterans can claim up \n     to Fifteen Thousand Dollars (USD 15,000) in lump-sum \n     benefits, not as monetary compensation for their gallantry \n     during World War II, but as recognition of their honor for \n     risking life and limb for our allies and our country. Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved as it is hereby resolved by the Senate of the \n     Philippines, To express the sense of the Senate to commend \n     Senator Daniel K.

S3786-S3802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Mr. Menendez, and Mr. Nelson, of Florida):\n  S. 690. A bill to amend the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation \nAct to reauthorize the Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Neotropical \nMigratory Bird Conservation Act with the support of my colleagues, Mr. \nCrapo, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. Nelson. This \nbill supports habitat protection, education, research, monitoring, and \ncapacity building to provide for the long-term protection of \nneotropical migratory birds. It does this by providing grants to \ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean for the conservation of \nthese birds, through a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service competitive \nmatching grants program. Up to one-quarter of the annual grants can \nalso be used for projects in the United States. Projects include \nactivities that benefit bird populations, such as habitat restoration, \nresearch and monitoring, law enforcement, and outreach and education.\n  Neotropical migratory birds breed in Canada and the U.S. during our \nsummer and spend our winters in Latin America and the Caribbean. There \nare nearly 500 species of these birds, and they face a range of \nthreats, including development pressures, invasive species, climate \nchange, and avian diseases. Protecting these birds requires \ninternational cooperation.\n  The NMBCA program has a proven track record of reversing habitat loss \nand advancing conservation strategies for the broad range of \nneotropical birds that populate the United States and the rest of the \nWestern hemisphere. The public-private partnerships and international \ncollaboration provided by this program are integral to preserving \nvulnerable bird populations. Just as importantly, this Federal program \nis a good value for taxpayers, leveraging over four dollars in partner \ncontributions for every one that we spend.\n  Migratory birds are not only beautiful creatures eagerly welcomed by \nmillions of Americans into their backyards every year; they help \ngenerate $2.7 billion annually for the U.S. economy through wildlife \nwatching activities, and they help our farmers by consuming billions of \nharmful insect pests. Bird watchers include over 48 million Americans, \n20 million of whom take annual trips to watch birds. In 2006, 20 \nmillion American wildlife watchers spent $12.8 billion on trip-related \nexpenditures. Americans spend $3.3 billion each year on bird food. 16 \nmillion Americans spend $790 million each year on bird houses, nest \nboxes, feeders, and baths.\n  The Baltimore Oriole, the state bird of my state of Maryland, \nmigrates in flocks to southern Mexico, Central America, and northern \nSouth America. The Oriole has recently been threatened by destruction \nof breeding habitat and tropical winter habitat, and by toxic \npesticides ingested by the insects which constitute the Oriole's main \ndiet. This legislation will help ensure that the broad range of \nmigratory birds, from the Cerulean Warbler to the Baltimore Oriole, \nwill have the healthy habitat they need on both ends of their annual \nmigration routes so they can continue to play their vital biological, \nrecreational, and economic roles.\n  Congress passed the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act of \n2000 and it became public law 106-527. It authorized an annual $5 \nmillion for each of the fiscal years 2001 through 2005. Since 2002, the \nU.S. has invested more than $25 million in 262 projects in 44 U.S. \nstates, Canada, and 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries, and \nleveraged an additional $112 million in partner funds to support these \nprojects. The reauthorization legislation would authorize $8 million \nfor fiscal year 2010, gradually escalating to $20 million for fiscal \nyear 2015, in order to meet expanding funding needs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 690\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REAUTHORIZATION OF NEOTROPICAL MIGRATORY BIRD \n                   CONSERVATION ACT.\n\n       Section 10 of the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 6109) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     to carry out this Act, to remain available until expended--\n       ``(1) $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2010;\n       ``(2) $11,000,000 for fiscal year 2011;\n       ``(3) $13,000,000 for fiscal year 2012;\n       ``(4) $16,000,000 for fiscal year 2013;\n       ``(5) $18,000,000 for fiscal year 2014; and\n       ``(6) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2015.\n       ``(b) Use of Funds.--Of the amounts made available under \n     subsection (a) for each fiscal year, not less than 75 percent \n     shall be expended for projects carried out at a location \n     outside of the United States.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNET (for himself and Mr. Udall of Colorado):\n  S. 691. A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a national cemetery for veterans in southern Colorado region, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I am proud to join today with \nmy colleague and fellow Coloradan Senator Michael Bennet in introducing \nlegislation to create a national veterans' cemetery in El Paso County, \nCO, and provide a respectful final resting place that our Colorado \nveterans so deserve.\n  In a few months, we will honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice \nin defending our Nation, as we celebrate Memorial Day weekend. On that \nweekend, friends and family members of our departed veterans will go to \nVeterans Affairs, VA, cemeteries throughout the\n\n[[Page S3787]]\n\ncountry to honor the memory of their loved ones. Unfortunately, too \nmany family members will have to travel far too many miles to pay their \nrespects. Even worse, the long distance that some veterans' survivors \nmust travel will prevent them from making the trip at all.\n  This is true of the loved ones of veterans in southern Colorado, \nwhose population features one of the highest concentrations of veterans \nin the Nation. The vast majority of veterans in southern Colorado are \nlocated far outside of a 75-mile radius of the nearest VA cemeteries, \nFort Logan National Cemetery in Denver and Fort Lyon National Cemetery \nin Bent County.\n  For nearly a decade, it has been a goal of the Pikes Peak Veterans \nCemetery Committee, as well as the Department of Colorado Veterans of \nForeign Wars, the Colorado chapters of the American Legion, the \nParalyzed Veterans of America, and the Association for Service Disabled \nVeterans, to bring a national cemetery to El Paso County. In the last \nCongress, Representative John Salazar introduced legislation that would \naddress this issue, and I supported that legislation along with other \nmembers of the Colorado delegation.\n  That bill, H.R. 1660, passed the House of Representatives unanimously \nby voice vote, highlighting the support southern Colorado veterans have \nreceived from the entire Nation for the establishment of a VA cemetery \nin El Paso County. Unfortunately, the Senate did not act on this bill \nin the last Congress.\n  I hope--and I know that veterans throughout Colorado hope--that this \nyear will be different. Representative Salazar has again introduced a \nHouse bill, and today we introduce the Senate companion. Senator Bennet \nand I will work hard to raise awareness of the need for a new national \ncemetery for southern Colorado and get this bill passed in the Senate. \nWe need to ensure that all of our veterans receive the recognition they \ndeserve with a final resting place close to their own communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                 S. 691\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL CEMETERY IN SOUTHERN \n                   COLORADO REGION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     establish, in accordance with chapter 24 of title 38, United \n     States Code, a national cemetery in El Paso County, Colorado, \n     to serve the needs of veterans and their families in the \n     southern Colorado region.\n       (b) Consultation in Selection of Site.--Before selecting \n     the site for the national cemetery established under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall consult with--\n       (1) appropriate officials of the State of Colorado and \n     local officials in the southern Colorado region; and\n       (2) appropriate officials of the United States, including \n     the Administrator of General Services, with respect to land \n     belonging to the United States in El Paso County, Colorado, \n     that would be suitable to establish the national cemetery \n     under subsection (a).\n       (c) Authority to Accept Donation of Parcel of Land.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may \n     accept on behalf of the United States the gift of an \n     appropriate parcel of real property. The Secretary shall have \n     administrative jurisdiction over such parcel of real \n     property, and shall use such parcel to establish the national \n     cemetery under subsection (a).\n       (2) Income tax treatment of gift.--For purposes of Federal \n     income, estate, and gift taxes, the real property accepted \n     under paragraph (1) shall be considered as a gift to the \n     United States.\n       (d) Report.--As soon as practicable after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a report on the establishment of the national cemetery under \n     subsection (a). The report shall set forth a schedule for \n     such establishment and an estimate of the costs associated \n     with such establishment.\n       (e) Southern Colorado Region Defined.--In this Act, the \n     term ``southern Colorado region'' means the geographic region \n     consisting of the following Colorado counties:\n       (1) El Paso.\n       (2) Pueblo.\n       (3) Teller.\n       (4) Fremont.\n       (5) Las Animas.\n       (6) Huerfano.\n       (7) Custer.\n       (8) Costilla.\n       (9) Alamosa.\n       (10) Saguache.\n       (11) Conejos.\n       (12) Mineral.\n       (13) Archuleta.\n       (14) Hinsdale.\n       (15) Gunnison.\n       (16) Pitkin.\n       (17) La Plata.\n       (18) Montezuma.\n       (19) San Juan.\n       (20) Ouray.\n       (21) San Miguel.\n       (22) Dolores.\n       (23) Montrose.\n       (24) Delta.\n       (25) Mesa.\n       (26) Crowley.\n       (27) Kiowa.\n       (28) Bent.\n       (29) Baca.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. \n        Lieberman):\n  S. 693. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants for the training of graduate medical residents in preventive \nmedicine; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am here today to lay the foundation for \nwhat I hope will be a broad effort to reform our health care system. In \nthese troubled economic times, it has never been more clear that our \ncurrent system is broken. I have said many times that we do not have a \n``health'' care system, we have a ``sick'' care system. If you are \nsick, you get care. We spend untold hundreds of billions on pills, \nsurgery, hospitalization, and disability. But we spend peanuts about 3 \npercent of our health-care dollars for prevention. There are huge, \nuntapped opportunities in the area of wellness and prevention.\n  Last fall, I was honored to be asked by Senator Kennedy to lead the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pension Committee's working group on \nPrevention and Public Health in our health reform efforts. I am a long-\ntime believer that prevention and wellness are the keys to solving our \nhealth care crisis. Our working group has already started looking at \nprevention and public health-based solutions. We have held three \nhearings so far. First, we laid down the case for why prevention and \npublic health strategies are so important to improving health care. We \nheard from a variety of experts, including health economists and \nsuccessful health promotion programs in the corporate world and in \nsmall communities. It was clear that prevention works and that we can \nnot afford not to do it. Next, we heard from a number of States about \nthe innovative things they are doing to improve public health and \nencourage wellness. We heard about universal coverage in Massachusetts, \nimproving quality and reducing cost in North Carolina's Medicaid \nprogram, and emphasizing prevention and chronic care management in \nIowa. Some truly groundbreaking efforts are already underway in many \nstates. Finally, we held a hearing about access to public health and \nwellness services for vulnerable populations. We heard about some \ncreative solutions addressing public health disparities for children, \nseniors, individuals with disabilities, and folks in rural areas. In \nall of our hearings, we have learned a great deal about what we are \ndoing right to make prevention happen. But we have also learned about \nhow far we still have to go in making sure that everyone has the \nopportunity to become healthier.\n  What is abundantly clear to me is that we can and must do more. We \nhave good science behind us, and we know that there are many proven \ntechniques to make our population healthier. This is particularly true \nin preventive medicine, where health care providers have expertise both \nin medicine and in public health. These are the people we need to help \ntackle our growing obesity epidemic, the alarming trends in \ncardiovascular disease and drug-resistant bacterial infections. They \ncan both treat patients and address public health concerns. They \nunderstand both the physiology of disease and the population effects of \ndisease. They know how to provide the best care for the patient and the \nbroader population.\n  When tens of millions of Americans suffer from preventable diseases \nsuch as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some types of cancer we \nneed experts in preventive medicine. And even\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\nthough the need is growing, our work force in preventive medicine is \nshrinking. We are not training enough preventive medicine specialists, \nand our capacity to do so is being limited. Though there were 90 \npreventive medicine residency programs in 1999, today there are only \n71. Today, I am introducing legislation, along with Senators Isakson, \nBingaman and Lieberman, to make sure that we train enough professionals \nin preventive medicine. The Preventive Medicine and Public Health \nTraining Act will provide training grants to medical schools, teaching \nhospitals, schools of public health, and public health departments to \nfund existing programs and in some cases develop new residency training \nprograms in Preventive Medicine. This bill is designed with one simple \ngoal in mind: to improve and increase our prevention workforce. We have \nseen how an ounce of prevention really is worth a pound of cure, but we \nknow that we need someone to provide that ounce of prevention. And our \nbill will help train future generations of experts in Preventive \nMedicine.\n  This legislation is a small but vitally important part of our efforts \nat health reform. In the coming months, I will be working with HELP \nCommittee Chairman Kennedy and other interested members to ensure that, \nas we craft legislation to provide health insurance to all, we do so in \na way that guarantees that all Americans have access to and take \nadvantage of exemplary preventive care. We must guarantee that our \nhealth care system will not just fix us when we are sick, but keep us \nwell throughout our lifetimes. We must lay down a marker today to say \nthat reforming our health care system means rejecting our current \ndelivery of ``sick care'' and instead strengthening our ability to \nprovide ``well care'' through preventive medicine. Today's legislation \nis just one part of that effort, and I look forward to working with \nother interested Senators to build on this legislation as health care \nreform moves forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 694. A bill to provide assistance to Best Buddies to support the \nexpansion and development of mentoring programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with Senator Orrin \nHatch the Best Buddies Empowerment for People with Intellectual \nDisabilities Act of 2009. The bill we are introducing would help to \nbetter integrate individuals with intellectual disabilities into their \ncommunities, improve their quality of life and promote the \nextraordinary gifts of these individuals.\n  I am proud to introduce this bill with my good friend Senator Hatch. \nHe has been a long time leader in the cause of Americans with \ndisabilities. We, as a society, have an obligation to do all we can to \nbetter include individuals with disabilities within our communities and \nhelp them to reach their full potential.\n  Yet, as one study on teen attitudes notes: ``Legal mandates cannot, \nhowever, mandate acceptance by peers, neighbors, fellow employees, \nemployers or any of the other groups of individuals who directly impact \nthe lives of people with disabilities.'' People with intellectual \ndisabilities have indeed gained many rights that have improved their \nlives; however, negative stereotypes abound. Social isolation, \nunfortunately, is the norm for too many people with intellectual \ndisabilities.\n  Early intervention, effective education, and appropriate support all \ngo a long way toward helping individuals with intellectual disabilities \nachieve the best of his or her abilities and lead a meaningful life in \nthe community. I would like to tell you about the accomplishments of \nBest Buddies, a remarkable non-profit organization that is dedicated to \nhelping people with intellectual disabilities develop relationships \nthat will provide the support needed to help them reach their \npotential.\n  Founded in 1989, Best Buddies is the only national social and \nrecreational program in the United States for people with intellectual \ndisabilities. Best Buddies works to enhance the lives of people with \nintellectual disabilities by providing opportunities for friendship and \nintegrated employment. Through more than one thousand volunteer-run \nchapters at middle schools, high schools and colleges, students with \nand without intellectual disabilities are paired up in a one-to-one \nmentoring friendship. Best Buddies also facilitates an Internet pen pal \nprogram, an adult friendship program, and a supported employment \nprogram.\n  Approximately 7,000,000 people in the U.S. have an intellectual \ndisability; every one of these individuals would benefit from the kind \nof relationships that the Best Buddies programs help to establish. The \nresulting friendships are mutually beneficial, increasing the self-\nesteem, confidence, and abilities of people both with and without \nintellectual disabilities.\n  The legislation we introduce today would allow the Secretary of \nEducation to award grants to promote the expansion of the Best Buddies \nprograms and to increase participation in and public awareness about \nthese programs. The bill authorizes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 \nand such sums as necessary through fiscal year 2014. If passed, this \nlegislation would allow Best Buddies to expand their valuable work and \noffer programs in every state in the America, helping to create a more \ninclusive society with a direct and positive impact on more than 1.2 \nmillion citizens.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Hatch for working with me on this \nimportant legislation. I urge my colleagues to join with me in \nsupporting this legislation that will make a positive--and needed--\ndifference in the lives of individuals with intellectual disabilities \nand in the lives of those with whom they develop relationships through \nthe Best Buddies program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 694\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to reduce the \nmatching requirement for participants in the Hollings Manufacturing \nPartnership Program; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of critical \nlegislation that I am introducing, along with Senators Kohl, Stabenow, \nBrown, and Lieberman, to reduce the cost share amount that the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership, or MEP, faces in obtaining its \nannual funding. The MEP is a nationwide public-private network of \ncounseling and assistance centers that provide our nation's nearly \n350,000 small and medium manufacturers with services and access to \nresources that enhance growth, improve productivity, and expand \ncapacity. The MEP's contribution to sustaining America's manufacturing \nsector is indisputable. In fiscal year 2008 alone, MEP clients created \nor retained 57,079 jobs; provided cost savings in excess of $1.44 \nbillion; and generated over $10.5 billion in sales.\n  At present, individual MEP centers must raise a full two-thirds of \ntheir funding after their fourth year of operation, placing a heavy \nburden on these centers. The National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, NIST, at the Department of Commerce, in turn, provides \\1/\n3\\ of the centers' funding. MEP centers can meet their portion of the \ncost share requirement through funds from universities, State and local \ngovernments, and other institutions.\n  In today's tumultuous economy, these centers are experiencing \nincreased difficulties finding adequate funding from both private and \npublic sources. As economic concerns weigh down on all of us, States, \norganizations, and groups that traditionally assist MEP centers in \nmeeting this cost share are reluctant to expend the money--or do not \nhave the resources to do so.\n  Our bill is simple and straightforward. It would reduce the statutory \ncost share that MEP centers face to 50 percent for all years of the \ncenters' operation. Frankly, the Nation's MEP centers are subject to an \nunnecessarily restrictive cost share requirement. It is inequitable, as \nthe MEP is the only initiative out of the 80 programs funded by the \nDepartment of Commerce that is subject to a statutory cost share of \ngreater than 50 percent. There is no reason for this to persist, \nparticularly not during this trying economy when so many manufacturers \nare trying to remain afloat.\n  The MEP is an essential resource for small and medium manufacturers \nnationwide. With centers in all 50 States, as well as Puerto Rico, its \nreach is unmatched and its experience in counseling manufacturers is \nunrivaled. It is my hope that my colleagues will support this \nlegislation as a direct way to bolster an industry that is \nindispensable to our Nation's economy health.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. Alexander):\n  S. 696. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \ninclude a definition of fill material; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today the Obama administration is taking \nan important first step in ending mountaintop mining, one of the most \nenvironmentally destructive practices currently in use in this country. \nMore than 1 million acres of Appalachia have already been destroyed. An \nestimated 1,200 miles of headwater streams have been buried under tons \nof mining wastes. Over 500 mountains have been permanently scarred. \nHomes have been ruined and drinking water supplies contaminated. It is \ntime to end this especially destructive method of coal mining.\n  By stopping the issuance of some of the most destructive permits, \ntoday the administration is sending the right signals that the days of \nmountaintop mining are being relegated to the dust bin of the past, \nwhere they belong.\n  Today, Senator Lamar Alexander and I are introducing bipartisan \nlegislation that will go one step further. Our bill, the Appalachia \nRestoration Act, will make clear that mining wastes cannot be dumped \ninto our streams, smothering them and sending plumes of toxic run-off \ninto groundwater systems. This Cardin-Alexander legislation amends the \nClean Water Act, specifically preventing the so-called ``excess spoil'' \nof mining wastes from entering our streams and rivers. This simple \nlegislation will restore the Clean Water Act to its original purpose. \nIn doing so, it will stop the wholesale destruction of some of \nAmerica's most beautiful and ecologically significant regions.\n  Mountaintop mining produces less than five percent of the coal mined \nin the United States. This bill does not ban other methods of coal \nmining. Instead, it is narrowly tailored to stop a practice that has \nearned the condemnation of communities across Appalachia as well as \ncitizens across the rest of the country.\n  I applaud the Obama administration for the steps it is taking today, \nand Senator Alexander and I look forward to working with the \nAdministration to pass the Cardin-Alexander Appalachia Restoration Act \nlater this year.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 696\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n         This Act may be cited as the ``Appalachia Restoration \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FILL MATERIAL.\n\n         Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \n     (33 U.S.C. 1362) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n         ``(26) Fill material.--\n         ``(A) In general.--The term `fill material' means any \n     pollutant that--\n         ``(i) replaces a portion of the waters of the United \n     States with dry land; or\n         ``(ii) modifies the bottom elevation of a body of water \n     for any purpose.\n         ``(B) Exclusions.--The term `fill material' does not \n     include--\n         ``(i) the disposal of excess spoil material (as described \n     in section 515(b)(22) of the Surface Mining Control and \n     Reclamation Act (30 U.S.C. 1265(b)(22))) in waters of the \n     United States; or\n         ``(ii) trash or garbage.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Graham, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 698. A bill to ensure the provision of high-quality health care \ncoverage for uninsured individuals through State health care coverage \npilot projects that expand coverage and access and improve quality and \nefficiency\n\n[[Page S3790]]\n\nin the health care system; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, there is a crisis facing our country, a \ncrisis that directly affects the lives of almost 50 million people in \nthe U.S., and that indirectly affects many more. The crisis is the lack \nof universal health insurance in America, and its effects are rippling \nthrough our families, our communities, and our economy. It is the \nnumber one issue that I hear about in Wisconsin, and it is the number \none issue for many Americans. Nevertheless, for too long, Congress has \nbeen locked in a stalemate when it comes to health reform, refusing to \nmove forward on this life-threatening problem because of party politics \nand special interests. That is why, for the past few Congresses, I have \nintroduced with the Senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, the \nState-Based Health Care Reform Act.\n  Senator Graham and I are from opposite ends of the political \nspectrum, we are from different areas of the country, and we have \ndifferent views on health care. But we agree that something needs to be \ndone about health care in our country. Every day, all over our nation, \nAmericans suffer from medical conditions that cause them pain and even \nchange the way they lead their lives. Every one of us has either \nexperienced this personally or through a family member suffering from \ncancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, genetic disorders, mental illness or \nsome other condition. The disease takes its toll on both individuals \nand families, as trips to the hospital for treatments such as \nchemotherapy test the strength of the person and the family affected. \nThis is an incredibly difficult situation for anyone. But for the \nuninsured and underinsured, the suffering goes beyond physical \ndiscomfort. These Americans bear the additional burden of wondering \nwhere the next dollar for their health care bills will come from; \nworries of going into debt; worries of going bankrupt because of health \ncare needs. When illness strikes families, the last thing they should \nhave to think about is money, but for many in our country, this is a \npersistent burden that causes additional stress and hopelessness when \nthey are ill.\n  It is difficult to do justice to the magnitude of the uninsurance \nproblem, but I want to share a few astounding statistics. The need for \nhealth care reform has reached crisis proportions in America, with over \n46 million Americans uninsured. As a result of our current economic \ncrisis, that number is climbing by the day. In December of 2008 and \nJanuary of 2009, it is estimated that 14,000 Americans lost their \naccess to health care each day; in Wisconsin, 230 people each day lost \naccess to care during these 2 months. The cost of providing care to the \nuninsured weighs heavily on the U.S. economy. According to research \ndone by the journal Health Affairs, the uninsured received \napproximately $56,000,000,000 in uncompensated care in 2008. Government \nprograms finance about 75 percent of uncompensated care. The cost of \nthe uninsured weighs heavily on our collective conscience, as well. In \nmy home State of Wisconsin alone, it is estimated that 250 \nWisconsinites, or 5 people each week, died in 2006 because they did not \nhave health insurance.\n\n  The U.S. is the only industrialized nation that does not guarantee \nhealth care for its citizens. In other countries, if someone is sick, \nthey get proper care regardless of ability to pay. In our country, that \nis not the case. It is unacceptable for a nation as great as America to \nnot provide good health care for all our citizens. We are failing those \nin need. We are failing the hard-working family that cannot afford the \ninsurance offered to them. We are failing the uninsured children whose \nparents do not have any access to insurance. We are failing low-income \nAmericans and middle-income Americans alike. This is not right. We can \ndo better.\n  Even for those Americans who currently have health insurance through \ntheir employer, the risk of becoming uninsured is very real. Large \nbusinesses are finding themselves less competitive in the global market \nbecause of skyrocketing health care costs. Small businesses are finding \nit difficult to offer insurance to employees while staying competitive \nin their own communities. Our health care system has failed to keep \ncosts in check, and there is simply no way we can expect businesses to \nkeep up. More and more, employers are forced to increase employee cost-\nsharing or to offer sub-par benefits, or no benefits at all. Employers \ncannot be the sole provider of health care when these costs are rising \nfaster than inflation.\n  I travel to each of Wisconsin's 72 counties every year to hold \ntownhall meetings. Almost every year, the number one issue raised at \nthese listening sessions is the same--health care. The failure of our \nhealth care system brings people to these meetings in droves. These \npeople used to think Government involvement was a terrible idea, but \nnot anymore. Now they come armed with their frustration, their anger, \nand their desperation, and they tell me that their businesses and their \nlives are being destroyed by health care costs, and they want the \nGovernment to step in.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Graham in introducing the State-\nBased Health Care Reform Act. In short, this bill establishes a pilot \nproject to provide States with the resources needed to implement \nuniversal health care reform. The bill does not dictate what kind of \nreform the States should implement, it just provides an incentive for \naction, provided States meet certain minimum coverage and low-income \nrequirements.\n  Even though Senator Graham and I support different methods of health \ncare reform, we both agree that this legislation presents a viable \nsolution to the logjam preventing reform. It may well be that, with a \nnew President and a new Congress, that logjam is already broken. I hope \nthat is the case, as I have long said that a single-payer health care \nsystem is what I prefer for our country. I also recognize that there \nare strong obstacles to enacting real reform, and that we may need the \nsupport of members of Congress with different views on this topic. \nSenator Graham would like to see health care privatized and see a base, \ncatastrophic coverage offered to everyone. Despite our disagreements \nabout the form that health care reform should take, we agree on this \nlegislation.\n\n  With the election of Barack Obama, Americans have a real opportunity \nto reform our health care system. I look forward to consideration of \nhealth care reform this Congress, and I do not intend to push this bill \nas an alternative to broader efforts. But I do think our proposal may \nhelp provide ideas about how to bring together Democrats and \nRepublicans on this issue.\n  Under our proposal, States can be creative in the State resources \nthey use to expand health care coverage. For example, a State can use \npersonal or employer mandates for coverage, use State tax incentives, \ncreate a single-payer system or even join with neighboring States to \noffer a regional health care plan. The proposals are subject only to \nthe approval of the newly created Health Care Coverage Task Force, \nwhich will be composed of health care experts, consumers, and \nrepresentatives from groups affected by health care reform. This Task \nForce will be responsible for choosing viable State projects and \nensuring that the projects are effective. The Task Force will also help \nthe States develop projects, and will continue a dialogue with the \nStates in order to facilitate a good relationship between the State and \nFederal Governments.\n  The Task Force is also charged with making sure that the State plans \nmeet certain minimal requirements. First, the State plans must include \nspecific target dates for decreasing the number of uninsured, and must \nalso identify a set of minimum benefits for every covered individual. \nThese benefits must be comparable to health insurance offered to \nFederal employees. Second, the State plans must include a mechanism to \nguarantee that the insurance is affordable. Americans should not go \nbroke trying to keep healthy, and health care reform should ensure that \nindividual costs are manageable. The State-Based Health Care Reform Act \nbases affordability on income.\n  Another provision in this legislation requires that the States \ncontribute to paying for their new health care programs. The Federal \nGovernment will provide matching funds based on enhanced FMAP--the same \nstandard used for SCHIP--and will then provide an additional 5 percent. \nStates that can\n\n[[Page S3791]]\n\nafford to provide more are encouraged to, but the matching requirement \nwill ensure the financial viability of the bill and State buy-in. Other \nthan these requirements, the States largely have flexibility to design \na plan that works best for their respective residents. The \npossibilities for reform are wide open.\n  One of the main criticisms of Federal Government spending on health \ncare is that it is expensive and increases the deficit. My legislation \nis fully offset, ensuring that it will not increase the deficit. The \nbill does not avoid making the tough budget choices that need to be \nmade if we are going to pay for health care reform.\n  We need a solution for a broken system where millions are uninsured, \nand where businesses and Americans are struggling under the burden of \nhealth care costs.\n  It has been over 10 years since the last serious debate over health \ncare reform was killed by special interests and the soft money \ncontributions they used to corrupt the legislative process. The \nlegislative landscape is now much different. Soft money can no longer \nbe used to set the agenda, and businesses and workers are crying out as \nnever before for Congress to do something about the country's health \ncare crisis.\n  We are fortunate to live in a country that has been abundantly \nblessed with democracy and wealth, and yet there are those in our \nsociety whose daily health struggles overshadow these blessings. That \nis an injustice, but it is one we can and must address. Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., said, ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in \nhealth care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' It is long past time \nfor Congress to heed these words and end this terrible inequality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Brown and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 700. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to phase \nout the 24-month waiting period for disabled individuals to become \neligible for Medicare benefits, to eliminate the waiting period for \nindividuals with life-threatening conditions, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues, \nSenators Brown and Collins, to introduce bipartisan legislation \nentitled Ending the Medicare Disability Waiting Period Act of 2009. \nThis legislation would phase out the current 2-year waiting period that \npeople with disabilities must endure after qualifying for Social \nSecurity Disability Insurance, SSDI. In the interim or as the waiting \nperiod is being phased out, the bill would also create a process by \nwhich the Secretary can immediately waive the waiting period for people \nwith life-threatening illnesses.\n  When Medicare was expanded in 1972 to include people with significant \ndisabilities, lawmakers created the 24-month waiting period. According \nto an April 2007 report from the Commonwealth Fund, it is estimated \nthat over 1.5 million SSDI beneficiaries are in the Medicare waiting \nperiod at any given time, ``all of whom are unable to work because of \ntheir disability and most of whom have serious health problems, low \nincomes, and limited access to health insurance.'' Nearly 39 percent of \nthese individuals do not have health insurance coverage for some point \nduring the waiting period and 26 percent have no health insurance \nduring this period.\n  The stated reason at the time was to limit the fiscal cost of the \nprovision. However, I would assert that there is no reason, be it \nfiscal or moral, to tell people that they must wait longer than 2 years \nafter becoming severely disabled before we provide them access to much \nneeded health care.\n  In fact, it is important to note that there really are actually three \nwaiting periods that are imposed upon people seeking to qualify for \nSSDI. First, there is the disability determination process through the \nSocial Security Administration, which often takes many months or even \nlonger than a year in some cases. Second, once a worker has been \ncertified as having a severe or permanent disability, they must wait an \nadditional five months before receiving their first SSDI check. And \nthird, after receiving that first SSDI check, there is the 2-year \nperiod that people must wait before their Medicare coverage begins.\n  What happens to the health and well-being of people waiting more than \n2\\1/2\\ years before they finally receive critically needed Medicare \ncoverage? According to Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, \nwhich has conducted several important studies on the issue, \n``Individuals in the waiting period for Medicare suffer from a broad \nrange of debilitating diseases and are in urgent need of appropriate \nmedical care to manage their conditions. Eliminating the 2-year wait \nwould ensure access to care for those already on the way to Medicare.''\n  Again, we are talking about individuals that have been determined to \nbe unable to engage in any ``substantial, gainful activity'' because of \neither a physical or mental impairment that is expected to result in \ndeath or to continue for at least 12 months. These are people that, by \ndefinition, are in more need of health coverage than anybody else in \nour society. The consequences are unacceptable and are, in fact, dire.\n  The majority of people who become disabled were, before their \ndisability, working full-time jobs and paying into Medicare like all \nother employed Americans. At the moment these men and women need \ncoverage the most, just when they have lost their health, their jobs, \ntheir income, and their health insurance, Federal law requires them to \nwait 2 full years to become eligible for Medicare. Many of these \nindividuals are needlessly forced to accumulate tens-of-thousands of \ndollars in healthcare debt or compromise their health due to forgone \nmedical treatment. Many individuals are forced to sell their homes or \ngo bankrupt. Even more tragically, more than 16,000 disabled \nbeneficiaries annually, about 4 percent of beneficiaries, do not make \nit through the waiting period. They die before their Medicare coverage \never begins.\n  Removing the waiting period is well worth the expense. According to \nthe Commonwealth Fund, analyses have shown providing men and women with \nMedicare at the time that Social Security certifies them as disabled \nwould cost $8.7 billion annually. This cost would be partially offset \nby $4.3 billion in reduced Medicaid spending, which many individuals \nrequire during the waiting period. In addition, untold expenses borne \nby the individuals involved could be avoided, as well as the costs of \ncharity care on which many depend. Moreover, there may be additional \nsavings to the Medicare program itself, which often has to bear the \nexpense of addressing the damage done during the waiting period. During \nthis time, deferred health care can worsen conditions, creating \nadditional health problems and higher costs.\n  Further exacerbating the situation, some beneficiaries have had the \nunfortunate fate of having received SSI and Medicaid coverage, applied \nfor SSDI, and then lost their Medicaid coverage because they were not \naware the change in income when they received SSDI would push them over \nthe financial limits for Medicaid. In such a case, and let me emphasize \nthis point, the Government is effectively taking their health care \ncoverage away because they are so severely disabled.\n  Therefore, for some in the waiting period, their battle is often as \nmuch with the Government as it is with their medical condition, \ndisease, or disability.\n  Nobody could possibly think this makes any sense.\n  As the Medicare Rights Center has said, ``By forcing Americans with \ndisabilities to wait 24 months for Medicare coverage, the current law \neffectively sentences these people to inadequate health care, poverty, \nor death. . . . Since disability can strike anyone, at any point in \nlife, the 24-month waiting period should be of concern to everyone, not \njust the millions of Americans with disabilities today.''\n  Although elimination of the Medicare waiting period will certainly \nincrease Medicare costs, it is important to note that there will be \nsome decrease in Medicaid costs. Medicaid, which is financed by both \nFederal and State governments, often provides coverage for a subset of \ndisabled Americans in the waiting period, as long as they meet certain \nincome and asset limits. Income limits are typically at or below the \npoverty level, including at just 74 percent of the poverty line in New \nMexico, with assets generally limited to just $2,000 for individuals \nand $3,000 for couples.\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\n  Furthermore, from a continuity of care point of view, it makes little \nsense that somebody with disabilities must leave their job and their \nhealth providers associated with that plan, move on to Medicaid, often \nhave a different set of providers, then switch to Medicare and yet \nanother set of providers. The cost, both financial and personal, of not \nproviding access to care or poorly coordinated care services for these \nseriously ill people during the waiting period may be greater in many \ncases than providing health coverage.\n  Finally, private-sector employers and employees in those risk-pools \nwould also benefit from the passage of the bill. As the Commonwealth \nFund has noted, ``. . . to the extent that disabled adults rely on \ncoverage through their prior employer or their spouse's employer, \neliminating the waiting period would also produce savings to employers \nwho provide this coverage.''\n  To address concerns about costs and immediate impact on the Medicare \nprogram, the legislation phases out the waiting period over a 10-year \nperiod. In the interim, the legislation would create a process by which \nothers with life-threatening illnesses could also get an exception to \nthe waiting period. Congress has previously extended such an exception \nto the waiting period to individuals with amyotrophic lateral \nsclerosis, ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and for hospice \nservices. The ALS exception passed the Congress in December 2000 and \nwent into effect July 1, 2001. Thus, the legislation would extend the \nexception to all people with life-threatening illnesses in the waiting \nperiod.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 700\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as we move forward with comprehensive \nhealth reform we must also not ignore that some of our most vulnerable \nMedicare beneficiaries are subject to costly, bureaucratic red tape \nwhich is delaying\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\nessential, life-saving treatments. Addressing this problem can both \nincrease the quality of life for many patients and ease financial \nburdens for their medical providers.\n  Between 6,000 and 10,000 Medicare beneficiaries have primary \nimmunodeficiency diseases, PIDD, that require intravenous \nimmunoglobulin, IVIG, treatment to maintain a healthy immune system.\n  Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases, PIDD, are disorders in which part \nof the body's immune system is missing or does not function properly. \nUntreated PIDDs result in frequent life-threatening infections and \ndebilitating illnesses. Even illnesses such as the common cold or the \nflu can be deadly for someone with PIDD.\n  Because of advances in our medical understanding and treatment of \nprimary immune deficiency diseases, individuals who in the past would \nnot have survived childhood are now able to live nearly normal lives. \nWhile there is still no cure for PIDD, there are effective treatments \navailable. Nearly 70 percent of primary immune deficient patients use \nintravenous immunoglobulin, IVIG, to maintain their health.\n  Immunoglobulin is a naturally occurring collection of highly \nspecialized proteins, known as antibodies, which strengthen the body's \nimmune response. It is derived from human plasma donations and is \nadministered intravenously to the patient every three to four weeks.\n  Currently, Medicare beneficiaries needing IVIG treatments are \nexperiencing access problems. This is an unintended result of the way \nMedicare has determined the payment for IVIG. In January 2005, the \nMedicare Modernization Act changed the way physicians and hospital \noutpatient departments were paid under Medicare. The law reduced IVIG \nreimbursement rates so most physicians in outpatient settings could no \nlonger afford to treat Medicare patients requiring IVIG. Access to home \nbased infusion therapy is limited since Medicare currently pays for the \ncost of IVIG, but not for the nursing services or supplies required for \ninfusion.\n  As a result, patients are experiencing delays in receiving \ncritically-needed treatment and are being shifted to more expensive \ncare settings such as inpatient hospitals. In April 2007, the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector \nGeneral, OIG, reported that Medicare reimbursement for IVIG was \ninadequate to cover the cost many providers must pay for the product. \nIn fact, the OIG found that 44 percent of hospitals and 41 percent of \nphysicians were unable to purchase IVIG at the Medicare reimbursement \nrate during the 3rd quarter of 2006. The previous quarter was even \nworse--77.2 percent of hospitals and 96.5 percent of physicians were \nunable to purchase IVIG at the Medicare reimbursement rate.\n  We have an opportunity to fix this very real problem with a \ncompassionate and common sense solution. I believe we can improve the \nquality of life for PIDD patients and cut inpatient expenses by \nimproving reimbursement procedures for IVIG treatments for physicians \nand outpatient facilities and allowing for home treatments and coverage \nfor related services.\n  That is why, today, I am introducing the Medicare IVIG Access Act, \nwith Senators Alexander, Wyden, Whitehouse, and Brownback, to authorize \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to update the payment for \nIVIG, based on new or existing data, and to provide coverage for \nrelated items and services currently excluded from the existing \nMedicare home infusion therapy benefit. This bill is endorsed by \nseveral national organizations from the patient and physician \ncommunities, including the Immune Deficiency Foundation, GBS/CIDP \nFoundation International, the Jeffrey Modell Foundation, the Clinical \nImmunology Society, and the National Patient Advocate Foundation.\n  I hope all my colleagues can support this legislation to help \npatients, physicians, caretakers, researchers, and plasma donors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n        Ensign, Ms. Collins, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 702. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nlong-term care insurance to be offered under cafeteria plans and \nflexible spending arrangements and to provide additional consumer \nprotections for long-term care insurance; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, at 2:30 today, the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Subcommittee on Health Care, held a hearing entitled The \nRole of Long-Term Care in Health Reform. In conjunction with the \nSubcommittee hearing, my colleagues Senators Lincoln, Snowe, Ensign, \nCollins, Klobuchar, Graham and I wanted to take the opportunity to \nintroduce the Long-Term Care Affordability and Security Act of 2009.\n  Our Nation is graying. Research shows that the elderly population \nwill nearly double by 2030. By 2050, the population of those aged 85 \nand older will have grown by more than 300 percent. Research also shows \nthat the average age at which individuals need long-term care services, \nsuch as home health care or a private room at a nursing home, is 75. \nCurrently, the average annual cost for a private room at a nursing home \nis more than $75,000. This cost is expected to be in excess of $140,000 \nby 2030.\n  Based on these facts, we can see that our Nation needs to prepare its \ncitizens for the challenges they may face in old-age. One way to \nprepare for these challenges is by encouraging more Americans to obtain \nlong-term care insurance coverage. To date, only 10 percent of seniors \nhave long-term care insurance policies, and only 7 percent of all \nprivate-sector employees are offered long-term care insurance as a \nvoluntary benefit.\n  Under current law, employees may pay for certain health-related \nbenefits, which may include health insurance premiums, co-pays, and \ndisability or life insurance, on a pre-tax basis under cafeteria plans \nand flexible spending arrangements, FSAs. Essentially, an employee may \nelect to reduce his or her annual salary to pay for these benefits, and \nthe employee does not pay taxes on the amounts used to pay these costs. \nEmployees, however, are explicitly prohibited from paying for the cost \nof long-term care insurance coverage tax-free.\n  Our bill would allow employers, for the first time, to offer \nqualified long-term care insurance to employees under FSAs and \ncafeteria plans. This means employees would be permitted to pay for \nqualified long-term care insurance premiums on a tax-free basis. This \nwould make it easier for employees to purchase long-term care \ninsurance, which many find unaffordable. This should also encourage \nyounger individuals to purchase long-term care insurance. The younger \nthe person is at the time the long-care insurance contract is \npurchased, the lower the insurance premium.\n  An aging Nation has no time to waste in preparing for long-term care, \nand the need to help people afford long-term care is more pressing than \never. I look forward to working with Senators Lincoln, Snowe, Ensign, \nCollins, Klobuchar, Graham and all of our Senate colleagues toward \nenacting the Long-Term Care Affordability and Security Act of 2009.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 702\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Kaufman, and Mr. \n        Menendez):\n  S. 705. A bill to reauthorize the programs of the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to support the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation Reauthorization Act of 2009. Along with Senators \nLugar, Kaufman and Menendez, I ask for approval of the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation Reauthorization Act of 2009, a bill to \nreauthorize a vital U.S. Government agency that has assisted U.S. \nbusinesses and promoted projects in support of our foreign policy \ninterests since 1971. This legislation reauthorizes the Overseas \nPrivate Investment Corporation, OPIC, for 4 years.\n  OPIC is an independent U.S. agency whose mission is to mobilize U.S. \nprivate sector investment in poorer countries to facilitate their \neconomic and social development. It provides U.S. companies with \nfinancing--from large structured finance to small business loans, \npolitical risk insurance, and investment funds.\n  OPIC operates at no net cost to taxpayers: OPIC charges market-based \nfees for its products and operates on a self-sustaining basis. Over its \n38-year history, OPIC projects have generated more than $72 billion in \nU.S. exports and supported more than 273,000 American jobs while \nsupporting over $188 billion worth of investments that have helped \ndeveloping countries generate almost $15 billion in host-government \nrevenues leading to over 821,000 host-country jobs.\n  OPIC's financing and political risk insurance help U.S. businesses, \nparticularly small- and medium-sized enterprises, to compete in \nemerging markets and meet the challenges of investing overseas when \nprivate sector support is not available. OPIC promotes U.S. best \npractices by requiring that projects adhere to international labor \nstandards.\n  OPIC also engages in critical foreign policy areas. It is \nimplementing major projects in the Middle East, including Jordan, the \nWest Bank, and Lebanon. In Africa, OPIC has established a new \ninvestment fund that will mobilize $1.6 billion of private investment \nin Africa towards health care, housing, telecommunications and small \nbusinesses. The agency also gives preferential consideration to \nprojects supported by small businesses. It has even established a \nseparate department to focus on small business financing. An \noverwhelming majority of projects supported by OPIC involved small \nbusiness--87 percent in fiscal year 2006. This is up from 24 percent in \nfiscal year 1997.\n  The bill incorporates several important aspects, including: \nstrengthening the rights of workers overseas, and strengthening \ntransparency requirements to ensure NGOs and other interested groups \nhave sufficient notice and\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\ninformation about potential OPIC-supported projects.\n  We all are aware of the unfortunate history associated with \nextractive industry projects and developing countries. Our bill ensures \nthat OPIC projects will conform to principles and standards developed \nby the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative. The transparency \nfor extraction investments is a new subsection created by the bill to \nensure that countries with extractive industry projects will put in \nplace functioning systems to allow accurate accounting, regular \nindependent audits and broader accountability. Ultimately, this will be \nan important tool for preventing fraud, bribery and corruption in host \ncountries with extractive projects.\n  This legislation will also ensure greater transparency for how the \nCorporation operates. It directs OPIC to provide more detailed \ninformation in advance about potential projects so NGOs and other \ngroups can determine their impact. The bill ensures that NGOs and other \ninterested groups will have adequate notice and information about \npotential OPIC-supported projects, prior to Board meeting votes on OPIC \nassistance.\n  I would like to reiterate that OPIC is an important foreign policy \ntool that encourages U.S. private sector companies to invest in poorer \ncountries and improve their economic and social development. I want to \nmake sure OPIC can continue to do its good work, but I also want to \nensure that OPIC adheres to the highest labor and environmental \nstandards, incorporates stringent accountability measures towards \nextractive industry projects, and promotes a green investment agenda.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to approve the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation Reauthorization Act of 2009 and join in this \neffort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 707. A bill to enhance the Federal Telework Program; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce the Telework Enhancement \nAct of 2009 to allow greater workplace flexibility for Federal workers \nand agencies. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my good \nfriend, Senator George Voinovich.\n  Flexible work arrangements referred to generally as ``telework'' have \nemerged as an important part of Federal agencies' management tools and \ncontinuity of operations plans during emergencies, allowing employees \nto work from home or a remote location. As the Internet and \ntechnologies have advanced and become integrated into the modern work \nenvironment, opportunities for employees to securely and efficiently \nperform their official duties from a remote location also have \nexpanded.\n  Last Congress, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of \nGovernment Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of \nColumbia, I joined Ranking Member Voinovich in holding a hearing to \nassess telework policies and initiatives within the Federal Government. \nWitnesses testified to the benefits of increased telework opportunities \nwithin the Federal workforce, including lower vehicle emissions \nassociated with commuting, better work-life balance, reduced overhead \ncosts for agencies, and increased trust and communication between \nemployees and their managers.\n  Expanding telework options helps the Federal Government attract and \nretain talented employees. With a large portion of the Federal \nworkforce eligible for retirement in the coming years, it is essential \nfor agencies to develop management tools to enhance recruitment and \nretention. This bill would provide Federal agencies with an important \ntool to remain competitive in the modern workplace and would offer a \nflexible option for human capital management.\n  Despite these benefits, witnesses also testified that many agencies \nhesitate to implement broad telework programs. The witnesses cite \nagency leadership and management resistance as the greatest barriers to \nthe development of robust telework policies. Even the head of the \nPatent and Trademark Office acknowledged that without his persistent \nleadership and commitment to telework, the PTO would not have the \nbeneficial program that it does today.\n  In the past, Congress has approved provisions in appropriations bills \nto enhance telework opportunities within the Federal Government and \nencouraged agencies to implement comprehensive telework programs. \nHowever, Congress has not approved an authorization bill to make all \nFederal employees presumptively eligible to telework unless an \nemploying agency expressly determined otherwise. Last Congress I \noffered an amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 1000, a \ntelework bill introduced by Senators Stevens and Landrieu. My amendment \nwas adopted by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs and the amended bill was reported on the floor of the Senate.\n  The Telework Enhancement Act of 2009 builds on those efforts by \nlaying the groundwork for robust telework policies in each executive \nagency. The Office of Personnel Management, OPM, would work with \nagencies to provide guidance and consultation on telework policies and \ngoals. A Telework Managing Officer, TMO, would also be created within \neach agency. The TMO's primary responsibilities would be to monitor and \ndevelop agency telework policies, and act as a resource for employees \nand managers on telework issues.\n  This bill does more than provide guidelines for the development of \nrobust telework policies; it prohibits discrimination against employees \nwho chose to telework, guaranteeing those employees will not be \ndisadvantaged in performance evaluations, pay, or benefits. This bill \nalso holds agencies accountable by requiring the submission of telework \ndata to OPM. OPM is then responsible for submitting an annual report to \nCongress, which summarizes the telework data and reports on the \nprogress of each agency in achieving its telework goals.\n  I am proud to join Senator Voinovich in introducing the Telework \nEnhancement Act of 2009. We must make sure agencies have the tools \nnecessary to make the Federal Government an employer of choice in the \ntwenty-first century; enhancing telework options will further that \ngoal. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 707\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Authority for telework travel expenses test programs.''.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend and \npartner on human capital issues, Senator Daniel K. Akaka, in \nintroducing the Telework Enhancement Act of 2009.\n  One of my top priorities as a Senator has been to transform the \nculture of the Federal workforce, something I conscientiously undertook \nwith the city and State workforces as Mayor of Cleveland and Governor \nof Ohio. I know that investing in our workforce pays off.\n  We have an aging workforce that has difficulty attracting young \npeople to public service careers. The image of the public sector can be \nbureaucratic--an impression that too often discourages young, creative \ncollege graduates. We must be able to recruit the best candidates, \nprovide training and professional development opportunities, and reward \ngood performance.\n  To compete as an employer of choice in the fast-paced 21st century \nknowledge economy and improve our competitiveness, we need to create an \nenvironment that supports those with the desire and commitment to \nserve. Just as other aspects of their lives have been informed by \ntechnology, we need to acknowledge that this next generation will have \ndifferent expectations of what it means to go to work. The growth of \nWeb 2.0 hand held devices makes it far more likely that working anytime \nfrom most anywhere will be the new norm.\n  As I stated in my 2000 report to the President on the Crisis in Human \nCapital, Federal agencies should enable as many employees as possible \nto telecommute or participate in other types of flexible workplace \nprograms. Not only would this make Federal service more attractive to \nmany employees, especially parents of young children, it has the \npotential to reduce traffic congestion and pollution in large \nmetropolitan areas. According to the Telework Exchange, the average \nround trip commute is 50 miles, and commuters spend an average of 264 \nhours per year commuting. Looking at the Federal Government, if all \nFederal employees who are eligible to telework full time were to do so, \nthe Federal workforce could realize $13.9 billion savings in commuting \ncosts annually and eliminate 21.5 billion pounds of pollutants out of \nthe environment each year. Though more difficult to quantify, but \nequally important, is the improved work/life balance which has a \npositive effect on employee morale. An additional reason that was made \nplain on September 11, 2001, is the need for a workforce that can be \ndispersed and decentralized so that essential functions can continue \nduring an emergency.\n  The legislation we introduce today helps ensure that executive \nagencies better integrate telework into their human capital planning, \nestablishes a level playing field for employees who voluntarily elect \nto telework, and improves program accountability.\n  According to the most recent OPM survey on Federal human capital, \nonly 22 percent of employees when asked about work/life and family \nfriendly benefits said that they were satisfied with current telework/\ntelecommuting opportunities. Another 37 percent responded that they had \nno basis to judge. Even though teleworking has increased since OPM \nbegan reporting in 2001, participation is far short of what it should \nbe and what the Federal workforce needs if our government is to remain \nan employer of choice. While most Federal agencies have made progress, \nthe overall number of teleworkers decreased by approximately 15,000 \nemployees between 2006 and 2007, according to the Office of Personnel \nManagement. In addition, less than 8 percent of eligible Federal \nemployees telework regularly.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Akaka and me in ensuring the \nFederal Government better integrates telework into its operational \nplans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. \n        Begich):\n  S 708. A bill to express the policy of the United States regarding \nthe United States relationship with Native Hawaiians, to provide a \nprocess for the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian government and the \nrecognition by the United States of the Native Hawaiian government, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I, along with members of the Hawaii \nCongressional Delegation, introduce a modified version of the Native \nHawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2009. In order to address \nconcerns that have been raised, a new section prohibiting gaming has \nbeen included. With the exception of this one section, the resulting \nSenate bill and House bill preserve the language of S. 381 and H.R. \n862, respectively; that were previously introduced on February 4, 2009. \nThe legislation we introduce today is the legislation we will seek to \nmove forward with toward enactment.\n  I am not a proponent of gaming. Our legislation would not legalize \ngaming by Native Hawaiians or the Native Hawaiian government in the \nState of Hawaii, any other state, or the territories. I reiterate to my \ncolleagues, as well as the people of this Nation that all forms of \ngambling are illegal in Hawaii and the Native Hawaiian government will \nbe subject to all State and Federal laws. The legislation we introduce \ntoday with this added gaming prohibition provision simply clarifies our \nintent.\n  Let me be clear for the record and for my colleagues that this bill \nis not about gaming. Rather it is about providing Federal recognition \nto Native Hawaiians so they may have the opportunity to enjoy the same \ngovernment-to-government relationship with the U.S. provided to Alaska \nNatives and American Indians. The indigenous people of Hawaii, Native \nHawaiians, have not been extended the Federal policy of self-governance \nand self-determination. The legislation provides parity and authorizes \na process to federally recognize Native Hawaiians. The legislation is \nconsistent with Federal law and maintains efforts by the U.S. \nGovernment and State of Hawaii to address\n\n[[Page S3798]]\n\nthe unique needs of Native Hawaiians and empower them to perpetuate \ntheir culture, language, and traditions.\n  The United States has committed itself to a process of reconciliation \nwith the indigenous people of Hawaii. Recognizing and upholding this \nU.S. responsibility for Native Hawaiians, the legislation allows us to \ntake the next necessary step in the reconciliation process. The \nlegislation does three things. First, it authorizes an Office within \nthe Department of Interior to serve as a liaison between Native \nHawaiians and the U.S. Second, it forms an Interagency Task Force \ncochaired by the Departments of Interior and Justice and comprised of \nofficials from Federal agencies administering programs and services \nimpacting Native Hawaiians. Third, it authorizes the process for the \nreorganization of a Native Hawaiian government for the purposes of a \nfederally recognized government-to-government relationship. Once the \nNative Hawaiian government is recognized, the bill establishes an \ninclusive democratic negotiations process representing both Native \nHawaiians and non-Native Hawaiians. There are many checks and balances \nin this process and any agreements reached during the negotiations \nprocess will require implementing legislation at the State and Federal \nlevels.\n  This legislation will go a long way to address issues present in my \nhome State. It is clear there are longstanding and unresolved issues \nresulting from the 1893 U.S. overthrow of the kingdom of Hawaii. \nProgress to address these issues have been limited as there has been no \ngovernment-to-government relationship to facilitate discussions or \nimplement agreements. However, with the structured process in the bill \nthe people of Hawaii will be empowered to come together, resolve these \nissues, and move proudly forward together as a State.\n  The bill remains the product of the dedicated and mindful work of the \nfive working groups that drafted the original bill that passed the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives in 2000. Individuals from the Native Hawaiian \ncommunity, elected officials from the State of Hawaii, representatives \nfrom Federal agencies, Members of Congress, as well as leaders from \nIndian country and experts in constitutional law contributed to this \nbill. These working groups ensured that all parties that had expertise \nand would work to implement the bill had an opportunity to participate \nin the drafting process.\n  Over the last 9 years there has been significant public input and \ncongressional oversight. This bill benefits from the input received \nduring the nine congressional hearings, including six joint House \nNatural Resources Committee and Senate Indian Affairs Committee \nhearings, five of which were held in Hawaii. The bill introduced today \nprovides a constitutionally sound foundation for us to build upon. I \nencourage my colleagues to join Senator Inouye and me in enacting this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 708\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Constitution vests Congress with the authority to \n     address the conditions of the indigenous, native people of \n     the United States.\n       (2) Native Hawaiians, the native people of the Hawaiian \n     archipelago which is now part of the United States, are \n     indigenous, native people of the United States.\n       (3) The United States has a special trust relationship to \n     promote the welfare of the native people of the United \n     States, including Native Hawaiians.\n       (4) Under the treaty making power of the United States, \n     Congress exercised its constitutional authority to confirm a \n     treaty between the United States and the government that \n     represented the Hawaiian people, and from 1826 until 1893, \n     the United States recognized the independence of the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii, extended full diplomatic recognition to the \n     Hawaiian government, and entered into treaties and \n     conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and \n     navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.\n       (5) Pursuant to the provisions of the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42), the United \n     States set aside 203,500 acres of land in the Federal \n     territory that later became the State of Hawaii to address \n     the conditions of Native Hawaiians.\n       (6) By setting aside 203,500 acres of land for Native \n     Hawaiian homesteads and farms, the Act assists the Native \n     Hawaiian community in maintaining distinct native settlements \n     throughout the State of Hawaii.\n       (7) Approximately 6,800 Native Hawaiian lessees and their \n     family members reside on Hawaiian Home Lands and \n     approximately 18,000 Native Hawaiians who are eligible to \n     reside on the Home Lands are on a waiting list to receive \n     assignments of land.\n       (8) In 1959, as part of the compact admitting Hawaii into \n     the United States, Congress established the Ceded Lands Trust \n     for 5 purposes, 1 of which is the betterment of the \n     conditions of Native Hawaiians. Such trust consists of \n     approximately 1,800,000 acres of land, submerged lands, and \n     the revenues derived from such lands, the assets of which \n     have never been completely inventoried or segregated.\n       (9) Throughout the years, Native Hawaiians have repeatedly \n     sought access to the Ceded Lands Trust and its resources and \n     revenues in order to establish and maintain native \n     settlements and distinct native communities throughout the \n     State.\n       (10) The Hawaiian Home Lands and the Ceded Lands provide an \n     important foundation for the ability of the Native Hawaiian \n     community to maintain the practice of Native Hawaiian \n     culture, language, and traditions, and for the survival of \n     the Native Hawaiian people.\n       (11) Native Hawaiians have maintained other distinctly \n     native areas in Hawaii.\n       (12) On November 23, 1993, Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. \n     1510) (commonly known as the Apology Resolution) was enacted \n     into law, extending an apology on behalf of the United States \n     to the Native people of Hawaii for the United States role in \n     the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\n       (13) The Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow \n     of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active \n     participation of agents and citizens of the United States and \n     further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never \n     directly relinquished their claims to their inherent \n     sovereignty as a people over their national lands to the \n     United States, either through their monarchy or through a \n     plebiscite or referendum.\n       (14) The Apology Resolution expresses the commitment of \n     Congress and the President to acknowledge the ramifications \n     of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and to support \n     reconciliation efforts between the United States and Native \n     Hawaiians; and to have Congress and the President, through \n     the President's designated officials, consult with Native \n     Hawaiians on the reconciliation process as called for under \n     the Apology Resolution.\n       (15) Despite the overthrow of the Hawaiian government, \n     Native Hawaiians have continued to maintain their separate \n     identity as a distinct native community through the formation \n     of cultural, social, and political institutions, and to give \n     expression to their rights as native people to self-\n     determination and self-governance as evidenced through their \n     participation in the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.\n       (16) Native Hawaiians also maintain a distinct Native \n     Hawaiian community through the provision of governmental \n     services to Native Hawaiians, including the provision of \n     health care services, educational programs, employment and \n     training programs, children's services, conservation \n     programs, fish and wildlife protection, agricultural \n     programs, native language immersion programs and native \n     language immersion schools from kindergarten through high \n     school, as well as college and master's degree programs in \n     native language immersion instruction, and traditional \n     justice programs, and by continuing their efforts to enhance \n     Native Hawaiian self-determination and local control.\n       (17) Native Hawaiians are actively engaged in Native \n     Hawaiian cultural practices, traditional agricultural \n     methods, fishing and subsistence practices, maintenance of \n     cultural use areas and sacred sites, protection of burial \n     sites, and the exercise of their traditional rights to gather \n     medicinal plants and herbs, and food sources.\n       (18) The Native Hawaiian people wish to preserve, develop, \n     and transmit to future Native Hawaiian generations their \n     ancestral lands and Native Hawaiian political and cultural \n     identity in accordance with their traditions, beliefs, \n     customs and practices, language, and social and political \n     institutions, and to achieve greater self-determination over \n     their own affairs.\n       (19) This Act provides for a process within the framework \n     of Federal law for the Native Hawaiian people to exercise \n     their inherent rights as a distinct aboriginal, indigenous, \n     native community to reorganize a Native Hawaiian government \n     for the purpose of giving expression to their rights as \n     native people to self-determination and self-governance.\n       (20) The United States has declared that--\n       (A) the United States has a special responsibility for the \n     welfare of the native peoples of the United States, including \n     Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) Congress has identified Native Hawaiians as a distinct \n     indigenous group within the scope of its Indian affairs \n     power, and has enacted dozens of statutes on their behalf \n     pursuant to its recognized trust responsibility; and\n       (C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to \n     administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility to \n     the State of Hawaii.\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\n       (21) The United States has recognized and reaffirmed the \n     special trust relationship with the Native Hawaiian people \n     through--\n       (A) the enactment of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide \n     for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union'', \n     approved March 18, 1959 (Public Law 86-3; 73 Stat. 4) by--\n       (i) ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands \n     formerly held by the United States, and mandating that those \n     lands be held in public trust for 5 purposes, one of which is \n     for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians; and\n       (ii) transferring the United States responsibility for the \n     administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of \n     Hawaii, but retaining the authority to enforce the trust, \n     including the exclusive right of the United States to consent \n     to any actions affecting the lands which comprise the corpus \n     of the trust and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42) that are \n     enacted by the legislature of the State of Hawaii affecting \n     the beneficiaries under the Act.\n       (22) The United States continually has recognized and \n     reaffirmed that--\n       (A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the aboriginal, native people who exercised \n     sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands;\n       (B) Native Hawaiians have never relinquished their claims \n     to sovereignty or their sovereign lands;\n       (C) the United States extends services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their unique status as the aboriginal, native \n     people of a once sovereign nation with whom the United States \n     has a political and legal relationship; and\n       (D) the special trust relationship of American Indians, \n     Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to the United States \n     arises out of their status as aboriginal, indigenous, native \n     people of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to better provide for compensation for certain persons \ninjured in the course of employment at the Santa Susana Field \nLaboratory in California; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Boxer to reintroduce legislation to enable hundreds of former \nSanta Susana Field Laboratory Workers or their survivors to receive \ncompensation for illnesses caused by exposure to radiation and other \ntoxic substances.\n  Specifically, the Santa Susana Fair Compensation Act would provide a \nspecial status designation under the Energy Employees Occupational \nIllness Compensation Act to Santa Susana Field Laboratory employees, so \nthey can receive the benefits they deserve.\n  In addition, the bill would extend the ``special exposure cohort'' \nstatus to Department of Energy employees, Department of Energy contract \nemployees, or atomic weapons employees who worked at the Santa Susana \nField Laboratory for at least 250 days prior to January 1, 2009.\n  This revision would ensure that the Act's benefits are available to \nany of those workers who developed a radiation-linked cancer due to \ntheir employment at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory.\n  This bill fulfills the intent of Congress when it approved the act, \nproviding compensation and care for nuclear program workers who \nsuffered severe health problems caused by on-the-job exposure to \nradiation.\n  The Santa Susana Field Laboratory is a 2,849-acre facility located \nabout 30 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.\n  During the Cold War, it was used for the development and testing of \nnuclear reactors and powerful rockets, including those used in \nAmerica's space and ballistic missile programs.\n\n[[Page S3802]]\n\n  Sadly, many workers of the Cold War era were exposed to radiation on \na regular basis. But claims for compensation are hampered by incomplete \nand inaccurate records.\n  Some records show only estimated levels of exposure for workers, and \nare imprecise. In other cases, if records were kept, they cannot be \nfound today.\n  Many Santa Susana Field Laboratory workers were not aware of the \nhazards at their workplace. Remarkably, no protective equipment--like \nrespirators, gloves, or body suits--was provided to workers.\n  More than 600 claims for compensation have been filed by Santa Susana \nField Lab workers, but only a small fraction have been approved. A lack \nof documentation, or inability to prove exposure thresholds, has \nhindered hundreds of claims that may well be legitimate. And, for some \nlab workers and their families, it is impossible to reconstruct \nexposure scenarios due to records having been destroyed.\n  Santa Susana Field Lab workers and their families now face the burden \nof having to reconstruct exposure scenarios that existed more than 40 \nyears ago, in most cases with little or no documentation.\n  The case of my constituent, Betty Reo, provides an example of why \nthis legislation is necessary.\n  Ms. Reo's husband, Cosmo Reo, worked at the Santa Susana Field \nLaboratory as an instrumentation mechanic from April 18, 1957 until May \n17, 1960.\n  Cosmo worked in the rocket testing pits and was exposed to hydrazine, \ntrichlorithylene, and other cancer-causing chemicals which attack the \nlungs, bladder and kidneys.\n  Cosmo died of renal failure in 1980. Ms. Reo applied for benefits \nunder the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act. She \nhas been trying to reconstruct the exposure scenarios under which her \nhusband worked, but without adequate documentation she has been \nrepeatedly denied benefits.\n  This bill would help people like Betty Reo, people who lack the \ndocumentation necessary to prove their cases, and those who worked in \nany of the four areas of the Santa Susana site.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in correcting these injustices and \ncutting through the ``red tape'' that prevents Santa Susana Field \nLaboratory workers, and their families, from receiving fair \ncompensation.\n  For many, such as Ms. Reo, time is running out.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) President John F. Kennedy said, ``The raising of \n     extraordinarily large sums of money, given voluntarily and \n     freely by millions of our fellow Americans, is a unique \n     American tradition . . . Philanthropy, charity, giving \n     voluntarily and freely . . . call it what you like, but it is \n     truly a jewel of an American tradition''.\n       (2) Americans gave more than $300,000,000,000 to charitable \n     causes in 2007, an amount equal to roughly 2 percent of the \n     gross domestic product.\n       (3) The vast majority of those donations, roughly 75 \n     percent or $229,000,000,000, came from individuals.\n       (4) Studies have shown that Americans give far more to \n     charity than the people of any other industrialized nation--\n     more than twice as much, measured as a share of gross \n     domestic product, than the citizens of Great Britain, and 10 \n     times more than the citizens of France.\n       (5) 7 out of 10 American households donate to charities to \n     support a wide range of religious, educational, cultural, \n     health care, and environmental goals.\n       (6) These charities provide innumerable valuable public \n     services to society's most vulnerable citizens during \n     difficult economic times.\n       (7) Congress has provided incentives through the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage charitable giving by \n     allowing individuals to deduct income given to tax-exempt \n     charities.\n       (8) 41,000,000 American households, constituting 86 percent \n     of taxpayers who itemize deductions, took advantage of this \n     deduction to give to the charities of their choice.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should preserve the full income tax deduction \n     for charitable contributions through the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 and look for additional ways to encourage \n     charitable giving rather than to discourage it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 717.

Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleague from \nArkansas, Senator Blanche Lincoln, in introducing Nos. 671, the Seniors \nMental Health Access Improvement Act.\n  For over a decade, Senator Lincoln has been a strong voice advocating \nfor health care policies in the Senate that apply specifically to rural \ncommunities. I am proud to join her as we fight to ensure Medicare \npatients living in rural and in frontier States have access to and a \nchoice of their mental health professionals.\n  The Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act will permit marriage \nand family therapists and licensed professional counselors to bill \nMedicare directly. These providers will then receive 75 percent of the \nrate that psychiatrists and psychologists receive for the same \nservices.\n\n[[Page S3807]]\n\n  I want my colleagues to know that S. 671 does not expand covered \nMedicare services. It would simply give Medicare patients who are \nliving in isolated frontier States, such as Wyoming, more choices for \nmental health providers.\n  Today, approximately three-quarters of the nationally designated \nmental health professional shortage areas are located in rural areas. \nOver half of all rural counties have no mental health services of any \nkind. Frontier counties have even more dramatic numbers--95 percent do \nnot have a psychiatrist, 68 percent do not have a psychologist, and 78 \npercent do not have a social worker. Virtually all of Wyoming is \ndesignated a mental health professional shortage area.\n  In Wyoming, there is a total of 474 mental health providers who are \ncurrently eligible to care for Medicare patients and bill Medicare for \ntheir services--474. Additionally, we have over 500 licensed \nprofessional counselors and 61 marriage and family therapists who are \ncurrently licensed to practice. None of them are able, at this time, to \ncharge Medicare for the services they provide. By enacting this Seniors \nMental Health Access and Improvement Act, that would more than double--\nmore than double--the number of mental health providers available to \ntreat seniors in my State.\n  Medicare patients in Wyoming are often forced to travel great \ndistances to see mental health providers who are currently recognized \nby the Medicare program. To make matters even more of a challenge, \nrural and frontier communities have a tough time recruiting and \nretaining these providers--all providers but especially mental health \ncare providers. In many small towns, a licensed professional counselor \nor a marriage or family therapist is the only mental health care \nprovider in the area.\n  Medicare laws only compound the current situation.\n  Right now, only psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, clinical \nsocial workers, and clinical nurse specialists can bill Medicare for \nmental health services. So it is time the Medicare Program recognizes \nthe qualifications of licensed professional counselors and marriage and \nfamily therapists. They do play a crucial role in this Nation's mental \nhealth care.\n  These providers go through rigorous training, and it is similar to \nthe curriculum of a master's level social worker. They must not be \nexcluded from the Medicare Program. I believe S. 671 is critically \nimportant to the health and the well-being of our Nation's seniors. It \nis time for this bill to become law.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/25/senate-section/article/S3807-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
