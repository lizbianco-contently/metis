Mr. President, as a majority, we have done a good job of \nshowing that the Senate can act in a reasonable manner. We have had \namendments. We have shown good faith by allowing amendments on \nbasically everything. This bill that is now before us is a big bill. I \nknow there will be speeches given about how big it is. But keep in mind \nwhat is in the bill. Last year, we couldn't work anything out with the \nPresident, so we funded everything except Defense, Homeland Security, \nand military construction with a continuing resolution that took us \nuntil March 6. March 6 is upon us. The reason I am talking about the \nbill being the size it is, remember, it includes appropriations for the \nyear dealing with Agriculture--extremely important--Commerce, Energy, \nTreasury, Interior, Labor, legislative branch--I was chairman of that \nsubcommittee for a long time, and very important items are included in \nthat--State Department. Of course, there are lots of other things that \ngo into those. I have just mentioned the main name on the bill that is \nin the omnibus.\n  This process has been as open as anything could be. The full \ncommittee was open. Each one of the subcommittees had full input by all \nranking members. It is time we move on to get into a regular process \nwhere we have not 9 bills but 12 bills that we bring before the Senate. \nThat is what I intend to do.\n  As we have shown good faith, I think the Republicans have shown good \nfaith. Although there are some amendments I wish they had not offered, \nthat is how things work out here. On this bill, we have to make sure \nthat reciprocity is also the same. We have shown good faith. I have had \na lot of people come to me and say: Look, this bill is so important. \nLet's not have any amendments. Let's go ahead and get 60 votes and get \nit out of here. I think that is not the right thing to do. As I have \nannounced, there will be amendments. As much as we can, we are not \ngoing to have a bunch of amendments pending because we are working on a \nvery short timeframe, and we will work as closely as we can with the \nminority. We have two terrific managers of this bill, Senators Inouye \nand Cochran.\n  I was told Senator McCain was going to be here to offer an amendment. \nI was told he was going to offer an amendment and that we would have a \nCR and not the omnibus. That is a reasonable amendment to offer. I \nthink that is appropriate. We will need a little time to talk about \nthat. But I think\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\nthat is appropriate. I believe in reciprocity and good faith. I had a \nconversation the other day with the Republican leader. He didn't \nmention who was going to offer the amendment, but both of us thought \nthere would be such an amendment offered.\n  I look forward to completing this legislation. We need to do it by \nThursday. I hope we can work our way through this. If it is the CR \namendment--and I have no other information other than staff told me \nwalking in that that was going to be the case--I think that is an \namendment that will take a little bit of time for us to discuss. There \nis not much to look at. It is probably one line long. I think I have \nmade myself clear. This is an important piece of legislation for our \ncountry. It is an important piece of legislation for the Senate so we \ncan get back to our regular appropriations process. We have done a good \njob of cutting, significantly, Government-directed spending. I have \nbeen on the record some time ago saying we have a constitutional \nobligation to make sure we are involved in how the country spends its \nmoney. We shouldn't leave how it is spent to bureaucrats in big offices \nhere in Washington, made up of people who I don't think know my State \nas well as I do.\n  We should have a good, stout debate on a number of issues in the next \nfew days and hopefully move on to other matters next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/02/senate-section/article/S2598-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I listened carefully to the remarks of \nmy friend the majority leader about the amendment process. I certainly \ncommend him for the way in which we have operated this year. As he well \nknows, 41 Republicans signed a letter to him a couple months ago \nindicating this is an issue about which Republican Members, regardless \nof their particular political philosophy--and we do have lots of \ndifferent philosophies represented in those 41 Members--felt very \nstrongly about. I commend the majority leader for responding. I think \nit has given the Senate an opportunity to operate again such as it did \nin the past. I think Members are, by and large, on both sides of the \naisle, comfortable with voting. People send us here to vote. My 41 \nRepublicans represent half the American population, and they are \ncertainly entitled to have their say. I think we are operating in a way \nthat is widely accepted and popular on both sides of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/02/senate-section/article/S2598-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. With regard to the bill before us, the Omnibus \nappropriations bill that arrived from the House certainly is an \nimportant piece of legislation, but it is not an emergency. Congress \napproves it every year. There is no need to rush something Congress \napproves every year. In fact, in January I recommended several times to \nthe President and to the Democratic leaders in Congress that we move \nthe omnibus before the stimulus. By determining what we would fund in \nan omnibus first, Democratic leaders would have been encouraged to be \nmore timely, temporary, and targeted as they put together the stimulus. \nInstead, we have had the order reversed. The result is that now we have \nsignificant double spending showing up in both the stimulus and in the \nomnibus. We have known about the Friday deadline for months, so no one \nshould suddenly point to it now as a reason to rush $410 billion in \nspending.\n  Americans are getting whiplash from all the spending we are doing \naround here. Let me say that again. Americans are getting whiplash from \nall the spending we are doing around here. We need to slow down and \nconsider the consequences of every dollar we spend. What we know about \nthis bill already is cause for serious concern. As I said, it adds \nmoney for 122 programs. It adds money for 122 programs that were \nalready in the stimulus. It represents an 8-percent increase over last \nyear's bill.\n  Much of the funding it adds or eliminates calls for scrutiny. The new \nadministration has repeatedly criticized Congress for rushing through \nlegislation before the public has a chance to review it. During his \ncampaign, the President said he wouldn't sign any nonemergency spending \nbill the American people had not had at least 5 days to review on the \nWhite House Web site. There is no reason for us to rush this massive \nbill when the White House has already promised it would not sign it \nwithout the requisite 5-day review. I would suggest, as we begin this \ndebate, that the House prepare a short-term continuing resolution. \nThere is no reason for either the Senate or the American people to feel \nartificially rushed, particularly on a bill of this magnitude.\n  It may seem quaint to some people, but a month ago many of us were \nconcerned about a $1.2 trillion deficit. Then we watched it grow, as we \npassed a $1 trillion stimulus bill and a $33 billion bill for SCHIP. \nThen last week the President proposed a $3.6 trillion budget, including \na $634 billion ``downpayment'' on health care reform and a major tax \nincrease on small businesses. We expect to be asked to spend $1 to $2 \ntrillion to stabilize the financial sector, and we have been told the \nadministration's housing plan, which is set to start this week, will \ncost a quarter of a trillion dollars.\n  We need to step back, look at the bigger picture, and think about \nwhat we are doing. That means slowing down before we spend another $410 \nbillion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I have indicated, the omnibus bill has \nbeen fully vetted by the various committees, Democrats and Republicans \nalike. As to the issue the Republican leader raised, that people need \nmore time to review this, this has been on the Web site for well more \nthan a week. People could look at it and have it memorized by now. We \nalso know the issues the Republican leader raised, that President Obama \nis talking about health care. Does anyone think that we can not do \nanything dealing with health care? People have said: How much is it \ngoing to cost to try to take care of health care?\n  How much is it going to cost to do nothing about health care? Fifty \nmillion people have no health insurance and millions of others are \nuninsured. If they have a private physician, every time they get sick \nand hurt, they go right to the emergency room. The highest priced \nmedical care rendered anyplace in the Nation is in these emergency \nrooms. It drives up taxes, the cost of a doctor, the cost of \nhospitalization and, of course, insurance premiums. So we have to do \nsomething with health care.\n  Energy? We are importing 70 percent of our oil. We have to do \nsomething about energy. Education? We are failing American children by \nnot doing more for education. So these issues we are going to take up \nin the future should have nothing to do with getting this most \nimportant legislation passed.\n\n  We are looking forward to moving this matter as quickly as possible. \nIt is something that is important for the country because we have a lot \nof issues we need to get to after we fund the Government--something we \nshould have done last year but we could not because of the difficulty \nwe had working with President Bush.\n  I think what Senator Inouye and Senator Cochran have done is in \nkeeping with the traditions of this body in meeting the needs of the \nAmerican people. There is no wasteful spending in this most important \npiece of legislation. It is important to all 50 States. I am hopeful \nand confident we will pass this in the next few days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/02/senate-section/article/S2598-4", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of H.R. 1105, which the clerk \nwill report by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as following:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1105) making omnibus appropriations for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n[[Page S2599]]\n\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1105, the \nOmnibus Appropriations Act of 2009. This is a measure that should have \nbeen completed last year but was not because of the previous \nadministration's unwillingness to negotiate in good faith. But today we \nhave the opportunity to put partisanship behind us and to continue the \ntask of rebuilding our economy, reinvesting in America and, frankly, \nmaking our Government work again.\n  I want to point out that today is March 2. We are now almost halfway \nthrough the fiscal year. Except for Defense, Veterans, and Homeland \nSecurity, our executive branch agencies are all still operating on a \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Under the continuing resolution, no new programs can begin. Funding \nlevels are held to last year's level. This means that even things such \nas price increases due to inflation and the cost of civil servant pay \nraises must be absorbed within the existing agency funding levels.\n  Many worthy initiatives which were approved by the Appropriations \nCommittee are being held at artificially low spending totals. And, as \nwe all know, the continuing resolution will expire on Friday--this \nFriday.\n  It is not in the best interests of the taxpayer or the agencies we \nare funding to operate the Federal Government on autopilot. A yearlong \ncontinuing resolution does not allow a Federal agency any flexibility \nto address changing priorities. Passage of H.R. 1105 begins the process \nof returning our Departments and agencies to a more regular order. We \nsimply must complete this bill this week--in fact, this Thursday.\n  The 2009 omnibus bill has strong support from both sides of the \naisle, including the vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Thad Cochran. Further, the distinguished minority leader was \naccurate with his comments in January that this bill has been fully \nvetted and is ready for immediate passage.\n  This measure is not, as some have suggested, duplicative of the \nspending provided by the recently enacted American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act. This argument misses the point entirely. The purpose \nof the recovery package is to jump-start economic growth by making \nsignificant investments above the annual budget. The omnibus is the \nbaseline budget.\n  But equally important to the funding contained in the bill is the \nfact that the omnibus bill will provide much needed guidance to \nexecutive branch agencies that have been operating without such \nguidance under the continuing resolution. In addition, there are a \nnumber of new initiatives across the Government that cannot be \nimplemented without passage of this bill.\n  So it is my sincere hope this is the last omnibus bill we will see \nfor some time to come, as it is my intention as chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee to pass each of our annual appropriations \nmeasures through the regular order. But having said that, it is clearly \nimpossible for fiscal year 2009, and for all the reasons mentioned \nabove, there is no doubt that this bill is far superior to yet another \ncontinuing resolution.\n  The $410 billion in spending contained in this measure will \naccomplish a number of objectives, including giving extra momentum to \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, by funding additional \nprojects and, therefore, saving thousands of additional jobs. In this \ntime of economic crisis, nothing is more important than keeping America \nworking.\n  I will offer a few examples of the kinds of initiatives that I \nincluded in this 2009 omnibus.\n  Energy security: There is perhaps no issue more critical to the \nfuture safety and prosperity of our Nation than energy security. This \nomnibus bill invests in America's security by prioritizing research and \ndevelopment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, including solar \npower, biofuels, vehicle technologies, energy-efficient buildings, and \nadvanced energy research.\n  Law enforcement: In the absence of strong support for law \nenforcement, the current economic downturn threatens to increase \nviolent crime throughout our Nation. As cash-strapped States struggle \nwith tight budgets, this bill will help keep Americans safe by \nsupporting the Community Oriented Policing Services or the COPS \nProgram, and the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants, which help State and \nlocal law enforcement fight and prevent crime in communities across \nAmerica.\n  Public health and safety: In the wake of disturbing incidents of \ncompromised food safety that have jeopardized the health of our \ncitizens, we have significantly increased investments for the Food and \nDrug Administration to strengthen the Food Safety and Inspection \nefforts. This bill will also protect the health and well-being of \nAmericans by cleaning our air and our water. It contains investments \nsignificantly above the former administration's inadequate request for \nclean drinking water and wastewater, cleaning up hazardous waste and \ntoxic sites, and for the implementation of the Clean Air Act.\n  Health care: Millions of Americans are struggling to gain access to \nquality affordable health care, particularly during these difficult \neconomic times. This measure will give scores of Americans better \naccess to health care through State access health grants and State \nhigh-risk insurance pools and by supporting community health centers \nand rural health facilities.\n  Education: As our economy struggles to regain its footing, millions \nof Americans are understandably fearful they will not be able to afford \nto pay for their children's college education. This measure provides \n$1.9 billion to support student financial aid programs, including \nPerkins loans and Federal supplemental educational opportunity grants.\n  Every day, thousands of Americans are losing their jobs--every day. \nEvery day, State and local governments see increased demand and \ndecreased resources. Every day, projects that could provide good jobs \nfor working Americans are delayed or canceled due to an inability to \nproperly fund them.\n  This Omnibus appropriations act will provide resources, guidance, and \nnew initiatives at a time when they are desperately needed. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the passage of this measure.\n  Mr. President, I have two documents, one relating to reasons why this \nomnibus bill should be enacted and the other a copy of a press release \nmade a few weeks ago. I ask unanimous consent that these two documents \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          25 Reasons Why the FY 2009 Omnibus Should Be Enacted\n\n\n             Funding Impacts on Existing Critical Programs\n\n     Safety of consumer goods and products\n       (1) Food and Medical Product Safety Inspections: H.R. 1105, \n     the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009, would provide the \n     Food and Drug Administration with an increase of nearly $325 \n     million, of which $150 million is included in the current \n     Continuing Resolution (CR). If H.R. 1105 is not enacted into \n     law, the proposed increased funding level for the FDA would \n     be reduced by $175 million. This reduction in funding would \n     significantly decrease the number of food and medical product \n     safety inspections, both domestic and overseas, that FDA \n     could perform. [Division A--AGRICULTURE]\n       (2) Consumer Product Safety: H.R. 1105 would provide the \n     Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) with an increase of \n     $25.4 million, or 32 percent, above the FY 2008 enacted \n     level. Without this funding increase, the CPSC would not be \n     able to implement many of the reforms and new directives \n     contained in the newly-enacted Consumer Product Safety \n     Improvement Act of 2008 to make children's products safer, \n     such as the consumer complaint database, an overseas \n     presence, and increased Inspector General staffing, and CPSC \n     staffing generally. [Division D--FINANCIAL SERVICES]\n     Keeping families in their homes\n       (3) Families Will Lose Housing: H.R. 1105 includes over $15 \n     billion for the renewal of Section 8 Tenant-Based vouchers. \n     This program provides housing for eligible families that \n     cannot afford housing. As the economy has worsened, an \n     increasing number of families are in need of affordable \n     housing options. The FY 2009 Omnibus Appropriations bill \n     would provide an increase of $340 million over the FY 2008 \n     enacted level. If H.R. 1105 is not enacted into law, nearly \n     45,000 families could lose their housing from the Section 8 \n     tenant-based account being flat-funded. [Division I--\n     TRANSPORTATION/HUD]\n       (4) The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will have to \n     stop helping families facing foreclosure to refinance into \n     affordable mortgages: The FY 2009 Omnibus appropriations bill \n     would increase the volume cap for\n\n[[Page S2600]]\n\n     FHA loan guarantees to $315 billion, from the FY 2008 enacted \n     level of $185 billion. In the absence of this increase, FHA's \n     increasingly central role in addressing the foreclosure \n     crisis will cause it to reach the lower cap before the close \n     of the current fiscal year. At that point, new homebuyers, \n     and distressed current homeowners needing to refinance, will \n     be unable to access safe, affordable FHA-guaranteed home \n     mortgages. [Division I--TRANSPORTATION/HUD]\n       (5) Single-Family Guaranteed Housing Loans: The CR provides \n     for a level of $5.2 billion for Section 502 guaranteed rural \n     housing loans. H.R. 1105 would provide for a level of $6.2 \n     billion. Demand for this program is rising at a substantial \n     rate. Given the role of housing markets in the current \n     economic downturn, increased funding for these housing loans \n     will help ease the credit shortfall by allowing current \n     borrowers to refinance existing Rural Housing Service (RHS) \n     loans, and to refinance non-RHS loans if the borrower would \n     now be eligible for an RHS direct loan. The additional $1.0 \n     billion in guaranteed rural housing loans also would increase \n     the availability of funding for potential borrowers seeking \n     home ownership, thereby removing existing vacant housing from \n     the market which will in turn help to stabilize the overall \n     housing market. [Division A--AGRICULTURE]\n     Fighting crime\n       (6) Federal Law Enforcement Efforts through the Department \n     of Justice (DOJ): H.R. 1105 would increase funding to the \n     Department of Justice by $2.7 billion above the enacted \n     level. If the FY 2009 Omnibus is not enacted, $550 million \n     less would be provided for the FBI to protect our Nation and \n     our communities from terrorism and violent crime. The FBI \n     would have to institute an immediate hiring freeze of agents, \n     analysts, and support staff. This will mean 650 fewer FBI \n     special agents, and 1,250 fewer intelligence analysts and \n     other professionals fighting crime and terrorism on U.S. \n     soil. In terms of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), \n     failure to pass the FY 2009 Omnibus would result in $52 \n     million less for the DEA to target and stem the flow of \n     illegal narcotics seeping into our Nation and our \n     communities. The DEA would have to institute an immediate \n     hiring freeze of agents, as well as a 13 day furlough of all \n     agents. As a result, DEA will carry out 90 fewer raids \n     against drug production and trafficking organizations. \n     [Division B--COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE]\n       (7) Anti-terrorist Enforcement Programs at the Department \n     of Treasury: Funding of $153.3 million, an $11 million \n     increase above the FY 2008 enacted level, for the Office of \n     Terrorism and Financial Intelligence and the Financial Crimes \n     Enforcement Network will make key enhancements to tracking, \n     detection and prevention of terrorist financing, enforcement \n     of economic sanctions against terrorist networks, and \n     coordination of enforcement with other countries. [Division \n     D--FINANCIAL SERVICES]\n     Protecting the public\n       (8) U.S. Attorneys: H.R. 1105 would provide an additional \n     $76.5 million for our U.S. Attorneys. If the FY 2009 Omnibus \n     is not enacted into law, the lack of increased funding would \n     require layoffs of 850 positions, including 451 attorneys, or \n     furloughing all U.S. Attorney staff for 16 days. Either \n     option would result in U.S. Attorneys cutting prosecution \n     caseload by 11,275 cases. U.S. Attorneys are the Nation's \n     prosecutors responsible for prosecuting violent gun, drug and \n     gang crimes, child exploitation, public corruption, money \n     laundering and terrorism cases before U.S federal courts. \n     [Division B--COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE]\n       (9) Security Requirements for Protecting the President and \n     Vice President: The FY 2009 Omnibus bill would provide an \n     additional $100 million in urgently needed funding for the \n     U.S. Secret Service to meet the increased security \n     requirements for President Obama and Vice President Biden. \n     Funding is provided for additional agents, intelligence \n     personnel, associated training, and for improved White House \n     and Secret Service communications. [Division J--FURTHER \n     PROVISIONS]\n       (10) Enforcement of Securities Laws: Inadequate resources \n     for the Securities and Exchange Commission would hamper their \n     ability to undertake vigorous enforcement of securities laws \n     to help bolster the integrity of the financial markets, just \n     when such enforcement is needed most. [Division D--FINANCIAL \n     SERVICES]\n       (11) Worldwide Security Protection: H.R. 1105 would provide \n     $1.12 billion for the Department of State's (DOS) Worldwide \n     Security Protection for non-capital security upgrades, an \n     increase of $355 million above the FY 2008 enacted level. \n     This account funds all the Diplomatic Security agents at \n     every post world-wide, armored vehicles, and training. If \n     H.R. 1105 is not enacted into law, DOS would be unable to \n     hire additional personnel to increase protection at high-\n     threat embassies overseas or to add oversight of security \n     contractors in Iraq, Afghanistan and Israel-West Bank. \n     [Division H--STATE]\n       (12) Nuclear Nonproliferation Programs: H.R. 1105 would \n     increase funding for the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration's nuclear nonproliferation programs by $146 \n     million over FY 2008. This increased funding is critical to \n     the United States' efforts to secure weapons grade nuclear \n     material around the world that could be used by terrorists. \n     [Division C--ENERGY]\n     Environmental and natural resources\n       (13) Fixed costs associated with programs of the Department \n     of Interior (DOI) and the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA): H.R. 1105 would provide an additional $1.0 billion in \n     funding for the programs included under the Interior title of \n     the Omnibus appropriations bill. Of that amount, 68 percent \n     is attributable to fixed and other inflationary costs. If \n     H.R. 1105 is not enacted into law, DOI, EPA, the Forest \n     Service and the Indian Health Service would be required to \n     cut current services further to absorb those fixed costs. \n     [Division E--INTERIOR]\n       (14) Weather and Climate Satellites: H.R. 1105 would \n     provide an increase in $309 million in funding for the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) \n     weather and climate satellites. Without this increase in \n     funding, there will be $235 million less in funding for the \n     next generation of weather satellites to provide warnings and \n     protect communities from severe weather. The procurement for \n     these critical new satellites would have to be paused in \n     2009, delaying construction of the new satellites and \n     resulting in severe gaps in forecasting coverage in future \n     years. This means that communities would not get accurate \n     weather reporting, and would not be warned of incoming \n     natural disasters. Further, there would be $74 million less \n     in funding for satellite climate sensors. There will be no \n     funding under a full-year CR to restore critical climate \n     modeling equipment that was removed by the previous \n     Administration from the next generation polar orbiting \n     satellites. These sensors will help us better understand \n     and predict changes in the Earth's climate. [Division B--\n     COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE]\n       (15) Diesel Emission Reduction Act Grants: The FY 2009 \n     Omnibus would provide $60 million for the national Diesel \n     Emission Reduction Act grant program, a 22 percent increase \n     over the FY 2008 enacted level of $49 million. These grants \n     are used to replace or retrofit aging diesel engines, \n     particularly for heavy trucks and school buses, reducing air \n     pollution and improving public health. [Division E--INTERIOR]\n       (16) Hazardous Fuels: The FY 2009 omnibus would provide \n     $531 million for the Forest Service and Department of the \n     Interior to fund hazardous fuels reduction projects, an \n     increase of $21 million over the FY 2008 enacted level of \n     $510 million for both agencies. These funds are used for \n     forest thinning projects on Federal lands that reduce the \n     frequency and severity of catastrophic wildfires, protecting \n     public safety and natural resources. These funds will also \n     help reduce the skyrocketing cost of fighting wildfires; last \n     year, the Federal government alone spent nearly $2 billion \n     fighting wildfires. [Division E--INTERIOR]\n     Health\n       (17) Influenza Pandemic: H.R. 1105 would provide \n     approximately $500 million to prepare for and respond to an \n     influenza pandemic. Funds are available for the development \n     and purchase of vaccine, antivirals, necessary medical \n     supplies, diagnostics, and other surveillance tools. \n     [Division F--LABOR/HHS]\n       (18) Global Health and Child Survival (GHCS): H.R. 1105 \n     would provide $7.114 billion for Global Health and Child \n     Survival, an increase of $737 million above the FY 2008 \n     enacted level. Without the additional resources proposed in \n     the FY 2009 Omnibus, USAID would not be able to expand the \n     malaria programs in Africa where a million people, mostly \n     children, die from malaria annually. In addition, without the \n     Omnibus bill, funding for family planning services would be \n     reduced by $63 million, limiting access for poor women. \n     Further, funding for life-saving immunization programs would \n     be reduced by $48 million, resulting in higher maternal and \n     infant mortality for entirely preventable illnesses. \n     [Division H--STATE]\n       (19) HIV/AIDS: The FY 2009 Omnibus would provide a total of \n     $5.509 billion for programs to combat HIV/AIDS, $459 million \n     above the FY 2008 level. Without the additional funding in FY \n     2009, the United States will not be on target to meet the \n     goals set in the PEPFAR Reauthorization Act to increase \n     treatment to 3 million people (up from 2 million people \n     currently served), 12 million infections prevented (up from \n     10 million) and care for 12 million (up from 10 million), \n     including 5 million Orphans/Vulnerable Children (up from 4 \n     million). [Division H--STATE]\n     Science and research and education\n       (20) America Competes Act--Department of Energy's (DOE) \n     Office of Science: H.R. 1105 would provide an increase of \n     $754 million above the FY 2008 enacted level for DOE's Office \n     of Science. The funding level provided in the FY 2009 Omnibus \n     is in response to passage of the America Competes Act, and \n     the expressed goal of doubling the U.S. investment in science \n     over 10 years. Without this funding increase, Congress would \n     fail to advance the bipartisan vision of the America Competes \n     Act. [Division C--ENERGY].\n       (21) America Competes Act--the National Institute of \n     Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Science \n     Foundation (NSF): H.R. 1105 would provide an increase of $426 \n     million in funding for activities authorized by the America \n     Competes Act, of which $63 million in funding would be for \n     NIST and $363 million in funding would be for NSF. Without \n     the funding increase for NIST, the United States' ability \n     both to keep up with advancements in industry technology and \n     to compete in the global economy are hampered. Without the \n     funding increase for NSF, fewer research grants will be \n     awarded, engaging a smaller workforce of scientists,\n\n[[Page S2601]]\n\n     technicians, engineers, and mathematicians. [Division B--\n     COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE]\n       (22) Development of the next U.S. Human Space \n     Transportation Vehicle: H.R. 1105 would provide an additional \n     $650 million above the level of funding provided by the CR \n     for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's \n     (NASA) Constellation program, which is the development of the \n     next U.S. human space transportation vehicle (called Orion \n     and Ares). Without this increase in funding, NASA will be \n     required to cut over 4,000 jobs in 2009. Layoff notices for \n     employees in Florida, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Utah, and \n     Louisiana will be mailed in March, and layoffs will begin in \n     May. In addition, the lack of increased funding will have \n     long term impact on the actual development of Orion and Ares \n     which will be delayed by over 6 months, exacerbating the 5-\n     year gap in time during which the United States will not have \n     its own vehicle to access space after the Space Shuttle is \n     retired. [Division B--COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE]\n     Infrastructure and workforce investments\n       (23) Endangering Continuation of Amtrak Route and Wage \n     Agreement: A full year CR would hold Amtrak operating \n     assistance at $475 million instead of the $550 million \n     provided in the FY 2009 Omnibus. This funding reduction could \n     endanger the continuation of all existing Amtrak routes and \n     would eliminate funding for the labor settlement payment owed \n     to all Amtrak wage employees under their collective \n     bargaining agreement. [Division I--TRANSPORTATION/HUD]\n       (24) Worsening the Shortage of Fully Trained Air Traffic \n     Controllers: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) faces \n     a crisis in maintaining an adequate workforce of trained air \n     traffic controllers. Without the increases provided in the FY \n     2009 omnibus, the FAA would be forced to freeze or reduce the \n     number of new air traffic controllers the agency can bring on \n     board and train--worsening the experience shortage we already \n     have in our air traffic control towers. [Division I--\n     TRANSPORTATION/HUD]\n       (25) Committee funding for U.S. Senate: At the beginning of \n     the 111th Congress, Democratic Leadership committed to \n     holding the minority harmless at the FY 2008 funding level, \n     and using that funding level as the FY 2009 baseline for \n     funding a 60/40 Democratic/Republican split. This agreement \n     would prevent significant reductions in force throughout the \n     Republican Committee structure. The FY 2009 bill provides an \n     additional $8.4 million in committee funding. Without this \n     funding increase, minority staffing levels will need to be \n     reduced. [Division G--LEGISLATIVE BRANCH]\n                                  ____\n\n\nHouse and Senate Appropriations Committees Announce Additional Reforms \n                      in Committee Earmark Policy\n\n\nInitiatives Build on Unprecedented Transparency Instituted in the 110th \n                                Congress\n\n             (For Immediate Release, Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2009)\n\n       Washington.--Today, Rep. Dave Obey (D-WI), Chairman of the \n     House Appropriations Committee, and Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-\n     HI), incoming Chairman of the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee, announced three significant changes to further \n     increase transparency and reduce funding levels for earmarks, \n     building on reforms brought about in the last Congress.\n       Previously implemented reforms:\n       2007 Moratorium: In January of 2007, Democrats imposed a \n     one-year moratorium on earmarks for 2007 until a reformed \n     process could be put in place.\n       Rules for Transparency: Under the 2007 rules, each bill \n     must be accompanied by a list identifying each earmark that \n     it includes and which member requested it. Those lists are \n     available online before the bill is ever voted on. In the \n     House, each earmark on those lists is backed up by a public \n     letter from the requesting member identifying the earmark, \n     the entity that will receive the funds and their address, \n     what the earmark does, and a certification that neither the \n     requesting member nor their spouse will benefit from it \n     financially. In the Senate, each Senator is required to send \n     the committee a letter providing the name and location of the \n     intended recipient, the purpose of earmark, and a letter \n     certifying that neither the Senator nor the Senator's \n     immediate family has a financial interest in the item \n     requested. The certification is available on the internet at \n     least 48 hours prior to a floor vote on the bill.\n       Significant Reductions: In the 2008 bills, the total dollar \n     amount earmarked or non-project-based accounts in \n     appropriations bills was reduced by 43%.\n       Other Measures: Earmarks produced by conference committees, \n     not in the original House or Senate bills, are clearly \n     identified with an asterisk. Members are able to offer floor \n     amendments on earmarks under the rules of the House and \n     Senate.\n       In our continuing effort to provide unprecedented \n     transparency to the process, new reforms to begin with the \n     2010 bills include:\n       Posting Requests Online: To offer more opportunity for \n     public scrutiny of member requests, members will be required \n     to post information on their earmark requests on their Web \n     sites at the time the request is made explaining the purpose \n     of the earmark and why it is a valuable use of taxpayer \n     funds.\n       Early Public Disclosure: To increase public scrutiny of \n     committee decisions, earmark disclosure tables will be made \n     publically available the same day as the House or Senate \n     Subcommittee rather than Full Committee reports their bill or \n     24 hours before Full Committee consideration of \n     appropriations legislation that has not been marked up by a \n     Senate Subcommittee.\n       Further Cuts: Earmarks will be further reduced to 50% of \n     the 2006 level for non-project-based accounts. In FY 2008, \n     earmark funding levels were reduced by 43% below the 2006 \n     level. Earmarks will be held below 1% of discretionary \n     spending in subsequent years.\n       ``Today we build on the unprecedented reforms made to \n     earmarks since Democrats took control of the Congress in \n     2007,'' said Obey and Inouye. ``These reforms mean that \n     earmarks will be funded at a level half as high as they were \n     in 2006, face greater public scrutiny, and members of \n     Congress will have more time and access to more information \n     before they vote on bills and as they prepare amendments.''\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield \nto the vice chairman of this committee with the understanding that I \nwill hold the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii, in presenting the 2009 Omnibus \nAppropriations Act to the Senate. This bill contains the nine regular \nappropriations bills that have not been enacted and accounts for nearly \nhalf of all regular discretionary spending for the 2009 fiscal year.\n  I am supporting the approval of this bill by the Senate even though \nthe process that has brought us to this point has left a lot to be \ndesired.\n  I also share with those on my side of the aisle the concerns about \nthe level of discretionary spending contained in this bill, which is \n$20 billion over President Bush's request.\n  I voted against the budget resolution that established the \ndiscretionary spending allocations for this bill, and I voted in favor \nof Senator Gregg's motion to instruct the conferees on the budget \nresolution to lower the discretionary caps to more modest levels. That \nmotion was defeated by one vote, and the conference report on the \nbudget resolution was adopted.\n  I commend my distinguished friend from Hawaii for resisting pressures \nto add controversial new policy matter to this bill. This is new \nlegislation as opposed to a conference report, and as such any number \nof policy riders could have been included in the bill. A few \nprovisions, such as language dealing with the Endangered Species Act, \nwere included, but, largely, the bill stays within the legislation \nrepresented by the House and Senate bills.\n  Of the nine bills in this omnibus measure, none were ever considered \non the floors of the House or the Senate. Two of the bills were never \nmarked up in the Senate committee, and six of the bills were not marked \nup in the House committee. But I can assure the Senate that the content \nof the legislation before us is consistent with the parameters \nestablished by the individual House and Senate bills, even though some \nof those bills were never presented formally to either body.\n  Previous omnibus bills have been comprised of individual bills \nreported by the House and the Senate committees, and generally of bills \nthat were passed by at least one of the legislative bodies. The bill \nbefore us today is a new kind of legislative document which I hope we \nwill not see replicated in the future.\n  Last year, the bicameral leadership made a conscious decision not to \nengage President Bush on spending issues and to avoid taking votes on \nextending the ban on Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas leasing. \nPerhaps that decision had some political benefits for some Members, but \nprocedurally and substantively, it had detrimental impacts.\n  First of all, the moratorium on Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas \nleasing has been removed from the Interior appropriations bill. Second, \nfor the last 6 months, most Federal agencies have been compelled to \noperate at funding levels very similar to those they would have \nreceived had we simply enacted the individual bills in a form that \nPresident Bush would have signed.\n  Today, we could be discussing the merits of supplemental \nappropriations if they had been needed rather than starting from \nscratch halfway through the fiscal year. Had we enacted the \nappropriations bills last fall, agencies\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\nwould have been carrying out their responsibilities with approved \nlevels of funding.\n  Funding for buildings, roads, trails, and water projects would have \nprovided jobs and would have been obligated by now. To the extent those \nactivities might have helped stimulate the economy, they would have \nbeen very beneficial. Instead, due to inaction by Congress, agencies \nhave been in a holding pattern for nearly half of the fiscal year under \nthe terms of the continuing resolution.\n  Two weeks ago, Congress sent to the President a huge stimulus bill. \nIt contains some $311 billion in appropriations for a variety of \nprograms. We had a vigorous debate about the bill in the Senate, and it \npassed with the minimum number of votes required. I voted against the \nstimulus bill in part because the bill included large amounts of \nfunding for programs that are not immediately stimulative such as \nhealth information technology and broadband deployment. These would \nhave been more appropriately considered in the context of a \nPresidential budget and at the more measured pace of the annual \nappropriations process. We will be living with the impacts of these \ndecisions made in the stimulus bill--all made in great haste--for years \nto come. It is fair to ask to what degree does the omnibus bill \nduplicate the stimulus bill.\n  There is no question that the order in which we are considering the \nstimulus and the omnibus is exactly backward. We should have used the \nstimulus bill to supplement regular appropriations, not the other way \naround.\n  There are a number of accounts and programs funded in this omnibus \nbill that are also funded in the stimulus bill. In most cases the \nomnibus funds those programs at or near prior year levels, and one can \nargue the stimulus funding for those programs was a deliberate \nsupplement. In other cases, the omnibus funds the same accounts \ncontained in the stimulus but for different purposes. There are a few \nprograms in the omnibus that, quite frankly, should have been scaled \nback based on the contents of the stimulus bill. So despite the \nunconventional and unfortunate process by which this bill was produced, \nit does represent a product that was fairly negotiated.\n  Some would like us to enact a continuing resolution for the remainder \nof the year that holds programs to their fiscal year 2008 funding \nlevels, thereby saving billions of dollars. But knowing the impact that \na full-year continuing resolution would have on individual programs, I \ndon't think the majority would propose such a measure, and I don't \nthink the President would sign it either.\n  Another possible outcome would be a modified continuing resolution \nsimilar to that enacted for fiscal year 2007--something that would \neliminate all manner of congressional directives and oversight \nmechanisms but spend no less money than we are currently considering. \nSurely there are other possible outcomes. But, in my view, continued \nuncertainty in the day-to-day operations of the Federal Government at a \ntime of national crisis is not worth the marginal and highly \nspeculative gains that might come from defeating this bill.\n  We now have received a preliminary budget from the new President. In \na few weeks, we will be considering the budget resolution for fiscal \nyear 2010, and we will be debating such things as appropriate \ndiscretionary spending levels. I look forward to a debate on that as \nthere is much in the President's budget request worth debating.\n  But it is time to put the fiscal year 2009 budget to rest. I am \ncommitted to do everything in my power not to repeat the dismal process \nthat has brought us to this juncture, and I know the chairman of the \ncommittee, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, shares that \ncommitment. Neither of us wants to deny Senators the opportunity to \nhelp shape appropriations bills in the early parts of the process \nthrough amendment and discussion of alternatives. Neither of us wants \nto hide anything from the scrutiny of the legislative process, and \nneither of us wants Members to have to pass judgment on nine \nappropriations bills all at once rather than individually.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Hawaii for the job he has done \nas chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He is leading the \ncommittee through a trying time, but he is doing it in the very best \nsense of bipartisanship and establishing working relationships that \nwill serve the interests of not only the Senate but of the American \npeople. These are relationships our committee can contribute to in the \nfuture, and I know they will under his leadership. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with him to achieve timely and open consideration of \nother appropriations bills.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding to me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are looking right now at a $410 billion \npiece of legislation approved by the House last week, largely on party \nlines, that we are beginning to debate today. It is 1,123 pages. It is \ninteresting that it is accompanied by a 1,844-page statement of \nmanagers. Put them together, and we have 2,967 pages of legislation. \nNot surprisingly, the measure has unnecessary and wasteful earmarks. So \nmuch for the promise of change. So much for the promise of change. This \nmay be--in all the years I have been coming to this floor to complain \nabout the earmark, porkbarrel corruption that this system has bred, \nthis may be probably the worst--probably the worst.\n  I just went through a campaign where both candidates promised change \nin Washington; promised change from the wasteful, disgraceful, \ncorrupting practice of earmark, porkbarrel spending. We have former \nMembers of Congress residing in Federal prison. We have former \ncongressional staffers under indictment and in prison. So what are we \ndoing here? Not only is this business as usual, but this is an \noutrageous insult to the American people.\n  Today we find out that the unemployment rate in the great State of \nCalifornia just went over 10 percent. It just went over 10 percent. So \nwhat are we going to do? We are going to spend $1.7 million for pig \nodor research in Iowa. We are going to spend $2 million for the \npromotion of astronomy in Hawaii. Why do we need--I ask the Senator \nfrom Hawaii: Why do we need to spend $2 million to promote astronomy in \nHawaii when unemployment is going up and the stock market is tanking? \nDo we really need to continue this wasteful process?\n  This includes $6.6 million for termite research in New Orleans; $2.1 \nmillion for the Center for Grape Genetics in New York. You will notice \nthere is a State or a district or a town or a location associated with \nall of these projects. You will notice that because that is what it is: \n$1.7 million for a honey bee factory in Weslaco, TX. Forgive me if I \nmispronounced the name of the town in Texas.\n  So here we are. Here we are promising the American people hope and \nchange, and what do we have? Business as usual. What does the \nadministration say? What does the administration say? Mr. Peter Orzag--\nan individual I don't know--brushed off questions during his appearance \non ``This Week'' about whether the President would sign a spending bill \nthat contains 9,000 earmarks--9,000 earmarks. Noting that during the \ncampaign President Obama said he would work to limit earmarks and make \nthem more transparent, his response was: This is last year's business. \nWe want to just move on.\n  Last year's business? The President will sign this appropriations \nbill into law. It is the President's business. It is the business of \nthe President of the United States. It is the business of the President \nof the United States to do what he said. When we were in debate seeking \nthe support of the American people, he stated he would work to \neliminate--eliminate--earmarks.\n  Last September, President Obama said during the debate in Oxford, MS:\n\n       We need earmark reform and when I am President, I will go \n     line-by-line to make sure we are not spending money unwisely.\n\n  That is the quote of the promise the President of the United States \nmade to the American people in a debate with me in Oxford, MS.\n  So what is brought to the floor today? Nine thousand earmarks, \nbillions and billions of dollars of unneeded and wasteful spending, and \nthe President's budget person says: This is last year's business. We \nwant to just move on. That is insulting to the American people.\n  White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel appeared on ``Face the \nNation.'' According to the New York Times, Mr. Emanuel said:\n\n       Mr. Obama was not happy with the large number of earmarks \n     in this bill, but--\n\n  Mr. Emanuel said--\n\n       the President kept lawmakers from adding a single earmark \n     to this $287 billion stimulus package and a $32.8 billion \n     plan to the State Children's Health Insurance Program.\n\n  By the way, that statement is disingenuous on its face.\n  So I guess we are doing last year's business. Does that mean last \nyear's President will sign this porkbarrel bill? I wish to freely \nacknowledge--I wish to freely acknowledge that Republicans were guilty \nof this as well. I have said time after time there are three kinds of \nMembers of Congress: Republican Members, Democrat Members, and \nappropriators.\n  If it sounds as if I am angry, it is because I am. The American \npeople today want the Congress to act in a fiscally responsible manner, \nand they don't want us to continue this corrupting practice.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma is here. He calls it a gateway drug--a \ngateway drug. I am not going to pick up this managers' package. Look at \nthis. Look at this. Look at this. Have we had a single one of these \nprojects authorized? Has any of them gone through the authorizing \ncommittee? Have any of these projects been examined for whether they \nare better or worse or more meritorious than others? No. They are in \nthere because of the political clout and seniority of Members of \nCongress. That is what this is all about--political influence.\n  Maybe one could argue when this economy was good and we were in a \nsurplus this kind of wasteful spending could be brushed aside; that it \nwas somehow, in the view of some, acceptable. It is not now. It is not \nnow. There are millions of Americans out of work, unemployment is \nclimbing, and the stock market is tanking.\n  So what do we do in response to that, as every American family is \nhaving to tighten their belts, sitting around the kitchen table \nfiguring out how they are either going to keep a job or get health \ninsurance, keep their families together and stay in their homes? We are \ngoing to spend $333,000 for the design and construction of a school \nsidewalk in Franklin, TX. Now, maybe that Franklin, TX, school needs a \nsidewalk. Maybe other places need a sidewalk too.\n  We are going to spend $951,500 for a sustainable Las Vegas. What does \nthat mean? What does sustainable Las Vegas mean?\n  We are going to spend $143,000 for Nevada Humanities to develop and \nexpand an online encyclopedia.\n  Is there no place besides Nevada that they need to expand an online \nencyclopedia? There hasn't been a lot of coverage on the $200,000 for a \ntattoo removal violence outreach program in the L.A. area. Is that \nprogram also needed in other areas? Why did we pick out L.A.? There is \n$238,000 for the Polynesian Voyaging Society in Honolulu, HI. We have \n$238,000 for the Polynesian Voyaging Society in Honolulu, HI, when \npeople are out of a job. There is $100,000 for the regional robotics \ntraining center in Union, SC. There is $238,000 for the Alaska PTA. \nThere is $150,000 for a rodeo museum in South Dakota.\n  Americans are angry, Mr. President, and they are going to know a lot \nmore about this bill before we have a final vote. They are going to \nknow a lot more about it. Americans are going to be angry. Americans \nare angry now at what we have done. The approval rating of Congress is \nincredibly low. So we will be going through a lot of this.\n  By the way, there is an outfit called PMA. A lot of Americans haven't \nheard of PMA. It is a lobbying organization. Contained within this \nlegislation are 14 earmarks that the managers of the bill put in, and \nthese 14 earmarks total nearly $9.7 million. Guess to whom they are \ndirected--clients of the PMA Group. The PMA Group, for the benefit of \nmy colleagues, is a lobbying group, a firm recently forced to close its \ndoors after being raided by the FBI for suspicious campaign donation \npractices. The firm is under investigation. So what did they do? They \nwent out and got $9.7 million worth of your taxpayer dollars, totaling \n$9.7 million, after being raided by the FBI for suspicious campaign \ndonation practices. They remain under investigation. Do you think maybe \nwe could take that out?\n  I have long spoken about a broken appropriations process, vulnerable \nto\n\n[[Page S2607]]\n\ncorruption and abuse, and the allegations against the PMA Group and \nsome Members of Congress stand as a testament to the urgent need for \nreform. How could we allow these provisions to move forward while their \nprincipal sponsor is under Federal investigation? How do we do that?\n  Mr. President, we will be talking a lot more in the days ahead as we \ngo through this legislation. I hope the American people will rise up \nand demand that what we need to do is just have a continuing \nresolution, continue with the spending levels that were part of the \ncontinuing resolution. If this is a ``change,'' then let's start \nimplementing change.\n  If there is any testament to business as usual here in the Congress \nof the United States, it is this bill before us. Americans all over \nthis country hope for change. They hope the corruption, earmarking, and \nporkbarrel practices will stop. What are we giving them? We are giving \nthem a slap in the face, that is what we are giving them.\n  I know my colleague from Oklahoma is here. I will be glad to hear the \nexplanation from my colleagues, the distinguished managers of the bill, \nas to why 14 earmark projects obtained by the PMA Group, which has been \nshut down and is under FBI investigation, why we need $1.7 million for \npig odor research in Iowa, and why we have 1,100 pages of the managers' \nstatement. A managers' statement is supposed to be a description of the \nbill. What has happened over the years is that we have stuck in more \nand more provisions in the managers' statement which then, according to \nthe agencies of Government, have the force of law. So we get tens of \nbillions of dollars of unnecessary and wasteful earmarks. So much for \nthe promise of change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, before we get started----\n  Mr. INOUYE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes, I am happy to yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Is the Senator going to propose an amendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will not at this time.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Thank you.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is interesting--and the American people \nought to pay attention to this--what we have right now is a bill that \nis $410 billion. It is $363 million a page. And now we have \ninstructions from the majority leader that no amendments are allowed to \nbe offered. That is what the intent of the quorum call was. That is why \nthe honorable chairman asked me that question. The only way I can talk \non the floor is if I agree not to offer an amendment to $410 billion \nworth of spending, at $363 million per page. What are we coming to? Now \nwe can't offer amendments. I reached out to Senator Reid and said I \nwould work with him on packaging amendments in a way that would not \ndelay this bill, in a way that we can still have a good debate and lots \nof amendments offered. My goodness, you have 57 votes. You can win \nalmost any vote here. Why do you not want to have amendments? They \ndon't want to have amendments because they really don't want the \nAmerican people to know what is in this bill. That is why.\n  This bill represents the spending for all of these agencies we have \nnot sent the money to this fiscal year. But it also represents the \nworst excesses of Congress. It represents parochialism ahead of \nprinciple. It represents putting politicians first and putting the \npeople last. That is what this bill represents. It represents the exact \nopposite of what our President said he wanted, which was ``change you \ncan believe in.'' Now we have change that is exactly what we saw before \nPresident Obama became President. We have the same standard of \nbehavior. Tons of earmarks are in this bill. That is a totally \ndifferent question. This bill has grown by over $32 billion from the \nsame period last year, of which we just increased most of these \nagencies on an average of around 80 percent with the stimulus bill. Now \nwe are going to increase it another 8.4 percent, and we are not \nsupposed to offer amendments. We are not supposed to take out things \nthat are obviously quid pro quo in terms of earmarks and campaign \ncontributions, as the Senator from Arizona just mentioned, from the \ndonors we are seeing who are being investigated right now.\n  The way to get our Government back is to have free and honest debate \nin the greatest deliberative body in the world, which is supposed to be \nthe U.S. Senate. Now we cannot offer amendments on a bill that is \nalmost half of the entire discretionary spending of the country because \nwe are not sure they want to take a vote on a bill. I have not been \nbashful about what I want to do.\n  There is an Emmett Till bill that we passed under controversy here. \nWe got it passed. There is not one penny for funding for the Emmett \nTill Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes in this bill, which your side totally \npromised would be in this spending. You are abandoning Alvin Sykes and \nall these families who had unsolved civil rights crimes over the last \n30, 40 years in this country and reneging on a promise that said you \nwould put the money in the Justice Department. Yet there is not a penny \nthere. We are high and mighty when it comes to authorizing and when we \npromise we will do the right thing. But when it comes down to it, we \nwould rather give earmarks for pig smell than fund the solution for \nunsolved civil rights crimes. I tell you, by doing that, I think we \nhave dishonored a great number of people who worked hard to make sure \nthat bill got passed, the least of which is not Alvin Sykes, a man who \nhas dedicated the last 10 years of his life to seeing that justice was \nnot denied to these families. Here we have a bill which we made promise \nafter promise that we would take care of, and we have done nothing. Of \ncourse nobody wants to change this bill. They don't want to change the \nbill because we are running up to a deadline we have known about since \nthe fiscal year started. No, you cannot change the bill because we will \nhave to extend the CR. There are a lot of benefits to extending the CR: \nOne, we save our grandkids $38 billion--that is one of the benefits--\nand two, we don't reward behavior that causes us to be less than \nhonorable.\n  There are 8,570 earmarks in this bill. I am not opposed to earmarks \nif they are authorized and go through a committee and Senators say they \nare a priority. But the average American, when they look at all these \nearmarks, is going to say: How in the world is that a priority? Yet we \nspend $7.7 billion out of that $30 billion--increased spending--so we \ncan help Senators get reelected and so they will look good at home.\n  Mr. President, I worry about our Republic. You should be worried too. \nIn the face of the greatest economic difficulty we have seen in over \nhalf a century in this country, the status quo has not changed in the \nSenate. We have not called up the courage to do what is best for this \ncountry. What we have done is relied on what is best for the \npoliticians. I worry about what our kids are going to see, what \nstandards of living they are going to have, because it is exactly this \nbehavior that will mortgage their future, and it is not just the \ndollars, it is the misdirection of funds against a standard that common \nsense would say is not a priority now. We ought to be doing what is \nmost important for this country first and what is best for the \npoliticians last. This bill has it wrong. It has it backward.\n  I told the majority leader a moment ago that I would work with him to \nmake sure we didn't obstruct. But maybe we should obstruct this bill, \nwe should stop this bill. Based on the waste in it, the lack of \noversight, lack of metrics in the programs, the earmarks in it, and the \noutright greed for the special class in this country--and that special \nclass is the connected class of the politician. That is who benefits \nmost from this bill. It makes me want to vomit.\n  You should worry about process in this Chamber because process is the \nthing that creates transparency. The American people are going to get \nto see--if we get an opportunity to offer amendments--what is really in \nthis bill.\n\n[[Page S2608]]\n\n  I will finish my rant by saying that I wonder what the Senators \nbefore us, 50 and 100 years ago, would say about what is going on with \nprocess in this Chamber right now. You have the votes to defeat \nanything. Yet you don't want to have an amendment that you have to take \na vote on that says this is a priority or this isn't a priority.\n  To me, I think that lacks honor, I know it lacks courage, and it \nlacks the dignity this institution deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, does the Senator from Texas wish to \nspeak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished bill managers \nfor the opportunity to speak by unanimous consent as in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Texas Independence Day\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I rise to speak on behalf of Texas \nIndependence Day, March 2. On this date in 1836, delegates from 59 \nTexas settlements in what was then Mexico declared their independence \nfrom that country and their determination to live in liberty. The \ndelegates who met in this small town known as Washington-on-the-Brazos \nwere a diverse group. Two of the delegates were native Mexicans, Jose \nFrancisco Ruiz and Jose Antonio Navarro. The rest were immigrants from \nEurope, from Mexico, and, yes, from the United States. Two-thirds of \nthe delegates were less than 40 years old.\n  Several of the delegates had political experience, men such as Sam \nHouston, who had been Governor of the State of Tennessee. He, Robert \nPotter, and Samuel Carson had all served in the Congress. Richard Ellis \nhad participated in the constitutional convention of the State of \nAlabama, and Martin Parmer had done the same in Missouri.\n  These delegates, and the people they represented, had a clear goal. \nThey wanted freedom. In this case, the freedom guaranteed to them under \nthe Mexican Constitution but which had been lost under the dictatorship \nof then-President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.\n  The Texas delegates modeled their declaration of independence on the \none signed in Philadelphia 60 years earlier. They expressed their \ngrievances, their determination to protect their freedoms, and their \nvision for a new nation--the Republic of Texas.\n  The ``Unanimous Declaration of Independence by the Delegates of the \nPeople of Texas'' was signed by those 59 delegates on March 2. Five \ncopies were sent to the towns of Bexar, Goliad, Nacogdoches, Brazoria, \nand San Felipe. Because there were no printing presses in Washington-\non-the-Brazos, the printer in San Felipe was ordered to print 1,000 \ncopies in handbill form. The original copy was sent to the U.S. \nDepartment of State in Washington, where it would stay for six decades \nbefore being returned to the State where it was written.\n  Even as the delegates signed this historic document, they knew their \nlove of liberty might demand the ultimate sacrifice. At that moment, \nless than 200 miles to the west, Santa Anna's army was laying siege to \nthe Alamo. Just days earlier, its young commander, William Barret \nTravis, sent out this letter. He wrote:\n\n       Fellow citizens & compatriots--I am besieged, by a thousand \n     or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna--I have sustained a \n     continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not \n     lost a man--The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, \n     otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the \n     forth is taken--I have answered the demand with a cannon \n     shot, & our flag still waves proudly from the walls--I shall \n     never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name \n     of Liberty, of patriotism and everything dear to the American \n     character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch--The enemy \n     is receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to \n     three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is \n     neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as \n     possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due \n     to his own honor & that of his country--Victory or Death!\n\n  Madam President, death came to the defenders of the Alamo, but \nvictory came to the people of Texas shortly thereafter. On April 21 of \nthat year, Sam Houston and about 900 Texas soldiers defeated the larger \nMexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto. The surprise attack was so \nsuccessful. It lasted all of 18 minutes, and the next day, Santa Anna \nhimself was captured. By this victory, Texans won the independence they \nhad declared less than 2 months earlier.\n  Sam Houston went on to serve as President of the Republic of Texas, \nafter serving as Governor of Tennessee, a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives from Tennessee, then as President of the Republic of \nTexas. And after statehood, he served right here in the Senate as one \nof the first two Senators from our State.\n  I am honored to hold the same seat in this body that was first held \nby Sam Houston. He served here for 13 years. He was a champion of \nNative Americans and raised his voice against secession and Civil War.\n  Today, Texans honor the courage and sacrifices of those who won our \nindependence and those who have followed in their footsteps to this \nday.\n  In the past year alone, I have had the honor to present a Bronze Star \nto a native of Harlingen, TX, who helped lead the breakout from a \nbeachhead in Anzio during World War II. I was honored to present a \nPurple Heart to a resident of Seguin who was severely wounded by mortar \nfire in Korea. I have seen tears of sorrow and of pride of those who \nhave lost loved ones in Iraq. And I have honored young men and women \nwho even now are completing their first year of study at our Nation's \nservice academies.\n  All these heroes and their families have paid the ultimate tribute to \nthose who stood for freedom 173 years ago. In remembrance of all those \nwho have risked their lives to keep Texas and the United States a land \nof liberty, I close with the words of our State song:\n\n       God bless you Texas! And keep you brave and strong, That \n     you may grow in power and worth, Thro'out the ages long.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 592\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 592.\n\n (Purpose: To continue funding at fiscal year 2008 levels through the \n                        end of fiscal year 2009)\n\n         Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. CONTINUING 2008 FUNDING LEVELS.\n\n         Section 106(3) of Public Law 110-329 is amended by \n     striking ``March 6, 2009'' and inserting ``September 30, \n     2009''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this amendment is very simple and \nstraightforward. Instead of the bloated, earmark-filled $410 billion \nOmnibus appropriations bill and statement of managers totalling 2,967 \npages that no Member could possibly have read given the sheer volume, \nthis amendment would provide for a long-term CR to fund the Federal \nGovernment through the end of this fiscal year. It is a one-page \namendment. It approaches fiscally responsible discipline in an \nexpeditious way which is why just 2 years ago we agreed to nearly the \nexact same approach when we agreed by a vote of 81 to 15, on February \n14, 2007, to revise the continuing appropriations resolution 2007.\n  I note no Member of the majority voted in opposition to that approach \nwhich, similar to the amendment I am proposing, funded nearly all the \nagencies of the Federal Government, except the Department of Defense \nand the Department of Homeland Security which had been enacted as \nregular appropriations bills. The only difference today is the MILCON-\nVA funding was approved last year and is not part of this continuing \nresolution, that and the fact that the majority is in control of the \nHouse, Senate, and White House.\n  When are we going to grasp the seriousness of the economic situation \nconfronting us? We learned Friday that the GDP sank 6.2 percent in the \nlast\n\n[[Page S2609]]\n\nquarter of 2008, far worse than what was expected. With the economy \ncontracting by the fastest pace in a quarter century, this needs to \nserve as a wakeup call. We cannot afford literally to continue under \nthis same status quo.\n  Let's consider some cold, hard facts. The current national debt is \n$10.7 trillion. The 2009 projected deficit is $1.2 trillion. The total \ncost of the economic stimulus enacted 2 weeks ago is $1.24 trillion. \nThat is $789 billion plus interest. TARP I and II, $700 billion; TARP \nIII, $250 billion to $750 billion or more; the President's budget \nrequest for 2010, $3.6 trillion. And now here we are debating a pork-\nfilled $410 billion Omnibus appropriations bill to fund the Federal \nGovernment through the second half of the fiscal year at a funding \nlevel that is nearly 10 percent greater than spending for the last \nfiscal year, which, according to the ranking minority of the House \nAppropriations Committee, represents the largest increase in annual \ndiscretionary spending since the Carter administration.\n  Combine the total costs of this omnibus with the Defense and Homeland \nSecurity and Military Construction bills passed last year, and spending \nfor fiscal year 2009 will top $1 trillion.\n  Now let's consider the impact of the funding increases in this bill, \ncombined with the billions of dollars provided to these agencies in the \nstimulus. According to a document prepared by the House Appropriations \nCommittee minority, the combined cost of the omnibus and the recently \npassed stimulus bill results in the following increases in this year's \nspending in billions of dollars: Agriculture, the percent increase over \nlast year is 45 percent. That is $26.1 billion. Commerce, State and \nJustice--this is with the stimulus and the bill before us, with its \n1,100 pages of managers' statement--is a 41 percent increase. Energy \nand water, a 151 percent increase; financial services, 43 percent; \nInterior, 45 percent; Labor-HHS, 91 percent; legislative branch, 12 \npercent; State and foreign ops, 13 percent; Transportation, 139 \npercent--a total of an 80-percent increase over last year's spending.\n  We are committing generational theft because we are going to ask our \nkids and our grandkids to pay this bill.\n  While I wish to say it is time to put a halt to business as usual, I \nfind myself thinking this level of funding defies that description. It \nis beyond anything I have ever witnessed and is extremely alarming. \nThat is why we should adopt this long-term continuing resolution that \nwill effectively freeze spending to last year's level and eliminate \nwasting an additional $7.7 billion on more than 9,000 wasteful \nearmarks.\n  Just as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, \nsaid during the February 2007 debate on a continuing resolution, it is \na fiscally disciplined resolution, and so is this one. During the week, \nthere will be many discussions on the floor about the questionable \nfunding contained in this omnibus spending bill. It is difficult even \nfor me to grasp the level of unnecessary spending proposed in this \nbill. It may be the most egregious pork-barrel spending I have \nwitnessed in all my years here.\n\n  Over the past few days, I have been listing a top 10 each day of some \nof the most stunning provisions. I have been twittering. Remarkably, it \nwould take me almost 3 years to list every earmark--if I continued to \nlist the top 10--until all the more than 9,000 were mentioned. I state \nthis to put some perspective on the enormity of this level of \nearmarking.\n  I have been through some of them before, but they make you laugh and \nthey make you cry: $190,000 for the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in \nCody, WY; $951,500 for the Oregon Solar Highway.\n  Some of these projects may be worthwhile. They may be projects we all \nneed. If they are, they should go through the process of authorization \nand appropriation. They are not. They are inserted in an appropriations \nbill in a fashion that no Member of this body has read this managers' \nstatement or this bill. That is what is wrong with it.\n  There will be arguments in favor of a certain earmark. There will be \nan argument for $6.6 million for termite research in New Orleans. Then \nwhy didn't it go through the proper authorizing committee and then have \nthe funds appropriated? That is what is required by the procedures of \nthe Senate, which have been violated more and more and more. And \nunfortunately, what happens when you commit any egregious breach, when \nyou engage in activities that are unethical, they grow and they grow. \nAnd I say--and I say again--this is serious stuff. We have former \nMembers of Congress and their staffs residing in Federal prison.\n  The Senator from North Dakota and I spent a couple of years \ninvestigating Mr. Abramoff, and we did so under the authorizing \ncommittee of the Indian Affairs Committee--what some view as an obscure \ncommittee--and we uncovered these egregious activities of ripping off \nNative Americans of millions of dollars; of the incestuous relationship \nbetween staffers and Members of Congress and this process. We confined \nour activities to Native Americans. There was much more evidence of \nwrongdoing. But because we were the Indian Affairs Committee, we kept \nour investigation to those.\n  I don't know how many people are now in prison, but I know recent \nindictments have come down. So this is not trivial stuff we are talking \nabout. This is corruption. And when we do things such as this, then it \nencourages a practice.\n  I asked earlier in my comments how in the world could we appropriate \nitems which had been lobbied for by a group called PMA, whose offices \nwere raided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation? How can we insert \ntheir earmarks into an appropriations bill? I don't get it.\n  My amendment is simple. It goes back to a continuing resolution and \nfunds the activities of the Government at last year's levels, which \nobviously were sufficient last year. We need to do some belt \ntightening, I don't think there is any doubt about that. We are asking \nevery American family to do that today. And every American family is \nhaving to do it today as we face an unprecedented economic distress \nwhich is affecting literally every family in America. It is a great and \nongoing tragedy. It seems to me that we, as a Congress, can at least \nnot increase the spending over last year's level as Americans have lost \nat least half of their savings in the stock market in the last year.\n  I hope we will approve this amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee for the chance to speak at this time. I am going to talk a \nbit about the cause of health care reform, and I know the chairman has \nbeen a leader in this area lo these many years.\n  For some time, the planets have started to align for the cause of \nhealth reform, and today the President put in place some stars in \nKathleen Sebelius and Nancy-Ann DeParle for key assignments in this \nhealth reform effort. Both of them bring extraordinary qualifications \nto their positions.\n  Kathleen Sebelius is a renowned expert on the cause of insurance \nreform. This is going to be especially important because the insurance \nmodel today is fundamentally flawed. It is all about cherry-picking--\ntaking healthy people and sending sick people over to government \nprograms more fragile than they are. Under Kathleen Sebelius, I am of \nthe view we will reinvent that insurance system. Private insurers will \ncompete on the basis of price, benefit, and quality.\n  I believe we will have bipartisan support for that effort. The \nPresident has talked about it. Chairman Baucus has it in his white \npaper. Chairman Kennedy has long advocated this very different model of \nprivate insurance. I am pleased to say in our bipartisan Healthy \nAmericans Act, which Senator Bennett and I have sponsored, we include \nit as well. With Kathleen Sebelius and her expertise in the insurance \nfield, we will be in a position to get it done and get it done with \nbipartisan support.\n  Nancy-Ann DeParle brings the same qualifications to the task of \nfixing health care. She is an expert in health care numbers. She was \ninvolved what was then the Health Care Finance Administration. But what \nI like the most about Nancy-Ann DeParle is that she has always \nunderstood that enduring solutions to big questions--such as fixing \nhealth care--are going to require that we bring together bipartisan \nsupport for those efforts.\n\n[[Page S2610]]\n\n  To his credit, the President has emphasized how important it is to \nhave bipartisan support for this challenge. I believe at this point \nDemocrats and Republicans can come together and end the gridlock over \nhealth care reform. I think we are now seeing emerge a bipartisan \nconsensus that each party has been right on fundamentals with respect \nto health care.\n  Democrats have been right about the proposition that you cannot fix \nthe system without covering everybody. If you don't cover everybody, \nthe people who are uninsured shift their bills to the insured, and they \nshift the most expensive bills. So my view is my party has been right \non the question of coverage, and it is time to get all Americans good \nquality, affordable health care.\n  I also believe Republicans have contributed significantly because we \ndo need a strong private sector, one that encourages innovation, one \nthat steers clear of price controls and a one-size-fits-all Federal \nsolution. So I think there is opportunity now for private sector \nchoices as well as expanding coverage. Again, President Obama has \nincluded that kind of thinking, Chairman Baucus has, Chairman Kennedy \nhas, and we have it in the Healthy Americans Act as well.\n  Some are saying--and we have heard this repeatedly in recent weeks--\nthat our country, with our fragile economy, can't afford health care \nreform. I am of the view that our economy can't afford the status quo. \nIf you think about what is going on in North Carolina, the reason \npeople's take-home pay doesn't go up is because it is all going to \nhealth care. The fact is that fixing the economy and fixing health care \nare two sides of the same coin. The Obama administration--particularly \nPeter Orszag, the Budget Director--has long recognized this.\n  The President was right to say that after 60 years of talking about \nhealth care, he didn't want to wait until year 61 to get something \ndone; he wanted to do it this year. Today, by appointing Kathleen \nSebelius and Nancy-Ann DeParle, he got these efforts off to a very \nstrong start.\n  This Thursday we will have a health care summit. Proponents, \nopponents, and those of differing views will be around the table. \nAgain, the President has made the right call by inviting some who \nhaven't been advocates for health care reform in the past. But I think \nwe are seeing a dramatic departure from a lot of the positions of the \npast, and that is what is going to make Thursday's session very \nexciting and I believe very productive.\n  For example, in 1993 and 1994, when our country debated health care \nreform under the Clinton plan, the business community said, We can't \nafford to fix health care. Now the business community--businesses small \nand large and of all philosophies--are saying, We can't afford the \nstatus quo. Chairman Baucus and Chairman Kennedy and their ranking \nminority members, Chuck Grassley and Mike Enzi, have a long record of \nbeing able to work in a bipartisan fashion to build on those new \nsentiments coming from the business community.\n  I believe Senator Bennett and I, with the 13 Senators who are part of \nthe Healthy Americans Act coalition, can bring to the President, can \nbring to our chairs and ranking minority members, some ideas that can \npick up bipartisan support. They know we are anxious to work with them \nand to work with them quickly. To stick to the President's timetable is \ngoing to require that kind of bipartisan goodwill, and I believe it is \nnow there.\n  I believe that the health care challenge in this country, with \nexploding costs and demographics that are relentless, requires a lot of \nthe old thinking be set aside. I believe it is doable. In the course of \nthe last 2 years, I have had a chance to visit more than 80 of our \ncolleagues in their offices, to listen to them, to get their thoughts \non what needs to be done in health care, and to a person, I found a \ndesire to act and to act now.\n  I think, as the President knows, you can't have a town meeting--\nwhether it is North Carolina or Oregon, or anywhere else in this \ncountry--without health care dominating the discussion. So this \nThursday provides an opportunity to bring people together. We will have \nthe nominations of Kathleen Sebelius and Nancy-Ann DeParle going \nforward. I am certain they are going to be approved with very \nsubstantial bipartisan support, and then we will be down to the task of \nwriting legislation.\n  On the key issues there is agreement among reformers. Clearly, you \nhave to cover everybody to stop cost shifting. You have to change the \ninsurance model so that instead of spending time scouring out the bad \nrisks and taking only healthy people, there is a different model of \nprivate insurance where plans compete on the basis of price, benefit \nand quality. We are going to come together and make sure we are \npurchasing value for our health care dollar.\n  Dr. Orszag has pointed out on many occasions that something like 30 \npercent of the health care dollar goes for services of little or no \nvalue. That is these services don't help patients get healthier. \nChairman Baucus and Chairman Kennedy have some good ideas for changing \nthat as well.\n  I think, finally, there will be a very sharp new focus on prevention \nand wellness. When Senator Bennett and I were talking about the Healthy \nAmericans Act, we thought there were a number of key areas we felt \nstrongly about. But what we felt most strongly about was getting a new \nemphasis on prevention and wellness. That is why we called it the \nHealthy Americans Act--because to a great extent, Madam President, we \ndon't have health care at all in this country. We have sick care.\n  Medicare Part A, the biggest health care program in our country, will \npay thousands of dollars for senior citizens' hospital bills, and \nMedicare Part B, on the other hand, will not do anything to award \nprevention and to keep people healthy. So in the Healthy Americans Act \nwe say seniors who make efforts to lower their blood pressure or lower \ntheir cholesterol will get lower Part B premiums.\n  The fact is, the entire health system does little to encourage \nprevention. For example, with the typical workers changing their jobs \nevery few years--right now the workers, by the time they are 40, change \ntheir jobs 11 times--there is not a great incentive for private \ninsurers to invest in prevention. So what the President seeks to do--\nand Chairman Baucus, Chairman Kennedy, Senator Bennett, myself, \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee who is part of \nour legislation--we are saying let's make health coverage portable so \nyou can take it from place to place as you change your job, and in the \nfuture private insurance companies will have an incentive to invest in \nwellness and prevention and good health care because people will be \nstaying with them. In today's system, when workers jump from one job to \nanother every year or year and a half there is no incentive for the \ninsurance company to invest in your health.\n  Madam President, I said the planet was aligning for the cause of \nhealth reform. With the appointment of two true stars, Kathleen \nSebelius and Nancy-Ann DeParle, the President took another significant \nstep toward achieving our goal today. I believe, after 60 years of \nbickering about this subject--it literally goes back to the 81st \nCongress with Harry Truman--there is new momentum for an enduring fix \nfor the challenges of American health care. To make an enduring \nsolution to those challenges requires that Democrats and Republicans \ncome together. I think that is going to be possible with both parties \nhaving the ability to secure major objectives they have worked for in \nthe past.\n  With Thursday's summit coming up, I think the American people will \nsee that now the hard work is going to go forward. This time, after \nyears and years of polarizing debates, there is going to be an \nopportunity to come together. I believe the Congress, with the \nleadership of President Obama, is going to take that opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I would like to speak to the fiscal year \n2009 appropriations bill, or what we call the\n\n[[Page S2611]]\n\nOmnibus appropriations bill, that is before us right now, beginning \nwith a general discussion and then some of the concerns that many of us \non the Republican side have with this legislation.\n  As I think most folks know, this is the second half of funding for \nthe fiscal year we are in right now. The first half went through \nMarch--or basically through the end of this coming week--and then the \nsecond half of the year we said we would do late, and that is this \nlegislation. I will discuss more of the process later, but the reason \nthis was done in two pieces, I think, is twofold.\n  First of all, the majority was not able to get the entire bill done \nlast year, either intentionally or because it represented a lot of \nwork--although that is the way we do it every other year--and second, I \nthink there was a feeling there was a good likelihood they would add to \ntheir numbers on the majority side and potentially have a Democratic \nPresident, and so there may be some policy changes and other changes \nthey would want to make in the legislation that they would have an \neasier chance to get passed than if they had done that when there were \nmore Republicans in this body, for example, and a Republican President \nwho could veto the bill.\n  I say that because some of the things that are in this bill clearly \nrepresent changes from what was going to be the funding for this fiscal \nyear until this special process was indulged. I do think and hope my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side appreciate one of the reasons \nRepublicans have concerns about this are these changes that have been \nmade.\n  In general terms, the $410 billion funding level is $32 billion or 8 \npercent higher than the fiscal year 2008 enacted level. At a time when \nwe are suffering from pretty tough economic times, this is a pretty \nhealthy increase in spending over last year. According to the House \nRepublican appropriators, if you exempt the 9/11 funding in the bill, \nit is the largest increase in annual discretionary spending since the \nCarter administration. The bill is long--it is 1,124 pages long--and in \naddition to that there is a 1,000-page joint explanatory statement.\n  I confess I have not gotten through all of those things. But staff \nhave tried to read through it and have identified some of the things I \nwant to discuss this afternoon.\n  If you add the bills we did pass to fund the Government for the \nentire year--the Defense bill, Homeland Security and Military \nConstruction--then the total of the discretionary funding for the year \nwill exceed $1 trillion for the first time in the history of the United \nStates.\n  So it is a big spending bill. The total, as I said, is about $21 \nbillion above President Bush's fiscal year 2009 request.\n  Some of the spending concerns specifically are the following: \nProbably the biggest is the fact that when we did the so-called \nstimulus bill, we spent almost $1 trillion. Much of that was spent on \nprograms that are actually imbedded in this Omnibus appropriations \nbill. Constituents may be a little bit confused on that point. We know \nthey know we have an appropriations bill that got us started on the \nyear 2009.\n  They know we had this $1 trillion-plus so-called stimulus bill. So \nwhy are we doing an Omnibus appropriations bill on top of that? It is a \ngood question, especially in those areas where there is duplicative \nfunding, which there is a lot of. There are 122 programs that already \nreceived hundreds of billions of dollars in the stimulus bill. You \nwould think they would not be included in this bill, so that you had \nduplicate spending.\n  But, no, they were both in the stimulus bill and also in this bill. \nAccording to, again, the House Appropriations Committee Republicans, \nthe omnibus and stimulus together include $680 billion for new \nprograms. There are also program expansions, there is one-time \nspending. If you add all these things together, you have an 80-percent \nincrease in the funds for those accounts over the 2008 level. Think of \nthat, an 80-percent increase.\n  Now, you can even rationalize maybe a 6- or 8-percent increase over \nthe previous year. But an 80-percent increase? That is obviously way \ntoo much. Just a couple of examples of things that got into this bill. \nThere is $15 million for beginning of a study for a new House office \nbuilding. I served time in the House of Representatives, and actually \nworked in two different office buildings in the House. Working in the \nRayburn House Office Building, a beautiful new building, there is \nplenty of room.\n  I think we would all like bigger space, but is that something we want \nto be spending money on this year, given our current economic \nenvironment and the fact that we just got through funding the new \nCongressional Visitor Center, which was massively over budget?\n  But more important than some of these spending items are the policy \nconcerns. These are the areas of the bill that certainly Republicans \nwould not have agreed to as part of the process: School Choice for the \nDistrict of Columbia. This bill effectively eliminates the School \nChoice Program by prohibiting any student from participating in the \nprogram after the 2009-2010 school year unless Congress reauthorizes \nthe program and the DC Council approves the bill. So you are setting up \ntwo big roadblocks to the continuation of what has been a very popular \nprogram for folks in the District of Columbia.\n  A provision on greenhouse gas emissions. This bill, with this \nprovision, taxes a large step toward allowing the Endangered Species \nAct to literally be used to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, although \nit was obviously never intended for that purpose.\n  Specifically, it allows the Interior Department to withdraw two \nspecific Endangered Species Act rules within 60 days of enactment \nwithout any public notice or comment. The practical effect of this rule \nwithdrawal is that any acts that increase carbon dioxide or greenhouse \ngas emissions, which means almost anything we do, since, of course, we \nbreathe carbon dioxide, would be subject to a lawsuit if it did not \nfirst consult the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on mitigation against \npotential impacts of climate change and harm to polar bears. That is \nthe specific rule we are talking about.\n  Examples of actions subject would include construction projects, \nenergy production, agricultural practices, to name a few. This is a \nradical departure from anything we have done in the past. It is a \npolicy change that most Republicans simply cannot agree with.\n  There is something called nominal drug pricing, which would allow \nPlanned Parenthood and other organizations to buy certain drugs for \nnominal prices and then resell those drugs at a profit. This is not \nwhat they are in business to do.\n  There is a very controversial section on family travel to Cuba. \nSection 620 and 621 of the Financial Services Division weakens the \nexisting travel restrictions to Cuba. Now, that is the kind of serious \npolicy which we need to have a serious policy debate about in this \nCongress. Is that the kind of thing we want to include in this \nappropriations bill? I think not.\n  The so-called Kemp-Kasten: Section 7079(b). This is a section we have \nhad in the law forever. This particular section includes language which \nwould undermine this longstanding Kemp-Kasten language. I said \n``forever.'' It has been since 1984. It is a provision that denies \nFederal funding for organizations that are involved with coercive \nabortions. While the Kemp-Kasten provisions are still intact in the \nomnibus, an exemption is created for a very important organization, the \nU.S. Population Fund or the UNFPA, which is a controversial program \nthat the United States has not funded in the past due to its past \ninvolvement with China's one-child policy. Again, it is a very \nimportant change in policy. If we are going to do things such as that, \nwe should debate it on the floor of the House and Senate and make a \ndecision, not just fold them into an appropriations bill.\n  Finally, we hear a lot on the earmarks these days. I was surprised to \nlearn this bill includes earmarks totalling about $7.7 billion, 8,750 \nearmarks, allegedly. Nobody argues that every single expenditure \nCongress directs is inappropriate, especially if they have already been \nauthorized. But I suspect that in these 8,750 earmarks, there is an \nawful lot that does not represent authorized spending by the Congress.\n  I would note that the three security-related appropriations bills \nenacted last fall added another $6.6 billion in earmarks, which would \nbring the total\n\n[[Page S2612]]\n\nin this bill to $14.3 billion in disclosed earmarks. That is not \nacceptable.\n  The President supported an amendment to the budget resolution for \n2009, the so-called DeMint amendment, with Senator McCain and Senator \nClinton, to establish an earmark moratorium for fiscal year 2009. The \nvote on that failed 29 to 71. But I would hope the President, as a \nresult of his position on this, would weigh in.\n  Finally, I mentioned in the very beginning the process, how we got to \nthis point. Why are we considering, after a recordbreaking stimulus \nbill of over $1 trillion, why are we passing another appropriations \nbill now, before we have done a budget for this year and before we do \nthe appropriations bills for the coming year? Well, it is because last \nyear the Congress did not fund the entire year of Federal agency \nfunding. Congress only funded the first 6 months.\n  Some people like to blame President Bush for this. President Bush had \nnothing to do with it. He was the President. He does not write the \nappropriations bills. He does not pass the appropriations bills in the \nCongress. I really think, as I said, it was a combination of factors.\n  For one thing, some bills, at least one that I know--well, two--the \nInterior bill and the legislative branch bill--were never passed out of \ncommittee. President Bush had nothing to do with that. It is a failure \nof Congress to get these bills passed out of the committee. Remember \nthat the Interior bill never got out of Committee in either the House \nor Senate because the majority was worried about taking the offshore \ndrilling, the so-called oil shale and OCS oil exploration and drilling \nvotes.\n  That bill got out of neither committee. It had nothing to do with the \nPresident. Given the delay in bringing the omnibus bill to the floor; \nin other words, waiting until the very week in which the resolution \nthat funded the first half of the Government expires, we are clearly \ntaking a chance that either we are going to rush through this and not \ngive it appropriate time or we are going to have a continuing \nresolution of at least some length of time. I presume it should not \nhave to be for very long, but I would find it very doubtful that we \ncould pass this bill, especially with the other things we have to do \ntomorrow, before the end of Thursday evening of this week. So there \nwill be a lot of amendments, obviously, proposed to it. I think we \nshould expect right now we will have to at least extend for a few days \nthe funding for the second half of the year.\n  My own thought would be we should actually have something like a \ncontinuing resolution for the remainder of the year, especially if the \nprice for not doing that is to adopt these many policy changes which \nare serious, significant, and require a lot more debate on the Senate \nfloor than simply having been included in an appropriations bill, that \nwould not enable them to get the kind of debate that I think ordinarily \nwould attend to them.\n  This is the outline of the bill we have before us. Obviously, we are \ngoing to have a lot of amendments to it. Some will deal with the \namounts of money in the bill, others will deal with the policy that is \nembedded in the bill. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwould be willing to allow this debate, a fulsome debate, with the \namendments that need to be offered, in order to conclude the bill in a \nresponsible fashion.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Peaceful Reunification of Cyprus\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in the last few decades we have seen \nhistoric changes around the world--the end of apartheid in South \nAfrica, the peaceful collapse of the Soviet Union, the dismantling of \nthe Berlin Wall, a wave of democratization across Eastern Europe and \nLatin America. My mother's homeland, her land of birth, the country of \nLithuania, was once occupied by Nazis and then the Soviets. Today, it \nis a free, prosperous, democratic nation. These have all been moments \nof hope and inspiration. Yet, sadly, despite so much progress, we \ncontinue to be challenged by a number of longstanding internal \nconflicts in different corners of the world. From Sudan, to Kashmir, to \nSri Lanka, internal divisions in the historical grievances have led to \ndivided people and unnecessary human suffering.\n  Recently, during the Presidents Day break 2 weeks ago, I had the \nopportunity to visit one such impasse that today shows at least the \npromise for resolution--the island of Cyprus. U.N. peacekeepers first \ncame to Cyprus in 1964 due to intercommunal fighting. Since 1974, \nCyprus has been divided into the government-controlled two-thirds of \nthe island and the remaining one-third of the island which is \nadministered by Turkish Cypriots. The Republic of Cyprus, which joined \nthe European Union in 2004, continues to be the only internationally \nrecognized government on the island.\n  Tragically, Cyprus has been divided now for more than 30 years, with \nthe U.N. buffer zone separating the entire island, the so-called green \nline. Violence today is rare, thank goodness, but the long-term impacts \nof the separation are stark--displaced people, memories of family \nmembers killed in earlier violence, and lost property rights. Quite \nsimply, a people who share a common island have been unnecessarily \ndivided for far too long.\n  In recent years, a number of important steps have been taken to \nimprove relations toward eventual reunification. Crossing points \nbetween the two sides have opened. Thousands of people pass peacefully \nbetween the two sides of the island without incident.\n  A Committee on Missing Persons comprised of scientists from both the \nTurkish and Greek Cypriot communities has been established. Of all the \nthings we visited during the course of the 48 hours, an intensive \nvisitation on the island of Cyprus, it is a cruel irony that one of the \nmost hopeful was this Committee on Missing Persons. This is what they \ndo. They have identified some 2,000 missing people, in some 40 years or \nmore, 1,500 on the Greek side, 500 on the Turkish side, and they are \ntrying to find the remains of their loved ones who have been gone for \nso long. They take DNA samples from all members of the family, and then \nthey wait for anonymous, confidential reports of grave sites. They send \ntheir archeologists out to excavate the grave sites, bring the skeletal \nremains into a laboratory, where scientists, both Turkish and Greek, \ntry to reassemble skeletons and then take DNA samples and link them \nwith families who reported missing persons. So far, over 130 of those \nmissing persons have been identified. They have been brought back to \ntheir families. There has been a moment of closure and peace.\n  One would think, because these people disappeared in the most \ntumultuous and violent times, that, in fact, this would be another \nexcuse, another opportunity for exploitation politically. But it \ndoesn't happen. These families, after waiting for decades, have finally \ncome to closure with the death of their loved one and really want to \nlook forward. It is a very sober and dignified program and one that \ngives me some hope for this island, that people whose lives have been \ntouched with violence can still find their way to peaceful resolution \nin their own minds when they finally are given the remains of someone \nthey love. Thus far, no politician has taken advantage of these \nidentifications to further more division or mistrust.\n  Most importantly, today there are two leaders who are extraordinary. \nDemetris Christofias is the President of the Republic of Cyprus. Mehmet \nAli Talat leads the other side of the island on the Turkish side. They \nare engaged in serious negotiations to reunify the island. I had a \nchance to meet with both of them, speak to them at length. At great \npolitical risk, they are sitting down to try to work out their \ndifficulties. They need help. They need the support of the Greek and \nTurkish Governments because although they may not have a direct \npresence--in the case of Turkey, their troops are there, and there is a \ndirect presence--there is a community of interest between the\n\n[[Page S2613]]\n\nTurkish Cypriots and Turkey and the Greek Cypriots and Greece. The \nsupport of those two nations can be very helpful in bringing the \npeaceful reunification of the island.\n  Christofias and Ali Talat are friends. They have made a peaceful and \nlasting agreement, or at least they have worked for one which unifies \nthe island their top priority, and it should be one we encourage and \nsupport. Their efforts are brave and forward-thinking. They are to be \ncommended for working to make history for the people of Cyprus.\n  While the negotiations are a Cypriot-led process, the United Nations \nhas a representative and special adviser, Alexander Downer, whom I met \nwith and who is trying to find ways to bring the two sides together. He \nis an important symbol of the world's interest in the effort to find \nlasting peace on the island. We need to support his work.\n  After visiting Cyprus, I had the opportunity to visit both Greece and \nTurkey, two key NATO allies and friends of the United States. I was \nheartened there by leaders in both countries expressing hope for the \npeaceful reunification of the island of Cyprus.\n  These are important and inspiring steps forward, but there is still a \ngreat deal to be done toward final agreement. Many issues still need to \nbe negotiated, and there is room for more confidence-building measures \nsuch as the Committee on Missing Persons and the opening of more \ncrossing points. I am also concerned that failure to reach some kind of \nagreement this year may result in missing one of the most hopeful, \nperhaps last great opportunities in recent times to reunify the island.\n  For more than a generation, the situation in Cyprus has left an \nisland and a region divided. People have died. Families have been \nseparated. There has been a great deal of pain inflicted on the people \nof this island.\n  Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey are all friends of the United States and \nimportant to the region. While this is a Cypriot-led process and \nnegotiation, I wish to express my strong hope and support for the \ncurrent negotiations to bring peaceful and enduring settlement to the \nisland.\n  One of the last visits I made, as I left Turkey, was to stop in \nIstanbul and meet with the Ecumenical Patriarch, the leader of the \nGreek Orthodox church. The Patriarch represents a church that has been \nin Istanbul for 17 centuries. There are now about 5,000 Greek Orthodox \nleft in Istanbul. It is a small and dwindling community. But Istanbul \nas a city has a great symbolic importance to the patriarch and his \nchurch. He told me one of his highest priorities was the closing of the \nHalki Seminary 38 years ago. I told him I would reach out to the \nTurkish side in the hopes that they would meet with the patriarch and \nreopen discussions about this issue. I recently spoke to Secretary of \nState Hillary Clinton about this as well. I know she is headed to the \nMiddle East. I hope she will raise it.\n  This gentle man, the Ecumenical Patriarch, is asking for a chance for \na seminary class so that his priests and bishops can be trained and \nprepared for the priesthood and for the hierarchy of his church. It is \nnot an unreasonable request. I hope there is a way we can find within \nthe constitution, within the laws, within the treaties involving Turkey \nto give them this opportunity. This gentle man, who prays for peace \nevery day, should be rewarded with the reopening of his seminary. I \nhope the leaders of Turkey in Ankara, who were kind enough to meet with \nme, will find a way after decades to reopen these negotiations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Realities In Cuba\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, there will be parts of my comments \nthat, for historical purposes, will be said in Spanish, and then I will \ntranslate them into English, so I ask unanimous consent that be \npermitted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, February 16 of this year marked 50 \nyears since the revolution in Cuba that brought Fidel Castro and his \nbrother, Raul, to power. Some have used this anniversary as an \nopportunity to put forth some romantic views of the revolution. So I \nhave come to the floor to talk about the realities of the situation in \nCuba. The reality is that this golden anniversary for the Castros is an \nimpoverished anniversary for the rest of the country.\n  Over the course of 50 years, the tides of romanticism have come and \ngone, but they have always crashed hard against the rocks of reality. \nAll the pictures of Che Guevara on T-shirts cannot hide the brutality \nof the declaration he made before the United Nations in 1964. He said \nthen:\n\n     hemos fusilado, fusilamos y seguiremos fusilando mientras sea \n     necesario--\n\n  Translated that means:\n\n       [W]e have executed people, we execute people now and we \n     will continue executing people for as long as we deem \n     necessary.\n\n  No words better sum up the character of the revolution. The Cuban \nregime has bent and gilded the spirit of their people over a rotten \ncore of brutality, depravation, and fear.\n  Here are the realities of the last five decades on the island:\n  According to the Free Society Project of the Cuban Archive, which has \nverification for every case, the number of people the regime has \nmurdered or abducted numbers in the thousands, if not the tens of \nthousands. Hundreds of thousands of children have been separated from \ntheir parents. Millions of men, women, and young people have been \nforced into the fields to cut sugarcane and perform other hard labor \nagainst their will.\n  Here are the realities of Cuba today:\n  The Government is, pure and simple, a brutal dictatorship. Every now \nand then, the regime stages meaningless elections with 609 candidates, \nall 609 chosen by the regime, vying for only 609 seats in a National \nAssembly that does not do anything without the approval of the Castro \nbrothers.\n  Despite fertile soil and perfect climate, as well as significant \nfinancial assistance, access to food is tightly rationed. The average \nCuban worker lives on an income of less than $1 a day.\n  World Bank statistics show that fewer people have telephones, \ntelevisions, computers, and cars than in almost any other country in \nLatin America. The regime makes sure as few people as possible can use \nthe Internet, so that the percentage of people who have access in Cuba \nis less than in Haiti.\n  The regime's claims about great progress in health care and education \nare immediately undermined by the costs paid--in lives lost, economic \nopportunities stolen, and freedoms denied. The island was not rich in \n1959. Yet Cubans have fewer opportunities to get ahead than they did 50 \nyears ago.\n  Across a wide variety of indicators of human development, Cuba has \nwatched other countries in Latin America make similar or even greater \ngains. This poverty has an enormous cost. The widespread desperation of \nfamilies has forced far too many young girls and boys into becoming sex \nworkers, even though defenders of the revolution constantly cite the \nelimination of prostitution as one of its supposed accomplishments. In \nfact, a few years ago, Cuba was listed by Voyeur Magazine as the sex \ntourism hotspot of the world. So much for that success of the \nrevolution of eliminating prostitution.\n  The Castro revolution has been most adept not at spreading education \nand prosperity but at instilling penetrating fear and terror, \nperpetuating their own power through a Stalinist police state.\n  The Cuban security forces were trained to torture by the dreaded \nStasi of East Germany and carry on that legacy today. If you doubt \nthat, ask Senator McCain about one of his torturers in Vietnam, a Cuban \nagent.\n  The world has expressed outrage at the treatment of detainees in the \nprison at Guantanamo Bay, and President Obama announced he would close \nit within a year. When the news of that decision reached Juan Carlos \nHerrera Acosta, who has spent more than 6 years in jail for his \npolitical views, he said:\n\n       Cuando el mundo abrira sus ojos y dira que hay \n     que cerrar los otros guantanamos que existen en Cuba?\n\n  Translated that means:\n\n       When will the world open its eyes and say that it's time to \n     close the other Guantanamos in Cuba?\n\n  There is no excuse for turning a blind eye to the 300 other prisons \non the island, prisons that make Guantanamo Bay look tame by \ncomparison.\n  Armando Valladares, who wrote the prize-winning book ``Against All\n\n[[Page S2614]]\n\nHope,'' was imprisoned in the infamous Isla de Pinos in 1960 for his \nopposition to communism. He lived through the hell of Castro's jail, \nsuffering violence, forced labor, and solitary confinement.\n  His writings were smuggled out, read throughout the world, and he was \nfinally released after intense international pressure, 22 years after \nhe was taken prisoner. Here are some of his memories of his captivity:\n\n       I recall the two sergeants, Porfirio and Matanzas, plunging \n     their bayonets into Ernesto Diaz Madruga's body. . . . \n     Boitel, denied water, after more than fifty days on a hunger \n     strike, because Castro wanted him dead; Clara, Boitel's poor \n     mother, beaten by Lieutenant Abad in a Political Police \n     station just because she wanted to find out where her son was \n     buried. . . . Officers . . . threatened family members if \n     they cried at a funeral.\n       I remember Estebita and Piri dying in blackout cells, the \n     victims of biological experimentation. . . . So many others \n     murdered in the forced-labor fields, quarries and camps. A \n     legion of specters, naked, crippled, hobbling and crawling \n     through my mind, and the hundreds of men mutilated in the \n     horrifying searches [they went through].\n       Eduardo Capote's fingers chopped off by a machete. \n     Concentration camps, tortures, women beaten. . . .\n       And in the midst of that apocalyptic vision of the most \n     dreadful and horrifying moments in my life, in the midst of \n     the gray, ashy dust and the orgy of beatings and blood, \n     prisoners beaten to the ground, a man emerged, the skeletal \n     figure of a man wasted by hunger with white hair, blazing \n     blue eyes, and a heart overflowing with love, raising his \n     arms to the invisible heaven and pleading for mercy for his \n     executioners.\n       ``Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do.'' \n     And a burst of machine-gun fire ripping open his chest.\n\n  Those are Armando Valladares' live memories of the 22 years he spent \nin Castro's jails.\n  This has been going on since 1959, but, unfortunately, it is not a \nthing of the past.\n  In 2003, armed security forces raided 22 libraries and sent 14 \nlibrarians to jail with terms of up to 26 years in prison, simply \nbecause they established a library in their community. Oh how dreadful \nis the power of a book that could cause those people who created \nlibraries to spend a quarter of a century in prison.\n  That year, it rounded up 75 journalists, human rights activists and \nopposition leaders and gave them summary trials and sent them to jail \nfor up to 28 years.\n  To put a human face on this, because sometimes we talk about \ndictatorships and the consequences of their actions and we talk about \npeople in mass numbers--but these are the faces: Oswaldo Paya; Marta \nBeatriz Roque; Oscar Espinosa Chepe; Armando Valladares, whom I quoted; \nand others who actually languish inside the jails in Cuba and who have \nbeen beaten and/or who ultimately have been harassed in the pursuit of \npeaceful civil society movements.\n  In 2003, Fidel Castro ordered one of the most sweeping, brutal \ncrackdowns on opposition figures in years--a roundup of 75 dissidents \nand their summary trials.\n  In that black spring, his agents took away Marta Beatriz Roque. She \nis an economist, a leader of a group called the Assembly for Promoting \nCivil Society, a coalition of nongovernmental organizations dedicated \nto peaceful democratic change on the island. In 2003, she was sentenced \nto 20 years behind bars for the crime of wanting peaceful change, for \nthe crime of speaking her mind.\n  In prison, her diabetes and blood pressure made her so ill that the \nregime let her leave her tiny cell. But they did not let her go far. \nTwo years later, the Government sent a mob to attack her as she was \ntraveling to meet a U.S. diplomat. They beat her. And when she tried to \nleave to get medical care, they trapped her in her home. She was 60 \nyears old.\n  Now, every day of her life, she knows she could wake up and be thrown \nin a cell once more, left to die for the crime of thinking independent \nthoughts, for the crime of asking for change.\n  During the crackdown in the spring of 2003, Fidel Castro also \narrested Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet. Dr. Biscet founded the Lawton \nFoundation for Human Rights, one of the first independent civic groups \nin Havana.\n  On February 27, 1999, he was arrested for hanging the national flag \nsideways at a press conference, and he was sentenced to 3 years in \njail. He was protesting the forced abortions he was ordered to perform. \nAfter his release, he organized seminars on the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights for Cubans. And he was arrested again in December of \n2002 for organizing these seminars.\n  In April of 2003, he was sentenced to 25 years in jail and sent to a \nspecial state prison. I have, in the Chamber, this picture of his jail \ncell. His dark, damp cell is barely bigger than he is. In 2007, he was \nawarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor \nthis country gives to anyone. But he still has not won something far \nmore important: his own freedom. He still languishes in a cell like \nthis.\n  It is a myth that detentions of activists has dropped off since Raul \nCastro, Fidel Castro's brother, took power. More than 1,500 were \nrounded up last year, according to the Cuban Commission on Human Rights \nand National Reconciliation, an independent observer group. They may be \nreleased temporarily, but they are always subject to rearrest.\n  Multiple human rights organizations confirm that the Cuban regime is \nstill holding more than 200 political prisoners whom we know of--\nindependent journalists, economists, human rights workers, and doctors \nall jailed for speaking their minds.\n  In the United States, we saw an election last year that was all about \na powerful call for change. The year before, 70 young Cuban youth were \nwalking down the streets of Havana and detained simply for wearing a \nwhite wristband that has one simple word on it: ``CAMBIO''--``Change.'' \nAll they did was wear a simple, white wristband to express what they \nwanted to see.\n  While in the United States, the mantra of change can get you elected \nto the Presidency of the United States. In Cuba, the mere suggestion of \nchange can get you arrested. What an irony.\n  The dictatorship maintains a network of spies on every single block. \nIt is called ``El Comite por la Defensa de la Revolucion.'' It is a \nblock-watch organization in every city, in every village, in every \nhamlet. If they suspect you, first, you will find yourself quietly \ndemoted at work. Then you will lose your job. You will wake up one \nmorning and your house will be covered in graffiti calling your family \nworms. You will walk outside and four former friends will now spit in \nyour path.\n\n  The case of Adolfo Fernandez Sainz could hardly be more \nrepresentative. He is a journalist forced to spend 15 years of his life \nbehind bars, in part for the crime of owning the novel by George \nOrwell, ``1984.'' Fifteen years of his life behind bars.\n  But the saddest proof that a country is operated like a prison is \nwhen people are shot trying to escape. It was a hallmark of Soviet \nRussia and East Germany, Communist Hungary and Czechoslovakia, but \ntoday the Caribbean is the Cuban's Berlin Wall. All boats and building \nmaterials belong to the State, so taking a shipment to the waters or \neven building a raft can be considered crimes, often punishable by \ndeath. Cuban planes have attacked ships from the air. The Cuban Navy \nhas attacked ships from the sea, surrounding boats, sinking them, \nsending men, women, and children to the bottom of the ocean.\n  The Cuba Archive has documented almost 250 cases of assassinations as \npeople fled, in addition to the countless thousands who have died at \nsea, either drowning or being killed by sharks. Those Florida Straits, \nas people searched for freedom, are the burial grounds of so many that \nwe don't know.\n  Cubans know the risks, and yet they continue to seek freedom. Since \n2005, the Washington Post cites the number who have fled to America or \nsought to flee to America at 80,000--some of the country's best and \nbrightest, risking arrest and death, leaving under the cover of \ndarkness. Since 1959, according to the Center for the Study of \nInternational Migrations, nearly 1.7 million Cubans have been forced \ninto exile.\n  For those who cannot leave, there is another sign of despair on the \nisland. The World Health Organization data reveals a sad fact: that \nCuba has one of the highest suicide rates in the hemisphere.\n  For over five decades we have seen democracy take hold in every \ncountry on the Western Hemisphere but one--one island, suspended in the \npast, resisting the tide of history, its people\n\n[[Page S2615]]\n\nwaiting for something to change. In 1962, the United States restricted \ncommerce within travel to Cuba. It stands as a legal, political, and \nmoral statement that we reject the dictatorship's abuses and it serves \nas a way to weaken the regime. At the beginning, it was embargoed in \nname only. U.S. foreign subsidiaries were allowed to freely commerce \nwith Cuba and it wasn't until the mid-1980s that these loopholes were \nclosed. The Cuba Democracy Act and later the Libertad Act caused the \nCuban regime to downsize what had become the third largest military per \ncapita in the Western Hemisphere. That was good for the Cuban people \nand good for the hemisphere because Castro could no longer send his \ntroops to promote revolution and to destabilize Latin American \ncountries.\n  But that came about not out of ideological change by the Castro \nbrothers; it came about as a result of economic necessity. The U.S. \ndollar--the most hated symbol of the revolution and illegal to own for \nquite some time--is now eagerly sought by the regime, creating a divide \nin Cuba. It is a divide between those who have access to U.S. dollars \nfrom their families and can use them at state-run dollar stores with \nprices that gouge those Cubans--and millions who have no family to send \nthem dollars and chafe at that disparity. They question a regime that \ndoesn't allow the freedom to work at jobs such as tourism and others, \nthat might give them access to those dollars. This conflict exists \nbecause these circumstances came about not as a change in Castro's \nideology; they came about because of economic necessity. Economic \nnecessity, not ideological change, further drove the regime to accept \ninternational investment--specifically, in tourism and mining--\nsomething that was also previously illegal. This has created resentment \nby Cubans who are sent to work at these establishments by a state \nemployment agency; and where the Cuban who goes to work at these \nforeign companies, their labor is sent there, they have to go work \nthere, they get paid in worthless Cuban pesos, while the state gets \npaid in dollars for their labor. They get a fraction of the cost of \ntheir labor.\n  In addition, foreign companies summarily fire workers without \nrecourse and get new workers from the state employment agency--no \nquestions asked. Cubans have been denied access to visit these hotels \nin their own country and now--only now--are they told they can do so if \nthey can pay hundreds of dollars a night when they make less than a \ndollar a day.\n  Notwithstanding these economic challenges that have created pressure \nfor change in Cuba, opponents of the embargo are quick to point out \nthat it has been in place for many years and the Castros remain in \npower. They seem very confident that allowing more American money to \nflow into Cuba will magically topple the regime. The truth is their \nprediction about cause and effect runs completely contrary to what has \nactually happened there. Over the years, millions of Europeans, \nCanadians, Mexicans, South and Central Americans, among others, have \nvisited Cuba, invested in Cuba, spent billions of dollars, signed trade \nagreements, and engaged politically. And what has been the result of \nall of that money and all of that engagement? The regime has not opened \nup; on the contrary, it has used resources to become more oppressive. \nForeign funds often temporarily reach the hands of Cuban families, but \nthey are then forced to spend those dollars in government-run dollar \nstores so that the money ultimately winds up in the hands of the Cuban \nGovernment and many suspect in the secret bank accounts of the \nCommunist Party elite.\n  So allowing Americans to sit on beaches which Cubans cannot visit \nunless they work there; smoking a Cuban cigar for which a worker gets \nslave wages, sipping a Cuba libre, which is an oxymoron, will not bring \nthe Cuban people their liberty. When the government isn't manipulating \ninternational aid, it sometimes rejects it altogether, as it did during \nlast year's hurricane season, further punishing its people.\n  So I ask those who argue that lifting the economic embargo on Cuba \nmeans the demise of the Castro regime--nothing I would want to see \nmore--why, then, has lifting the embargo been the No. 1 foreign policy \nobjective of the Castro regime? Does it seek its own demise after 50 \nyears? Certainly not. What it seeks is the economic viability to \ncontinue to perpetuate itself.\n  But beyond the practical realities, I think there is also a broader \nprinciple at stake. Now, as power has passed somewhat--because Fidel is \nstill alive--from Fidel to Raul, from one dictator to another, are we \nto declare that their tyranny outlasted our will to resist it? When a \nmurderer escapes the police and is a fugitive, do we declare them \ninnocent after a few years because we haven't caught them? Should we \nsuddenly say it is too much for the Cuban people to be able to decide \nfor themselves what course their nation will take? Should we decide to \nsuddenly legitimize the behavior of the regime and strengthen its \nability to continue perpetuating crimes? Which one of the freedoms we \nseek for the Cuban people as a condition of our full engagement as a \ncountry are we willing to deny them? Which one--free speech, free \nassociation, freedom of religion, freedom to politically organize and \nelect their own leadership? Which one? Which one of those freedoms that \nwe are willing to say to the Cuban people they cannot enjoy are we \nwilling to give up?\n  I have also heard the suggestion from opponents of legal restrictions \non Cuba that the United States has dealt with other brutal \ndictatorships more openly than this one. Those who make that argument \nmust have a strange definition of a successful policy. If we consider \nprison camps and child labor, forced abortions and slavery, violent \nsuppression of protest, Tiananmen Square, ethnic cleansing of Tibet, \nand denial of human rights, be it in China or anywhere around the \nworld, anywhere these violations are happening, if we are willing to \naccept that as successful engagement, I believe we are deeply mistaken. \nThe disregard of human rights violations for the sake of economic gain \nin the past is never an argument to do it again in the future.\n  A full and open discussion of the real situation in Cuba is timely \nfor more reasons than the fiftieth anniversary of Castro's revolution. \nIt is timely because in this Omnibus appropriations bill that we have \nbefore us there are some who have attempted to sneak in changes to our \ncurrent policy. But perhaps the greatest irony of all is that this bill \nincludes three important foreign policy changes with respect to Cuba \nthat have not been subjected to debate in this body. They have not been \nquestioned for their impact on both our national interests and our \nnational security. They have not gone through the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. They have not been subjected to a vote on the floor of \neither the House of Representatives or the Senate. These modifications \ndeserve a full examination. They should be subjected to vigorous \ndebate. We should gather evidence, bring a wide range of voices to the \ntable, and make careful and thoughtful considerations of their \nimplications. But this isn't what is taking place. Instead, this body \nis being asked to swallow these changes in the crudest process I can \nimagine: without analysis, without inclusion, and without debate.\n  Now, supporters of these modifications claimed that they are carrying \nthem out in the hopes of fostering democratic change in Cuba, even as \nthey do so in a way that silences democratic debate in our country. The \nUnited States cannot claim to be a model for democratic process and \ninclusive change if we find ourselves resorting to such undemocratic \nmeans. Jamming these foreign policy changes in an Omnibus \nappropriations package by a handful of Members at the exclusion of the \nrest of this body, not to mention the rest of the other body, and not \nto mention the executive branch, whose jurisdictions these changes fall \nwithin, is simply not democratic.\n  These changes come in the same week that the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee's ranking member, and my very dear, distinguished colleague \nfrom Indiana, Senator Lugar, produced a staff trip report. I have seen \nit quoted as the ``committee's report.'' It is the staff trip report, \nand I respect that it has some value, but it is not the full \ncommittee's undertaking and approval.\n  The memo suggests some of the very things we see in this omnibus. But \ninstead, in my view of a responsible report, this document presents a \nloose\n\n[[Page S2616]]\n\nset of recommendations based upon a few days of observations on the \nisland by a single source, and none of it quotes the fact that there \nwas an engagement with one human rights activist, with one political \ndissident, with one democracy activist, with one independent \njournalist--not one.\n  Now I ask my colleagues: Does it make any sense that we would see \nsuch a basis for a report based upon what are clearly superficial \nobservations, followed by sweeping and untested recommendations about \nhow we should engage with the last totalitarian dictatorship in the \nWestern Hemisphere? Let me point out a few of the main contradictions \nin that report.\n  First, the lack of focus on democracy and human rights in the memo \nwas astonishing to me. In a literal and in a legal sense, support for \nCuba's prodemocracy movement is at the core of United States policy \ntoward Cuba. It is represented in law under the Cuban Liberty and \nDemocratic Solidarity Act of 1996. The report doesn't even mention the \ncentrality of representative democracy in United States policy toward \nCuba and the entire hemisphere. By the same token, the memo does not \neven mention that the United States of America is the world's--the \nworld's--largest provider of humanitarian assistance to the people of \nCuba through both individual assistance and nongovernmental \norganizations.\n  This fact makes it indisputably clear: The focus of United States \npolicy is the Cuban people--not its regime--advocating for their \nfreedom and empowering them to bring change.\n  The way the memo addresses the economic situation on the island is no \nless of an enormous flaw. On the one hand, this memo claims that \neconomic sanctions have been ineffective, but on the other hand, it \nsays: ``Popular dissatisfaction with Cuba's economic situation is the \nregime's vulnerability.''\n  What a contradiction. But it would be even more of a contradiction \nfor the United States to do anything to rescue the regime by improving \nits economic portion, therefore neutralizing its vulnerability. This \nreport says that ``popular dissatisfaction [that people's \ndissatisfaction] with Cuba's economic situation is the regime's \nvulnerability.'' But it would be even more of a contradiction for the \nU.S. to do anything to rescue the regime by improving its economic \nfortunes, therefore neutralizing its vulnerability.\n  Yet that is exactly what one of the recommendations in the memo that \nis included in the omnibus would do. That suggested policy change would \ngive the Cuban regime financial credit to purchase agricultural \nproducts from the United States. On its face, that would seem like a \nconcession to American farmers. We certainly want to see American \nfarmers sell all over the world. But let's think about this for a \nmoment.\n  Anyone applying for even a small loan in our country right now has to \nundergo--if their credit record is poor, they would be rejected for \nthat loan. Well, Cuba's credit history is horrible. The Paris Club of \ncreditor nations recently announced that Cuba has failed to pay almost \n$30 billion in debt. Among poor nations, that is the worst credit \nrecord in the world. So I ask: If the Cuban Government has put off \npaying those it already owes $30 billion, why does anybody think it \nwould meet new financial obligations to American farmers?\n  Considering the serious economic crisis we are facing right now, we \nneed to focus on solutions for hard-working Americans, not subsidies \nfor brutal dictatorships.\n  We should evaluate how to encourage the regime to allow a legitimate \nopening--not in terms of cell phones and hotel rooms that Cubans can't \nafford to own, but in terms of the right to organize, the right to \nthink and speak what they believe.\n  However, what we are doing with this omnibus bill is far from \nevaluation. The process by which these changes have been forced upon \nthis body is so deeply offensive to me and so deeply undemocratic that \nit puts the Omnibus appropriations package in jeopardy, despite all the \nother tremendously important funding this bill would provide.\n  The real reason why so many--and we have seen this barrage of reports \nthat come particularly from outside of this body, whose work, by the \nway, is often subsidized by business interests--advocate Cuba policy \nchange is about money and commerce; it is not about freedom and \ndemocracy.\n  It makes me wonder why those who spend hours and hours in Havana \nlistening to Fidel Castro's soliloquies cannot find minutes for human \nrights and democracy advocates. It makes me wonder why those who go and \nenjoy the sun of Cuba will not shine the light of freedom on its jails \nfull of political prisoners. It makes me wonder how they advocate for \nlabor rights in the United States but are willing to accept forced \nlabor in Cuba. They talk about democracy in Burma, but they are willing \nto sip rum with Cuba's dictators.\n  There is another report that came out last week, which I hope this \nbody does not vote on the omnibus bill without reading. It is the State \nDepartment's 2008 Human Rights Report. I want to read from it at \nlength, in case my colleagues don't have the opportunity. It says, \nreferring to Cuba's human rights situation:\n\n       The government continued to deny its citizens their basic \n     human rights and committed numerous, serious abuses. The \n     government denied citizens the right to change their \n     government. . . . As many as 5,000 citizens served sentences \n     for ``dangerousness,'' without being charged with any \n     specific crime. The following human rights problems were \n     reported: beatings and abuse of detainees and prisoners, \n     including human rights activists, carried out with impunity; \n     harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, including \n     denial of medical care; harassment, beatings, and threats \n     against political opponents by government-recruited mobs, \n     police, and State security officials; arbitrary arrest and \n     detention of human rights advocates and members of \n     independent professional organizations; denials of fair \n     trials; and interference with privacy, including pervasive \n     monitoring of all private communications.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       There were also severe limitations on freedom of speech and \n     press; denial of peaceful assembly and association; \n     restrictions on freedom of movement, including selective \n     denial of exit permits to citizens and the forcible removal \n     of persons from Havana to their hometowns; restrictions on \n     freedom of religion; and refusal to recognize domestic human \n     rights groups or permit them to function legally. \n     Discrimination against persons of African descent, domestic \n     violence, underage prostitution, trafficking in persons, and \n     severe restrictions on worker rights, including the right to \n     form independent unions, were also a problem.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from the latest State Department Report \non Human Rights--in this case talking about Cuba.\n  President Obama often repeats what Martin Luther King understood--\nthat injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. The people \nof Cuba have never given up on their aspirations for democracy and \neconomic freedom. Now is not the time to give up on them. Because we \ncan't do everything doesn't mean we should not do everything we can.\n  A new American President does mean an opportunity for change. \nPresident Obama, who saw repression in Indonesia when he was a child, \npromises us this. He said this in a speech in Florida as a candidate:\n\n       My policy toward Cuba will be guided by one word: libertad \n     [that means freedom]. And the road to freedom for all Cubans \n     must begin with justice for Cuba's political prisoners, the \n     rights of free speech, a free press and freedom of assembly; \n     and it must lead to elections that are free and fair.\n\n  So here is what I think we can do to help that happen. Much has been \nwritten about seeking change in our policy. Let me offer some changes \nas well, as someone who has followed this his whole life.\n  In exchange for more liberal remittances to Cuban families, let us \ninsist that the Cuban regime not charge 20 percent of every dollar sent \nto Cuba. Say I have family in Cuba and I want to send them money to \nhelp them out in desperate times, and I send them $100. The Cuban \nregime takes $20 of that. Why? If you go to Western Union and send \nmoney anyplace in the world, it's maybe 3, 4, or 5 percent--not 20. The \nregime is taking money for itself, denying Cuban families the very \nopportunity to have more.\n  Let us also allow remittances, via license, to human rights \nactivists, democracy activists, and other civil society advocates.\n  Some suggest that there be cooperation with Cuba on narcotics \ntrafficking. Well, let them hand over the 200 fugitives from the United \nStates that the FBI knows are in Cuba, including JoAnne Chesimard, the \nconvicted killer of New Jersey State\n\n[[Page S2617]]\n\nTrooper Werner Foerster. Let her come back to the United States and \nface justice. There are 200 of them.\n  In exchange for more frequent visits from Cuban-American families who \nbring money and resources to the island, let us insist that the Cuban \nregime permit those who want to travel to Cuba and visit human rights \nactivists, democracy activists, independent journalists, and other \ncivil society advocates, be given visas as well.\n  Today, Members of Congress and others who want to promote democracy \nand human rights in Cuba, as we do in organizations throughout the \nworld, are routinely denied entrance into Cuba. Those who want to sit \nwith Castro and let him speak for hours about the revolution get a \nvisa. Those who want to go talk to these people in the photos, who \nlanguish inside either Cuba's jails or are detained in their homes and \nare struggling to create democracy, no, you cannot get a visa. They are \nhappy to accept those who bring dollars but not those who speak truth \nto power.\n  Let us have the United States offer more visitor and student visas \nfor eligible Cubans to come to the United States to see and live our \nway of life. Having Americans travel to Cuba could never be as powerful \nas having Cuban youth see the greatness of our country and its \npluralistic, diverse representative democracy. That taste of freedom \nwould be infectious.\n\n  In return, we simply seek a commitment from Cuba to accept their \ncitizens' return, and to guarantee the issuance of exit permits for all \nqualified migrants.\n  Cuba is one of the few countries in the world that will not permit \nits citizens to travel even when they have a legitimate visa to do so. \nAnd when they give them license to leave, they must pay to do so.\n  If we want to facilitate the sales of food to Cuba, let us insist \nthey be sold in open markets, available to all Cubans, without it being \npart of Castro's food rationing plan--a plan meant to further control \nthe Cuban people.\n  For those who disagree with our policies toward Cuba, let them ask \nthemselves:\n  What are they doing to promote democracy, human rights, and civil \nsociety in Cuba?\n  What are they doing to support Antunez, Oswaldo Paya, Marta Beatriz \nRoque, and Oscar Elias Biscet?\n  What are they doing to cast an international spotlight on Cuba's \nvaliant human rights activists, Cuba's equivalents of Aleksandr \nSolzhenitsyn, Vaclav Havel, or Lech Walesa?\n  Do they sit back as they languish in jail or are harassed or do they \ninvite them to their embassies in Cuba, to speak in their countries \nabout their struggles for freedom? Do they raise the issue of human \nrights in Cuba with the Castro regime? Do they cast a spotlight on \nthese people, as we did in Poland with Lech Walesa, or in the former \nCzechoslovakia with Vaclav Havel, and with Solzhenitsyn?\n  In pursuing any proposal or policy change, we have to recognize, as \nPresident Obama made clear to repressive regimes throughout the world \nin his inaugural address, that we extend a hand if they are willing to \nunclench their fist. However, if the omnibus bill is signed by the \nPresident as is, he will be extending a hand while the Castro regime \nmaintains its iron-handed clenched fist.\n  During his Presidential campaign, then-Senator Obama promised this. \nHe said:\n\n       I will maintain the embargo. It provides us with the \n     leverage to present the regime with a clear choice: If you \n     take significant steps toward democracy, beginning with the \n     freeing of all political prisoners, we will take steps to \n     begin normalizing relations.\n\n  He said:\n\n       That's the way to bring about real change in Cuba--through \n     strong, smart and principled diplomacy.\n\n  That was the policy that Americans understood he would pursue when \nthey voted for him.\n  I believed then that Candidate Obama meant what he said, and I \nbelieve now that President Obama intends to remain true to his word.\n  Following our conscience and our laws, we simply cannot let up our \npressure on the regime without seeing symbols of progress.\n  The United States and the international community must continue to \nwork diligently to help bring freedom to Cuba. But we cannot forget how \nmany valiant efforts have come within Cuba itself, how decades of fear \nand repression have also led to acts of courage. I stand here today in \nsolidarity with all of those brave Cubans who have sacrificed and shown \nremarkable courage so that one day the Cuban people will finally know \nthe basic blessings of liberty that we are entitled to as human beings \nand that we in this Nation enjoy.\n  Just days ago, 130 Cubans kept vigil outside of the Placetas \nHospital, waiting for news about the condition of a young activist, \nIris Tamara Perez Aguilara, who had gone into hypoglycemic shock after \na hunger strike to protest the regime.\n  This is not the best picture, but it is what we got out of Cuba. It \nis a picture of some of them talking about:\n  In this home live those who are having a hunger strike for peaceful \nchange and for respect for human rights and specifically talking \nagainst the torture of one of their colleagues.\n\n  She has been joined in her hunger strike by her husband Jorge Luis \nGarcia Perez ``Antunez,'' along with Segundo Rey Cabrera and Diosiris \nSantana Perez. They have avowed to continue their protest until the \ntorture of political prisoner Mario Alberto Perez Aguilera, held at the \nSanta Clara Provincial Prison, ceases immediately. They will continue \ntheir protest until he is taken out of a tiny solitary confinement \ncell, until he is no longer beaten and forced to starve, until the \nregime allows Antunez's sister, Caridad Garcia Perez, to rebuild her \nhome destroyed by the hurricanes last year, which they have not allowed \nas further punishment to these activists.\n  Imagine that: Your home is lost in a hurricane. You want to rebuild \nit, and the regime stops you from being able to rebuild the home as \nfurther punishment because of your peaceful efforts to try to create \nchange and respect for human rights in the country.\n  When Iris emerged from the hospital the other day, the Cuban citizens \nwaiting outside surrounded her to express their thanks and support for \nwhat she was doing. They hoped she would keep up her work for an \norganization named after an American pioneer they deeply admire. It is \ncalled the el Movimiento Feminista de Derechos Civiles Rosa Parks--the \nRosa Parks women's civil rights movement.\n  The hundreds of political prisoners and all Cubans who live with the \ndaily chains of political repression have shown their commitment that \nCuba will change, and this change will come from within, from the Cuban \npeople. But they need our help. We must continue to fight here to do \nwhat we can to empower them. We must continue to acknowledge them when \nthey empower themselves.\n  Let me close with what President Obama has quoted. He quoted Jose \nMarti who once wrote:\n\n       It is not enough to come to the defense of freedom with \n     epic and intermittent efforts when it is threatened at \n     moments that appear critical. Every moment is critical for \n     the defense of freedom.\n\n  This year, 50 years later, Cuba is still in the cold winter of \npoverty and oppression. But I hold up hope that people all around the \nworld, and most importantly within Cuba itself, will use this \nremarkable moment and every moment, as they are doing, as these men and \nwomen are doing, to bring about a new birth of freedom, to rise up in a \ngroundswell that will thaw the frost of tyranny and bring about a \nspring of hope and change--change the Cuban people can believe in, \nchange that they are praying for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the floor, I have \nhad the opportunity to listen to not all but 80 percent of what he \nsaid. I had meetings going on in my office, and I had not been able to \nwatch it all.\n  As the distinguished Senator from New Jersey knows, I have locked \narms with Congressman and now Senator from New Jersey for many years. \nIn fact, my votes in years past have not always been in the majority, \nbut they have always been something I felt comfortable doing and still \nfeel comfortable doing.\n  I appreciate the statement made by my friend from New Jersey. I am \ncommitted to work with him to see what\n\n[[Page S2618]]\n\nwe can do to resolve the injustice that is taking place 90 miles off \nthe shore of America and, once and for all, give those people who live \nin Las Vegas--people do not realize the largest number of Cuban \nAmericans live in Florida, next is New Jersey, and, surprisingly, next \nis Nevada.\n  I worked with my friends there, Tony Alamo and many others, over the \nyears to try to bring justice to an unjust system. I appreciate very \nmuch the statement made by my friend from New Jersey. I look forward to \nworking with him on all other issues.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nmoment?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I wish to thank the distinguished majority leader for \nhis longtime support for the Cuban people, for taking the votes and \npositions when it is not within the popular mainstream. And I \nappreciate his expression of support today as a continuation of that \nlong history. He has my personal admiration. More importantly, those \nwho are struggling for freedom and democracy inside Cuba appreciate it \nas well.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Virginia, Nevada, New Jersey, and the other \n47 States are well served by my friend from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, tomorrow I will rise to offer a pro-life \nand pro-child amendment to the fiscal year 2009 Omnibus Appropriations \nAct. But more than that, it will be an amendment that is profreedom \nthat follows in the line of reasoning of my friend and my colleague \nfrom New Jersey. It is anti-oppression, prowoman and anticoercion.\n  My amendment tomorrow will restore the Kemp-Kasten anticoercion \npopulation control provision that has been a fundamental part of our \nforeign policy for almost a quarter of a century.\n  Since 1985, the Kemp-Kasten provision has denied Federal funding to \norganizations or programs that, as determined by the President, support \nor participate in a program of coercive abortion or involuntary \nsterilization. Should my amendment be adopted, then President Obama \nwould be able to make an official determination as to whether \norganizations engage in such coercive practices.\n  The Kemp-Kasten amendment has been included in appropriations bills \nwithout substantial changes for 23 years, until today. Perhaps at this \npoint it would be helpful to my colleagues if I outlined the \ndifferences between the Mexico City policy and the Kemp-Kasten \nprovision.\n  Already, as one of his very first acts as President, President Obama \nchose to nullify the so-called Mexico City policy. The Mexico City \npolicy said the United States would not federally fund groups that \npromote or provide abortion as a method of family planning. According \nto a Gallup poll released last month, overturning this pro-life policy \nwas the least popular of the President's actions in his first week in \noffice. Only 35 percent supported funding groups that promote or \nprovide abortions as a method of family planning, and 58 percent oppose \nthis new Obama administration policy.\n  I disagreed with President Obama on his Mexico City policy. I think \nmost Americans, frankly, disagree with President Obama on this Mexico \nCity decision. I think most Americans would rather not spend taxpayer \ndollars on international organizations that promote abortion as a \nmethod of family planning.\n  Having said that, I am not surprised by the President's decision. He \nran, frankly, as a pro-abortion candidate. Senator McCain ran as a pro-\nlife candidate. I think the decision in the election came down to other \nissues. Elections have consequences, but can we not all agree that \nforced abortion is wrong? Can we not all agree that coerced \nsterilization is wrong? That is what Kemp-Kasten has stood for for \nalmost a quarter of a century.\n  Regardless of how Senators come down on the pro-life or pro-choice \ndebate, can we not all at least agree on this one proposition, that the \nUnited Nations should not be able to spend American tax dollars on \ncoercion in the name of family planning? That is the issue dealt with \nin Kemp-Kasten, and that is the only issue addressed in my amendment.\n  Here is what the bill language currently does. It purports to retain \nKemp-Kasten, but then goes on to direct funds to the United Nations \nPopulation Fund ``notwithstanding any other provision of law.'' \n``Notwithstanding any other provision of law''--these six words, in \neffect, nullify the Kemp-Kasten anticoercion provision. It is either \ncontradictory or purposely deceptive that one portion of the omnibus \nbill purports to retain Kemp-Kasten while another paragraph has the \nreal effect of gutting Kemp-Kasten.\n  One might inquire: Why does the majority party not trust a President \nof their own party to make a determination about whether U.N. funds are \nprovided to coercive abortion programs? Surely a majority of this body \ndoes not favor funding UNFPA even if the organization is engaging in \ncoercion. Surely we can all agree on that. Perhaps not.\n  The truth is, the U.N. Population Fund, UNFPA, has actively \nsupported, comanaged, and whitewashed pervasive crimes against women in \nthe guise of family planning. Just last year, the U.S. State Department \nfound, once again, that the UNFPA violated the anticoercion provision \nof Kemp-Kasten and, accordingly, reprogrammed all funding originally \nearmarked to the UNFPA to other maternal health care and family \nplanning projects.\n  The most recent State Department report on UNFPA activities in China \nshows that UNFPA funds are, indeed, funneled to Chinese agencies that \ncoercively enforce the one-child policy.\n  What has changed in less than a year? Are we to believe that all \nthese organizations have suddenly shifted their policies? This bill \ngives UNFPA a 25-percent funding increase and a deadly exception.\n  What has really changed is that we have a new administration with a \npro-abortion agenda. I don't think coerced abortions were what the \nAmerican people voted for last November. Creating this exception \nspecifically for UNFPA makes a mockery of longstanding U.S. policy to \nprotect human rights abroad. If we cannot stop the abuse in other parts \nof the globe, at the very least we should not be encouraging abuse with \nU.S. funds. We should be pressing the UNFPA to conform to human rights \nstandards, instead of trying to change human rights standards to \nconform to the oppressive Chinese population control program.\n  By creating a loophole for UNFPA, we regrettably send a message to \noppressive governments that coercive abortion is not a serious concern \nfor American citizens. This message could not be further from the \ntruth.\n  I urge my colleagues tomorrow to support the Wicker amendment and \ncontinue our longstanding policy against coercive abortion. Let's \ncontinue the time-honored Kemp-Kasten policy.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two amendments \nthat I have filed at the desk to H.R. 1105 be called up and made \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. THUNE. Thank you, Mr. President. If I might speak to one or both \nof these amendments, one in particular right now that I would like to \nreference, let me start by saying that H.R. 1105, which is under \nconsideration now by the Senate, is yet another voluminous document, \nnot unlike the stimulus bill we considered a couple of weeks ago. This \none actually is 1,122 pages long and represents over $400 billion of \nspending by our Government. The fact that it is this long and \nrepresents several hundred million dollars per page here of spending \nwould suggest that it ought to be legislation that is given a lot of \nconsideration in the Senate, on which many amendments can be offered \nand different points of\n\n[[Page S2619]]\n\nview expressed. It would appear that process is going to be short-\ncircuited on this bill and that we are not going to have the \nopportunity to offer amendments to it.\n  With regard to the general bill itself, I would simply point out what \na number of my colleagues already have; that is, this appropriations \nbill, although having passed a trillion-dollar stimulus bill a couple \nof weeks ago, still represents over an 8-percent increase over the \nprevious year's level.\n  So 2009, fiscal year 2009, which we are currently in, this is work \nthat did not get completed last year by September 30, which is the end \nof the fiscal year. So we passed a continuing resolution that expires \non March 6; therefore, the reason we have to be before the Senate \ntrying to pass nine appropriations bills that were not completed in the \nform of this 1,122-page Omnibus appropriations bill. But an 8.3-percent \nincrease over the same nine appropriations bills that were passed last \nfiscal year, after having already passed over $1 trillion in the \nstimulus bill, much of which will be directed to the agencies that will \nreceive the plussed-up funding under this bill. But over 8 percent is \nmore than twice the rate of inflation. So having passed a trillion-\ndollar stimulus bill, we are now coming on the heels of that and taking \nup a piece of legislation that is going to increase Federal spending by \nover 8 percent over last year's spending level.\n  That would suggest that this is something we ought to take a little \ntime with because many of the agencies that are funded under this \nappropriations bill already received huge infusions of new funding in \nthe stimulus bill. The Labor, Health, and Human Services-Education \nbill, along with the stimulus bill, and the funding that is included in \nthis bill, will receive a 99-percent increase in funding over last \nyear. There is another appropriations account that will get a 150-\npercent increase over last year's appropriated level. These are \ngargantuan increases in funding.\n  It would seem to me that we ought to at least be able to bring this \nappropriations bill in at last year's level. There is going to be an \namendment, perhaps one already offered by Senator McCain, to extend the \ncontinuing resolution which would save taxpayers over $32 billion \nbecause that would represent the 8.3-percent increase that is included \nin this bill on top of all the additional funding that many of these \nagencies are going to receive as a result of the stimulus bill.\n  I regret the fact that the majority is not going to allow us to offer \namendments to this bill. It would appear they want to move this \nquickly. I can see the rationale for that, when you are spending this \namount of money in this short of a time period. The more the American \npeople have an opportunity to see what is in it, the more concerned and \nthe more resistance would build and you would see a tremendous at-the-\ngrassroots level movement to try and stop this kind of spending spree \nwe have seen in Washington. I would hope the process will be opened \nwhereby Members on both sides can offer amendments to this bill that \ncan be considered and perhaps voted on and maybe even bring some fiscal \nsanity to it by getting us back into a form that actually would save \nthe American taxpayers a significant amount of money, after we have \njust asked the American taxpayers and our children and grandchildren to \nfund a stimulus bill to the tune of over $1 trillion with interest and \nmuch more than that, over $3 trillion, if much of the spending in that \nbill is continued and not terminated in the 2-year period for which it \nwas intended.\n  I wanted to speak to an amendment that I have filed at the desk and \nasked to have made pending, which was objected to by the majority--\nagain, an indication of how amendments are going to go on this piece of \nlegislation. I offer this amendment because last week 87 Members of the \nSenate voted to uphold our first amendment rights by supporting a \nstatutory prohibition of the so-called fairness doctrine. This \namendment was accepted as part of the DC voting rights bill, which is \ncurrently awaiting action by the House of Representatives.\n  My concern is that once the House considers this bill, whenever it \nmay be that the Senate and House versions get conferenced together, \nthat provision will no longer be part of the final DC voting rights \nbill. I am hopeful the DeMint amendment is retained in the final \nversion of the DC Voting Rights Act, but I am fearful it will be \nstripped out behind closed doors.\n  I filed an amendment at the desk to the Omnibus appropriations bill \nthat would prohibit the FCC from using any funds to reinstate the \nfairness doctrine during the remainder of fiscal year 2009. If this \namendment is accepted to the omnibus bill, the 87 Senators who last \nweek supported this prohibition will have assurances that the fairness \ndoctrine will not be reinstated for the remainder of this year, \nregardless of whether the DeMint amendment remains part of the DC \nvoting rights legislation.\n  By way of background, many of my colleagues heard this discussion \nlast week, but the so-called fairness doctrine has a long and infamous \nhistory. The FCC promulgated the fairness doctrine in 1949 to ensure \nthat contrasting viewpoints would be presented on radio and television. \nIn 1985, the FCC began repealing the doctrine after concluding that it \nactually had the opposite effect. They concluded then what we all know \ntoday: that the fairness doctrine resulted in broadcasters limiting \ncoverage of controversial issues of public importance. Recently, many \non the left have advocated reinstating the doctrine, arguing that \nbroadcasters, including talk radio, should present both sides of any \nissue because they use the public airwaves. However, recent calls to \nreinstate the fairness doctrine fail to take into account several \nconsiderations.\n  The first is, in reality the fairness doctrine resulted in less, not \nmore, broadcasting of issues of importance to the public. Because \nairing controversial issues subjected broadcasters to regulatory \nburdens and potentially severe liabilities, they simply made the \nrational choice not to air any such content at all.\n  Second, the number of radio and TV stations and the development of \nnewer broadcast media such as cable and satellite TV and satellite \nradio have grown dramatically in the past 50 years. In 1949, there were \n51 television and about 2,500 radio stations. In 1985, there were 1,200 \ntelevision and 9,800 radio stations. Today there are nearly 1,800 \ntelevision and nearly 14,000 radio stations. There is simply no \nscarcity to justify content regulation like the fairness doctrine.\n  The third observation is that the development of new media, social \nnetworking, and access to the Internet has changed media forever. \nSupporters of government-mandated balance either ignore the multiple \nnew sources of media or reveal their true intention, which is to \nregulate content of all forms of communication and ultimately stifle \ncertain viewpoints on certain media such as talk radio.\n  The fourth observation I would make is this: Broadcast content is \ndriven by consumer demand. Consumers of media show whether they are \nbeing served well by broadcasters when they choose either to tune in or \nturn off the programming that is being offered. The fairness doctrine \nruns counter to individual choice and freedom to choose what we listen \nto or see on the air or read on the Internet. The fairness doctrine \nshould not be reinstated.\n  Last week, the Senate acted in a strong bipartisan manner in \nopposition to the fairness doctrine. What I am asking the Senate to do \nis to consider one additional measure to ensure that our first \namendment rights are protected and that consumers have the freedom to \nchoose what they see and hear over our airwaves. This amendment ensures \nthat the FCC does not use any resources to reinstate the fairness \ndoctrine through the end of the fiscal year until a more permanent \nsolution can be reached through a statutory prohibition.\n  It is a very straightforward amendment and one that follows along the \nlines of the debate held last week. I wish I was confident that the \nprohibition on reinstatement of the fairness doctrine that was included \nlast week in the DC voting rights bill would be retained in the \nconference with the House. I have reason to believe that will be \nstripped out, and this is one additional way in which this body can \nweigh in and ensure that the fairness doctrine is not reinstated, not \nput back into effect, and that American consumers have the freedom to \nchoose\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\nwhat they want to see and what they want to hear over our airwaves.\n  I hope at some point I will be able to get it pending, to perhaps \nhave a vote on it. It would be unfortunate on a bill of this \nconsequence and magnitude, when, again, we are talking about 1,122 \npages of this legislation, all of which is spending another $400-some \nbillion--$410 billion or thereabouts in additional spending on top of \nthe $1 trillion stimulus passed a couple weeks ago--that we would have \nan opportunity at least to offer amendments, to debate amendments, to \nget amendments voted on, and this is one that I would like to have a \nvote on. It would certainly be my sincere hope that the majority at \nsome point would open the door to those of us on both sides who would \nlike to have amendments voted on which, frankly, could improve the \nbill. There will be others that will be offered and, hopefully, \nconsidered which will get at the overall size and cost of the bill \nwhich, as an 8.3-percent increase over last year's appropriated level, \nlast year's spending level, a $32 billion increase over last year's \nlevel, is an enormous amount of money in light of all the spending that \nis going on around here.\n\n  I might mention as well, that is the largest 1-year hike in annual \nappropriated spending since the Carter administration. What we are \ntalking about is 8 percent, over 8 percent, more than twice the rate of \ninflation, but also the largest 1-year hike in annual appropriated \nspending since the Carter administration. That is, again, on the heels \nof $1 trillion spent a couple of weeks earlier, much of which was \ndirected at these very same agencies of Government that will receive \nfunding under this 1,122-page bill.\n  We need to open this process. We need to be able to offer amendments. \nWe need to get amendments voted on. It would certainly be my hope that \nwould be the case.\n  I have one other amendment which I will speak to perhaps tomorrow \nwhich would move some money from one account to another to fund \nsomething that was a very important priority the Congress established \nlast year during the PEPFAR debate. I offered, along with Senators \nDorgan and Kyl, Senator Clinton and a number of others, an amendment \nthat carved a couple billion out of that $50 billion authorization for \nneeds on Native American reservations; specifically directed to law \nenforcement, which is a security issue; to health care, which is \nsomething that is desperately lacking on many reservations; and at \nwater development--all critical needs and all important priorities and \nthings we ought to be concerned with.\n  I would move money from another account in this bill to actually \nprovide funding for the authorization that Congress created as part of \nthe PEPFAR bill a year ago. This ought to be a priority for the \nCongress. We are talking about spending this amount of money and \nfunding all these various accounts and agencies. We certainly ought to \nfind room to fund some of the priorities that were created as a result \nof the PEPFAR legislation.\n  I will be offering that amendment as well and will also be requesting \nthat it be made pending and that we have an opportunity to vote on it. \nIt would seem to me that many of the other amendments that Members on \nour side would like to offer, as well as Members on the other side \nwould like to offer, ought to be able to be put before the Senate and \nvoted upon in an attempt to try to make this bill stronger and better. \nWe all have different ideas about how to make this a better bill. I \nhope the majority will allow us to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nresumes consideration of H.R. 1105 tomorrow, Tuesday, March 3, the time \nuntil 11:45 a.m. be for debate with respect to the McCain amendment No. \n592, with the time equally divided and controlled between Senators \nInouye and McCain or their designees, with no amendment in order to the \namendment prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; that at 11:45 \na.m., the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the amendment No. \n592.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while I have two of my Republican colleagues \non the floor, and others, of course, listening, I have been told by the \nRepublican leadership there is a number of extremely important \namendments from the minority's perspective. No. 1 is this amendment \nthat Senator McCain has offered. Another one that comes to my mind is \none that a number of people on the other side of the aisle have talked \nabout often, which would lower the amount of spending to the CR level. \nI do not how much money that is. So we are waiting for someone to offer \nthat.\n  We heard a presentation made by Senator Wicker this afternoon that he \nhas an abortion-related amendment. We understand Senator Vitter has an \nabortion-related amendment. I have had several conversations today with \nDr. Coburn, and he has been very constructive in working with us in \ncoming up with four amendments, none of which I like. But there are \nfour amendments, and we are going to work our way through these, where \npeople have ample time to talk about them, as soon as we can.\n  But I thought it was important, before we have our caucus tomorrow, \nto at least get this one amendment the minority feels very strongly \nabout. We will work our way through this and see what happens tomorrow.\n  There is no end to amendments that could be offered on this bill. \nThis is a very big bill. It is nine subcommittees. I hope everyone \nwould focus on what would happen if we could pass this bill. It would \nbe good for the institution. We could get back to a process where we do \n12 individual appropriations bills. That would be so important because \nthis is not the way to legislate, having these great big bills. We have \ndone it in the last several years, and it is not in keeping with--I am \nno longer a member of the Appropriations Committee, but I was on the \nAppropriations Committee for a quarter of a century, or something like \nthat. It is a wonderful committee. But it has not been doing the job it \nis supposed to do for this institution.\n  So I hope we, by the end of this week, can pass this omnibus bill. I \nwant to make sure the minority has the opportunity to offer amendments. \nBut as I have indicated, there will come a time sometime when we will \nhave to stop amending and try to get the matter passed. But that will \ncome at a later time.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I will simply ask, through the Chair, if I \nmight: The leader talked about being able to offer amendments. I have \nfiled a couple amendments. Is there some point at which--you mentioned \nthe one amendment you have an agreement on now that will be voted on \ntomorrow--where other amendments will be able to be made pending and \nvoted on, that Members will be able to get their amendments actually--\n  Mr. REID. The answer, through the Chair to my friend from South \nDakota, is, yes, we are going to try to get to as many amendments as we \ncan. With a bill as complex as this, we cannot stack up endless \namendments, so we are going to have to work out a process where if we \nstack amendments, they will have to be few in number. And ``few'' is in \nthe eye of the beholder. But the answer to the Senator's question: \nThere is no reason that I know of--I do not know the subject matter of \nthe Senator's amendment or amendments--but I have no reason to believe \nthat we should not be able to get to his amendment.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. The point I am trying to make is, we are not trying to \navoid voting on tough amendments. I have outlined to you some pretty \ndifficult amendments. Dr. Coburn did not think up his amendments riding \nthe subway over from his office in one of the office buildings. A lot \nof thought has gone into his amendments, and they are very difficult \namendments. I would like to avoid them, but I do not see any reason how \nI can do that. So in answer: I repeat, there will be time for \namendments. It is just a question of when there will be enough time. \nCertainly tomorrow. And I hope we can work through these on Wednesday \nand have a better feel where we need to go.\n\n[[Page S2621]]\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Through the Chair, I thank the leader for his answer. And \nI will be available. Mine are filed, and I would love to get them \nactually up.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I understand the majority leader may \nwant to close, and I am happy to wait until he does, if he wishes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been told we can do what we call \nwrap-up. It will take a minute or two. If my friend from Tennessee \nwould withhold, we will rip right through this.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I will be delighted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am writing to you to help you see the impact that the \n     recent rise in energy costs in this country has done to my \n     family and many other hard working, middle class families in \n     this great State. My wife of ten years and I have been \n     blessed with four wonderful children and have chosen Idaho \n     like our fathers before us as the place we want to raise our \n     children. We love the outdoor recreation that this area \n     affords us. We like to camp and enjoy many motorized \n     recreational activities. We also live in an area where \n     driving is needed for my employment and necessary for \n     everyday survival. Idaho does not have a large amount of \n     public transportation. Our population base does not support \n     it. With many kids I drive a Suburban which is out of \n     necessity, not indulgence as many may think. We need the \n     four-wheel drive for our winters here and the room for all of \n     our children. It is a great way to have one vehicle for all \n     seasons.\n       Please begin to drill offshore and in ANWR right away. I \n     believe that with increased production and additional \n     refineries we can make a lasting positive effect on the \n     supplies of oil and gasoline in this country for generations \n     to come. I also plead with you to build more nuclear plants \n     which offer the most clean, high output energy we can \n     produce. We are way behind in this area also considering \n     other countries who generate most of their power with Nuclear \n     Energy. I believe we should take care of our own needs and \n     when I hear that we have more oil reserves than all of the \n     Middle East combined I feel as though our enemies are within \n     not without. If Congress is waiting for a time to act on \n     this, it is now. If our reserves are available and silly \n     legislation is keeping us from them, we need a new group of \n     leaders who are willing to protect the interests of U.S. \n     citizens over all else. Our country is strong but we need \n     affordable energy to stay ahead of the game. I do not mean \n     subsidized energy, for that will only be paid in taxes \n     instead of at the pump. Increase the supplies and sell it to \n     us, and restrict sales to other outside countries. Allow less \n     regulation on refineries, and drilling rigs to promote U.S. \n     companies involvement in increasing the supplies needed now.\n     Scott, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do not need to tell you a story--they are all the same \n     everywhere. We need to drill in the United States now. We are \n     crippled by our own inaction. The longer we do nothing the \n     longer there will be no relief in sight for high fuel and \n     natural gas prices. We have not seen the worst I am sure. We \n     also need to build oil refineries, nuclear power plants, \n     liquefy coal and expand wind farms. We need to stop diverting \n     precious farm land to ethanol production. Ethanol has turned \n     out to be a huge, wasteful mistake. It uses far too many non-\n     renewable resources to produce a gallon. The net effect is \n     nothing in terms of reducing our dependence on foreign oil \n     and look how it has affected the price of food and will \n     continue to do so. To summarize: Drill here, drill now, pay \n     less. Thank you sir for asking Idahoans for their opinion.\n     Pam, Homedale.\n                                  ____\n\n       I listen every day to the news, telling me how much oil \n     prices rose overnight and how much of an increase I will \n     expect to see at the pump. Each time I hear a one cent or two \n     cent rise, I panic. Not for myself, but for my family. My \n     parents own a ranch in small town Idaho, where fuel prices \n     exceed even our big city imaginations.\n       I wonder how they will afford to fill the tractors to plow \n     fields to make the corn that our nation loves to consume. I \n     wonder how they will be able to haul the cows to market in \n     order to sell them for pennies, barely enough to cover the \n     fuel of hauling them.\n       Then I hear the government saying they should switch from \n     diesel trucks to smaller cars . . . I have never seen a \n     hybrid that can pull a stock trailer with 12 cows. I hear the \n     government say no more drilling in Alaska, yet they also say \n     we will run out of oil soon. I listen to economists say that \n     our economy is on the downfall. Gas prices rise, food prices \n     rise, Idaho minimum wage stays the same, they continue to \n     develop on the farmland that could provide food for cheaper \n     prices. What are you doing in Washington that is helping \n     middleman America? Nothing and, by doing so, you are killing \n     the America dream one gas pump at a time.\n       You ask for opinions, but where's the change? By allowing \n     oil companies to monopolize the industry, the American people \n     have no way of overcoming the fuel shortage.\n       Ways you can help:\n       Open oil reserves in Alaska.\n       Put a price cap on the cost of fuel, forcing lower profit \n     margins for big business oil companies.\n       Provide an incentive for creating alternate fuel sources \n     that can meet the needs of ALL Americans (including farmers \n     and ranchers).\n       Make hybrid cars more affordable and give incentives to \n     those who want to purchase one.\n       Stop giving economic stimulus checks for $600 to the \n     richest and only $300 to the poor/middleman. The middle \n     American needs the $600 more than the person that made \n     $30,000 last year.\n     Terra.\n                                  ____\n\n       The only real solution to high energy prices is to consume \n     less. I am using less diesel myself by planning trips \n     carefully, carpooling, walking and biking. I see many others \n     in Boise doing the same. I support a higher federal tax on \n     carbon-producing energy sources, with the revenue used to \n     support rail shipping and travel and transit.\n     Marilee, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Wow, it almost sounds like you are running a commercial for \n     the oil and gas or the nuclear industry. Yes, energy price \n     increases have hurt all Americans, but part of the blame lies \n     with the oil/gas and nuclear industry as well as the average \n     Joe, who have continued to buy gas-guzzling vehicles, buy \n     huge homes that are 40-60 miles from their work location. The \n     oil and gas industry has done little to expand capacity and \n     have repeated huge profits in recent history.\n       I have a diesel pickup that rarely moves, only when pulling \n     the horse trailer or hauling the flat bed trailer to move \n     hay, etc. I use coupons at the store whenever possible \n     because of the rising food costs, and we have cut back on \n     going out to dinner, movies, etc.\n       But drilling oil in the Arctic or off the coast is not \n     going to solve the problem; the Alaska Pipeline was supposed \n     to solve the oil crises when it was built.\n       Every day I commute from Nampa to Boise. I wish I could \n     find someone to commute with or work from home, but the work \n     just does not allow it. But I know lots of people speeding \n     done the highway, who are driving alone in their cars to the \n     same work location, and Idaho has done virtually nothing to \n     conserve fuel, no HOV lanes, no rapid transit, metered on \n     ramps, fact is the Idaho legislature is doing everything they \n     can to prevent finding ways to conserve previous recourses \n     and the U.S. Congress has done little to help. Congress has \n     repeatedly voted not to increase the average fuel economy of \n     vehicles until recently or assist with mass transit projects. \n     Our rail system is falling apart, and Congress is not \n     helping. Moving products by rail is one of the most \n     economical ways to move material.\n       Yes, we need to get a handle on high fuel prices, but the \n     best way is to reduce demand. I would support limited \n     drilling for oil and gas, and development of nuclear energy \n     but relaxing regulations is not the way, we need to ensure \n     lots of oversight to make sure it is done right. I have seen \n     hundreds of dead migratory birds caught in oil overflow ponds \n     at drilling sites. I have witnessed the mining industry use \n     toxic waste product as a soil binder on county roads. I have \n     seen companies contracted to build interstate highways steal \n     sand and gravel from the U.S. government, so I have no faith \n     in industry.\n       So, please, find a real solution that works. Thanks.\n     Rob, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am writing in regards to your request on how the energy \n     prices have affected our\n\n[[Page S2622]]\n\n     household. It is hitting us hard, my husband works \n     construction and is not getting the hours that he got last \n     year so we are on a lower budget than ever. We used to do a \n     little traveling, not far but weekend trips to livestock \n     shows and to see friends, but now a trip to the grocery store \n     is about all we get to do. No quick trips to the store, if we \n     need something it waits until we have a good list. We used to \n     eat out a couple times a week since we both work, and that \n     does not happen often either anymore. We have sold all but a \n     handful of our animals (South African Meat Goats and dairy \n     goats) due to what the feed increases are.\n       The other thing that is amazing to us is that, in 1991, \n     when we bought a Geo Metro, it got 60 mpg easily. Why is it \n     that the manufacturers cannot do that now unless it is a \n     ``hybrid''. If they could do it 17 year ago, what is the \n     problem now? This is just my 2 cents.\n     Lauri, Blackfoot.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for asking for our input. The energy crisis is \n     hitting our family particularly hard because of the slowdown \n     in the economy. I am a self-employed architect, and, though \n     we had a good year last year, the slowdown has brought our \n     firm to a standstill. I share this because as the fuel prices \n     rise, they affect every sector of our economy. Because our \n     work has decreased, this means even more money needs to go to \n     higher fuel and utility costs, money which we do not have \n     right now.\n       I suggest that instead of Congress blaming the President \n     for not having an energy policy that they look themselves in \n     the mirror and ask themselves why they continue to vote in \n     such a way that keeps us in bondage to oil from overseas. If \n     Congress could address this one issue in a unified manner, \n     maybe then their job approval rating would not be lower than \n     the President's job approval rating as it is right now.\n       The bottom line is this: we must become energy independent \n     from countries that support terrorism and are not in the best \n     interests of the US. This means increasing US Oil drilling, \n     production, refining, distribution, and increasing our \n     research (working with Oil companies) to create alternatives \n     to oil to run our country: such as hydrogen fuel cells, \n     electric hybrids, etc. We must be able to drill in ANWR, oil \n     shale in Colorado, Utah, and North Dakota; oil in Wyoming, \n     oil in the Gulf, etc. At the same time, we need to transition \n     out of using oil into other energy sources: nuclear, etc. No \n     decision now is still making the decision to procrastinate. \n     Procrastination is not an option.\n     Brian, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       As an average American citizen making just under $30,000 a \n     year, skyrocketing gas prices are hurting the pocketbook. A \n     full tank of gas is costing around $55, which is just crazy \n     to think. It is hard to imagine that just ten years ago gas \n     prices in the state of Idaho averaged $.96 a gallon. With a \n     recession looming, the dollar growing weaker by the day, and \n     unemployment rates on the rise it is a scary time for \n     America. One solution that I can see to help with the gas \n     prices is by suspending all sales of oil on the futures \n     market. It is evident that forecasts by the speculators are \n     driving the prices sky high. While investors are making money \n     on these hedge fund investments, millions of Americans are \n     suffering from paying these high prices. My solution would be \n     to suspend all oil sales on the futures market for 3 to 6 \n     months just to see what effect it would have. I believe it is \n     the speculators that are driving the prices with their \n     forecasting of a bad hurricane season or low supply of oil \n     available they are the ones that are the problem. They are \n     the reason for the high prices of oil. By suspending the sale \n     of oil on the futures market this would take them out of the \n     equation and hopefully stabilize the prices. Even by just \n     setting a limit on prices of oil sales per barrel would help \n     stabilize the high prices of gasoline. Overall this is just \n     another example of the rich getting richer and the poor \n     getting poorer.\n     Kenneth.\n                                  ____\n\n       I appreciate the opportunity to share how fuel prices are \n     impacting our family. We are one of the many that own a \n     diesel truck and have been impacted in a very big way. We \n     purchased our diesel in the summer of 2005 and the price of \n     fuel was $2.11/gal and, as you know, today it is $4.85/gal. \n     That is a 130% increase in the cost of fuel! And to further \n     compound the increase in cost, tighter emissions restrictions \n     have been implemented. When we purchased out truck we were \n     able to get 23 mpg and now that the ultra low sulfur fuel has \n     been mandated our economy has dropped to 17 mpg. That is a \n     26% reduction in economy. As an engineer, I have a difficult \n     time seeing the reasoning behind reducing the pollutants per \n     gallon to only decrease mileage which ultimately increase the \n     amount of pollutant per mile driven. This is very apparent on \n     the new diesel trucks which are struggling to get 12 mph \n     because of the emission controls. I have to ask the question \n     is more than a 50% reduction in pollutants to justify the 50% \n     reduction in economy. There is something that could be done \n     right now and that is to relax the emission on diesel fuel so \n     many families and the trucking industry would get an \n     immediate increase in economy. We saw this during Katrina \n     when the restrictions were lifted, our economy went back up \n     to 23 mpg. Americans would see this relief immediately.\n       Our family has taken many measures to help offset the cost \n     of the increasing fuel prices. We have basically parked our \n     truck and become a one car family. We cancelled our kids \n     swimming lessons and our spring/summer outdoor activities \n     (camping, fishing, and hunting) to reduce the cost of fuel. \n     In addition to limiting our driving we have stopping eating \n     out (fast food and sit down) and other non-essential \n     activities. We are fortunate to have planned extra budget for \n     unaccounted costs, however, the increase fuel costs have \n     taken all the extra and we as a family are extremely \n     concerned that Congress is unwilling to act and make the \n     difficult choice.\n       What has to happen to have Congress understand the simple \n     principle of supply and demand? I, like many Americans, would \n     like to be able to use a cleaner energy source but, until one \n     is viable with a sound delivery network in place, we have to \n     use the one we have and that is oil. And with the world's \n     political climate, we also strongly believe it is a matter of \n     national security to become less dependent on others for oil.\n       We strongly support expanding oil exploration and \n     production in the United States. We also strongly support \n     drilling in protected areas of Alaska. We agree with Ted \n     Stevens when he points out that we as Americans would have \n     that million barrels a day right now if President Clinton \n     would not have vetoed the bill. People that are against \n     drilling in Alaska simply do not understand how little an \n     impact is has on the area. I challenge any person to visit \n     the North Slope and see the operations there and see how \n     exploration is done with little to no impacts with ice roads \n     and the modern techniques. As an Idaho family, we strongly \n     support all measures that will increase the domestic supply \n     of oil. Thank you for your hard work in this effort.\n     Cortney and Lori, Star.\n                                  ____\n\n       You asked for a line or two as to how the energy expenses \n     have affected our lives. Certainly via the pocketbook, but \n     equally in lifestyle and choices we make. I have reached a \n     time in my life that I wanted to see some of our country that \n     I have not yet been privileged to see. I wanted to drive \n     across Montana and see the Big Horn Battlefield and on to the \n     Black Hills. Drop into Nebraska to see family, then who knows \n     wherever we ended up. Not now. I cannot afford to spend a \n     thousand dollars or more on fuel. I realize that there are \n     new automobiles that are more fuel efficient, only $20,000-\n     $30,000+) but if we find ourselves upside down now on a Ford \n     F150 truck that gets 15-18 MPG and nobody wants to buy it \n     because it cannot get 30+ MPG you adjust. Trips now will \n     consist of short radius excursions. Long distance is out. \n     Such ventures are not economically possible. Fuel expense as \n     a percentage of my income has risen notably. The more \n     affluent folks can fill their tanks and shake it off. Some of \n     us feel more than a pinch.\n       We also are associated with property under the current CRP \n     program in Power County. Once CRP is removed and the land is \n     resolved to be put into production it will take 3-4 years to \n     prepare the ground for planting. All with no return income in \n     return. Dry land farming has never been a high profit \n     endeavor, but with the expense of the machinery and the 100+% \n     increase in fuel, the small farmer will undoubtedly be out of \n     business--out of business being the operative phrase here.\n       I worry for our country if we are indeed slaves to foreign \n     oil and big money refuses to allow a phase-out. We are not a \n     nation of sheep, or are we? We have the technology to fuel \n     our autos using water for crying out loud. Why is not this \n     technology in use? Who is stopping it from becoming an \n     affordable reality? I have asked such questions before of our \n     representatives and have never received a response. Maybe you \n     could be the first. Thanks for listening.\n     Dan, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Unfortunately our family has had to cancel our vacation and \n     any other fishing trips this year. In fact, we will not \n     venture out to any of Idaho's beautiful cities this summer. \n     The cost of fuel and food and our daughter's education have \n     us questioning if we will be able to make ends meet. New \n     technology for transportation will come too late for most \n     working citizens, That is why we need to drill for oil now \n     before the platforms have other countries flags flying.\n     Randy.\n                                  ____\n\n       The story is the failure of Congress to act in the interest \n     of the American public. Congress continually is bowing to the \n     environmentalist (how they became the majority is beyond me). \n     The current gas price just shows another failure of \n     government. There is an old saying ``Lead, follow or get out \n     of the way''--[it seems like our country is failing on all \n     three.]\n       When you sit down at dinner tonight, think about the 85-\n     year-old couple who retired 20 years ago and are drawing \n     Social Security in the amount of $980 month. How would you \n     put food on the table, pay for health care, housing, \n     transportation and enjoy your golden years.

Keeling as she retires after nearly 32 \nyears of Federal service, which included working for 6 years in the \nU.S. Senate. Her dedicated public service and tireless commitment to \nkeeping appropriate congressional committees fully and currently \ninformed of the activities of her agency should be recognized and \nappreciated by all in this Chamber.\n  A native of Nashville, TN, Ms. Keeling graduated from the University \nof Tennessee in 1977. She then joined the staff of our esteemed former \nmajority leader, Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee, in June of 1977, \nwhere she served as an office manager, formulating the Senator's office \nbudget and supervising 30 full-time employees with a variety of \nresponsibilities.\n  In August of 1983 she joined the office of Commissioner Frederick \nBernthal of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC. As his \nadministrative assistant, she handled all day-to-day operations of the \noffice and managed work flow within the Commissioner's office.\n  At the end of Commissioner Bernthal's term in June of 1988, Ms. \nKeeling joined the staff of NRC's Office of Congressional Affairs. She \nserved as a congressional affairs officer for almost 12 years and was \nthen promoted to senior congressional affairs officer in 2000. She \nserved in that capacity until September of 2005. As a senior \ncongressional affairs officer, she assisted in formulating \ncongressional relations policy and programs, performed liaison duties, \nanalyzed legislation and coordinated congressional briefings and \nhearings.\n  Ms. Keeling was recognized for her outstanding service by the NRC \nwith a Meritorious Service Award, the agency's second-highest award \ngiven to its employees, in 2003. She received this award ``in \nrecognition of her exceptional versatility, dedicated service, and \nadroit handling of Congressional affairs.'' Ms. Keeling was also the \nrecipient of numerous performance and special achievement awards \nthroughout her career at the NRC.\n  In September 2005, Ms. Keeling was appointed associate director for \ncongressional affairs in NRC's Office of Congressional Affairs. She has \nbeen in this position since that time and it is from this position that \nMs. Keeling retired from Federal service on February 27, 2009. She will \nbe returning to her beloved State of Tennessee to be with her family \nand friends in Nashville.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Ms. Keeling on her retirement and thanking her for her \nservice to the U.S. Senate and her country through her work at the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/02/senate-section/article/S2623-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEASURES DISCHARGED\n\n  The following measure was discharged from the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions by unanimous consent, and referred as \nindicated:\n\n       S. 473.

A bill to restrict the use of offshore tax havens and abusive \ntax shelters to inappropriately avoid Federal taxation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, America has been knocked flat on its back \nby the current financial crisis, but the American fighting spirit \nhasn't given up. We are battling back.\n  Congress recently passed an $800 billion recovery bill to jumpstart \nthe economy with new jobs and investments. That $800 billion is on top \nof the $700 billion we set aside earlier to revive the credit markets \nand recapitalize the financial institutions that got us into this mess. \nThose steps weren't easy to take and represent a lot of money going out \nthe door.\n  That is why, today, I am introducing the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, \nalong with Senators Whitehouse, McCaskill and Bill Nelson, to stop tax \ncheats who drain our treasury of funds needed to pay for our recovery. \nThe bill's target is offshore tax abuses that rob the U.S. Treasury of \nan estimated $100 billion each year, reward tax dodgers using offshore \nsecrecy laws to hide money from Uncle Sam, and offload the tax burden \nonto the backs of middle income families who play by the rules.\n  It is time for Congress and this administration to take a stand \nagainst offshore tax evasion. It is unfair; we can't afford it; and \nthere is a whole lot more we can do to stop it.\n  The bill we are introducing today is an improved version of the Stop \nTax Haven Abuse Act that I introduced in February 2007, with Senator \nColeman and then Senator Obama, and that Congressmen Lloyd Doggett and \nRahm Emanuel introduced in the House with the support of 47 cosponsors. \nNo action was taken last Congress on either bill, even though evidence \nhas continued to pour in about the extensive and serious nature of \noffshore tax dodging.\n  In July 2008, for example, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, which I chair, held two days of hearings and released a \nreport that broke through the wall of secrecy that normally surrounds \nbanks located in tax haven jurisdictions. The Subcommittee presented \nmultiple case histories exposing how two such banks, UBS AG of \nSwitzerland and LGT Bank of Liechtenstein, used an array of secrecy \ntricks to help U.S. clients hide assets and dodge U.S. taxes.\n  The hearing showed, for example, that UBS had opened Swiss accounts \nfor an estimated 19,000 U.S. clients with nearly $18 billion in assets, \nand did not report any of those accounts to the U.S. Internal Revenue \nService. A UBS private banker based in Switzerland pled guilty to \nconspiring to helping a U.S. billionaire hide $200 million and evade \n$7.2 million in tax, and provided sworn deposition testimony to the \nSubcommittee about how UBS Swiss bankers sought and serviced clients \nright here in the United States. A more senior UBS official asserted \nhis Fifth Amendment rights at the hearing rather than answer questions \nabout UBS conduct.\n  The Subcommittee investigation also presented seven case histories of \nU.S. persons who had secretly stashed millions of dollars in accounts \nat LGT Bank, a private bank owned by the Liechtenstein royal family. \nThese case histories unfolded like spy novels, with secret meetings, \nhidden funds, shell corporations, and complex offshore transactions \nspanning the globe from the United States to Liechtenstein, \nSwitzerland, the British Virgin Islands, Australia, and Hong Kong. What \nthe case histories had in common were officials from LGT Bank and its \naffiliates acting as willing partners to move a lot of money into LGT \naccounts, while obscuring the ownership and origin of the funds from \ntax authorities, creditors, and courts.\n  A former LGT employee, now in hiding for disclosing LGT client \ninformation, provided videotaped testimony during the hearing \ndescribing a long list of secrecy tricks and deceptive practices used \nby LGT to conceal client assets. They included using code names for LGT \nclients; requiring bankers to use outside pay phones to call clients to \nprevent those calls from being traced back to the bank; establishing \noffshore shell corporations which clients could use to route money into \nand out of their LGT accounts without incriminating wire transfers; and \ncreating elaborate offshore structures involving foundations, trusts, \nand corporations to conceal client ownership of assets. In addition, \nfour U.S. persons asserted their Fifth Amendment rights at the hearing \nand declined to answer questions about their LGT accounts.\n  More than 150 U.S. taxpayers are now under investigation by the IRS \nfor having undeclared Liechtenstein accounts. The IRS is not labouring \nalone. Nearly a dozen countries have investigations underway into \npossible tax evasion involving Liechtenstein accounts. Germany, for \nexample, is working through a list of 600 to 700 German taxpayers with \nLGT accounts, including a prominent businessman who allegedly used LGT \naccounts to evade $1.5 million in taxes.\n  LGT was invited to the July Subcommittee hearings to defend its \nactions, but chose not to appear. UBS, to its credit, appeared and \nannounced at the hearings that it would take responsibility for its \nactions. It apologized for past compliance failures, promised to close \nall 19,000 Swiss accounts unless the U.S. accountholder agreed to \ndisclose the account to the IRS, and announced it would no longer offer \nU.S. clients the option of opening Swiss accounts that are not \ndisclosed to the IRS. A few months later, Liechtenstein signed its \nfirst tax information exchange agreement with the United States, and \nLGT announced its intention to change its business model and begin \ncooperating with foreign tax authorities.\n  The actions taken by UBS and LGT have reverberated around the tax \nhaven world, raising questions about whether the game is finally up and \nthe international community is ready to take action to put an end to \noffshore secrecy and tax abuses. Some banks, like Credit Suisse, \nSwitzerland's largest bank after UBS, have decided to follow UBS' lead \nand stop offering hidden Swiss bank accounts to U.S. clients. But many \nother tax haven banks continue their secret ways and continue to engage \nin practices that facilitate tax evasion.\n  The United States Government is continuing its efforts to combat \noffshore secrecy. In November 2008, the U.S. Department of Justice, \nDOJ, indicted a senior UBS official, then head of the UBS private bank, \nfor conspiring to help other U.S. clients dodge U.S. taxes. Because \nhe has refused to face the charges, he remains a fugitive from justice \nin Switzerland. In February, DOJ indicted UBS itself, again for \nconspiring to help U.S. clients dodge U.S. taxes. That criminal \nprosecution was then deferred, because UBS admitted to the underlying \nfacts, paid a $780 million fine, turned over the names of at least 250 \nclients with Swiss accounts,\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\nand promised to no longer open Swiss accounts for U.S. clients without \nnotifying the IRS. A U.S. indictment of a major bank is rare; an \nindictment of a major bank for helping clients evade U.S. taxes may be \nunprecedented.\n\n  In addition to filing these criminal prosecutions, DOJ served UBS \nwith a John Doe summons seeking the names of the other 19,000 U.S. \nclients with Swiss accounts hidden from the IRS. UBS said at the \nSubcommittee hearing in July that it was ready to cooperate, but \nvirtually none of the information requested by the John Doe summons has \nbeen turned over, primarily because the Swiss Government has taken the \nposition that turning over this client account information would \nviolate Swiss secrecy laws. DOJ has asked the U.S. court that approved \nthe summons to enforce it, and a trial to resolve the issue is now \nscheduled for July 2009, one year after the initial request for the \ninformation. The fact that the United States is having such a difficult \ntime getting the client names, despite catching UBS red-handed and \nobtaining its admission of wrongdoing, shows how tough the offshore tax \nevasion problem is.\n  It is worth noting that Switzerland is refusing to allow UBS to \nprovide the names of potential U.S. tax cheats, while at the same time \nattempting to claim it is not a tax haven and it is not a secrecy \njurisdiction. It is also worth noting that top Swiss government \nofficials have now formed a ``strategic delegation'' charged with \ndefending Swiss bank secrecy against efforts by the United States, \nEuropean Union, and other countries to change Swiss practices.\n  Right now, tax haven governments and tax haven banks often dress up \ntheir secrecy laws and banking practices with phrases like ``financial \nprivacy'' and ``wealth management.'' Some enter into tax treaties and \ntax information exchange agreements with the United States, while \nsetting up procedures that deny or delay providing information \nessential for effective tax enforcement. They also use their secrecy \nlaws and practices to hide, not only the wrongdoing of the taxpayers, \nbut also the actions of the tax haven participants who aid and abet the \nwrongdoing.\n  Secrecy breeds tax evasion. Tax evasion eats at the fabric of \nsociety, not only by starving health care, education, and other needed \ngovernment services of resources, but also by undermining trust--making \nhonest folks feel like they are being taken advantage of when they pay \ntheir fair share.\n  We can fight back against offshore secrecy jurisdictions and offshore \ntax abuses if we summon the political will. Our bill offers powerful \nnew tools to tear down the tax haven secrecy walls in favour of \ntransparency, cooperation, and tax compliance. To tear down those \nsecrecy walls, protect honest taxpayers, and obtain the revenues \nessential for critical needs, I hope my colleagues will act during this \nCongress to enact our legislation to shut down the $100 billion in \noffshore tax abuses.\n  The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act is the product of years of work. My \nSubcommittee, through reports and hearings, has exposed numerous \nabusive practices involving offshore tax havens as well as home-grown \nabusive tax shelters. In the 109th Congress, we confronted these twin \nthreats to our treasury by introducing S. 1565, the Tax Shelter and Tax \nHaven Reform Act. In the 110th Congress, we introduced an improved \nversion of that legislation, S. 681, reflecting not only the \nSubcommittee's additional investigative work but also innovative ideas \nto end the use of tax havens and to stop unethical tax advisers from \naiding and abetting U.S. tax evasion.\n  Today's bill is very similar to S. 681, but with three new additions. \nA new Section 103 addresses the tax dodging that occurs when a business \nincorporates in a tax haven, pretending to be a foreign corporation for \nU.S. tax purposes, while, in reality, being managed and controlled from \nthe United States. A new Section 108 seeks to put an end to financial \ngimmicks being used by offshore hedge funds and others to dodge payment \nof U.S. taxes on U.S. stock dividends. A new Section 109 expands \nreporting requirements for U.S. persons who benefit from a passive \nforeign investment corporation. These new sections offer powerful new \ntools to combat offshore tax abuse.\n  I will now describe some of the tax abuses that need to be addressed \nand explain what our bill would do to stop them. First, I will look at \nthe offshore tax problem and then at some of our home-grown abusive tax \nshelters.\n\n\n                            Tax Haven Abuses\n\n  A tax haven is a foreign jurisdiction that maintains corporate, bank, \nand tax secrecy laws and industry practices that make it very difficult \nfor other countries to find out whether their citizens are using the \ntax haven to cheat on their taxes. In effect, tax havens sell secrecy \nto attract clients to their shores. They peddle secrecy the way other \ncountries advertise high quality services. That secrecy is used to \ncloak tax evasion and other misconduct, and it is that offshore secrecy \nthat is targeted in our bill.\n  The Tax Justice Network, an international non-profit organization \ndedicated to fighting tax evasion, has estimated that wealthy \nindividuals worldwide have stashed $11.5 trillion of their assets in \noffshore tax havens. The IMF has estimated that, in 2000 alone, $1.7 \ntrillion in investments were sent through offshore tax havens. A series \nof 2007 Tax Notes articles estimated that over $1.5 trillion in hidden \nassets were located in just four tax havens, Guernsey, Jersey, Isle of \nMan, and Switzerland, characterizing those assets as beneficially owned \nby nonresident individuals likely avoiding tax in their home \njurisdictions. At one Subcommittee hearing, a former owner of an \noffshore bank in the Cayman Islands testified that he believed 100 \npercent of his former bank clients were engaged in tax evasion. He said \nthat almost all were from the United States and had taken elaborate \nmeasures to avoid IRS detection of their money transfers. He also \nexpressed confidence that the offshore government that licensed his \nbank would vigorously defend client secrecy in order to continue \nattracting business.\n  In connection with a hearing held in August 2006, the Subcommittee \nreleased a staff report with six case studies describing how U.S. \nindividuals use offshore tax havens to evade U.S. taxes. In one case, \ntwo brothers from Texas, Sam and Charles Wyly, established 58 offshore \ntrusts and corporations, and operated them for more than 13 years \nwithout alerting U.S. authorities. To move funds abroad, the brothers \ntransferred over $190 million in stock option compensation they had \nreceived from U.S. publicly traded companies to the offshore \ncorporations. They claimed that they did not have to pay tax on this \ncompensation, because, in exchange, the offshore corporations provided \nthem with private annuities which would not begin to make payments to \nthem until years later. In the meantime, the brothers directed the \noffshore corporations to cash in the stock options and start investing \nthe money. The brothers failed to disclose these offshore stock \ntransactions to the SEC despite their position as directors and major \nshareholders in the relevant companies.\n\n  The Subcommittee was able to trace more than $600 million in stock \noption proceeds that the brothers invested in various ventures they \ncontrolled, including two hedge funds, an energy company, and an \noffshore insurance firm. They also used the offshore funds to purchase \nreal estate, jewelry, and artwork for themselves and their family \nmembers, claiming they could use these offshore dollars to advance \ntheir personal and business interests without having to pay any taxes \non the offshore income. The Wylys were able to carry on these tax \nmaneuvers in large part because all of their activities were shrouded \nin offshore secrecy.\n  In another of the case histories, six U.S. taxpayers relied on \nphantom stock trades between two offshore shell companies to generate \nfake stock losses which were then used to shelter billions in income. \nThis offshore tax shelter scheme, known as the POINT Strategy, was \ndevised by Quellos, a U.S. securities firm headquartered in Seattle; \ncoordinated with a European financial firm known as Euram Advisers; and \nblessed by opinion letters issued by two prominent U.S. law firms, \nCravath Swaine and Bryan Cave. The two offshore shell companies at the \ncenter of the strategy, known as Jackstones and Barneville, supposedly \ncreated a stock portfolio worth $9.6 billion. However, no cash or stock \ntransfers ever took place. Moreover, the shell companies\n\n[[Page S2626]]\n\nthat conducted these phantom trades were so shrouded in offshore \nsecrecy that no one would admit to knowing who owns them. One U.S. \ntaxpayer used the scheme to shelter about $1.5 billion from U.S. taxes. \nAnother sought to shelter about $145 million. Both have since agreed to \nsettle with the IRS.\n  The persons examined by the Subcommittee are far from the only U.S. \ntaxpayers engaging in these types of offshore tax abuses. Two experts, \nJoseph Guttentag and Professor Reuven Avi-Yonah, have estimated that \nU.S. individuals are using offshore tax schemes to avoid payment of $40 \nto $70 billion in taxes each year.\n  Corporations are also using tax havens to avoid payment of U.S. \ntaxes. Data released by the Commerce Department indicates that, as of \n2001, almost half of all foreign profits of U.S. corporations were in \ntax havens. A study released by the journal Tax Notes in September 2004 \nfound that American companies were able to shift $149 billion of \nprofits to 18 tax haven countries in 2002, up 68 percent from $88 \nbillion in 1999. Professor Kimberly Clausing has estimated that \ncorporate offshore abuses utilizing transfer pricing schemes resulted \nin $60 billion in lost U.S. tax revenues in 2004, and other experts \nhave estimated similar amounts.\n  Corporate use of tax haven jurisdictions is also widespread. In \nJanuary 2009, Senator Dorgan and I released a report by the Government \nAccounting Office (GAO) which shows that out of the 100 largest U.S. \npublicly traded corporations, 83 have subsidiaries in tax havens. Of \nthe 100 largest federal contractors, 63 have tax haven subsidiaries. \nUsing data from their corporate filings with the Securities and \nExchange Commission, GAO listed the number of tax haven subsidiaries \nfor each of these corporations. GAO determined, for example, that \nMorgan Stanley has 273 tax haven subsidiaries, while Citigroup has 427, \nwith 90 in the Cayman Islands alone. News Corp. has 152, while Procter \nand Gamble has 83, Pfizer has 80, Oracle has 77, and Marathon Oil has \n76. My Subcommittee is currently engaged in an effort to understand why \nso many of these corporations have so many tax haven affiliates. To do \nthat we are going to have to battle secrecy laws in 50 different \njurisdictions.\n  Here's just one simplified example of the gimmicks being used by \ncorporations to transfer taxable income from the United States to tax \nhavens to escape taxation. Suppose a profitable U.S. corporation \nestablishes a shell corporation in a tax haven. The shell corporation \nhas no office or employees, just a mailbox address. The U.S. parent \ntransfers a valuable patent to the shell corporation. Then, the U.S. \nparent and all of its subsidiaries begin to pay a hefty fee to the \nshell corporation for use of the patent, reducing its U.S. income \nthrough deducting the patent fees and thus shifting taxable income out \nof the United States to the shell corporation. The shell corporation \ndeclares a portion of the fees as profit, but pays no U.S. tax since it \nis a tax haven resident. The icing on the cake is that the shell \ncorporation can then ``lend'' the income it has accumulated from the \nfees back to the U.S. parent for its use. The parent, in turn, pays \n``interest'' on the ``loans'' to the shell corporation, shifting still \nmore taxable income out of the United States to the tax haven. This \nexample highlights just a few of the tax haven ploys being used by some \nU.S. corporations to escape paying their fair share of taxes here at \nhome.\n  Our Subcommittee's 2008 investigation into tax haven banks and our \n2006 investigation into offshore abuses also highlight the extent to \nwhich offshore secrecy rules make it possible for taxpayers to \nparticipate in illicit activity with little fear of getting caught. \nThrough a series of case studies, the Subcommittee has shown how U.S. \ntaxpayers, with the help of offshore financial institutions, service \nproviders, legal counsel, and tax professionals, set up financial \naccounts and entities in secrecy jurisdictions to hide assets and dodge \ntaxes. The case studies showed how some U.S. persons created complex \noffshore structures to hide their ownership of offshore bank accounts. \nOthers formed offshore entities which they claimed were independent \nbut, in fact, exercised control over them through compliant offshore \ntrustees, officers, directors, and corporate administrators. Because of \noffshore secrecy laws and practices, offshore businesses could and did \ntake steps to protect their U.S. clients' identities and financial \ninformation from U.S. tax and regulatory authorities, making it \nextremely difficult, if not impossible, for U.S. law enforcement \nauthorities to get the information needed to enforce U.S. tax laws.\n  The extent of the offshore tax abuses documented by years of \nSubcommittee reports and hearings demonstrates the importance of \nobtaining new tools to combat offshore secrecy and restore the ability \nof U.S. tax enforcement to pursue offshore tax cheats. I'd now like to \ndescribe the key measures in the Stop Tax Havens Act providing those \nnew enforcement tools. They include new legal presumptions to overcome \noffshore secrecy barriers, special measures to combat persons who \nimpede U.S. tax enforcement, treatment of offshore corporations as \ndomestic corporations when controlled by U.S. persons, elimination of \nthe offshore dividend tax loophole, greater disclosure of offshore \ntransactions, and more.\n\n\n         Presumptions Related to Offshore Secrecy Jurisdictions\n\n  The 2006 Subcommittee staff report provided six case histories \ndetailing how U.S. taxpayers are using offshore tax havens to avoid \npayment of the taxes they owe. These case histories examined an \nInternet based company that helped persons obtain offshore entities and \naccounts; U.S. promoters that designed complex offshore structures to \nhide client assets, even providing clients with a how-to manual for \ngoing offshore; U.S. taxpayers who diverted business income offshore \nthrough phony loans and invoices; a one-time tax dodge that deducted \nphantom offshore stock losses from real U.S. stock income to shelter \nthat income from U.S. taxes; and the 13-year offshore empire built by \nSam and Charles Wyly. Each of these case histories presented the same \nfact pattern in which the U.S. taxpayer, through lawyers, banks, or \nother representatives, set up offshore trusts, corporations, or other \nentities which had all the trappings of independence but, in fact, were \ncontrolled by the U.S. taxpayer whose directives were implemented by \ncompliant offshore personnel acting as the trustees, officers, \ndirectors or nominee owners of the offshore entities.\n  In the case of the Wylys, the brothers and their representatives \ncommunicated Wyly directives to a so-called trust protector who then \nrelayed the directives to the offshore trustees. In the 13 years \nexamined by the Subcommittee, the offshore trustees never once rejected \na Wyly request and never once initiated an action without Wyly \napproval. They simply did what they were told. A U.S. taxpayer in \nanother case history told the Subcommittee that the offshore personnel \nwho nominally owned and controlled his offshore entities, in fact, \nalways followed his directions, describing himself as the ``puppet \nmaster'' in charge of his offshore holdings.\n  When the Subcommittee discussed these case histories with financial \nadministrators from the Isle of Man, the regulators explained that none \nof the offshore personnel were engaged in any wrongdoing, because their \nlaws permit foreign clients to transmit detailed, daily instructions to \noffshore service providers on how to handle offshore assets, so long as \nit is the offshore trustee or corporate officer who gives the final \norder to buy or sell the assets. They explained that, under their law, \nan offshore entity is considered legally independent from the person \ndirecting its activities so long as that person follows the form of \ntransmitting ``requests'' to the offshore personnel who retain the \nformal right to make the decisions, even though the offshore personnel \nalways do as they are asked.\n  The Subcommittee case histories illustrate what the tax literature \nand law enforcement experience have shown for years: that the business \nmodel followed in all offshore secrecy jurisdictions is for compliant \ntrustees, corporate administrators, and financial institutions to \nprovide a veneer of independence while ensuring that their U.S. clients \nretain complete and unfettered control over ``their'' offshore assets. \nThat's the standard operating procedure offshore. Offshore service\n\n[[Page S2627]]\n\nproviders pretend to own or control the offshore trusts, corporations, \nand accounts they help establish, but what they really do is whatever \ntheir clients tell them to do. In truth, the independence of offshore \nentities is a legal fiction, and it is past time to pull back the \ncurtain on the reality hiding behind the legal formalities.\n  The reality behind these offshore practices makes a mockery of U.S. \nlaws that normally view trusts and corporations as independent \nentities. They invite game-playing and tax evasion. To combat these \noffshore abuses, our bill takes them head on in a number of ways.\n\n     Section 101--Rebuttable evidentiary presumptions and initial \n       list of offshore secrecy jurisdictions\n\n  The first section of our bill, Section 101, tackles this issue by \ncreating several rebuttable evidentiary presumptions that would strip \nthe veneer of independence from the U.S. person involved with offshore \nentities, transactions, and accounts, unless that U.S. person presents \nclear and convincing evidence to the contrary. These presumptions would \napply only in civil judicial or administrative tax or securities \nenforcement proceedings examining transactions, entities, or accounts \nin offshore secrecy jurisdictions. These presumptions would put the \nburden of producing evidence from the offshore secrecy jurisdiction on \nthe taxpayer who chose to do business there, and who has access to the \ninformation, rather than on the federal government which has little or \nno practical ability to get the information. The creation of these \npresumptions implements a bipartisan recommendation in the August 2006 \nSubcommittee staff report on tax haven abuses.\n  The bill would establish three evidentiary presumptions that could be \nused in a civil tax enforcement proceeding: (1) a presumption that a \nU.S. taxpayer who ``formed, transferred assets to, was a beneficiary \nof, or received money or property'' from an offshore entity, such as a \ntrust or corporation, is in control of that entity; (2) a presumption \nthat funds or other property received from offshore are taxable income, \nand that funds or other property transferred offshore have not yet been \ntaxed; and (3) a presumption that a financial account controlled by a \nU.S. taxpayer in a foreign country contains enough money--$10,000--to \ntrigger an existing statutory reporting threshold and allow the IRS to \nassert the minimum penalty for nondisclosure of the account by the \ntaxpayer.\n  In addition, the bill would establish two evidentiary presumptions \napplicable to civil proceedings to enforce U.S. securities laws. One \nwould specify that if a director, officer, or major shareholder of a \nU.S. publicly traded corporation were associated with an offshore \nentity, that person would be presumed to control that offshore entity. \nThe second provides that securities nominally owned by an offshore \nentity are presumed to be beneficially owned by any U.S. person who \ncontrolled the offshore entity.\n  These presumptions are rebuttable, which means that the U.S. person \nwho is the subject of the proceeding could provide clear and convincing \nevidence to show that the presumptions were factually inaccurate. To \nrebut the presumptions, a taxpayer could establish, for example, that \nan offshore corporation really was controlled by an independent third \nparty, or that money sent from an offshore account really represented a \nnontaxable gift instead of taxable income. If the taxpayer wished to \nintroduce evidence from a foreign person, such as an offshore banker, \ncorporate officer, or trust administrator, to establish those facts, \nthat foreign person would have to actually appear in the U.S. \nproceeding in a manner that would permit cross examination in order for \nthe taxpayer to rebut the presumption. A simple affidavit from an \noffshore resident who refused to submit to cross examination in the \nUnited States would be insufficient.\n  There are several limitations on these presumptions to ensure their \noperation is fair and reasonable. First, the evidentiary rules in \ncriminal cases would not be affected by this bill which would apply \nonly to civil proceedings. Second, because the presumptions apply only \nin enforcement ``proceedings,'' they would not directly affect, for \nexample, a person's reporting obligations on a tax return or SEC \nfiling. The presumptions would come into play only if the IRS or SEC \nwere to challenge a matter in a formal proceeding. Third, the bill does \nnot apply the presumptions to situations where either the U.S. person \nor the offshore entity is a publicly traded company, because in those \nsituations, even if a transaction were abusive, IRS and SEC officials \nare generally able to obtain access to necessary information. Fourth, \nthe bill recognizes that certain classes of offshore transactions, such \nas corporate reorganizations, may not present a potential for abuse, \nand accordingly authorizes Treasury and the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to issue regulations or guidance identifying such classes of \ntransactions, to which the presumptions would then not apply.\n  An even more fundamental limitation on the presumptions is that they \nwould apply only to transactions, accounts, or entities in offshore \njurisdictions with secrecy laws or practices that unreasonably restrict \nthe ability of the U.S. government to get needed information and which \ndo not have effective information exchange programs with U.S. law \nenforcement. The bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury to \nidentify those offshore secrecy jurisdictions, based upon the practical \nexperience of the IRS in obtaining needed information from the relevant \ncountry.\n  To provide a starting point for Treasury, the bill presents an \ninitial list of 34 offshore secrecy jurisdictions. This list is taken \nfrom actual IRS court filings in court proceedings in which the IRS \nsought permission to obtain information about U.S. taxpayers active in \nthe named jurisdictions. The bill thus identifies the same \njurisdictions that the IRS has already named publicly as probable \nlocations for U.S. tax evasion. Federal courts all over the country \nhave consistently found, when presented with the IRS list and \nsupporting evidence, that the IRS had a reasonable basis for concluding \nthat U.S. taxpayers with financial accounts in those countries \npresented a risk of tax noncompliance. In every case, the courts \nallowed the IRS to collect information about accounts and transactions \nin the listed offshore jurisdictions.\n  The bill also provides Treasury with the authority to add or remove \njurisdictions from the initial list so that the list can change over \ntime and reflect the actual record of experience of the United States \nin its dealings with specific jurisdictions around the world. The bill \nprovides two tests for Treasury to use in determining whether a \njurisdiction should be identified as an ``offshore secrecy \njurisdiction'' triggering the evidentiary presumptions: (1) whether the \njurisdiction's secrecy laws and practices unreasonably restrict U.S. \naccess to information, and (2) whether the jurisdiction maintains a tax \ninformation exchange process with the United States that is effective \nin practice.\n  If offshore jurisdictions make a decision to enact secrecy laws and \nsupport industry practices furthering corporate, financial, and tax \nsecrecy, that's their business. But when U.S. taxpayers start using \nthose offshore secrecy laws and practices to evade U.S. taxes to the \ntune of $100 billion per year, that's our business. We have a right to \nenforce our tax laws and to expect that other countries will not help \nU.S. tax cheats achieve their ends.\n  The aim of the presumptions created by the bill is to eliminate the \nunfair advantage provided by offshore secrecy laws that for too long \nhave enabled U.S. persons to conceal their misconduct offshore and game \nU.S. law enforcement. These presumptions would allow U.S. law \nenforcement to establish what we all know from experience is normally \nthe case in an offshore jurisdiction--that a U.S. person associated \nwith an offshore entity controls that entity; that money and property \nsent to or from an offshore entity involves taxable income; and that an \noffshore account that wasn't disclosed to U.S. authorities should have \nbeen. U.S. law enforcement can establish these facts presumptively, \nwithout having to pierce the secrecy veil. At the same time, U.S. \npersons who chose to transact their affairs through an offshore secrecy \njurisdiction are given the opportunity to lift the veil of secrecy and \ndemonstrate that the presumptions are factually wrong.\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\n  We believe these evidentiary presumptions will provide U.S. tax and \nsecurities law enforcement with powerful new tools to shut down tax \nhaven abuses.\n\n     Section 102--Special measures where U.S. tax enforcement is \n       impeded\n\n  Section 102 of the bill is another innovative approach to combating \ntax haven abuses. This section would build upon existing Treasury \nauthority to apply an array of sanctions to counter specific foreign \nmoney laundering threats by extending that same authority to counter \nspecific foreign tax administration threats.\n  In 2001, the Patriot Act gave Treasury the authority under 31 U.S.C. \n5318A to require domestic financial institutions and agencies to take \nspecial measures with respect to foreign jurisdictions, financial \ninstitutions, or transactions found to be of ``primary money laundering \nconcern.'' Once Treasury designates a foreign jurisdiction or financial \ninstitution to be of primary money laundering concern, Section 5318A \nallows Treasury to impose a range of requirements on U.S. financial \ninstitutions in their dealings with the designated entity--from \nrequiring U.S. financial institutions, for example, to provide greater \ninformation than normal about transactions involving the designated \nentity, to prohibiting U.S. financial institutions from opening \naccounts for that foreign entity.\n  This Patriot Act authority has been used sparingly, but to telling \neffect. In some instances Treasury has employed special measures \nagainst an entire country, such as Burma, to stop its financial \ninstitutions from laundering funds through the U.S. financial system. \nMore often, Treasury has used the authority surgically, against a \nsingle problem financial institution, to stop laundered funds from \nentering the United States. The provision has clearly succeeded in \ngiving Treasury a powerful tool to protect the U.S. financial system \nfrom money laundering abuses.\n\n  The bill would authorize Treasury to use that same tool to require \nU.S. financial institutions to take the same special measures against \nforeign jurisdictions or financial institutions found by Treasury to be \n``impeding U.S. tax enforcement.'' Treasury could, for example, in \nconsultation with the IRS, Secretary of State, and the Attorney \nGeneral, require U.S. financial institutions that have correspondent \naccounts for a designated foreign bank to produce information on all of \nthat foreign bank's customers. Alternatively, Treasury could prohibit \nU.S. financial institutions from opening accounts for a designated \nforeign bank, thereby cutting off that foreign bank's access to the \nU.S. financial system. These types of sanctions could be as effective \nin ending the worst tax haven abuses as they have been in curbing money \nlaundering.\n  In addition to extending Treasury's ability to impose special \nmeasures against foreign entities impeding U.S. tax enforcement, the \nbill would add one new measure to the list of possible sanctions that \ncould be applied to foreign entities: it would allow Treasury to \ninstruct U.S. financial institutions not to authorize or accept credit \ncard transactions involving a designated foreign jurisdiction or \nfinancial institution. Denying tax haven banks the ability to issue \ncredit cards for use in the United States, for example, would be a \npowerful new way to stop U.S. tax cheats from obtaining access to funds \nhidden offshore.\n\n     Section 103--Deny tax benefits for foreign corporations \n       managed and controlled in the United States\n\n  In July 2008, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing detailing \nfindings made by GAO when it went to the Cayman Islands to look at the \ninfamous Ugland House, a five-story building that is the official \naddress for over 18,800 registered companies. GAO's review seems to \nindicate that the Cayman Islands has more registered businesses than \nresidents, with a mutual fund or hedge fund for every five residents, \nand two registered companies for every resident.\n  GAO also determined that about half of the alleged Ugland House \ntenants--around 9,000 entities--have a billing address in the United \nStates and were not actual occupants of the building. In fact, GAO \ndetermined that none of the nearly 19,000 companies registered at the \nUgland House was an actual occupant. GAO found that the only true \noccupant of the building is a Cayman law firm, Maples and Calder. \nAccording to the GAO: ``Very few Ugland House registered entities have \na significant physical presence in the Cayman Islands or carry out \nbusiness in the Cayman Islands. According to Maples and Calder \npartners, the persons establishing these entities are typically \nreferred to Maples by counsel from outside the Cayman Islands, fund \nmanagers, and investment banks. As of March 2008 the Cayman Islands \nRegistrar reported that 18,857 entities were registered at the Ugland \nHouse address. Approximately 96 percent of these entities were \nclassified as exempted entities under Cayman Islands law, and were thus \ngenerally prohibited from carrying out domestic business within the \nCayman Islands.''\n  Section 103 of the bill is a new addition to the Stop Tax Haven Abuse \nAct designed to address the Ugland House problem. It focuses on the \nsituation where a corporation is incorporated in a tax haven as a mere \nshell operation with little or no physical presence or employees in the \njurisdiction. The shell entity pretends it is operating in the tax \nhaven, even though its key personnel and decisionmakers are in the \nUnited States. The objective of this set up is to enable the owners of \nthe shell entity to take advantage of all of the benefits provided by \nU.S. legal, educational, financial, and commercial systems, and at the \nsame time avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n  My Subcommittee has seen numerous companies exploit this situation, \ndeclaring themselves to be foreign corporations, even though they \nreally operate out of the United States. For example, thousands of \nhedge funds whose financial experts live in Connecticut, New York, \nTexas, or California play this game to escape taxes and avoid \nregulation. In an October 2008 Subcommittee hearing, three sizeable \nhedge funds, Angelo Gordon, Highbridge Capital, and Maverick Capital, \nadmitted that, although all they claimed to be based in the Cayman \nIslands, none had an office or a single full time employee in that \njurisdiction. Instead, their offices and key decisionmakers were \nlocated and did business right here in the United States.\n  Section 103 will put an end to such corporate fictions and offshore \ntax dodging. It states that if a corporation is publicly traded or has \naggregate gross assets of $50 million or more, and its management and \ncontrol occurs primarily in the United States, that corporation will be \ntreated as a U.S. domestic corporation for income tax purposes.\n  To implement this provision, Treasury is directed to issue \nregulations to guide the determination of when management and control \noccur primarily in the United States, looking at whether \n``substantially all of the executive officers and senior management of \nthe corporation who exercise day-to-day responsibility for making \ndecisions involving strategic, financial, and operational policies of \nthe corporation are located primarily within the United States.''\n  This new section relies on the same principles regarding the true \nlocation of ownership and control of a company that underlie the \ncorporate inversion rules adopted in the American Jobs Creation Act of \n2005. Those inversion rules, however, do not address the fact that some \nentities directly incorporate in foreign countries and manage their \nbusinesses activities from the United States. Section 103 seeks to \nlevel the playing field and ensure that entities which incorporate \ndirectly in another country are subject to a similar management and \ncontrol test. Section 103 is also similar in concept to the substantial \npresence test in the income tax treaty between the United States and \nthe Netherlands, which looks to the primary place of management and \ncontrol to determine corporate residency.\n  Section 103 also provides an exception for foreign corporations with \nU.S. parents. This exception from the $50 million gross assets test \nrecognizes that, within a multinational operation, strategic, \nfinancial, and operational decisions are often made from a global or \nregional headquarters location and then implemented by affiliated \nforeign corporations. Where such decisions are undertaken by a parent \ncorporation\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\nthat is actively engaged in a U.S. trade or business and is organized \nin the United States--and is, therefore, already a domestic \ncorporation--the bill generally will not override existing U.S. \ntaxation of international operations. At the same time, this exception \nmakes it clear that the mere existence of a U.S. parent corporation is \nnot sufficient to shield a foreign corporation from also being treated \nas a domestic corporation under this section. The section also creates \nan exception for private companies that once met the section's test for \ntreatment as a domestic corporation but, during a later tax year, fell \nbelow the $50 million gross assets test, do not expect to exceed that \nthreshold again, and are granted a waiver by the Treasury Secretary.\n\n  Section 103 is intended to stop, in particular, the outrageous tax \ndodging that now goes on by too many hedge funds and investment \nmanagement businesses that structure themselves to appear to be foreign \nentities, even though their key decisionmakers--the folks who exercise \ncontrol of the company, its assets, and investment decisions--live and \nwork right here in the United States. Too many hedge funds establish a \nstructure of offshore entities, often including master and feeder \nfunds, that make it appear as if the hedge fund's assets and investment \ndecisions are offshore, when, in fact, the funds are being managed and \ncontrolled by investment experts located in the United States. It is \nunacceptable that such companies utilize U.S. offices, personnel, laws, \nand markets to make their money, but then stiff Uncle Sam and offload \ntheir tax burden onto competitors who play by the rules.\n  To put an end to this charade, Section 103 specifically directs \nTreasury regulations to specify that, when corporate assets are being \nmanaged primarily on behalf of investors and the investment decisions \nare being made in the United States, the management and control of that \ncorporation shall be treated as occurring primarily in the United \nStates, and that corporation shall be subject to U.S. taxes in the same \nmanner as any other U.S. corporation.\n  If enacted into law, Section 103, the Ugland House provision, would \nput an end to the unfair situation where some U.S.-based companies pay \ntheir fair share of taxes, while others who set up a shell corporation \nin a tax haven are able to defer or escape taxation, despite the fact \nthat their foreign status is nothing more than a paper fiction.\n\n     Section 104--Extension of time for offshore audits\n\n  Section 104 of the bill addresses a key problem faced by the IRS in \ncases involving offshore jurisdictions--completing audits in a timely \nfashion when the evidence needed is located in a jurisdiction with \nsecrecy laws. Currently, in the absence of fraud or some other \nexception, the IRS has three years from the date a tax return is filed \nto complete an audit and assess any additional tax. Because offshore \nsecrecy laws slow down, and sometimes impede, efforts by the United \nStates to obtain offshore financial and beneficial ownership \ninformation, the bill gives the IRS an extra three years to complete an \naudit and assess a tax on transactions involving an offshore secrecy \njurisdiction. Of course, in the event that a case turns out to involve \nactual fraud, this provision of the bill is not intended to limit the \nrule giving the IRS unlimited time to assess tax in such cases.\n\n     Section 105--Increased disclosure of offshore accounts and \n       entities\n\n  Offshore tax abuses thrive in secrecy. Section 105 attempts to pierce \nthat secrecy by creating two new disclosure mechanisms requiring third \nparties to report on offshore transactions undertaken by U.S. persons.\n  The first disclosure mechanism focuses on U.S. financial institutions \nthat open a U.S. account in the name of an offshore entity, such as an \noffshore trust or corporation, and learn from an anti-money laundering \ndue diligence review, that a U.S. person is the beneficial owner behind \nthat offshore entity. In the Wyly case history examined by the \nSubcommittee, for example, three major U.S. financial institutions \nopened dozens of accounts for offshore trusts and corporations which \nthey knew were associated with the Wyly family.\n  Under current anti-money laundering law, all U.S. financial \ninstitutions are supposed to know who is behind an account opened in \nthe name of, for example, an offshore shell corporation or trust. They \nare supposed to obtain this information to safeguard the U.S. financial \nsystem against misuse by terrorists, money launderers, and other \ncriminals.\n  Under current tax law, a bank or securities broker that opens an \naccount for a U.S. person is also required to give the IRS a 1099 form \nreporting any capital gains or other reportable income earned on the \naccount. However, the bank or securities broker need not file a 1099 \nform if the account is owned by a foreign entity not subject to U.S. \ntax law. Problems arise when an account is opened in the name of an \noffshore entity that is nominally not subject to tax, but which the \nbank or broker knows, from its anti-money laundering review, is owned \nor controlled by a U.S. person who is subject to tax. The U.S. person \nshould be filing a tax return with the IRS reporting the income of the \n``controlled foreign corporation.'' However, since he or she knows it \nis difficult for the IRS to connect an offshore accountholder to a \nparticular taxpayer, he or she may feel safe in not reporting that \nincome. That complacency might change, however, if the U.S. person knew \nthat the bank or broker who opened the account and learned of the \nconnection had a legal obligation to report any account income to the \nIRS.\n  Under current law, the way the regulations are written and typically \ninterpreted, the bank or broker can treat an account opened in the name \nof a foreign corporation as an account that is held by an independent \nentity that is separate from the U.S. person, even if it knows that the \nforeign corporation is merely holding title to the account for the U.S. \nperson, who exercises complete authority over the corporation and \nbenefits from any income earned on the account. Many banks and brokers \ncontend that the current regulations impose no duty on them to file a \n1099 or other form disclosing that type of account to the IRS.\n  The bill would strengthen current law by expressly requiring a bank \nor broker that knows, as a result of its anti-money laundering due \ndiligence or otherwise, that a U.S. person is the beneficial owner of a \nforeign entity that opened an account, to disclose that account to the \nIRS by filing a 1099 or equivalent form reporting the account income. \nThis reporting obligation would not require banks or brokers to gather \nany new information--financial institutions are already required to \nperform anti-money laundering due diligence for accounts opened by \noffshore shell entities. The bill would instead require U.S. financial \ninstitutions to act on what they already know by filing the relevant \nform with the IRS.\n\n  This section would require such reports to the IRS from two sets of \nfinancial institutions. The first set are financial institutions which \nare located and do business in the United States, supply 1099 and other \nforms to the IRS, and open U.S. accounts for foreign entities which the \nfinancial institution knows are beneficially owned by U.S. persons. The \nsecond set are foreign financial institutions which are located and do \nbusiness outside of the United States, but are voluntary participants \nin the Qualified Intermediary Program, and have agreed to provide \ninformation to the IRS about certain accounts. Under this section, if a \nforeign financial institution has an account under the QI Program, and \nthe accountholder is a non-U.S. entity that is controlled or \nbeneficially owned by a U.S. person, then that foreign financial \ninstitution would have to report to the IRS any U.S. securities or \nother reportable assets or income in that account.\n  The second disclosure mechanism created by Section 105 targets U.S. \nfinancial institutions that open foreign bank accounts or set up \noffshore corporations, trusts, or other entities for their U.S. \nclients. Our investigations have shown that it is common for private \nbankers and brokers in the United States to provide these services to \ntheir wealthy clients, so that the clients do not even need to leave \nhome to set up an offshore structure. The offshore entities can then \nopen both offshore and U.S. accounts and supposedly\n\n[[Page S2630]]\n\nbe treated as foreign account holders for tax purposes.\n  A Subcommittee investigation learned, for example, that Citibank \nPrivate Bank routinely offered to its clients private banking services \nwhich included establishing one or more offshore shell corporations--\nwhich it called Private Investment Corporations or PICs--in \njurisdictions like the Cayman Islands. The paperwork to form the PIC \nwas typically completed by a Citibank affiliate located in the \njurisdiction, such as Cititrust, which is a Cayman trust company. \nCititrust could then help the PIC open offshore accounts, while \nCitibank could help the PIC open U.S. accounts.\n  Section 105 would require any U.S. financial institution that \ndirectly or indirectly opens a foreign account or establishes a foreign \ncorporation or other entity for a U.S. customer to report that action \nto the IRS. The bill authorizes the regulators of banks and securities \nfirms, as well as the IRS, to enforce this filing requirement. Existing \ntax law already requires U.S. taxpayers that take such actions to \nreport them to the IRS, but many fail to do so, secure in the knowledge \nthat offshore secrecy laws limit the ability of the IRS to find out \nabout the establishment of new offshore accounts and entities. That's \nwhy our bill turns to a third party--the financial institution--to \ndisclose the information. Placing this third party reporting \nrequirement on the private banks and brokers will make it more \ndifficult for U.S. clients to hide their offshore transactions.\n     Section 106--Closing foreign trust loopholes\n  Section 106 of our bill strengthens the ability of the IRS to stop \noffshore trust abuses by making narrow but important changes to the \nRevenue Code provisions dealing with taxation of foreign trusts. The \nrules on foreign trust taxation have been significantly strengthened \nover the past 30 years to the point where they now appear adequate to \nprevent or punish many of the more serious abuses. However, the \nSubcommittee's 2006 investigation found a few loopholes that are still \nbeing exploited by tax cheats and that need to be shut down.\n  The bill would make several changes to close these loopholes. First, \nour investigation showed that U.S. taxpayers exercising control over a \nsupposedly independent foreign trust commonly used the services of a \nliaison, called a trust ``protector'' or ``enforcer,'' to convey their \ndirectives to the supposedly independent offshore trustees. A trust \nprotector is typically authorized to replace a foreign trustee at will \nand to advise the trustees on a wide range of trust matters, including \nthe handling of trust assets and the naming of trust beneficiaries. In \ncases examined by the Subcommittee, the trust protector was often a \nfriend, business associate, or employee of the U.S. person exercising \ncontrol over the foreign trust. Section 105 provides that, for tax \npurposes, any powers held by a trust protector shall be attributed to \nthe trust grantor.\n  A second problem addressed by our bill involves U.S. taxpayers who \nestablish foreign trusts for the benefit of their families in an effort \nto escape U.S. tax on the accumulation of trust income. Foreign trusts \ncan accumulate income tax free for many years. Previous amendments to \nthe foreign trust rules have addressed the taxation problem by \nbasically disregarding such trusts and taxing the trust income to the \ngrantors as it is earned. However, as currently written, this taxation \nrule applies only to years in which the foreign trust has a named \n``U.S. beneficiary.'' In response, to avoid the reach of the rule, some \ntaxpayers have begun structuring their foreign trusts so that they \noperate with no named U.S. beneficiaries.\n  For example, the Subcommittee's investigation into the Wyly trusts \ndiscovered that the foreign trust agreements had only two named \nbeneficiaries, both of which were foreign charities, but also gave the \noffshore trustees ``discretion'' to name beneficiaries in the future. \nThe offshore trustees had been informed in a letter of wishes from the \nWyly brothers that the trust assets were to go to their children after \ndeath. The trustees also knew that the trust protector selected by the \nWylys had the power to replace them if they did not comply with the \nWylys' instructions. In addition, during the life of the Wyly brothers, \nand in accordance with instructions supplied by the trust protector, \nthe offshore trustees authorized millions of dollars in trust income to \nbe invested in Wyly business ventures and spent on real estate, \njewelry, artwork, and other goods and services used by the Wylys and \ntheir families. The Wylys plainly thought they had found a legal \nloophole that would let them enjoy and direct the foreign trust assets \nwithout any obligation to pay taxes on the money they used.\n  To stop such foreign trust abuses, the bill would make it impossible \nto pretend that this type of foreign trust has no U.S. beneficiaries. \nThe bill would shut down the loophole by providing that: (1) any U.S. \nperson actually benefiting from a foreign trust is treated as a trust \nbeneficiary, even if they are not named in the trust instrument; (2) \nfuture or contingent U.S. beneficiaries are treated the same as current \nbeneficiaries; and (3) loans of foreign trust assets or property such \nas real estate, jewelry and artwork (in addition to loans of cash or \nsecurities already covered by current law) are treated as trust \ndistributions for tax purposes.\n\n     Section 10--Legal opinion protection from penalties\n\n  Section 107 of the bill takes aim at legal opinions that are used to \ntry to immunize taxpayers against penalties for tax shelter \ntransactions with offshore elements. The Subcommittee investigations \nhave found that tax practitioners sometimes tell potential clients that \nthey can invest in an offshore tax scheme without fear of penalty, \nbecause they will be given a legal opinion that will shield the \ntaxpayer from any imposition of the 20 percent accuracy related \npenalties in the tax code. Current law does, in fact, allow taxpayers \nto escape these penalties if they can produce a legal opinion letter \nstating that the tax arrangement in question is ``more likely than \nnot'' to survive challenge by the IRS. The problem with such opinions \nwhere part of the transaction occurs in an offshore secrecy \njurisdiction is that critical assumptions of the opinions are often \nbased on offshore events, transactions and facts that are hidden and \ncannot be easily ascertained by the IRS. Legal opinions based on such \nassumptions should be understood by any reasonable person to be \ninherently unreliable.\n  The bill therefore provides that, for any transaction involving an \noffshore secrecy jurisdiction, the taxpayer would need to have some \nother basis, independent of the legal opinion, to show that there was \nreasonable cause to claim the tax benefit. The ``more likely than not'' \nopinion would no longer be sufficient in and of itself to shield a \ntaxpayer from all penalties if an offshore secrecy jurisdiction is \ninvolved. This provision, which is based upon a suggestion made by IRS \nCommissioner Mark Everson at our August 2006 hearing, is intended to \nforce taxpayers to think twice about entering into an offshore scheme \nand to stop thinking that an opinion by a lawyer is all they need to \nescape any penalty for nonpayment of taxes owed. By making this change, \nwe would also provide an incentive for taxpayers to understand and \ndocument the complete facts of the offshore aspects of a transaction \nbefore claiming favorable tax treatment.\n  To ensure that this section does not impede legitimate business \narrangements in offshore secrecy jurisdictions, the bill authorizes the \nTreasury Secretary to issue regulations exempting two types of legal \nopinions from the application of this section. First, the Treasury \nSecretary could exempt all legal opinions that have a confidence level \nsubstantially above the more-likely-than-not level, such as opinions \nwhich express confidence that a proposed tax arrangement ``should'' \nwithstand an IRS challenge. ``More-likely-than-not'' opinion letters \nare normally viewed as expressing confidence that a tax arrangement has \nat least a 50 percent chance of surviving IRS review, while a \n``should'' opinion is normally viewed as expressing a confidence level \nof 70 to 75 percent. This first exemption is intended to ensure that \nlegal opinions on arrangements that are highly likely to survive IRS \nreview would continue to shield taxpayers from the 20 percent penalty.\n  Second, the Treasury Secretary could exempt legal opinions addressing \nclasses of transactions, such as corporate reorganizations, that do not \npresent\n\n[[Page S2631]]\n\nthe potential for abuse. These exemptions would ensure that taxpayers \nwho obtain legal opinions for these classes of transactions would also \nbe protected from tax code penalties.\n  Finally, in drafting such regulations, it is intended that the \nSecretary of the Treasury take into account the function of the ``more \nlikely than not'' standard in the context of corporations that are \nindependently audited and subject to accounting rules requiring \ndisclosure of uncertain tax positions. It is intended that the \nregulations issued under this bill provision be coordinated with the \nobjectives of those accounting rules to ensure consistent guidance for \ndetecting and stopping abusive transactions without disrupting the \nfinancial accounting of legitimate transactions.\n\n     Section 108--Closing the dividend tax loophole\n\n  Section 108 of this bill is the second new addition to the Stop Tax \nHaven Abuse Act. It is aimed at closing down a tax loophole that has \nenabled offshore hedge funds and others to use complex financial \ngimmicks, including transactions involving equity swaps and offshore \nstock loans, to dodge billions of dollars in U.S. taxes over the last \nten years. This loophole contributes to the estimated $100 billion in \nunpaid taxes that Uncle Sam loses each year from offshore tax abuses. \nWith financial disasters hitting this country from every direction, we \ncan no longer afford to ignore this offshore tax dodge. It is time to \nshut it down.\n  The section is straightforward. It amends the Internal Revenue Code \nto make it clear that non-U.S. persons cannot escape payment of U.S. \ntaxes on U.S. stock dividends by participating in structured financial \ntransactions that recast taxable stock dividend payments as allegedly \ntax-free ``dividend equivalent'' or ``substitute dividend'' payments. \nThe bill eliminates this offshore tax dodge by requiring that dividend, \ndividend equivalent, and substitute dividend payments made to non-U.S. \npersons all receive the same tax treatment--as taxable income subject \nto withholding.\n  Right now, foreigners who invest in the United States enjoy a minimal \ntax burden. For example, non-U.S. persons who deposit money with a U.S. \nbank or securities firm pay no U.S. taxes on the interest earned. They \npay no U.S. taxes on capital gains. U.S. citizens do pay taxes on that \nincome, but the tax code lets foreign investors operate without tax in \nan effort to attract foreign investment.\n  But there is one tax on the books that even foreign investors are \nsupposed to pay. If they buy stock in a U.S. company, and that stock \npays a dividend, the non-U.S. stockholder is supposed to pay a tax on \nthe dividend. The general tax rate is 30%, unless their country of \nresidence has negotiated a lower rate with the United States, typically \n15%.\n  In addition, to make sure those dividend taxes are paid, U.S. law \nrequires the person or entity paying a stock dividend to a non-U.S. \nperson to withhold the tax owed Uncle Sam before any part of the \ndividend leaves the United States. If the ``withholding agent'' fails \nto retain and remit the dividend tax to the IRS, and the tax is not \npaid by the dividend recipient, the tax code makes the withholding \nagent equally liable for the unpaid taxes. That's the law. But the \nreality is that many non-U.S. stockholders never pay the dividend taxes \nthey owe.\n  An investigation conducted by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, which I chair, resulted in a staff report and hearing \nin September 2008, which showed that foreign entities, primarily \noffshore hedge funds and foreign financial institutions, use two \ncommon schemes to dodge their dividend tax obligations to the U.S. \ngovernment--equity swaps and stock loans.\n\n  Swaps sound complicated, but they are essentially a financial bet--in \nthe case of equity swaps a bet on the future of a stock price. Under \nthe swap, a financial institution promises to pay, say, a hedge fund an \namount equal to any price appreciation in the stock price and the \namount of any dividend paid during the term of the swap. The payment \nreflecting the dividend is referred to as a ``dividend equivalent.'' In \nreturn, the hedge fund agrees to pay the financial institution an \namount equal to any price depreciation in the stock price. The \nfinancial institution hedges its risk by holding the physical shares of \nstock that were ``sold'' to it by the hedge fund. It also charges a \nfee, which usually includes a portion of the tax savings that the hedge \nfund will obtain by dodging the withholding tax.\n  The swap gives the hedge fund the same economic risks and rewards \nthat it had when it owned the physical shares of the stock. So why hold \na swap instead of the stock inself? Because under the tax code, \ndividend payments are taxed, but dividend equivalent payments made \nunder a swap are not.\n  Dividend equivalent payments made under a swap are tax free, because, \nin 1991, the IRS issued a series of regulations to determine what types \nof income will be treated as coming from the United States and \ntherefore taxable. These so-called ``source'' rules treat U.S. stock \ndividends as U.S. source income, because the money comes from a U.S. \ncorporation. But the 1991 regulation takes the opposite approach with \nrespect to swaps. It deems swap agreements to be ``notional principal \ncontracts'' and says that the ``source'' of any payment made under that \ncontract is to be determined, not by where the money came from, but by \nwhere it ends up. In other words, the payment's source is the country \nwhere the payment recipient resides.\n  That approach turns the usual meaning of the word, ``source,'' on its \nhead. Instead of looking to the origin of the payment to determine its \n``source,'' the IRS swap rule looks to its end point--who receives it. \nThat ``source'' is not really a ``source'' by any known definition of \nthe word. It is the opposite--not the point of origin but the end \npoint.\n  The result is that when a financial institution makes a dividend \nequivalent payment to an offshore client under a swap agreement, the \ntax code provides that the payment is from an offshore ``source.'' So \nthe swap payment is free of any U.S. tax. In our example, the U.S. \nfinancial institution makes the swap payment to the offshore hedge \nfund, minus its fee, and stiffs Uncle Sam for the amount of taxes that \nshould have been sent to the IRS. The swap is then terminated, and the \nstock is ``sold'' back to the hedge fund. Under this gimmick, the hedge \nfund ends up in the same position as before the swap, as a stockholder, \nexcept it has pocketed a dividend payment without paying any U.S. tax.\n  Stock loans are also used to dodge dividend taxes. These transactions \npile a stock loan on top of a swap to achieve the same allegedly tax-\nfree result.\n  The first step is that the client with an upcoming dividend lends its \nstock to an offshore corporation controlled by the financial \ninstitution. This offshore corporation promises, as part of the loan \nagreement, to forward any dividend payments back to the client.\n  The next step is that offshore corporation enters into a swap with \nthe financial institution that controls it, referencing the same type \nof stock and number of shares that is the subject of the stock loan. \nEssentially, two related parties are placing a bet on the stock, which \nmakes no economic sense except, once that stock pays the dividend, the \nswap arrangement allows the financial institution to send it as an \nallegedly tax-free dividend equivalent payment to the offshore \ncorporation it controls. The offshore corporation then forwards the \nsame amount to the client. Because the payment is sent to the client as \npart of a stock loan agreement, it is called a ``substitute dividend.'' \nThe tax code treats substitute dividends in the same way as the \nunderlying dividend. So if the underlying dividend came from a U.S. \ncorporation, the substitute dividend would normally be taxed as U.S. \nsource income.\n  But in this transaction, the parties claim the substitute dividend is \ntax-free by invoking the wording of an obscure IRS Notice 97-66 never \nintended to be applied to this situation. That notice says that when \ntwo parties in a stock loan are outside of the United States and \nsubject to the same dividend tax rate, they don't have to pay the \ndividend tax when passing on a substitute dividend. The assumption is \nthat the tax was already paid by another party in the lending \ntransaction. Some tax lawyers have seized on the wording to claim that \nthis IRS Notice, which was intended to prevent over-withholding, could \nbe used to eliminate\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\ndividend withholding entirely, so long as one offshore party passes on \na substitute dividend to another offshore party subject to the same \ndividend tax rate. The IRS testified at the Subcommittee hearing that \nNotice 97-66 was never intended to be interpreted that way, but in the \nten years since it was issued and abusive stock loans have exploded, \nthe IRS has never put that in writing.\n  The end result in our example is that the client pockets a substitute \ndividend payment--minus the financial institution's fee--without paying \nany tax. The stock loan is terminated, and the stock is returned to the \nclient. The big advantage of this approach over a swap is that the \nclient doesn't have to explain why he got his stock back after the \ntransaction. The stock was, after all, only on loan.\n  Tax dodging was clearly the economic purpose of the two transactions \njust described. While there are many types of legitimate swap and stock \nloan transactions, the Subcommittee investigation found that in these \ncases, such transactions were conducted primarily to dodge U.S. taxes \nand not for legitimate business purposes. In some of the most extreme \nexamples, the client owned U.S. stock both before and after each \ntransaction. Neither the swap nor the stock loan altered the client's \nmarket risk. The only risk involved in either transaction was that \nUncle Sam would catch on and assess the dividend taxes that should have \nbeen paid but weren't.\n  To make it harder for Uncle Sam to catch on and prove what is going \non, financial institutions have added more complexity, more bells and \nwhistles, to these so-called ``dividend enhancement'' transactions. But \nthe purpose of the transactions remains the same--to enable clients to \nescape paying the taxes they owe.\n  In the September 2008 hearing and report released by the \nSubcommittee, we described how specific financial institutions and \nhedge funds used swaps and stock loans to duck U.S. stock dividend \ntaxes. We disclosed, for example, that Morgan Stanley helped clients, \nfrom 2000 to 2007, dodge payment of U.S. dividend taxes of over $300 \nmillion. Lehman Brothers estimated that in one year alone, 2004, it \nhelped clients dodge U.S. dividend taxes amounting to perhaps $115 \nmillion. UBS enabled clients, from 2004 to 2007, dodge $62 million in \ndividend taxes, but last year stopped offering the Cayman stock loans \nthat produced that figure. Maverick Capital, which runs several \noffshore hedge funds, disclosed that its offshore hedge funds used \ndividend enhancement products sold by multiple firms to escape dividend \ntaxes from 2000 to 2007, totaling nearly $95 million. Citigroup even \nadmitted to the IRS that it had failed to withhold dividend taxes on \ncertain swap transactions from 2003 to 2005, and voluntarily paid \nmissing taxes totaling $24 million. The Subcommittee investigation \ndocumented, in short, a whole swath of unpaid dividend taxes from just \na handful of firms.\n  Section 108, if enacted into law, would prevent non-U.S. persons from \navoiding their U.S. dividend tax obligations by recasting dividend \npayments as allegedly tax-free dividend equivalent or substitute \ndividend payments. Instead, all payments of dividend-based amounts \nwould be treated consistently.\n  The section also authorizes the Treasury Secretary to issue \nregulations addressing several related issues. Treasury is directed, \nfor example, to issue regulations to reduce possible over-withholding \non dividend equivalents or substitute dividends, but only where the \ntaxpayer can establish that the tax was previously withheld from an \nearlier payment. Treasury is also directed to issue regulations to \nimpose withholding when dividend equivalent payments are netted with \nother payments under a swap contract, when dividend equivalent payments \nare made under other financial instruments, such as an option or \nforward contract, or when a substitute dividend is netted with fees and \nother payments. Finally, the section makes it clear that nothing in the \nlegislation should be construed to limit the authority of the IRS \nCommissioner to collect taxes, interest, and penalties on dividend \nequivalent or substitute dividend payments made prior to the date of \nenactment of the bill.\n  Let me be clear. I do not oppose structured finance transactions used \nfor legitimate purposes, including swaps and stock loans that \nfacilitate capital flows, reduce capital needs, or spread risk. What I \noppose, and what Section 108 would stop is the misuse of financial \ntransactions to undermine the tax code, rob the U.S. treasury, and \nforce honest Americans who play by the rules to shoulder the country's \ntax burden. What this section is intended to stop are dividend-based \ntransactions whose economic purpose is nothing more than tax dodging.\n\n     Section 109--PFIC Reporting Requirement\n\n  Section 109 is the third and final new addition to the Stop Tax Haven \nAbuse Act. The purpose of this provision to strengthen disclosure \nrequirements for foreign corporations used as the personal investment \nvehicles of U.S. individuals. These corporations are sometimes \nestablished in offshore secrecy jurisdictions, making it particularly \ndifficult for the IRS to detect them and establish links to the U.S. \nbeneficiaries.\n  The tax obligations of these corporations, known as passive foreign \ninvestment corporations or PFICs, are set out in Sections 1291-1298 of \nthe tax code. U.S. persons who are direct or indirect shareholders of a \nPFIC are currently required to complete a Form 8621 providing certain \ninformation about the PFIC to the IRS. While the IRS has issued \nproposed regulations governing PFIC reporting, they have not yet been \nfinalized.\n  Section 109 of the bill would codify the PFIC reporting requirements \nset out in the proposed regulations, with one additional requirement. \nSpecifically, PFIC reporting would be required not only by U.S. persons \nwho have an ownership interest in a PFIC, but also by any U.S. person \nwho, directly or indirectly, causes the PFIC to be formed, or who sent \nassets to or received assets from the PFIC during the relevant tax \nyear.\n  The need for expanded reporting obligations was highlighted during \nthe Subcommittee's investigative work which showed that, in too many \ncases, ownership requirements were not enough to trigger reporting \nobligations for offshore corporations. For example, the Subcommittee \nfound numerous instances in which a U.S. person asked an offshore \nservice provider to form an offshore corporation, lodge ownership of \nthe new corporation in one or more offshore shell companies under the \nprovider's control, and then operate the new corporation as the U.S. \nperson directed, despite the absence of any direct ownership interest. \nThis arrangement, which may have been designed to evade tax or other \nlegal obligations that attach to corporations directly or indirectly \nowned by a U.S. person, nevertheless provided U.S. persons with \nbeneficial interests in offshore corporations that effectively operated \nat their discretion.\n  To ensure that such offshore corporations are subject to the same \nreporting requirements as PFICs in which a U.S. person is a direct or \nindirect shareholder, the new Section 109 would require Forms 8621 to \nbe filed by any U.S. person who formed a PFIC, sent assets to it, \nreceived assets from it, was a beneficial owner of it, or had \nbeneficial interests in it. This expanded reporting requirement is \nintended to prevent any U.S. person who established, capitalized, or \nprofited from a beneficial interest in a PFIC--whether or not that \nbeneficial interest was evidenced by legal documentation--from arguing \nthat they had no reporting obligation for that PFIC, because they \nlacked a formal ownership interest in it.\n  Finally, Section 109 is intended to require reporting by U.S. persons \nwho have a beneficial interest in a PFIC; it is not intended to impose \nreporting requirements on persons who perform ministerial tasks \nassociated with a PFIC, including tasks associated with a PFIC's \nformation, management, contributions or distributions.\n\n     Section 201--Stronger penalty for failure to make required \n       securities disclosures\n\n  In addition to tax abuses, the 2006 Subcommittee investigation into \nthe Wyly case history uncovered a host of troubling transactions \ninvolving U.S. securities held by the 58 offshore trusts and \ncorporations associated with the two Wyly brothers. Over the course of \na number of years, the Wylys had obtained about $190 million in stock \noptions as compensation from three U.S. publicly traded corporations at \nwhich\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\nthey were directors and major shareholders. Over time, the Wylys \ntransferred these stock options to the network of offshore entities \nthey had established.\n  The investigation found that, for years, the Wylys had generally \nfailed to report the offshore entities' stock holdings or transactions \nin their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \nThey did not report these stock holdings on the ground that the 58 \noffshore trusts and corporations functioned as independent entities, \neven though the Wylys continued to direct the entities' investment \nactivities. The public companies where the Wylys were corporate \ninsiders also failed to include in their SEC filings information about \nthe company shares held by the offshore entities, even though the \ncompanies knew of their close relationship to the Wylys, that the Wylys \nhad provided the offshore entities with significant stock options, and \nthat the offshore entities held large blocks of the company stock. On \nother occasions, the public companies and various financial \ninstitutions failed to treat the shares held by the offshore entities \nas affiliated stock, even though they were aware of the offshore \nentities' close association with the Wylys. The investigation found \nthat, because both the Wylys and the public companies had failed to \ndisclose the holdings of the offshore entities, for 13 years federal \nregulators had been unaware of those stock holdings and the \nrelationships between the offshore entities and the Wyly brothers.\n  Corporate insiders and public companies are already obligated by \ncurrent law to disclose stock holdings and transactions of offshore \nentities affiliated with a company director, officer, or major \nshareholder. Current penalties, however, appear insufficient to ensure \ncompliance in light of the low likelihood that U.S. authorities will \nlearn of transactions that take place in an offshore jurisdiction. To \naddress this problem, Section 201 of our bill would establish a new \nmonetary penalty of up to $1 million for persons who knowingly fail to \ndisclose offshore stock holdings and transactions in violation of U.S. \nsecurities laws.\n\n     Sections 202 and 203--Anti-money laundering programs for \n       hedge funds and company formation agents\n\n  The Subcommittee's August 2006 investigation showed that the Wyly \nbrothers used two hedge funds and a private equity fund controlled by \nthem to funnel millions of untaxed offshore dollars into U.S. \ninvestments. In addition, multiple Subcommittee investigations provide \nextensive evidence on the role played by U.S. company formation agents \nin assisting U.S. persons to set up offshore structures. Moreover, a \nSubcommittee hearing in November 2006 disclosed that U.S. company \nformation agents are forming U.S. shell companies for numerous \nunidentified foreign clients. Some of those U.S. shell companies were \nlater used in illicit activities, including money laundering, terrorist \nfinancing, drug crimes, tax evasion, and other misconduct. Because \nhedge funds, private equity funds, and company formation agents are as \nvulnerable as other financial institutions to money launderers seeking \nentry into the U.S. financial system, the bill contains two provisions \naimed at ensuring that these groups know their clients and do not \naccept or transmit suspect funds into the U.S. financial system.\n  Currently, unregistered investment companies, such as hedge funds and \nprivate equity funds, are the only class of financial institutions \nunder the Bank Secrecy Act that transmit substantial offshore funds \ninto the United States, yet are not required by law to have anti-money \nlaundering programs, including Know Your Customer, due diligence \nprocedures, and procedures to file suspicious activity reports. There \nis no reason why this sector of our financial services industry should \ncontinue to serve as a gateway into the U.S. financial system for \nsubstantial funds of unknown origin.\n  Seven years ago, in 2002, the Treasury Department proposed anti-money \nlaundering regulations for these companies, but never finalized them. \nIn 2008, the Department withdrew them with no explanation. Section 202 \nof the bill would require Treasury to issue final anti-money laundering \nregulations for unregistered investment companies within 180 days of \nthe enactment of the bill. Treasury would be free to draw upon its 2002 \nproposal, but the bill would also require the final regulations to \ndirect hedge funds and private equity funds to exercise due diligence \nbefore accepting offshore funds and to comply with the same procedures \nas other financial institutions if asked by federal regulators to \nproduce records kept offshore.\n  In addition, Section 203 of the bill would add company formation \nagents to the list of persons subject to anti-money laundering \nobligations. For the first time, those engaged in the business of \nforming corporations and other entities, both offshore and in the 50 \nStates, would be responsible for knowing the identity of the person for \nwhom they are forming the entity. The bill also directs Treasury to \ndevelop anti-money laundering regulations for this group. Treasury's \nkey anti-money laundering agency, the Financial Crimes Enforcement \nNetwork, testified before the Subcommittee in 2006, that it was \nconsidering drafting such regulations but has yet to do so.\n  We expect and intend that, as in the case of all other entities \nrequired to institute anti-money laundering programs, the regulations \nissued in response to this bill would instruct hedge funds, private \nequity funds, and company formation agents to adopt risk-based \nprocedures that would concentrate their due diligence efforts on \nclients that pose the highest risk of money laundering.\n\n     Section 204--IRS John Doe summons\n\n  Section 204 of the bill focuses on an important tool used by the IRS \nin recent years to uncover taxpayers involved in offshore tax schemes, \nknown as the John Doe summons. Section 204 would make three technical \nchanges to make the use of John Doe summons more effective in offshore \nand other complex investigations.\n  A John Doe summons is an administrative IRS summons used to request \ninformation in cases where the identity of a taxpayer is unknown. In \ncases involving a known taxpayer, the IRS may issue a summons to a \nthird party to obtain information about the U.S. taxpayer, but must \nalso notify the taxpayer who then has 20 days to petition a court to \nquash the summons to the third party. With a John Doe summons, however, \nIRS does not have the taxpayer's name and does not know where to send \nthe taxpayer notice, so the statute substitutes a procedure in which \nthe IRS must instead apply to a court for advance permission to serve \nthe summons on the third party. To obtain approval of the summons, the \nIRS must show the court, in public filings to be resolved in open \ncourt, that: (1) the summons relates to a particular person or \nascertainable class of persons, (2) there is a reasonable basis for \nconcluding that there is a tax compliance issue involving that person \nor class of persons, and (3) the information sought is not readily \navailable from other sources.\n  In recent years, the IRS has used John Doe summonses to try to obtain \ninformation about taxpayers operating in offshore secrecy \njurisdictions. For example, as indicated earlier, the IRS obtained \ncourt approval to serve a John Doe summons on the Swiss bank, UBS, to \nobtain the names of an estimated 19,000 U.S. clients who opened UBS \naccounts in Switzerland without disclosing those accounts to the IRS. \nThis is a landmark effort to try to overcome Swiss secrecy laws. In \nearlier years, the IRS obtained court approval to issue John Doe \nsummonses to credit card associations, credit card processors, and \ncredit card merchants, to collect information about taxpayers using \ncredit cards issued by offshore banks. This information has led to many \nsuccessful cases in which the IRS identified funds hidden offshore and \nrecovered unpaid taxes.\n  Currently, however, use of the John Doe summons process is time \nconsuming and expensive. For each John Doe summons involving an \noffshore secrecy jurisdiction, the IRS has had to establish in court \nthat the involvement of accounts and transactions in offshore secrecy \njurisdictions meant there was a significant likelihood of tax \ncompliance problems. To relieve the IRS of the need to make this same \nproof over and over in court after court, the bill would provide that, \nin any John Doe summons proceeding involving a class defined in terms \nof accounts or transactions in an offshore secrecy jurisdiction, the \ncourt may presume that the\n\n[[Page S2634]]\n\ncase raises tax compliance issues. This presumption would then \neliminate the need for the IRS to repeatedly establish in court the \nobvious fact that accounts, entities, and transactions involving \noffshore secrecy jurisdictions raise tax compliance issues.\n  Second, for a smaller subset of John Doe cases, where the only \nrecords sought by the IRS are offshore bank account records held by a \nU.S. financial institution where that offshore bank has an account, the \nbill would relieve the IRS of the obligation to get prior court \napproval to serve the summons. Again, the justification is that \noffshore bank records are highly likely to involve accounts that raise \ntax compliance issues so no prior court approval should be required. \nEven in this instance, however, if a U.S. financial institution were to \ndecline to produce the requested records, the IRS would have to obtain \na court order to enforce the summons.\n  Finally, the bill would streamline the John Doe summons approval \nprocess in large ``project'' investigations where the IRS anticipates \nissuing multiple summonses to definable classes of third parties, such \nas banks or credit card associations, to obtain information related to \nparticular taxpayers. Right now, for each summons issued in connection \nwith a project, the IRS has to obtain the approval of a court, often \nhaving to repeatedly establish the same facts before multiple judges in \nmultiple courts. This repetitive exercise wastes IRS, Justice \nDepartment, and court resources, and fragments oversight of the overall \nIRS investigative effort.\n  To streamline this process and strengthen court oversight of IRS use \nof John Doe summons, the bill would authorize the IRS to present an \ninvestigative project, as a whole, to a single judge to obtain approval \nfor issuing multiple summonses related to that project. In such cases, \nthe court would retain jurisdiction over the case after approval is \ngranted, to exercise ongoing oversight of IRS issuance of summonses \nunder the project. To further strengthen court oversight, the IRS would \nbe required to file a publicly available report with the court on at \nleast an annual basis describing the summonses issued under the \nproject. The court would retain authority to restrict the use of \nfurther summonses at any point during the project. To evaluate the \neffectiveness of this approach, the bill would also direct the \nGovernment Accountability Office to report on the use of the provision \nafter five years.\n\n     Section 205--FBAR investigations and suspicious activity \n       reports\n\n  Section 205 of the bill would make several changes to Title 31 of the \nU.S. Code needed to reflect the IRS' new responsibility for enforcing \nthe Foreign Bank Account Report (FBAR) requirements and to clarify the \nright of access to Suspicious Activity Reports by IRS civil enforcement \nauthorities.\n  Under present law, a person controlling a foreign financial account \nwith over $10,000 is required to check a box on his or her income tax \nreturn and, under Title 31, also file an FBAR form with the IRS. \nTreasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which \nnormally enforces Title 31 provisions, recently delegated to the IRS \nthe responsibility for investigating FBAR violations and assessing FBAR \npenalties. Because the FBAR enforcement jurisdiction derives from Title \n31, however, and most of the information available to the IRS is tax \nreturn information, IRS routinely encounters difficulties in using \navailable tax information to fulfill its new role as FBAR enforcer. The \ntax disclosure law permits the use of tax information only for the \nadministration of the internal revenue laws or ``related statutes.'' \nThis rule is presently understood to require the IRS to determine, at a \nmanagerial level and on a case by case basis, that the Title 31 FBAR \nlaw is a ``related statute.'' Not only does this necessitate repetitive \ndeterminations in every FBAR case investigated by the IRS before each \nagent can look at the potential non-filer's income tax return, but it \nprevents the use by IRS of bulk data on foreign accounts received from \ntax treaty partners to compare to FBAR filing records to find non-\nfilers.\n  One of the stated purposes for the FBAR filing requirement is that \nsuch reports ``have a high degree of usefulness in . . . tax . . . \ninvestigations or proceedings.'' 31 U.S.C 5311. If one of the reasons \nfor requiring taxpayers to file FBARs is to use the information for tax \npurposes, and if IRS is to be charged with FBAR enforcement because of \nthe FBARs' connection to taxes, common sense dictates that the FBAR \nstatute should be considered a related statute for tax disclosure \npurposes, and the bill changes the related statute rule to say that.\n  The second change made by Section 205 is a technical amendment to the \nwording of the penalty provision. Currently the penalty is determined \nin part by the balance in the foreign bank account at the time of the \n``violation.'' The violation is interpreted to have occurred on the due \ndate of the FBAR return, which is June 30 of the year following the \nyear to which the report relates. The statute's use of this specific \nJune 30th date can lead to strange results if money is withdrawn from \nthe foreign account after the reporting period closed but before the \nreturn due date. To eliminate this unintended problem, the bill would \ninstead gauge the penalty by using the highest balance in the account \nduring the reporting period.\n  The third part of section 205 relates to Suspicious Activity Reports, \nwhich financial institutions are required to file with FinCEN whenever \nthey encounter suspicious transactions. FinCEN is required to share \nthis information with law enforcement, but currently does not permit \nIRS civil investigators access to the information. However, if the \ninformation that is gathered and transmitted to Treasury by the \nfinancial institutions at great expense is to be effectively utilized, \nits use should not be limited to the relatively small number of \ncriminal investigators, who can barely scratch the surface of the large \nnumber of reports. In addition, sharing the information with civil tax \ninvestigators would not increase the risk of disclosure, because they \noperate under the same tough disclosure rules as the criminal \ninvestigators. In some cases, IRS civil agents are now issuing an IRS \nsummons to a financial institution to get access, for a production fee, \nto the very same information the financial institution has already \nfiled with Treasury in a SAR. The bill changes those anomalous results \nby making it clear that ``law enforcement'' includes civil tax law \nenforcement.\n\n  Overall, Titles I and II of our bill include a host of innovative \nmeasures to strengthen the ability of federal regulators to combat \noffshore tax haven abuses. We believe these new tools merit \nCongressional attention and enactment this year if we are going to \nbegin to make a serious dent in the $100 billion in annual lost tax \nrevenue from offshore tax abuses that forces honest taxpayers to \nshoulder a greater tax burden than they would otherwise have to bear.\n  Until now, I've been talking about what the bill would do combat \noffshore tax abuses. Now I want to turn to what the bill would do to \ncombat abusive tax shelters and their promoters who use both domestic \nand offshore means to achieve their ends.\n\n\n                          Abusive Tax Shelters\n\n  Abusive tax shelters are complicated transactions promoted to provide \ntax benefits unintended by the tax code. They are very different from \nlegitimate tax shelters, such as deducting the interest paid on a home \nmortgage or Congressionally approved tax deductions for building \naffordable housing. Some abusive tax shelters involve complicated \ndomestic transactions; others make use of offshore shenanigans. All \nabusive tax shelters are marked by one characteristic: there is no real \neconomic or business rationale other than tax avoidance. As Judge \nLearned Hand wrote in Gregory v. Helvering, they are ``entered upon for \nno other motive but to escape taxation.''\n  Abusive tax shelters are usually tough to prosecute. Crimes such as \nterrorism, murder, and fraud produce instant recognition of the \nimmorality involved. Abusive tax shelters, by contrast, are often \n``MEGOs,'' meaning ``My Eyes Glaze Over.'' Those who cook up these \nconcoctions count on their complexity to escape scrutiny and public \nire. But regardless of how complicated or eye-glazing, the hawking of \nabusive tax shelters by tax professionals like accountants, bankers, \ninvestment advisers, and lawyers to\n\n[[Page S2635]]\n\nthousands of people like late-night, cut-rate T.V. bargains is \nscandalous, and we need to stop it.\n  My Subcommittee has spent years examining the design, sale, and \nimplementation of abusive tax shelters. Our first hearing on this topic \nin recent years was held in January 2002, when the Subcommittee \nexamined an abusive tax shelter purchased by Enron. In November 2003, \nthe Subcommittee held two days of hearings and released a staff report \nthat pulled back the curtain on how even some respected accounting \nfirms, banks, investment advisors, and law firms had become engines \npushing the design and sale of abusive tax shelters to corporations and \nindividuals across this country. In February 2005, the Subcommittee \nissued a bipartisan report that provided further details on the role \nthese professional firms played in the proliferation of these abusive \nshelters. Our Subcommittee report was endorsed by the full Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs in April 2005.\n  In 2006, the Subcommittee released a staff report entitled, ``Tax \nHaven Abuses: The Enablers, the Tools, and Secrecy,'' which disclosed \nhow financial and legal professionals designed and sold yet another \nabusive tax shelter known as the POINT Strategy, which depended on \nsecrecy laws and practices in the Isle of Man to conceal the phantom \nnature of securities trades that lay at the center of this tax shelter \ntransaction. Most recently, in 2008, the Subcommittee released a staff \nreport and held a hearing on how financial firms have designed and sold \ncomplex financial transactions, referred to as dividend enhancement \ntransactions, to help offshore hedge funds and others escape payment of \nU.S. taxes on U.S. stock dividends.\n  The Subcommittee investigations have found that many abusive tax \nshelters are not dreamed up by the taxpayers who use them. Instead, \nmost are devised by tax professionals, such as accountants, bankers, \ninvestment advisors, and lawyers, who then sell the tax shelter to \nclients for a fee. In fact, as our 2003 investigation widened, we found \na large number of tax advisors cooking up one complex scheme after \nanother, packaging them up as generic ``tax products'' with boiler-\nplate legal and tax opinion letters, and then undertaking elaborate \nmarketing schemes to peddle these products to literally thousands of \npersons across the country. In return, these tax shelter promoters were \ngetting hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, while diverting \nbillions of dollars in tax revenues from the U.S. Treasury each year.\n  For example, one shelter investigated by the Subcommittee and \nfeatured in the 2003 hearings has since become part of an IRS effort to \nsettle cases involving a set of abusive tax shelters known as ``Son of \nBoss.'' Following our hearing, more than 1,200 taxpayers admitted \nwrongdoing and agreed to pay back taxes, interest and penalties \ntotaling more than $3.7 billion. That's billions of dollars the IRS has \ncollected on just one type of tax shelter, demonstrating both the depth \nof the problem and the potential for progress. The POINT shelter \nfeatured in our 2006 hearing involved another $300 million in tax loss \non transactions conducted by just six taxpayers. The offshore dividend \ntax scams we examined in 2008 meant additional billions of dollars in \nunpaid taxes over a ten year period.\n  Titles III and IV of the bill we are introducing today contain a \nnumber of measures to curb abusive tax shelters. First, they would \nstrengthen the penalties imposed on those who aid or abet tax evasion. \nSecond, they would prohibit the issuance of tax shelter patents. \nSeveral provisions would deter bank participation in abusive tax \nshelter activities by requiring regulators to develop new examination \nprocedures to detect and stop such activities. Others would end \noutdated communication barriers between the IRS and other enforcement \nagencies such as the SEC, bank regulators, and the Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board, to allow the exchange of information \nrelating to tax evasion cases. The bill also provides for increased \ndisclosure of tax shelter information to Congress.\n  In addition, the bill would simplify and clarify an existing \nprohibition on the payment of fees linked to tax benefits; and \nauthorize Treasury to issue tougher standards for tax shelter opinion \nletters. Finally, the bill would codify and strengthen the economic \nsubstance doctrine, which eliminates tax benefits for transactions that \nhave no real business purpose apart from avoiding taxes.\n  Let me be more specific about these key provisions to curb abusive \ntax shelters.\n\n     Sections 301 and 302--Strengthening tax shelter penalties\n\n  Title III of the bill strengthens two very important penalties that \nthe IRS can use in its fight against the professionals who make complex \nabusive shelters possible. Three years ago, the penalty for promoting \nan abusive tax shelter, as set forth in Section 6700 of the tax code, \nwas the lesser of $1,000 or 100 percent of the promoter's gross income \nderived from the prohibited activity. That meant in most cases the \nmaximum fine was just $1,000.\n  Many abusive tax shelters sell for $100,000 or $250,000 apiece. Our \ninvestigation uncovered some tax shelters that were sold for as much as \n$2 million or even $5 million apiece, as well as instances in which the \nsame cookie-cutter tax opinion letter was sold to 100 or even 200 \nclients. There are huge profits to be made in this business, and a \n$1,000 fine is laughable.\n  The Senate acknowledged that in 2004, when it adopted the Levin-\nColeman amendment to the JOBS Act, S. 1637, raising the Section 6700 \npenalty on abusive tax shelter promoters to 100 percent of the fees \nearned by the promoter from the abusive shelter. A 100 percent penalty \nwould have ensured that the abusive tax shelter hucksters would not get \nto keep a single penny of their ill-gotten gains. That figure, however, \nwas cut in half in the conference report, setting the penalty at 50 \npercent of the fees earned and allowing the promoters of abusive \nshelters to keep half of their illicit profits.\n  While a 50 percent penalty is an obvious improvement over $1,000, \nthis penalty still is inadequate and makes no sense. Why should anyone \nwho pushes an illegal tax shelter that robs our Treasury of needed \nrevenues get to keep half of their ill-gotten gains? What deterrent \neffect is created by a penalty that allows promoters to keep half of \ntheir fees if caught, and of course, all of their fees if they are not \ncaught?\n  Effective penalties should make sure that the peddler of an abusive \ntax shelter is deprived of every penny of profit earned from selling or \nimplementing the shelter and then is fined on top of that. Section 301 \nof this bill would do just that by increasing the penalty on tax \nshelter promoters to an amount equal to up to 150 percent of the \npromoters' gross income from the prohibited activity.\n  A second penalty provision in the bill addresses what our \ninvestigations have found to be a key problem: the knowing assistance \nof accounting firms, law firms, investment firms, banks, and others to \nhelp taxpayers understate their taxes. In addition to those who meet \nthe definition of ``promoters'' of abusive shelters, there are many \nother types of professional firms that aid and abet the use of abusive \ntax shelters and enable taxpayers to carry out the abusive tax schemes. \nFor example, law firms are often asked to write ``opinion letters'' to \nhelp taxpayers head off IRS questioning and fines that they might \notherwise confront for using an abusive shelter. Currently, under \nSection 6701 of the tax code, these aiders and abettors face a maximum \npenalty of only $1,000, or $10,000 if the offender is a corporation. \nThis penalty, too, is a joke. When law firms are getting $50,000 for \neach of these cookie-cutter opinion letters, it provides no deterrent \nwhatsoever. A $1,000 fine is like a jaywalking ticket for robbing a \nbank.\n  Section 302 of the bill would strengthen Section 6701 of the tax code \nby subjecting aiders and abettors to a maximum fine up to 150 percent \nof the aider and abettor's gross income from the prohibited activity. \nThis penalty would apply to all aiders and abettors, not just tax \nreturn preparers.\n  Again, the Senate has recognized the need to toughen this critical \npenalty. In the 2004 JOBS Act, Senator Coleman and I successfully \nincreased this fine to 100 percent of the gross income derived from the \nprohibited activity. Unfortunately, the conference report completely \nomitted this change, allowing\n\n[[Page S2636]]\n\nmany aiders and abettors to continue to profit without penalty from \ntheir wrongdoing.\n  If further justification for toughening these penalties is needed, \none document uncovered by our investigation shows the cold calculation \nengaged in by a tax advisor facing low fines. A senior tax professional \nat accounting giant KPMG compared possible tax shelter fees with \npossible tax shelter penalties if the firm were caught promoting an \nillegal tax shelter. This senior tax professional wrote the following: \n``[O]ur average deal would result in KPMG fees of $360,000 with a \nmaximum penalty exposure of only $31,000.'' He then recommended the \nobvious: going forward with sales of the abusive tax shelter on a cost-\nbenefit basis.\n\n     Section 303--Prohibition on tax shelter patents\n\n  Section 303 of our bill addresses the growing problem of tax shelter \npatents, which has the potential for significantly increasing abusive \ntax shelter activities.\n  In 1998, a federal appeals court ruled for the first time that \nbusiness methods can be patented and, since then, various tax \npractitioners have filed applications to patent a variety of tax \nstrategies. The U.S. Patent Office has apparently issued over 70 tax \nstrategy patents to date, up from 49 in 2007, and with many more on the \nway. These patents were issued by patent officers who, by statute, have \na background in science and technology, not tax law, and know little to \nnothing about abusive tax shelters.\n  Issuing these types of patents raises multiple public policy \nconcerns. Patents issued for aggressive tax strategies, for example, \nmay enable unscrupulous promoters to claim the patent represents an \nofficial endorsement of the strategy and evidence that it would \nwithstand IRS challenge. Patents could be issued for blatantly illegal \ntax shelters, yet remain in place for years, producing revenue for the \nwrongdoers while the IRS battles the promoters in court. Patents \nfor tax shelters found to be illegal by a court would nevertheless \nremain in place, creating confusion among users and possibly producing \nillicit income for the patent holder.\n\n  Another set of policy concerns relates to the patenting of more \nroutine tax strategies. If a single tax practitioner is the first to \ndiscover an advantage granted by the law and secures a patent for it, \nthat person could then effectively charge a toll for all other \ntaxpayers to use the same strategy, even though as a matter of public \npolicy all persons ought to be able to take advantage of the law to \nminimize their taxes. Companies could even patent a legal method to \nminimize their taxes and then refuse to license that patent to their \ncompetitors in order to prevent them from lowering their operating \ncosts. Tax patents could be used to hinder productivity and competition \nrather than foster it.\n  The primary rationale for granting patents is to encourage \ninnovation, which is normally perceived to be a sufficient public \nbenefit to justify granting a temporary monopoly to the patent holder. \nIn the tax arena, however, there has historically been ample incentive \nfor innovation in the form of the tax savings alone. The last thing we \nneed is a further incentive for aggressive tax shelters. That's why \nSection 303 would prohibit the patenting of any ``tax planning \ninvention'' that is ``designed to reduce, minimize, determine, avoid or \ndefer ? tax liability.'' The wording of this section has been updated \nsince the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act of 2007, to reflect the bipartisan \nconsensus that was reached on this provision in S. 2369, a Baucus-\nGrassley-Levin bill to bar tax patents, introduced but not acted upon \nin the 110th Congress.\n\n     Section 304--Fees contingent upon obtaining tax benefits\n\n  Another finding of the Subcommittee investigations is that some tax \npractitioners are circumventing current state and federal constraints \non charging tax service fees that are dependent on the amount of \npromised tax benefits. Traditionally, accounting firms charged flat \nfees or hourly fees for their tax services. In the 1990s, however, they \nbegan charging ``value added'' fees based on, in the words of one \naccounting firm's manual, ``the value of the services provided, as \nopposed to the time required to perform the services.'' In addition, \nsome firms began charging ``contingent fees'' that were calculated \naccording to the size of the paper ``loss'' that could be produced for \na client and used to offset the client's other taxable income--the \ngreater the so-called loss, the greater the fee.\n  In response, many states prohibited accounting firms from charging \ncontingent fees for tax work to avoid creating incentives for these \nfirms to devise ways to shelter substantial sums. The SEC and the \nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants also issued rules \nrestricting contingent fees, allowing them in only limited \ncircumstances. Recently, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \nissued a similar rule prohibiting public accounting firms from charging \ncontingent fees for tax services provided to the public companies they \naudit. Each of these federal, state, and professional ethics rules \nseeks to limit the use of contingent fees under certain, limited \ncircumstances.\n  The Subcommittee investigation found that tax shelter fees, which are \ntypically substantial and sometimes exceed $1 million, are often linked \nto the amount of a taxpayer's projected paper losses which can be used \nto shelter income from taxation. For example, in four tax shelters \nexamined by the Subcommittee in 2003, documents show that the fees were \nequal to a percentage of the paper loss to be generated by the \ntransaction. In one case, the fees were typically set at 7 percent of \nthe transaction's generated ``tax loss'' that clients could use to \nreduce other taxable income. In another, the fee was only 3.5 percent \nof the loss, but the losses were large enough to generate a fee of over \n$53 million on a single transaction. In other words, the greater the \nloss that could be concocted for the taxpayer or ``investor,'' the \ngreater the profit for the tax promoter. Think about that--greater the \nloss, the greater the profit. How's that for turning capitalism on its \nhead!\n  In addition, evidence indicated that, in at least one instance, a tax \nadvisor was willing to deliberately manipulate the way it handled \ncertain tax products to circumvent contingent fee prohibitions. An \ninternal document at an accounting firm related to a specific tax \nshelter, for example, identified the states that prohibited contingent \nfees. Then, rather than prohibit the tax shelter transactions in those \nstates or require an alternative fee structure, the memorandum directed \nthe firm's tax professionals to make sure the engagement letter was \nsigned, the engagement was managed, and the bulk of services was \nperformed ``in a jurisdiction that does not prohibit contingency \nfees.''\n  Right now, the prohibitions on contingent fees are complex and must \nbe evaluated in the context of a patchwork of federal, state, and \nprofessional ethics rules. Section 304 of the bill would establish a \nsingle enforceable rule, applicable nationwide, that would prohibit tax \npractitioners from charging fees calculated according to a projected or \nactual amount of tax savings or paper losses.\n\n     Section 305--Deterring financial institution participation in \n       abusive tax shelter activities\n\n  The bill would also help fight abusive tax shelters that are \ndisguised as complex investment opportunities and use financing or \nsecurities transactions provided by financial institutions. In reality, \ntax shelter schemes lack the economic risks and rewards associated with \na true investment. These phony transactions instead often rely on the \ntemporary use of significant amounts of money in low risk schemes \nmischaracterized as real investments. The financing or securities \ntransactions called for by these schemes are often supplied by a bank, \nsecurities firm, or other financial institution.\n  Currently the tax code prohibits financial institutions from \nproviding products or services that aid or abet tax evasion or that \npromote or implement abusive tax shelters. The agencies that oversee \nthese financial institutions on a daily basis, however, are experts in \nbanking and securities law and generally lack the expertise to spot tax \nissues. Section 305 would crack down on financial institutions' illegal \ntax shelter activities by requiring federal bank regulators and the\n\n[[Page S2637]]\n\nSEC to work with the IRS to develop examination techniques to detect \nsuch abusive activities and put an end to them.\n  These examination techniques would be used regularly, preferably in \ncombination with routine regulatory examinations, and the regulators \nwould report potential violations to the IRS. The agencies would also \nbe required to prepare joint reports to Congress in 2010 and 2013 on \npreventing the participation of financial institutions in tax evasion \nor tax shelter activities.\n\n     Section 306--Ending communication barriers between \n       enforcement agencies\n\n  During hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \non tax shelters in November 2003, IRS Commissioner Mark Everson \ntestified that his agency was barred by Section 6103 of the tax code \nfrom communicating information to other federal agencies that would \nassist those agencies in their law enforcement duties. He pointed out \nthat the IRS was barred from providing tax return information to the \nSEC, federal bank regulators, and the Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board (PCAOB)--even, for example, when that information might \nassist the SEC in evaluating whether an abusive tax shelter resulted in \ndeceptive accounting in a public company's financial statements, might \nhelp the Federal Reserve determine whether a bank selling tax products \nto its clients had violated the law against promoting abusive tax \nshelters, or help the PCAOB judge whether an accounting firm had \nimpaired its independence by selling tax shelters to its audit clients.\n  Another example demonstrates how harmful these information barriers \nare to legitimate law enforcement efforts. In 2004, the IRS offered a \nsettlement initiative to companies and corporate executives who \nparticipated in an abusive tax shelter involving the transfer of stock \noptions to family-controlled entities. Over a hundred corporations and \nexecutives responded with admissions of wrongdoing. In addition to tax \nviolations, their misconduct may be linked to securities law violations \nand improprieties by corporate auditors or banks, but the IRS has \ninformed the Subcommittee that it is currently barred by law from \nsharing the names of the wrongdoers with the SEC, banking regulators, \nor PCAOB. The same is true for the offshore dividend tax shelters \nexposed in the Subcommittee's 2008 hearing. The IRS knows who the \noffending banks and investment firms are that designed and sold \nquestionable dividend enhancement transactions to offshore hedge funds \nand others, but it is barred by Section 6103 of the tax code from \nproviding detailed information or documents to the SEC or banking \nregulators who oversee the relevant financial institutions.\n  These communication barriers are outdated, inefficient, and ill-\nsuited to stopping the torrent of tax shelter abuses now affecting or \nbeing promoted by so many public companies, banks, investment firms, \nand accounting firms. To address this problem, Section 306 of this bill \nwould authorize the Treasury Secretary, with appropriate privacy \nsafeguards, to disclose to the SEC, federal banking agencies, and the \nPCAOB, upon request, tax return information related to abusive tax \nshelters, inappropriate tax avoidance, or tax evasion. The agencies \ncould then use this information only for law enforcement purposes, such \nas preventing accounting firms, investment firms, or banks from \npromoting abusive tax shelters, or detecting accounting fraud in the \nfinancial statements of public companies.\n\n     Section 307--Increased disclosure of tax shelter information \n       to Congress\n\n  The bill would also provide for increased disclosure of tax shelter \ninformation to Congress. Section 307 would make it clear that companies \nproviding tax return preparation services to taxpayers cannot refuse to \ncomply with a Congressional document subpoena by citing Section 7216, \nwhich prohibits tax return preparers from disclosing taxpayer \ninformation to third parties. Several accounting and law firms raised \nthis claim in response to document subpoenas issued by the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, contending they were barred by the \nnondisclosure provision in Section 7216 from producing documents \nrelated to the sale of abusive tax shelters to clients for a fee.\n  The accounting and law firms maintained this position despite an \nanalysis provided by the Senate legal counsel showing that the \nnondisclosure provision was never intended to create a privilege or to \noverride a Senate subpoena, as demonstrated in federal regulations \ninterpreting the provision. This bill would codify the existing \nregulations interpreting Section 7216 and make it clear that \nCongressional document subpoenas must be honored.\n  Section 307 would also ensure Congress has access to information \nabout decisions by Treasury related to an organization's tax exempt \nstatus. A 2003 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, Tax \nAnalysts v. IRS, struck down certain IRS regulations and held that the \nIRS must disclose letters denying or revoking an organization's tax \nexempt status. The IRS has been reluctant to disclose such information, \nnot only to the public, but also to Congress, including in response to \nrequests by the Subcommittee.\n  For example, in 2005, the IRS revoked the tax exempt status of four \ncredit counseling firms, and, despite the Tax Analysts case, claimed \nthat it could not disclose to the Subcommittee the names of the four \nfirms or the reasons for revoking their tax exemption. Our bill would \nmake it clear that, upon receipt of a request from a Congressional \ncommittee or subcommittee, the IRS must disclose documents, other than \na tax return, related to the agency's determination to grant, deny, \nrevoke or restore an organization's exemption from taxation.\n\n     Section 308--Tax shelter opinion letters\n\n  As part of Circular 230, the Treasury Department has issued standards \nfor tax practitioners who provide opinion letters on the tax \nimplications of potential tax shelters. Section 308 of the bill would \nprovide express statutory authority for these and even clearer \nregulations.\n  The public has traditionally relied on tax opinion letters to obtain \ninformed and trustworthy advice about whether a tax-motivated \ntransaction meets the requirements of the law. The Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations has found that, in too many cases, tax \nopinion letters no longer contain disinterested and reliable tax \nadvice, even when issued by supposedly reputable accounting or law \nfirms. Instead, some tax opinion letters have become marketing tools \nused by tax shelter promoters and their allies to sell clients on their \nlatest tax products. In many of these cases, financial interests and \nbiases were concealed, unreasonable factual assumptions were used to \njustify dubious legal conclusions, and taxpayers were misled about the \nrisk that the proposed transaction would later be designated an illegal \ntax shelter. Reforms are essential to address these abuses and restore \nthe integrity of tax opinion letters.\n  The Treasury Department recently adopted standards that address a \nnumber of the abuses affecting tax shelter opinion letters; however, \nthe standards could be stronger yet. Our bill would authorize Treasury \nto issue standards addressing a wider spectrum of tax shelter opinion \nletter problems, including: preventing concealed collaboration among \nsupposedly independent letter writers; avoiding conflicts of interest \nthat would impair auditor independence; ensuring appropriate fee \ncharges; preventing practitioners and firms from aiding and abetting \nthe understatement of tax liability by clients; and banning the \npromotion of potentially abusive tax shelters. By addressing each of \nthese areas, a beefed-up Circular 230 could help reduce the ongoing \nabusive practices related to tax shelter opinion letters.\n\n\n                      Title IV--Economic Substance\n\n  Finally, Title IV of the bill incorporates a Baucus-Grassley proposal \nwhich would strengthen legal prohibitions against abusive tax shelters \nby codifying in federal tax statutes for the first time what is known \nas the economic substance doctrine. This anti-tax abuse doctrine was \nfashioned by federal courts evaluating transactions that appeared to \nhave little or no business purpose or economic substance apart from tax \navoidance. It has become a powerful analytical tool used by courts to \ninvalidate abusive tax shelters. At the same time, because there is no \nstatute underlying this doctrine and the courts have developed\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\nand applied it differently in different judicial districts, the \nexisting case law has many ambiguities and conflicting interpretations.\n  This language was developed under the leadership of Senators Baucus \nand Grassley, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee. \nThe Senate has voted on multiple occasions to enact the economic \nsubstance doctrine into law, but House conferees have rejected it each \ntime. Since no tax shelter legislation would be complete without \naddressing this issue, Title IV of this comprehensive bill proposes \nonce more to include the economic substance doctrine in the tax code.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  The eyes of some people may glaze over when tax shelters and tax \nhavens are discussed, but unscrupulous taxpayers and tax professionals \nsee illicit dollar signs. Our commitment to crack down on their tax \nabuses must be as strong as their determination to get away with \nripping off America and American taxpayers.\n  Our bill provides powerful tools to end offshore tax haven and tax \nshelter abuses. Offshore tax abuses alone contribute nearly $100 \nbillion to the $345 billion annual tax gap, which represents taxes owed \nbut not paid. With the financial crisis facing our country today and \nthe long list of expenses we're incurring to try to end that crisis, it \nis past time for taxes owing to the people's Treasury to be collected. \nAnd it is long past time for Congress to stop tax cheats from shifting \ntheir taxes onto the shoulders of honest Americans.\n  I am optimistic that under the leadership of the new Obama \nAdministration and with the support of the Senate Finance Committee \nthat we can finally tackle this massive problem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. \n        Begich):\n  S. 507. A bill to provide for retirement equity for Federal employees \nin nonforeign areas outside the 48 contiguous States and the District \nof Columbia, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I join with my good friend from \nHawaii, Senator Daniel Inouye, and my friends from Alaska, Senators \nLisa Murkowski and Mark Begich, to reintroduce legislation to ensure \nretirement equity for Federal workers in Hawaii, Alaska, and the U.S. \nTerritories.\n  For years, Federal employees in my home State of Hawaii and in other \nnon-foreign areas have been disadvantaged when it comes to their \nretirement due to a lack of locality pay. Federal workers in those \nareas may receive a non-foreign cost of living allowance, COLA, based \non the difference in the cost of living between those areas and the \nDistrict of Columbia. However, this pay adjustment does not count \ntoward their retirement.\n  The inequity in retirement benefits for Federal workers in Hawaii, \nAlaska, and the U.S. Territories hinders efforts to recruit and retain \nFederal workers in these areas, and it has led to several lawsuits \nagainst the Federal government. Most recently, on January 30, 2008, \nJudge Phillip M. Pro in the U.S. District Court in Honolulu issued a \ndecision on this in Matsuo v. the Office of Personnel Management. In \nhis ruling, Judge Pro acknowledged the disparity saying that Congress \ndischarged its legislative responsibilities imperfectly and recommended \nthat Congress correct the incongruity made so evident by this case.\n  Under the Federal Employee Pay Comparability Act, FEPCA, of 1990, \nFederal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and the Territories were excluded \nfrom receiving locality pay, which is adjusted for local labor markets \nacross the country to help close the gap between private sector and \npublic sector wages. The first year FEPCA was implemented, in 1994, \nFederal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and the Territories were denied a \npay raise so that Federal employees in the 48 contiguous States could \nreceive their first locality pay allowance. Every year since 1994, \nFederal employees outside of the continental United States have been \ndenied approximately one percent of the average annual pay raise, which \ngoes toward locality pay rates.\n  As you can imagine, this issue has caused Federal employees in the \nnon-foreign areas great concern for years, but there has never been \nenough support for any proposed solution. In the past two years, \nhowever, we have laid the groundwork for the solution represented by \nthis bipartisan bill. The previous Administration submitted a \nlegislative proposal to phase-out non-foreign COLA and phase-in \nlocality pay. That proposal provided a good starting point, but did not \naddress numerous important issues, including the impact such a change \nwould have on postal employees, employees who receive special rates, \nmembers of the Senior Executive Service, and others who are in agency-\nspecific personnel systems or those who do not receive locality pay, \nsuch as employees under the National Security Personnel System at the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  My Federal Workforce Subcommittee, in collaboration with Senators \nStevens, Inouye, and Murkowski, worked extensively with Federal \nemployees in Hawaii, Alaska, and the Territories and with the Office of \nPersonnel Management, OPM, and other Federal agencies to craft a \ncomprehensive solution, which we introduced as the Non-Foreign Area \nRetirement Equity Assurance Act last year.\n  We also have worked with OPM to help ensure that affected Federal \nemployees understand the proposal. After we introduced the bill, my \nSubcommittee held a series of meetings in Hawaii with representatives \nfrom OPM, the Postal Service, and DoD to educate Federal employees on \nthe impact of the legislation and listen to their concerns. I also \nchaired a field hearing in Honolulu, Hawaii, where the Administration \npresented its formal opinion on the legislation and Federal employee \nrepresentatives from Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, and other Territories were \ninvited to express their thoughts on the legislation. While there are \nstill divergent views on this proposal, the vast majority of employees \nwho I have heard from support it.\n  As the bill moved through the Senate, I agreed to a few modifications \nof the bill to address particular concerns. The Senate passed the \namended version by unanimous consent in October 2008. Unfortunately, \nthe 110th Congress adjourned before the House could take action on the \nbill.\n  Today, we are reintroducing a similar version of the Non-Foreign AREA \nAct that passed the Senate by unanimous consent only a few months ago \nin the hopes that we can move quickly to address this growing inequity. \nThis bill is not a windfall or a pay raise for Federal employees. Since \n1994, Federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and the Territories have \nbeen denied pay and retirement equity and this bill seeks to correct \nthe long-time inequity, prevent further lawsuits, and protect employees \ntake-home pay in the process.\n  As we all know, the declining economy is making it hard on working \nmen and women to pay their bills and stay afloat. While locality rates \nhave increased in recent years, non-foreign COLA rates have been \ngradually declining. COLA rates are expected to drop again this year in \nAlaska, Hawaii, and the Territories. Unless Congress acts soon, Federal \nemployees in these areas will see their pay further adversely affected. \nIn the current economic climate, we must be careful to do no harm.\n  I continue to encourage employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and in the \nTerritories to write us with their questions and concerns on our \nlegislation. My goal remains to ensure that Federal workers in the non-\nforeign areas are not disadvantaged when it comes to their pay and \nretirement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 507\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Non-Foreign Area Retirement \n     Equity Assurance Act of 2009'' or the ``Non-Foreign AREA Act \n     of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S.J. Res. 12.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the joint resolution by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 12) proclaiming Casimir \n     Pulaski to be an honorary citizen of the United States \n     posthumously.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I speak on the resolution honoring \nthe valor of GEN Casimir Pulaski, a hero of the American Revolution who \nmade the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of American freedom. This \nresolution would grant honorary posthumous citizenship to General \nPulaski, a long overdue tribute to a man who gave his life to the cause \nof American independence.\n  I thank Senator Lisa Murkowski, the lead Republican cosponsor of this \nresolution, as well as other original cosponsors, Senators Mikulski, \nCardin, Whitehouse, Dodd, Brown, Burris, and Pryor.\n  As a young soldier, Casimir Pulaski developed a reputation as a \nhighly skilled military tactician, whose activities to advance the \ncause of Polish liberty against Russian influence ultimately led to his \nexile from Poland. Seeking refuge, Pulaski traveled to France, where he \nmet an American diplomat who convinced him to join the Continental Army \nin its struggle for independence. That diplomat was so impressed with \nthe Polish general, that, in a letter to George Washington, he \ndescribed Pulaski as an officer ``renowned throughout Europe for the \ncourage and bravery he displayed in defense of his country's freedom.'' \nThat diplomat's name was Ben Franklin.\n  Casimir Pulaski adopted the revolutionary spirit of the American \ncolonists and came to America to fight in their quest for self-\ndetermination.\n  On September 11, 1777, Casimir Pulaski fought with distinction in the \nBattle of Brandywine. His bravery and skill in battle averted American \ndefeat and helped save the life of George Washington. Upon Washington's \nrecommendation, the Continental Congress promoted Pulaski to general, \nand appointed him General of the Cavalry. That same year, Casimir \nPulaski wrote to George Washington, ``I came here, where freedom is \nbeing defended, to serve it, and to live or die for it.'' General \nPulaski's letter would prove prophetic, when, during a major offensive \nagainst British forces in Savannah, GA, Pulaski was mortally wounded. \nHe died at sea, aboard the USS Wasp, on October 11, 1779.\n  General Pulaski's life and death inspired his contemporaries as he \ninspires us today. Shortly after his death, the Continental Congress \nresolved to build a monument in his honor that proved to be the first \nof many. In 1825, General Lafayette, an honorary American citizen, laid \nthe cornerstone for the Pulaski monument in Savannah, GA. In 1929, \nCongress resolved that October 11 of each year would be Pulaski Day in \nthe United States, and several States have followed that example. There \nare countless schools, streets, towns, and memorials across this \ncountry that bear his name--and honor his contributions to our Nation's \nbirth.\n  Today is Pulaski Day in Illinois. In 1973, my own state of Illinois \ndesignated the first Monday of March as Pulaski Commemorative Day and \nin 1986 declared that day to be a State holiday.\n  We in Illinois are privileged to have a large and vibrant Polish-\nAmerican community. From Casimir Pulaski to legendary artists like \nIgnacy Jan Paderewski, Polish-Americans have contributed mightily to \nIllinois--and to our Nation. Chicago is home to the Polish American \nCongress, which encompasses 3,000 Polish organizations across the \ncountry, as well as the Polish Museum of America. The Polish-American \ncommunity also has a large presence in the Illinois National Guard, \nwhich has enjoyed a long-standing relationship with the Polish Air \nForce.\n  I am honored to reintroduce this resolution to grant posthumous \nhonorary citizenship to GEN Casimir Pulaski, an American general who \ngave his life so that our Nation could be free. This resolution passed \nthe Senate by unanimous consent in the 110th Congress and received \nbroad support in the House of Representatives. I hope that this year we \nwill be able to pass this resolution in both Chambers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and the valor of the \nman whom we seek to honor. When we think of our Nation's struggle for \nfreedom in its infancy, we must remember GEN Casimir Pulaski and his \nindelible contribution to our Nation's birth.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint \nresolution be read a third time and passed, the preamble be agreed to, \nthe motions to reconsider be laid on the table, there be no intervening \naction or debate, and any statements relating to this measure be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 12) was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The joint resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. On his \ncomments about the omnibus appropriations bill, two brief points. One \nis that, of course, all Senators welcome the opportunity to debate and \namend the bill. Senator Byrd has argued eloquently, as the majority \nleader himself has, that the opportunity to debate and amend bills is \nan important part of what makes the Senate unique. We often tend to \nargue that point more eloquently when we are in the minority. \nAmendments and debate are what make the Senate the Senate. It gives us \na chance to represent the people who send us--the people for whom we \nwork. All of us on the minority side appreciate that this year the \nmajority leader has--as we believe he should, but nevertheless he has--\ntried to create an environment in which we can debate and amend. \nObviously, amendments aren't going to always be amendments we agree \nwith. I don't agree with all the amendments that come from our side \neither, but I appreciate that chance to offer amendments, and we would \nlike to see the Senate function in a way that gives us a chance to \nrepresent the people who hire us.\n  Second, I suspect every member of the Appropriations Committee and \nmost Members of the Senate hope we can get back to the practice of \npassing our appropriations bills one by one and acting on them before \nthe beginning of the fiscal year, which is October 1. I would hate to \nthink how much of the taxpayers' money we must waste each year by \nmissing that deadline, but grouping these measures together into giant \n``omnibus'' bills, and by passing continuing resolutions which don't \ntake into account the differences of opinion among members of Congress \nand the administration about budget priorities. I would hope we could \nget back to the practice of finishing our work and taking the bills one \nby one as we did not so long ago.\n  I appreciate the majority leader mentioning the fact that we will be \ndebating all week on this appropriations bill, to try and give this \nmassive bill the scrutiny it deserves. It would have been much better \nif these nine appropriations bills had been enacted last year, before \nOctober 1, and we could take them into account when we voted on the \nstimulus bill last week. That is the way we should have been able to do \nthat, but we weren't.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say to my friend who has been \nGovernor of his State and a Cabinet Secretary, ran for President, and \nnow a Member of the Senate, I think he has a foundation of \nunderstanding how important it is that we move these appropriations \nbills. This is a difficult situation. We have done it quite a few times \nin recent years, and it is not the best way to legislate. The Senator \nfrom Tennessee and I agree on that.\n  I have to say to my friend, there are a number of people in my caucus \nwho come to me and say: Why are you making us take these tough votes \nand why are you talking about more votes on this bill? Because in \nkeeping with what the Senator from Tennessee said, I hope we can \ncontinue doing this. I think the Republicans have not offered some easy \namendments--I wish they had been a little easier on us--but that is the \nway it is. That is why I wanted to spend a little time this evening \ntalking about the range of amendments we already have which have been \nhard votes and perhaps hard for both sides in many respects.\n  I support the statement of my friend from Tennessee that we are all \ngoing to try to arrive at the same place. It is just that how we get \nthere sometimes doesn't correlate.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/02/senate-section/article/S2646-6", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2646-S2648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN WARS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have two topics I wish to speak about \nthis evening: One on Iraq and one on higher education. First, on Iraq \nand Afghanistan. President Obama on Friday told marines at Camp Lejeune \nand the world how the United States plans to end the war in Iraq. The \nPresident's plan turns out not to be so different than the agreement \nPresident Bush signed with Iraq just before he left office. Add Senator \nMcCain's name to the list because on Friday he generally supported \nPresident Obama's decision. For the first time, I think it can be said \nwe have a bipartisan consensus--and a consensus between the Congress \nand the President--about how to honorably and successfully conclude the \nwar in Iraq.\n  Ironically, this is a bipartisan consensus that comes 2 years later \nthan it could have. Because what President Bush and President Obama and \nSenator McCain seemed to agree on today is also a course that is \nconsistent with the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group \nheaded by former Republican Secretary of State James Baker and former \nDemocratic House Foreign Affairs Chairman Lee Hamilton. That is not \njust my judgment. I asked Secretary Rice, the former Secretary of \nState, whether the agreement\n\n[[Page S2647]]\n\nPresident Bush signed with Iraq is generally consistent with the \nprinciples of the Iraq Study Group, and she said yes. I asked Secretary \nGates, who has been Secretary of Defense both for President Bush and \nnow for President Obama and who, for a little while, was also a member \nof the Iraq Study Group, whether the direction in Iraq that President \nBush had agreed to go in is approximately the same as the principles \nrecommended in December of 2006 by the Iraq Study Group, and he \nanswered yes.\n  Unfortunately, instead of having, for the last 2 years, a consensus \nbetween the Congress--a Democratic Congress--and the President--a \nRepublican President--we instead made it clear to our enemy and clear \nto our troops that we were divided in Washington about the course of \nthe war and that we couldn't agree on how to conclude. I don't know \nwhether we had reached agreement earlier by, for example, adopting the \nlegislation that Senator Salazar and I and 17 Senators offered and that \nabout 60 Representatives offered in the House, that would have made the \nprinciples of the Iraq Study Group the course upon which the United \nStates would embark to successfully conclude the war in Iraq--I don't \nknow whether, if we had done that in 2007, 2 years ago, the war would \nhave been more successful or Iraq would have been better stabilized; if \ntroops would have come home sooner and perhaps even American lives \nmight have been saved; or if Iraqi lives might have been saved. I don't \nknow about that. But I do know that we put in jeopardy--by our failure \nto agree between the Congress and the President over the course of the \nwar in Iraq--we put in jeopardy the ability of the American people to \nhave the stomach to see this mission all the way through to the end, \nwhich is an essential requirement, in my view, of any military endeavor \nin which the United States should engage.\n  President Bush, nevertheless, persevered, and it became, in the view \nof many Democrats and others, Bush's war, and it seriously damaged the \nBush Presidency. It seriously divided the country. At least we can use \nthis failure to agree, this failure to come to some consensus, as a \nguide about how to conduct ourselves in future conflicts, starting with \nthe war in Afghanistan.\n  President Obama is sending 17,000 more Americans to Afghanistan. He \nis doing so after only a month in office. He says, quite candidly, he \nhasn't yet got a strategy, approved a strategy or, in his words Friday \nnight in his interview with Jim Lehrer, an exit strategy. I assume that \nalso means he hasn't yet decided upon what is even more important, \nwhich is a success strategy. The lesson of Iraq and of our failure to \ncome to some agreement over the last 2 years is that we should give our \nnew President time and support in his efforts to develop a strategy and \nthen we should insist--we in the Congress--that we agree with him on a \nstrategy; and if we can't agree with the one he comes up with, that he \nadjust it until we can, so we as a nation can have a compelling \npurpose, a clear set of goals, the money to supply more than enough \nforce to reach those goals. So our enemies and our troops can hear \nclearly that the American people have the stomach to see the mission in \nAfghanistan all the way through to the end. In other words, it is \nimportant for our country not just for the success of the Obama \npresidency; it is important for our country that what some called \nBush's war not be followed by what others might call Obama's war.\n  The Iraq Study Group was created by Congress in 2006. It had a \nremarkable group of members, including Lee Hamilton and Jim Baker who \nboth cochaired it. Ed Meese, the former Attorney General for President \nReagan, was there. Vernon Jordan was a member. Secretary Gates was a \nmember for a while. The first President Bush's Secretary of State, \nLarry Eagleburger, was a member. Leon Panetta, President Clinton's \nChief of Staff and now CIA Director, was there. President Clinton's \nSecretary of Defense was a member. Sandra Day O'Connor, former Supreme \nCourt Justice, was a member. They spent many months and went to Iraq, \nand they talked to a variety of people. They tried to see if they could \ncome to a consensus about how the U.S. could honorably conclude the war \nin Iraq. They were bipartisan and unanimous in their 79 \nrecommendations, which would be boiled down to three major points.\n  I remember being very disappointed in early 2007 when, following \nthat, President Bush didn't take advantage of the opportunity during \nhis State of the Union Address to embrace the report. He knew then that \na majority of Americans didn't support his strategy. He knew the \nstrategy would have a more difficult time being sustained without their \nsupport. I think all of us knew, then, if he could get Congress to \nagree, the American people would be more likely to agree.\n  The President could have invited the distinguished members of the \nIraq Study Group to sit in the gallery during his speech and, as \nPresidents do often, introduce them. The President could have said: \nThis is not my recommendation, it is theirs. I accept it for the good \nof the country, and I ask the American people now to accept it.\n  If one goes back and reads the recommendations of the Iraq Study \nGroup report made in December 2006, here is basically what it said we \nshould do: Get the U.S. troops out of the combat business in Iraq and \ninto the support business in a prompt and honorable way--maybe over the \ncourse of a year, they said. General Petraeus amended that to a little \nlonger than a year. The Iraq Study Group said reduce the number of \nAmerican forces in Iraq. The Iraq Study Group said there should be a \nlimited military presence for the longer term in Iraq, and that would \nsignal to the rest of the Middle East to stay out of Iraq. It said it \nwould give support to General Petraeus and his troops for a military \nsurge to make Baghdad safer. This was before President Bush authorized \nthe surge.\n  It would expand diplomatic efforts to build support for Iraqi \nnational reconciliation and sovereignty. The Iraq Study Group would \nrecognize, as Prime Minister Blair said, that it is time for the next \nchapter of Iraq's history to be written by the Iraqis themselves.\n  Democratic Senator Ken Salazar--who is now a member of the Obama \nadministration as Interior Secretary--and I wrote legislation that \nwould make the Iraq Study Group recommendations national policy. As I \nmentioned, it attracted about nine Democrats and eight Republican \nSenators. In the House of Representatives, there were 27 Democrats and \n35 Republicans.\n  At that time, we were having vote after vote on Iraq. Some Senators \nsaid there should be an immediate withdrawal. Others wanted victory of \nthe kind we had in Germany and Japan. I thought the Iraq Study Group \nrecommendations made the most sense; and, apparently, today, so does \nPresident Bush, so does President Obama, and so does Senator McCain.\n  Now, it is fair to say each of those men I just mentioned could find \nsomething in the Iraq Study Group report with which to disagree. I \nwould respect those disagreements. But the 17 of us in the Senate could \nfind within that report a course to agree about, just like the \nCommission itself of widely varying Americans could find enough \nunanimously to agree about, so they could say to the troops, to the \nenemy, and to the world: Here is our course forward.\n  I suggest we would have been better off if we had done that. I \npointed out that President Bush would not support the report. I \nrespected that, but I disagreed with it. At the same time, Speaker \nPelosi and the Democratic leaders would not allow our amendment to come \nto a vote. We asked and asked--but their reaction was, ``No, no, we \nwon't do that.'' I guess they had their reasons. We don't question \ntheir motivation. President Bush persevered in the war, and Democratic \nleaders persevered with their opposition to the war. They didn't allow \nthe Iraq Study Group resolution to come to a vote. So then we had an \nelection.\n  Senator Salazar said about the only way we could have united the \nPresident and the Democratic leaders was in their opposition to the \nIraq Study Group--a set of recommendations that are now largely the \nprinciples upon which we are preceding as we seek to end the war in \nIraq. But is the country better off for us not having had that 2 years \nof agreement?\n  Here are some lessons: One, the Iraq war reminds us that nation \nbuilding costs many billions of dollars and many lives. Whenever \npossible, we\n\n[[Page S2648]]\n\nshould use our military forces to defend America and use our ``shining \ncity on a hill,'' which President Reagan talked about so often, as an \nexample to spread freedom. If we must become involved in another \ncountry, as we are in Iraq and Afghanistan, then we must have a \ncompelling reason, a clear mission, an overwhelming force to make \ncertain we reach our goals.\n  The second lesson is this: In order to reach those goals, we have to \npersuade the American people to have the stomach to see the mission we \nhave adopted all the way through to the end. It is much better if the \nPresident and the Congress, even if they are of different political \nparties, agree on that mission. Technically, the Commander in Chief can \nwage a war, leaving us not much to do but fund the troops, which almost \nall of us, regardless of party, do. We saw in Iraq the failure to agree \nbetween the President and the Congress--which made the war harder and \nlonger and President Bush's presidency much less successful. We were in \nthe position often of being the oldest democracy lecturing Baghdad, an \ninfant democracy, for not coming up with a political solution when we \nourselves could not come up with one.\n  Finally, we learned a lesson in Iraq about how to honor those who \nserve our country. Sometimes in airports now--unlike in the Vietnam \nera--passengers burst into applause when a group of service men and \nwomen appear. A great many Tennesseans have been to Iraq and \nAfghanistan. More are going this week to Afghanistan. Many have served \ntwo or three tours already--including men and women from the Tennessee \nNational Guard and the 101st Airborne--and 100 have given their lives \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. Hundreds have suffered wounds that will change \ntheir lives. They have performed heroically. I am glad to see that \nafter 6 years, we finally seem to be united on a path which will bring \nthe war to successful conclusion and hasten the time when most of those \nserving can come home. But it is disappointing that we did not take the \nadvantage 2 years ago when we might have done it to agree on the \nprinciples of the Iraq Study Group. We had that opportunity. It might \nhave shortened the war. It might have stabilized Iraq more rapidly. It \nmight have saved lives.\n\n  We should remember that as we look ahead to Afghanistan. We do not \nwant to succeed Bush's war with Obama's war. Whenever we go to war, it \nshould be an American war and the President should make certain he has \nbipartisan support in Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/02/senate-section/article/S2648-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, during the 1960s, American Motors \nCorporation president George Romney warned Detroit's automakers, \n``There is nothing more vulnerable than entrenched success.''\n  The big three paid no attention. They were building the best cars in \nthe world--highly profitable gas-guzzling vehicles we were quick to \nbuy. Meanwhile, their future Japanese competitors were perfecting \nsmaller, fuel-efficient cars. And today we are bailing out the Detroit \ncompanies that did not listen.\n  American higher education would do well to heed the warning that \nGeorge Romney gave the Detroit automakers in the 1960s. We have the \nbest colleges in the world today, just as we had the best cars in the \nworld then. But even brisk competition at home seems to have little \neffect on rising tuition costs.\n  To deal with rising college costs, I suggest, No. 1, colleges offer \nsome well-prepared students the option of a 3-year baccalaureate \ndegree, cutting one-third the time and one-fourth the cost from a \ncollege education; and No. 2, make community college free for well-\nprepared students.\n  This seems impossible when State community college funding is tight. \nIn my State, Vanderbilt's endowment has declined 16.5 percent and \nMaryville College is under a hiring freeze. The University of Tennessee \nis trying to decide what positions to cut. Impossible, that is, unless \ncollege administrators are listening to students, States, and Members \nof Congress who are up in arms about rising tuition.\n  What I hear in Congress is: Every time we increase Pell grants, \ncolleges raise tuition. In their exasperation, Members of Congress then \npiled new rules on already overregulated colleges. The former president \nof Stanford University estimates complying with these regulations--\nwhich today fill a stack of boxes 6 feet tall, which I have previously \nbrought onto the Senate floor--adds 7 cents to every dollar cost of \ntuition. Last year, I even voted against the new higher education bill \nbecause it doubles those regulations.\n  The greatest threat to the quality of higher education, in my \nopinion, is not underfunding, it is overregulation. But to persuade \nother Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives to stop \nadding these stacks of regulations, colleges are first going to have to \nshow that they know how to lower college costs.\n  Just as a plug-in hybrid car is not for every driver, a 3-year \ncollege degree is not for every student. But some well-qualified \nstudents may want to complete their work in 3 years--many today take 5 \nor 6 years--and in doing so save time and save money. This will require \nadjusting attitudes, faculty workloads, and using some campus \nfacilities year round.\n  Five upper East Tennessee counties already are offering free tuition \nto qualified local students at Northeast State Community College. \nFederal Pell grants and the State HOPE Scholarship pay most of the \n$1,300 semester tuition. The five counties and private companies pay \nthe rest. Sullivan County's bill last year was only $80,000 for its \nshare.\n  These are very difficult times. We all know that here. But during the \n1980s, when I was Governor of Tennessee, unemployment reached 11 \npercent, inflation reached 14 percent, and interest rates reached 20 \npercent. We were struggling then. Then the economy surged, as we hope \nit will soon again. Tennessee's higher education funding growth led the \nNation for 3 consecutive years. This is more likely to happen again if \nhigher education offers a 3-year college degree option and free \ncommunity college tuition. That will help regain the support of \nlegislators and families who are upset about colleges that seem able \nonly to increase tuition every time legislators increase funding.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/02/senate-section/article/S2648-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
