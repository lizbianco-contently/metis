In response, the Fifth Circuit \n     appointed a Special Investigative Committee (hereinafter in \n     this article referred to as ``the Committee'') to investigate \n     Cathy McBroom's complaint.\n       (2) On or about June 8, 2007, at Judge Kent's request and \n     upon notice from the Committee, Judge Kent appeared before \n     the Committee.\n       (3) As part of its investigation, the Committee sought to \n     learn from Judge Kent and others whether he had engaged in \n     unwanted sexual contact with Cathy McBroom and individuals \n     other than Cathy McBroom.\n       (4) On or about June 8, 2007, Judge Kent made false \n     statements to the Committee regarding his unwanted sexual \n     contact with Donna Wilkerson as follows:\n       (A) Judge Kent falsely stated to the Committee that the \n     extent of his unwanted sexual contact with Donna Wilkerson \n     was one kiss, when in fact and as he knew he had engaged in \n     repeated sexual contact with Donna Wilkerson without her \n     permission.\n       (B) Judge Kent falsely stated to the Committee that when \n     told by Donna Wilkerson his advances were unwelcome no \n     further contact occurred, when in fact and as he knew, Judge \n     Kent continued such advances even after she asked him to \n     stop.\n       (5) Judge Kent was indicted and pled guilty and was \n     sentenced to imprisonment for the felony of obstruction of \n     justice in violation of section 1512(c)(2) of title 18, \n     United States Code, on the basis of false statements made to \n     the Committee.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Harold Hongju Koh, of \nConnecticut, to be Legal Adviser of the Department of State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11 \na.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I will consume. \nI intend to yield time to Senator Lieberman and Senator Feingold.\n  Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the nomination of \nDean Harold Koh to be the Legal Adviser to the Secretary of State. This \nnomination is, in fact, overdue.\n  Dean Koh is one of the foremost legal scholars in the country and a \nman of the highest intellect, integrity, and character. He received a \nlaw degree from Harvard, where he was an editor of the Law Review, with \ntwo master's degrees from Oxford University where he was a Marshall \nScholar.\n  He clerked on both the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. \nSupreme Court. He has served with distinction in both Democratic and \nRepublican administrations, beginning his career in government in the \nOffice of Legal Counsel in the Reagan era.\n  I think everybody who has dealt with him and has worked with him on a \npersonal level understands the skill Dean Koh would bring to this job. \nHe has worked with the State Department on a firsthand basis. He served \nas Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor \nin the Clinton administration--a post for which he was unanimously \nconfirmed by the Senate in 1998.\n  He left government to teach at Yale Law School, and he went on to \nserve as dean until his nomination to serve in the current \nadministration. As a renowned scholar and a leading expert on \ninternational law, he has published or coauthored eight books and over \n150 articles.\n  Throughout his career, Dean Koh has been a fierce defender of the \nrule of law and human rights. He understands that the United States \nbenefits as much if not more than any other country from an \ninternational system of law where we are governed by the rule of law.\n  At the same time, his personal commitment to America's security and \nto the defense of our Constitution are indisputable. Accusations that \nhis views on international or foreign law would somehow undermine the \nConstitution are simply unjustified and unfounded--completely and \ntotally. As Dean Koh explained in response to a question from Senator \nLugar, who supports his nomination, he said:\n\n       My family settled here in part to escape from oppressive \n     foreign law, and it was America's law and commitment to human \n     rights that drew us here and have given me every privilege in \n     my life that I enjoy. My life's work represents the lessons \n     learned from that experience. Throughout my career, both in \n     and out of government, I have argued that the U.S. \n     Constitution is the ultimate controlling law in the United \n     States and that the Constitution directs whether and to what \n     extent international law should guide courts and \n     policymakers.\n\n  So while disagreements on legal theory are obviously legitimate, I \nregret that some of the accusations and insinuations against Dean Koh \nhave simply gone over any line of reasonableness or decency. Some \npeople have actually alleged that Dean Koh supports the imposition of \nIslamic Shariah law in America, which it just begs any notion of \nrelevance to what is rational.\n  Some have questioned Dean Koh for allegedly supporting suits against \nBush administration officials involved in abusive interrogation \ntechniques. Well, this is a matter for the Justice Department that he \nwill have no role in as Legal Adviser of the State Department.\n  Others have actually gone so far as to claim--believe it or not--that \nhe is against Mother's Day. I am happy his mother was at the hearing. \nHe pointed to her and had to go so far as to actually deny that, which \nis rather extraordinary.\n  Dean Koh deserves a better debate than he has been given thus far, \nand all of us are done a disservice when the debate gets diverted to \nsome of the accusations we have heard in this case.\n  Regardless of any policy differences, everyone in the Senate ought to \nbe able to agree on Dean Koh's obvious competence. We have received an \noutpouring of support for this nomination from all corners, including \nfrom over 600 law professors, over 100 law school deans, over 40 \nmembers of the clergy, 7 former State Department Legal Advisers--\nincluding the past two Legal Advisers from the Bush administration--and \nmany others.\n  Perhaps most remarkable has been the enthusiastic support for Dean \nKoh from those who do not agree with him on some issues who have spoken \nout on his behalf, including former Solicitor General Ted Olson and \nformer White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten. No less a conservative \nlegal authority than Ken Starr wrote:\n\n       The President's nomination of Harold Koh deserves to be \n     honored and respected. For our part as Americans who love our \n     country, we should be grateful that such an extraordinarily \n     talented lawyer and scholar is willing to leave the deanship \n     at his beloved Yale Law School and take on this important but \n     sacrificial form of service to our Nation.\n\n  So I think that says it all. That is the kind of Legal Adviser we \nneed at the State Department. I urge my colleagues to support this \nnomination and to vote for cloture on this nomination.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on our side? At \nleast another 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is the total time we have available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the total time remaining controlled by \nthe majority.\n  Mr. KERRY. I divide it evenly between Senator Lieberman and Senator \nFeingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nnomination of Harold Koh to be Legal Adviser at the Department of \nState.\n  I have known Harold Koh for many years, as a friend and as a neighbor \nin New Haven, and there is no doubt in my mind that he is a profoundly \nqualified choice for this important position, and deserving of \nconfirmation.\n\n[[Page S6963]]\n\n  To state the obvious, Harold is a brilliant scholar and one of \nAmerica's foremost experts on international law. He also has a \ndistinguished record of service in our government, having worked in \nboth Democratic and Republican administrations and consistently won the \nhighest regard from people across the political spectrum.\n  However, Harold Koh will bring to this position a deep devotion to \nour country and an appreciation of the fundamental values for which we \nstand, drawn from his own personal experience and the experience of his \nfamily.\n  Harold's parents came to this country, like so many before and since, \nfleeing the evils of dictatorship and seeking freedom. It was this \nexperience that helped forge in Harold his lifelong commitment to \ndemocracy and the rule of law.\n  Harold has of course been a prolific scholar, having authored or \ncoauthored 8 books and more than 150 articles. And in the course of his \nlong academic career, he has quite often exercised his right of free \nspeech.\n  To tell the truth, there have been occasions when Harold has said or \nwritten things that I personally don't agree with. And although he is \ntoo gracious to say so, I am sure there have been occasions when I have \nsaid or done things that Harold has not agreed with.\n  But this has never interrupted my respect for Harold--for his \nintelligence and his integrity, nor I have any doubt about Harold's \nlove for our great nation and its values, and his commitment to uphold \nour Constitution. To use a word we do not use enough anymore, Harold \nKoh is a true American patriot who will put our country and our \nConstitution first.\n  It is also worth noting that no one who has ever worked with Harold \nhas offered anything but praise for him personally and support for his \nnomination. In fact, his nomination has attracted a remarkable \nbipartisan coalition of supporters, including Ted Olson, Ken Starr, and \nJosh Bolten.\n  These endorsements reflect the fact that, even those who might not \nalways agree with Harold on every issue, nonetheless respect him \nenormously and feel he is profoundly qualified to serve in this \nposition.\n  There is a great deal that we debate in this chamber, but there is \nreally no debate about the importance of the rule of law to our \ncountry. That is what Harold Koh's life and career have been all about, \nand it is that surpassing priority that he will bring to the position \nof Legal Adviser at the State Department.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support Harold Koh's \nnomination and to vote for his confirmation.\n  The cloture vote will occur at 11 o'clock, minutes from now. I speak \nfrom a real depth and personal experience with Harold Koh. I know him \nand have known him for years as a friend and a neighbor in Connecticut. \nBased on that and all of his professional work, there is no doubt in my \nmind that he is profoundly qualified to occupy this important position \nas Legal Adviser at the Department of State. He is a brilliant scholar. \nHe is one of America's foremost experts on international law. He \nactually is qualified to be the Legal Adviser to the Secretary of \nState. He has a distinguished record of service in our government, \nhaving worked in both Democratic and Republican administrations. He has \nconsistently won the highest regard from people across the political \nspectrum.\n  Harold Koh will bring to this position a deep devotion to our country \nand the appreciation of the fundamental values for which we stand, \nbased on his personal status as the child of immigrants who came to \nthis country, escaping dictatorship, seeking freedom, and contributing \nmightily to America.\n  Harold has been a prolific scholar in the course of his long academic \ncareer. He has fully exercised his right of free speech. To tell the \ntruth, there have been occasions when Harold has said or written things \nthat I personally don't agree with. Although he is too gracious to say \nso, I am sure there have been occasions on which I have centered on \nsome things that Harold has not agreed with, but that has never \ninterfered with my respect and admiration for him----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Connecticut has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.--because I have always known, regardless of whether we \nagree or disagree, Harold Koh is committed to the United States of \nAmerica, to the Constitution, and the rule of law. What more could we \nask for a Legal Adviser to the Department of State.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am so pleased to rise today in strong \nsupport of the nomination of Harold Koh to be Legal Adviser at the \nState Department. I have known Dean Koh for more than 30 years, and I \ncan say without any doubt he is an excellent choice for this position. \nI say that not just because he is one of my oldest friends but because \nhe is one of the leading legal scholars in the country. He is \nextraordinarily qualified for this position.\n  Dean Koh is one of the most intelligent, ethical, and hard-working \nindividuals I have ever encountered. He has spent his career of some 30 \nyears working on public and private international law, national \nsecurity law, and on human rights. Throughout that time, he has been \ncommitted to America's security and to defending our Constitution. He \nhas dedicated his life to upholding the rule of law and strengthening \nAmerican values.\n  During his confirmation hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Dean Koh effectively responded to all of the charges against \nhim. He made clear that he understands that his role as legal counsel \nfor the State Department would be different from that of an academic, \nthat he would adhere to the constitutional laws of our land, and that \nof course he does not believe that foreign law can trump the \nConstitution.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that Dean Koh will candidly and \nobjectively advise the Secretary of State on existing law, while also \nensuring that she receives competent, objective, and honest advice on \nthe legal consequences of her actions and decisions in an effort to \nsupport and advance the President's foreign policy agenda.\n  At the same time, Dean Koh will ensure respect for our national \ninterests and our legal obligations. If confirmed, Dean Koh will serve \nour President, and this Nation, and defend the Constitution fully and \nfaithfully.\n  We are long overdue in confirming Dean Koh. I urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of cloture so we can move expeditiously to an up or down \nvote and Dean Koh can begin his service as the State Department's Legal \nAdviser.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise reluctantly to speak against the \nnomination of Harold Koh to be the Legal Adviser to the State \nDepartment. I had a chance to explain some of the reasons yesterday, \nand for the benefit of our colleagues I wish to cover those and some \nadditional concerns as well with a little more detail.\n  There is no question that Dean Koh is a brilliant lawyer and he has \nbeen a charming advocate for his promotion to this important position. \nHowever, I have concluded that he is not the right person for this job, \nbecause he has stated what I would consider to be radical views with \nregard to the role of the United States sovereignty relative to the \nrest of the world.\n  For example, he has advocated judges using treaties in customary \ninternational law, including treaties that the Senate has not ratified, \nto bind the United States. If that is not an erosion of U.S. \nsovereignty, I don't know what it is. Advocating that judges who take \nan oath to uphold and defend the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates should instead look to international treaties as the source of \nthat law, to me, is a radical and very fundamental shift in what I \nthink most people would expect from our judges.\n  He said that Federal judges should use their power to ``vertically \nenforce'' or ``domesticate'' American law with international norms and \nforeign law. Do we want the top adviser at the State Department \nsupporting the idea that international bodies and unelected Federal \nofficials, not the Congress,\n\n[[Page S6964]]\n\nshould be the ultimate lawmaking authority for the American people? I \ndon't think so.\n  This has manifested itself in a number of ways. For example, in an \ninterview that Dean Koh gave on May 10 for the ``News Hour,'' he was \nasked about, for example, some of the interrogations that took place in \nplaces such as Guantanamo. He basically said that the U.S. forces, \nincluding our commanders and presumably the intelligence officials who \nactually conducted interrogations and detentions, violated the Geneva \nConventions and should be held accountable for that. Does he believe \nthat U.S. officials should be prosecuted and perhaps convicted of war \ncrimes because they did what the American people asked them to do, \nconsistent with the legal opinions from the Office of Legal Counsel at \nthe Justice Department?\n  As the Wall Street Journal points out today in an article called \n``The Pursuit of John Yoo''--I will read a couple of sentences from it:\n\n       Here's a political thought experiment: Imagine that \n     terrorists stage an attack on U.S. soil in the next 4 years. \n     In the recriminations afterward, Administration officials are \n     sued by families of victims for having advised in legal memos \n     that Guantanamo be closed and that interrogations of al-Qaida \n     detainees be limited. Should these officials be personally \n     liable for the advice they gave to President Obama?\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       We'd say no, but that's exactly the kind of lawsuit that \n     the political left, including State Department nominee Harold \n     Koh, has encouraged against Bush administration officials.\n\n  Of course, it goes on to talk about the lawsuit brought by Jose \nPadilla, a convicted terrorist, against lawyers at the Office of Legal \nCounsel at the Justice Department that is being encouraged, if not \nfacilitated, by Harold Koh, the outgoing dean at the Yale Law School, \nthe person who is being proposed for promotion as a Legal Adviser at \nthe Justice Department.\n  I think his views, if they were confined to academia and to Yale Law \nSchool, would be one thing, but the thought that he would bring and put \nthese what I would consider to be out-of-the-mainstream legal theories \nand approaches into action as a Legal Adviser at the State Department, \nto me is a frightening prospect.\n  He has also, in the course of his writings, taken very extreme views \nwith regard to the second amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates, part of our Bill of Rights, the right to keep and bear arms. In \n2002, and later in Fordham Law Review in May of 2003, he wrote an \narticle called ``The World Drowning In Guns'' in which he argued for a \nglobal gun control regime. Do we want the top adviser at the State \nDepartment working through diplomatic circles to take away Americans' \nsecond amendment rights to the Constitution? I think not.\n  Third, Professor Koh in 2007 argued that foreign fighters, detainees \nheld by the U.S. Armed Forces anywhere in the world--not just at \nGuantanamo Bay--are entitled to habeas corpus review in U.S. Federal \ncourts--in civilian courts--just as an American citizen would be, no \nmatter where they were held. Do we want the top adviser at the State \nDepartment working to grant terrorists and enemy combatants more rights \nthan they have ever had before under any court interpretation? I think \nnot.\n  Perhaps most timely, Professor Koh appears to draw moral equivalence \nbetween the Iranian regime's political suppression and human rights \nabuses on the one hand, which we have been watching play out on \ntelevision, and America's counterterrorism policies on the other hand. \nIn 2007, he wrote:\n\n       The United States cannot stand on strong footing attacking \n     Iran for ``illegal detentions'' when similar charges can be \n     and have been lodged against our own government.\n\n  Do we want a Legal Adviser to the State Department who can't see the \ndifference between America defending itself against terrorism and the \nbrutal repression practiced by a theocratic dictatorship? I think not.\n  I am afraid that Dean Koh is just another in a line of radical \nnominees by this administration that the Senate should not confirm.\n  I think back to Don Johnson who was also nominated to the Office of \nLegal Counsel who said America is not at war post 9/11, and that \ninstead of embracing the provisions of the Constitution that recognize \nthe President's powers as Commander in Chief to protect the American \npeople, we ought to instead resort to a paradigm that says, Well, this \nis a law enforcement matter. If it is a law enforcement matter, then \nyou are not going to do anything to stop terrorist attacks before they \noccur; you are merely going to prosecute the terrorists after they kill \ninnocent life.\n  Just like Don Johnson, who said we are not at war, Harold Koh has \nencouraged and facilitated the investigation and perhaps prosecution of \nAmerican military personnel, and who knows who else, including lawyers \nwho have provided legal advice, as well as perhaps the intelligence \nofficials who relied on that advice to get actual intelligence that we \nhave used to deter and indeed to defeat terrorist attacks on our own \nsoil.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting against cloture on this \nnomination. Professor Koh may be an appropriate individual for some \nother job, but when our national security is at stake, and our role \nrelative to the international community, whether we are going to \nsubject ourselves not just to the U.S. Constitution and laws made by \nthe elected representatives of the people here in the Congress but \ninstead to international treaties and international common law that we \nhave not agreed to and that the American people have not consented to, \nI think this is the wrong job for this nominee. I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in voting against cloture.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to strongly \nsupport the nomination of Dean Koh for this position. I have known Dean \nKoh from his outstanding work at the Yale Law School and from his \noutstanding contribution as the dean of the Yale Law School. He comes \nto this position with an extraordinary educational background: summa \ncum laude of Harvard College, Oxford; Harvard Law School, cum laude. He \nhas had a distinguished career with the Federal Government having \nserved as Assistant Secretary of State from 1998 to 2001. He has done \nexemplary work at Yale. His father was the first Korean lawyer to study \nin the United States.\n  Yesterday, I spoke at some length about Dean Koh and inserted his \nextraordinary resume in the Record. It took many pages to list all of \nhis honorary degrees, all of his publications, and all of his awards. \nWhen we search for the best and the brightest to come to Washington, \nDean Koh is a perfect match for that description. If his nomination is \nto be rejected, it certainly will be a signal to people who have an \ninterest in public service that they are better off not treading in \nthese waters because the politics is so thick that even individuals of \nsuch extraordinary credentials can be rejected by the Senate.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this nomination. I have been \nin this body a while. I have never spoken with such enthusiasm or such \ndetermination for the confirmation of a nominee as I have for Dean Koh. \nI think he will do an outstanding job.\n  Certainly, the points that have been raised by the distinguished \nSenator from Texas are worthy of consideration, but there is no showing \nthat any of those ideas will be followed to the extreme to the \ndetriment of the United States, and his qualifications suggest he would \nbe a great asset to the United States of America and the State \nDepartment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and that I be followed by my colleague, Senator \nIsakson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing no objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Dr. Bruce Grube\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an academic \nleader and a true public servant--Dr. Bruce Grube. A decade ago, Dr. \nGrube took the helm of Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, GA. \nAt the end of this month, after 10 years on this job, he will leave \nGeorgia Southern a bigger, better, and considerably richer university, \nboth in terms of its endowment and in its academic achievements, than \nwhen he started.\n  His leadership has been robust. During Dr. Grube's tenure as \nPresident of Georgia Southern the school's enrollment has risen almost \n23 percent. Nearly 18,000 students are proud to call Georgia Southern \ntheir academic home. And while freshman SAT scores were rising some 13 \npercent on his watch, the university was being catapulted into national \nprominence. During Dr. Grube's time as president, Georgia Southern was \ndesignated a Carnegie doctoral/research university, was featured in the \nU.S. News and World Report's ``Best Colleges'' guide, and was named one \nof the Nation's ``Top 100 Best Values'' in education by Kiplinger.\n  He also oversaw the creation of two new colleges specializing in \ninformation technology and public health, presided over a veritable \nbuilding boom on campus, and brought Georgia Southern into the Internet \nage with distance learning courses.\n  Of all his remarkable achievements, perhaps the most significant is \nthat in the decade of Dr. Grube's presidency, the amount of \nscholarships funded through the Georgia Southern Foundation has \ndoubled. In 1999, the foundation's scholarships totaled $644,000. In \n2007, the foundation was able to award $1.3 million to deserving \nscholars, many of whom may not have been able to start school or \ncomplete their degrees without that assistance. And Dr. Grube has led \nthe way in doubling the university's endowment in 9 years' time.\n  In addition, he has overseen Georgia Southern's rise in the world of \ncollegiate athletics. In the past decade, the Eagles' volleyball, \nsoftball, baseball, and golf teams have reached their respective NCAA \ntournaments. Its football team went to the FCS national championships, \nand its cheerleading squad captured the national title.\n  Georgia Southern and the entire university system will miss Dr. \nGrube's visionary leadership. Fortunately, this political scientist who \ngot his start in the classroom won't be going far. After a little time \noff, he will return to Georgia Southern to teach in 2010.\n  Dr. Grube, we certainly wish you and your family the best. Your \nprofessional dedication to better education has made Georgia Southern \nand Georgia a better place in which to live. I am proud to call you my \ngood friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise with my colleague \nfrom Georgia, Senator Chambliss, and pay tribute to my friend, Dr. \nBruce Grube. A lot of times we stand on the floor and say ``my \nfriend,'' when it is a passing statement. Well, it is not for me. I met \nDr. Grube in 1989, when he was named the 11th president of Georgia \nSouthern University, and I was with him as recently as commencement \nlast year.\n  He is a great leader in education in our State, and he will be \nmissed. But he is both remembered and revered and there are three \nreasons I would like to talk about his distinguished career. No. 1, he \ndid what is most important for college presidents to do--he raised the \nendowment of the university. In fact, he doubled the endowment of the \nuniversity. And because of that, as Senator Chambliss said, he doubled \nthe number of scholarships going out to deserving Georgians to come to \nGeorgia Southern University. That is No. 1.\n\n  No. 2, as a former chairman of a State board of education and one \nwhose passion is education, I love what Dr. Grube did when he put in \nthe First-Year Experience program at Georgia Southern University, a \nprogram designed to make the first-year experience a lasting experience \nso student retention improved at Georgia Southern and more kids who \nentered graduated. Since the inception of that program, retention at \nGeorgia Southern University has gone from 66 percent of the freshman \nclass to 81 percent of the freshman class--four out of five returning \nand getting their degree at Georgia Southern University.\n  No. 3, among everything else that a president of a university does in \nterms of responsibility, it is so important that they outreach to the \ncommunity. When you go to Bulloch County in Statesboro, GA, if you are \nat Snooky's Restaurant for breakfast, Dr. Grube is there. If you are on \ncampus in the middle of the day, interacting with students under the \nshade of a Georgia pine tree, Dr. Grube is there. If there is a \ncharitable or benefit program in Bulloch County, Dr. Grube is there. He \nis the face of Georgia Southern University, and he will be missed--but \nonly for a year because after a brief sabbatical he comes back to teach \npolitical science at Georgia Southern University. He returns to his \nroots, established in his doctorate degree at the University of Texas \nin political science and carried on for years to come as a \ndistinguished professor of political science at Georgia Southern \nUniversity.\n  I am proud to rise with my colleague, Senator Chambliss, to pay \ntribute to a great Georgian, a great educator, and my personal friend, \nDr. Bruce Grube.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S6966]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to proceed on my leader time \nwhich I did not use earlier this morning.\n\n\n                      Health Care Week IV, Day III\n\n  Mr. President, when it comes to reforming health care, Republicans \nbelieve that both political parties should work together to make it \nless expensive and easier to obtain, while preserving what people like \nabout our current system.\n  That is why Republicans have put forward ideas that should be easy \nfor everyone to support, such as reforming medical malpractice laws to \nget rid of junk lawsuits; encouraging wellness and prevention programs \nthat have already been shown to cut costs; and addressing the needs of \nsmall businesses without imposing taxes that will kill jobs.\n  Unfortunately, Democrats on Capitol Hill have opted against many of \nthese commonsense proposals, moving instead in the direction of a \ngovernment-run system that denies, delays, and rations care.\n  So it is my hope that the President uses his prime time question and \nanswer session at the White House tonight to clearly express where he \nhimself comes down on a number of crucial questions.\n  One question relates to whether Americans would be able to keep the \ncare they have if the Democrat plan is enacted. The President and \nDemocrats in Congress have repeatedly promised Americans they could \nkeep their health insurance. Yet the independent Congressional Budget \nOffice says that just one section of the Democrat bill being rushed \nthrough Congress at the moment would cause 10 million people with \nemployer-based insurance to lose the coverage they have.\n  Another independent study of a full proposal that includes a \ngovernment-run plan estimates that 119 million Americans, or \napproximately 70 percent of those covered under private health \ninsurance, could lose the health insurance they have as a consequence \nof a government plan. America's doctors have also warned that a \ngovernment plan threatens to drive private insurers out of business. \nAnd yesterday, the President himself acknowledged that under a \ngovernment plan, some people might be shifted off of their current \ninsurance.\n  So the first question is this: Will the President veto any \nlegislation that causes Americans to lose their private insurance?\n  The President also said that health care reform cannot add to the \nalready staggering national debt. Yet once again, the Congressional \nBudget Office has said that just one section of the Democrats' HELP \nbill would spend $1.3 trillion, while others estimate the whole thing \ncould end up spending more than $2 trillion. And here is how the CBO \nput it: ``the substantial costs of many current proposals to expand \nFederal subsidies for health insurance would be much more likely to \nworsen the long-run budget outlook than to improve it.''\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President. The Congressional Budget Office \nsays that some of the proposals in the Democrats' bill would be much \nmore likely to worsen the long-run budget outlook than to improve it.\n  So the second question is this: Will the President veto a bill that \nadds to the Nation's already staggering deficit?\n  The President has said that no middle-class Americans would see their \ntaxes raised a penny. Yet Democrats on Capitol Hill are considering \nproposals, such as a plan to limit tax deductions for medical costs, \nthat would not only raise taxes on middle class families, but that \nwould hit these families the hardest.\n  So the third question is this: Will the President veto any \nlegislation that raises taxes on the middle class?\n  The President has said he supports wellness and prevention programs \nthat have proven to cut costs and improve care by encouraging people to \nmake healthy choices, like quitting smoking and fighting obesity. One \nsuch program is the so-called Safeway plan, which has dramatically cut \nthat company's costs and employee premiums. Yet the bill Democrats are \nrushing through the Senate would actually ban the key provisions of the \nSafeway program from being implemented by other companies.\n  So the fourth question is this: Does the President support the HELP \nCommittee bill, which bans providing incentives for healthy behavior, \nand will he veto legislation that bans these kinds of programs?\n  Finally, the President has said that government should not dictate \nthe kind of care Americans receive. On this issue, the President has no \nstronger supporters than Republicans. But Democrats on the HELP \nCommittee rejected a Republican amendment that would have prohibited a \nDemocrat-proposed government board from rationing care or denying \nlifesaving treatments because they are too expensive.\n  So the fifth question is this: Does the President support the \nRepublican amendment to prohibit the rationing of care, and will he \nveto legislation that allows the government to deny, delay, and ration \ncare?\n  Five questions: Will the President use his veto pen to make sure \nAmericans are not kicked off their current health plans? Will he oppose \nany legislation that increases the nation's deficit? Will he oppose any \nbill that raises taxes on middle-class families? Will he reject any \nbill that excludes commonsense wellness and prevention programs that \nhave been proven to cut costs and improve care? And will he disavow \nlegislation that denies, delays, and rations care?\n  The American people want Republicans and Democrats to work together \nto enact health care reform, but they want the right kind of reform not \na massive government takeover that forces them off of their current \ninsurance and denies, delays, and rations care. Americans are right to \nbe concerned about what they are hearing from Democrats. It's my hope \nthat the President addresses those concerns tonight once and for all.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the nomination of Harold Koh concerns me for \na number of reasons. Primarily, his view that international law should \nguide U.S. law and his criticism of our first amendment right to \nfreedom of speech and his opposition to the Solomon amendment, which \nconditions Federal funding to educational institutions on allowing \nmilitary recruiting on campus.\n  The State Department Legal Adviser helps formulate and implement U.S. \nforeign policy, advises the Justice Department on cases with \ninternational implications, influences U.S. positions on issues \nconsidered by international bodies, and represents the United States at \ntreaty negotiations and international conferences.\n  In short, this position requires the utmost deference to the \nConstitution of the United States. Mr. Koh is a proponent of \ntransnationalism, the belief that Americans should use foreign law and \nthe views of international organizations to interpret our Constitution \nand to determine our policies.\n  Mr. Koh has gone so far as to refer to the United States as part of \nan ``axis of disobedience'' in reference to America's alleged \nviolations of international law.\n  During his 2003 speech at the University of California at Berkeley, \nMr. Koh said:\n\n       When I came to government, the first conclusion I reached \n     was that the rule of law should be on the U.S. side.\n       That's a system of law--\n\n  He is speaking now of international law--\n\n     that we helped to create. So that's why we support various \n     systems of international adjudication. That's why we support \n     the UN system. We need these institutions, even if they cut \n     our own sovereignty a little bit.\n\n  Mr. Koh's views on the first amendment again portray a desire to make\n\n[[Page S6967]]\n\nAmerican law subservient to international law. In his Stanford Law \nReview article--the title of which was ``On American Exceptionalism''--\nKoh stated that our first amendment gives ``protections for speech and \nreligion . . . far greater emphasis and judicial protection in America \nthan in Europe or Asia,'' and he opined that America's ``exceptional \nfree speech tradition can cause problems abroad.'' Furthermore, he \nstated that the way for the ``Supreme Court [to] moderate these \nconflicts'' is ``by applying more consistently the transnationalist \napproach to judicial interpretation.''\n  This is breathtaking. Is it even consistent with an oath to protect \nand defend the Constitution? Should we now begin to dismantle a \nfounding principle of our democracy in order to appease the so-called \ninternational community, as Mr. Koh advocates? If the Founding Fathers \nhad followed this advice, this country would not be the leading example \nof freedom in the world it is today and a leader in getting others to \nprotect free speech and assembly and other freedoms--such as are being \nasserted in Iran today. Conforming our views to the norm, which Mr. Koh \nacknowledges provides less protection than our Constitution would, \ntherefore, would adversely affect the very international community \nwhich Mr. Koh seeks to emulate.\n  Let me put it another way. People in Iran today are taking to the \nstreets to try to exercise some degree of free speech and assembly and \npetition their government. Mr. Koh acknowledges that in our \nConstitution we provide much more protection for those rights than \nanywhere else, or, I think as he put it, than the mainstream of \ninternational law provides. That is true.\n  I think that is something we should not only adhere to for our own \nbenefit but for the benefit that it provides to others around the world \nas an example of what they should seek to achieve and because of the \nmoral status it gives the United States to be able to say to the \nleaders of a country such as Iran: You need to provide free speech and \nassembly and the right to petition their government, and the fact that \nyou are not doing it is wrong because if we believe we are all created \nequal, by our Creator, that means we have moral equality as \nindividuals. Everybody in Iran, we believe, would have the same right \nas anyone else to exercise these God-given rights. And if that is true, \nit makes no sense to diminish those rights as they have been \ninterpreted by our courts in the United States, interpreting our U.S. \nConstitution, in order for us to conform to an international norm.\n  Rather, it makes sense for us to continue to adhere to those high \nstandards and to try to bring other countries along with us. In fact, I \nwould postulate that because of our high standard of rights and the \nexample that our Constitution provides, many countries of the world \nhave actually advanced the cause of free speech and assembly and \npetitioning their government more than they otherwise would have \nbecause they have the example of the United States to look at.\n  If I think of countries, the revolutions, the Orange Revolution, and \nthe changes in governments in places such as Poland, back when it broke \nfrom the Soviet Union, and Ukraine and Georgia and all of the other \nplaces in the world where people finally broke free from the shackles \nof a government that would not permit free speech, what were they \nseeking to do? To exercise free speech in order to petition their \ngovernment for individual freedom.\n  So the United States should jealously guard those rights in our \nConstitution rather than, as Mr. Koh says, have the United States \ninterpret its Constitution more in line with the mainstream of thinking \nin the rest of the world.\n  If you sort of try to apply a mathematical formula, and you average \nwhat the rest of the world thinks about free speech, the right of \nreligion, the right to assemble, the right to petition the government, \nthe average is far below what we provide. We are pretty much at the top \nof the pile in terms of what we protect.\n  But if we were to follow Mr. Koh's advice, in order to be more \naccepted in the world, we would draw our standards of protection of \nindividual rights down to the leveled area of the mainstream around the \nworld. If you look around the world today, there are so many \ndictatorships, totalitarian systems, autocracies--even a country such \nas China--which provide very little in the way of freedom for their \npeople. If you just took the average based on the population of the \nworld, I know what the mainstream would be. It would not be very much \nin the way of individual rights.\n  So we should jealously protect what we have in the United States, \nwhich is a constitution that at least thus far has been interpreted to \nprotect those rights jealously, not just for our benefit--though that \nshould be, I submit, the sole purpose of a Supreme Court Judge, for \nexample, deciding Supreme Court cases; what does the Constitution say \nfor the people of America?--but if one is going to consider the \ninternational implications, I think it would be exactly the opposite of \nwhat Mr. Koh is saying; namely, that we should be concerned that any \ndiminishment of the interpretation of our rights would negatively \naffect other people around the world.\n  I do not care if the average is a lower standard. I wish those \ncountries would bring their standards up to ours. But I certainly do \nnot want to conform to some idea of international acceptance or \ninternational popularity by bringing ourselves down to their level. \nThis is not what ``American Exceptionalism'' is all about--the title of \nthe piece Mr. Koh wrote.\n  He has argued in other contexts as well that unique American \nconstitutional provisions should conform to the international view of \nthings. I have been speaking of free speech and assembly, the right to \npetition your government, to practice religion. We think those are \nabsolutely basic. But there are some other rights in our Constitution. \nOne of them is the second amendment. It is controversial.\n  Other countries do not have a protection such as the second amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution. If we want to amend the Constitution, we can \ndo that. But as it stands right now, the second amendment has been \nupheld by the Supreme Court to apply to every individual in the United \nStates, free from Federal undue interference with respect to the \nownership of guns.\n  But if we adopt Mr. Koh's argument about conforming to international \nnorms, including stricter gun control, it may bring us more in line \nwith some other countries, but it certainly would not be in keeping \nwith the interpretation of the U.S. Supreme Court with respect to that \nsecond amendment.\n  In an April 2002 speech at the Fordham University School of Law, Mr. \nKoh advocated a U.N.-governed regime to force the United States ``to \nsubmit information about their small arms production.'' He believes the \nUnited States should ``establish a national firearms control system and \na register of manufacturers, traders, importers and exporters'' of guns \nto comply with international obligations. This would allow U.N. members \nsuch as Cuba and Venezuela and North Korea and Iran to have a say in \nwhat type of gun regulations are imposed on American citizens.\n  As the dean of Yale Law School, Mr. Koh was a leader in another \neffort I think is troublesome. It was an effort to deprive students of \nthe freedom to listen to military recruiters who wanted to explain on \ncampus the benefits of a career in our military services. We all--every \none of us in this body--frequently express our gratitude to the people \nin the U.S. military services who protect us, who put themselves in \ndanger in order to protect the very freedoms we are talking about. Yet \nas dean of the law school, he would not allow the recruiters for these \nmilitary institutions to come on campus. Yet he would protect students' \nfreedom to listen to antiwar speakers on campus. But Yale closed its \ndoors to military recruiters primarily because it disagreed with the \nmilitary's policies on gays, which, by the way, is a policy of the \nPresident and the Congress, not just the military.\n\n  In court, Mr. Koh and others in Yale's administration challenged the \nconstitutionality of the Solomon amendment. The Solomon amendment is a \nstatute that denies Federal funds to educational institutions that \nblock military recruiters. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled against \nMr. Koh's position.\n  Mr. Koh also led a lawsuit against Department of Justice lawyer John\n\n[[Page S6968]]\n\nYoo for doing what any government lawyer is expected to do: provide his \nlegal opinions to the people he worked for, the policymakers of the \nU.S. Government.\n  The Supreme Court has said, in no uncertain terms, that government \nlawyers need immunity from suit in order to avoid ``the deterrence of \nable citizens from acceptance of public office'' and the ``danger that \nfear of being sued will dampen the ardor of . . . public officials in \nthe unflinching discharge of their duties.''\n  In other words, by encouraging this lawsuit, Mr. Koh was effectively \ndeterring his students from doing precisely what Yale otherwise \nrecommends that they do: enter public service.\n  Elections have consequences. I understand and generally support the \nprerogative of the President to nominate individuals for his \nadministration he deems appropriate as long as they are within the \nspectrum of responsible views. However, because of the importance of \nhis position in representing the United States in the international \ncommunity with respect to treaties and other agreements, his own words \nand actions demonstrate to me he is far outside the mainstream in such \na way that his appointment as State Department Legal Adviser could \ndamage U.S. sovereignty.\n  So I oppose his nomination. I urge my colleagues--all of us who take \nan oath to support and defend the Constitution and who appreciate there \nare always challenges to America's sovereignty--to closely examine Mr. \nKoh's record and determine whether he would be a representative not \nonly whom they could be proud of but whom they could rely upon in \nrepresenting the American public interest.\n  At the end of the day, our sovereignty depends upon the American \npeople. We govern with the consent of the governed. Our government does \nnot start with rights. We had a group of people in America who gave \ntheir government certain limited rights in order for their common good. \nSo the American people are our bosses. They pay our salary. We need to \nlisten to them.\n  When I talk to my constituents--at least in recent months--I notice a \ntheme that is recurring, and it is troublesome to me first of all \nbecause it is the kind of thing that sometimes is influenced by people \nwho have less character than those of us in this body and others who \nmay disagree with each other but seriously approach these issues. It is \nthe idea that little by little the people are losing sovereignty, and \nthat the country of America is giving up its sovereignty to others. Who \nare the others?\n  I am not a conspiratorial person. That is why I say some of the \npeople who promote this idea do not do so for the right reasons, and I \ndo not like to see them paid attention to by our constituents. But \nevery time we adhere to a U.N. resolution or sign a treaty with another \ncountry or agree to abide by the terms of a trade agreement, or \nsomething of that sort, to some extent we are giving up a little bit of \nour sovereignty. As long as we do all of those things with the consent \nof the governed and as long as we do it through the representative \nprocess where we pass a law or we confirm a treaty, ratify a treaty, it \nis done in the right way. We may make a mistake, we may go too far \nsometimes, but that is the decision we make. We have the right to make \nmistakes too. But when we go outside the legal framework of the country \nto cede a little bit of our sovereignty, as Mr. Koh says is OK, then we \nhave abused the confidence the American people have placed in us and we \nhave gone beyond our legal ability as representatives of the people to \ngive up this little degree of sovereignty.\n\n  What I am concerned about, because of his position, which is the \ndirect link between the United States and all of these international \norganizations and countries which our country necessarily deals with, \nis that he cares less about the protection of American sovereignty than \nthe vast majority of the American citizens. In fact, he has a point of \nview which regards that as less important than conforming to \ninternational norms and even being in line with popular opinion \ninternationally. As I said before, it is nice to be liked, but at the \nend of the day, the United States should not be about popular opinion.\n  We could probably be more popular with 100 countries in the United \nNations if we stopped harping on things such as clean elections and \nfree speech and the right to assembly and so on because my guess is \nthere are probably 50 to 100 countries in the United Nations that don't \nrespect their citizens' rights nearly as much as we do. In fact, the \nnumber is probably larger than that. They are uncomfortable with the \nexample of a country such as the United States which sets on such a \nhigh pedestal our American citizens' rights, that we not only protect \nthose rights for our citizens, but we hold them out to the rest of the \nworld as something that would be beneficial for their citizens as well. \nThis makes them uncomfortable, and rightly so, because sometimes, as we \nare seeing in Iran today, people decide that it is a good thing to \ndecide to exercise those rights and they feel the denial of that \nability by their governments is wrong. They are even willing to risk \ntheir lives, as our forefathers did, to assert those rights. That is \nhow important they are.\n  How odd it is, therefore, to come across such an intelligent--and he \ncertainly is intelligent--man such as Mr. Koh who has a very different \npoint of view about these important American rights, who believes it is \nmore important for us to be in the mainstream of international thinking \neven though that mainstream represents a view of rights far less than \nthe United States views our rights; it is far more important for us to \nbe well viewed in the international community than it is to strictly \nadhere to those rights that are embodied in our Constitution. That is \nextraordinarily troubling to me. Some of his views are breathtaking as \nthey have been asserted.\n  I know he has met with some of our colleagues, that he is apparently, \nin addition to being very intelligent, very charming, and that his \nessential position is: Well, that is what I said in a speech, but I \nwill recognize my obligations as a member of the administration.\n  I think we are all informed by our views, and if we care enough about \nthem to speak out in a way that he has, as frequently and as forcefully \nas Mr. Koh has, it is difficult to believe that all of a sudden, in a \nmoment of his confirmation, he will forget about everything he said and \nwhat he believes and conform his representation of the American people \nto what is a far more mainstream point of view; namely, that we should \ndefend our Constitution to the absolute maximum extent we can, \nirrespective of the views of other countries around the world. That is \nwhy, at the end of the day, as I said, I hope my colleagues will review \nhis record very carefully and will judge and eventually base their vote \non his confirmation on what he has said--because he is an intelligent \nman who knows very well what he has said--and what, therefore, could \nflow from his words as actions as our representative in the State \nDepartment as its Legal Adviser.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes, with the time counting toward \nthe postcloture debate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Metro Collision\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my condolences to \nthe families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in the tragic \ncollision of two Metro trains this past Monday evening. This accident \nis the most devastating, by any measure, in Metro's history, and it has \naffected our entire region. My prayers are with those who lost their \nlives and my deepest sympathies are with their families, friends, and \nall those they touched.\n  I want to take a moment to praise the first responders, who worked \ntirelessly through the night to rescue the injured and save lives. It \nis during tragedies such as this that we can fully appreciate the \nheroism and bravery of our first responders.\n\n[[Page S6969]]\n\n  At this time, we don't know the cause of the crash, and it may take \nconsiderable time for the National Transportation Safety Board to \ncomplete its investigation and make a determination. We certainly will \ndo everything we can in this body to assist the National Transportation \nSafety Board in their investigation, make sure it is thorough and \ncomplete, and that we fully understand how this tragedy occurred.\n  News reports found that the train car that caused the fatal accident \nwas an older model that the Federal safety officials had recommended \nfor replacement. It didn't have the data recorder or modern \nimprovements to stand up to a collision, and it may have been 2 months \nbehind in its scheduled maintenance. Metro officials are replacing \nthese aging cars that date back to the 1970s. These costly replacements \nare being made but at a pace that is too slow.\n  Funding shortfalls have caused Metro to make repairs instead of \nreplacing aging equipment or structures throughout the system. Last \nyear, I visited the Shady Grove Station and witnessed firsthand how \nthey literally are using wood planks and iron rods to prop up station \nplatforms. They have been forced to make accommodations to keep the \nsystem running in the safest possible manner.\n  The Washington Metro rail system is the second busiest commuter rail \nsystem in America, carrying as many as a million passengers a day. It \ncarries the equivalent of the combined subway ridership of BART in San \nFrancisco, MARTA in Atlanta, and SEPTA in Philadelphia each day. But \nmore than three decades after the first train started running, the \nsystem is showing severe signs of age. Sixty percent of the Metro rail \nsystem is more than 20 years old. The costs of operations maintenance \nand rehabilitation are tremendous.\n  This is not only the responsibility of the local jurisdictions that \nserve Metro--the State of Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, DC--but \nthere is also a Federal responsibility in regard to these cars. Federal \nfacilities are located within footsteps of 35 of Metrorail's 86 \nstations. Nearly half of Metrorail's rush hour riders are Federal \nemployees. This is our Metro system. We have a responsibility. \nApproximately 10 percent of Metro's riders use the Metrorail stations \nat the Pentagon, Capital South, and Union Station, serving the military \nand the Congress.\n  In addition, Metro's ability to move people quickly and safely in the \nevent of a terrorist attack or natural disaster is crucial. The Metro \nsystem was invaluable on September 11, 2001, proving its importance to \nthe Federal Government and the Nation during the terrorist attacks of \nthat tragic day.\n  There is a clear Federal responsibility to this system.\n  Metro is unique from any other major public transportation system \nacross the country because it has no dedicated source of funding to pay \nfor its operation and capital funding requirements. But we are close to \nresolving that issue.\n  I was proud to work alongside Senator Mikulski, Senator Webb, and \nformer Senator John Warner last year to pass the Federal Rail Safety \nImprovement Act, which was signed into law in October 2008. This law \nauthorizes $1.5 billion over 10 years in Federal funds for Metro's \ngoverning Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, matched \ndollar for dollar by local jurisdictions, for capital improvement. The \ntechnical details of this arrangement are nearly complete, and when \ndone, Metro finally will have its dedicated funding sources. I \ncompliment the States of Virginia and Maryland and the District for \npassing the necessary legislation.\n  Earlier this year, as a regional delegation, along with our new \ncolleague, Senator Mark Warner, we requested that the Appropriations \nCommittee provide the first $150 million. While this is a substantial \ndownpayment, it is not nearly enough to fulfill all of Metrorail's \nobligations. At the time of the bill's passage, Metro had a list of \nready-to-go projects totaling about $530 million and $11 billion in \ncapital funding needs over the next decade. Yesterday, I joined with my \ncolleagues from Maryland and Virginia in sending another letter to the \nchairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee reiterating \nour urgent request for a first-year installment of $150 million in \nfunding for WMATA. Earlier today, I was pleased to announce $34.3 \nmillion in additional funding for the purchase of new Metro cars. This \nwas the last installment of a 3-year, $104 million commitment. However, \nonly a steady, major stream of funding will help WMATA make the \ninvestments needed to reassure the commuters, locals, tourists, \nfamilies, and all Americans who ride Metro that the system is as safe \nand reliable as it can possibly be. I find it unacceptable that the \ntransit system in our Nation's Capital does not have enough resources \nto improve safety and upgrade its aging infrastructure. While we may \nnot know the cause of Monday's tragic collision for some time, it \nshined a spotlight on the dire need for improvements and upgrades to \nthe Metrorail's infrastructure.\n  Again, on behalf of all our colleagues, I extend our deepest \nsympathies to all those affected by this horrific accident, in \nparticular the families and loved ones of those who were killed. I hope \nmy colleagues will join together, working with the Virginia Senators \nand Maryland Senators, to ensure that this body does everything it can \nto make sure a similar tragedy is never repeated.\n\n\n                        Hate Crimes Legislation\n\n  Madam President, I next wish to talk about the urgent need to pass \nthe Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009. We passed this \n2 years ago, and unfortunately we were unable to reconcile it with the \nother body.\n  In the last 2 years, we have had constant reminders of the need to \npass this legislation. Just this past June 15, Steven Johns, a security \nguard at the U.S. Holocaust Museum, lost his life to a person who was \nderanged but who also was acting under hate. On February 12, 2008, \nLawrence King, a 15-year-old student, lost his life because he was gay. \nOn election night, we saw two men go on a killing spree against African \nAmericans because America elected its first African-American President. \nIn July of last year, four teenagers killed a Mexican immigrant and \nused racial slurs, making it clear it was a hate crime. In 2007, there \nwere 7,600 reported hate crimes in America--150 in my own State of \nMaryland. So we need to do something about this. The trends have not \nbeen positive. They have been negative. Crimes against Latinos, based \nupon hate, have increased steadily since 2003. In 2007, we saw the \nhighest number of hate crimes against lesbians, gays, bisexual and \ntransgendered, up 6 percent from the year before. The number of \nsupremacist groups in America has increased dramatically. There has \nbeen an increase in anti-Semitism between 2006 and 2007. The list goes \non and on.\n  My point is this: We are seeing a troubling trend in America, with \nincreased violence caused by hate-type activities. We need to act. The \nFederal Government needs to act. The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act of 2009 will do just that. It expands the current hate \ncrimes legislation we have on the Federal books so that it covers not \njust protected Federal activities but all activities in which a hate \ncrime is perpetrated, and it extends the protections against hate \ncrimes generated by gender, disability, gender identity, and sexual \norientation. It will supplement what the States are doing. Many States \nare aggressively pursuing these matters. In fact, 45 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia have passed their own hate crimes statute, and 31 \ninclude sexual orientation as a protected right.\n  The reason we need the Federal law is that the Federal Government has \nthe resources and the capacity to respond when many times the States \ncannot. And I want to make it clear that this bill fully protects first \namendment rights. This protection is against violent acts, not against \nspeech. Hate crimes not only affect the victim, but they affect the \nentire community. It is time for us to act, and I hope we will soon \npass the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Lastly, I wish to talk about health care reform. There has been a lot \nof debate in this body, a lot of conversation about health care reform \nand what we need to do. I hope the only option that is not on the table \nis the status quo. We cannot allow the current system to continue.\n\n[[Page S6970]]\n\n  I say that for several reasons. First is the matter of cost. The \nNation cannot afford the health care system we have now. Last year, the \nNation's health care costs totaled $7,400 for every man, woman, and \nchild in this country, for a total of $2.4 trillion. We spent 15 \npercent of our gross domestic product on health care in 2006--the \nhighest country by far. Switzerland, which is No. 2, spends 11 percent, \nand the average of the OECD nations is 8\\1/2\\ percent. We spend \napproximately twice as much as the industrial nations of the world \nspend on health care. And we don't have the results to warrant this \ntype of expenditure. Of the 191 countries ranked by the World Health \nOrganization, we are ranked 37th on overall health systems \nperformance--behind France, Canada, and Chile, just to mention a few. \nWe rank 24th on health life expectancies, and we ranked No. 1, by far, \non health care expenditures. Between 2000 and 2007, the median earnings \nof Maryland workers increased 21 percent. Yet health insurance premiums \nfor Maryland families rose three times faster than the median earnings \nin that same time period.\n  So we can't afford the cost of health care in America. It is \ncrippling our economy, and our budgets are not sustainable. We are \nhaving a hard time figuring out how we are going to bring down the \nFederal deficit. When we look at the projected numbers, if we don't get \nhealth care costs under control, it is going to be extremely difficult \nto figure out how to balance budgets in the future. We need to bring \ndown the cost of health care if America is going to be competitive in \nthis international competitive environment.\n  For all those reasons, we need to do it. Yet we know we have 46 \nmillion Americans--despite how much money we spend--who don't have \nhealth insurance, and that is 20 percent higher than 8 years ago. We \nare running in the wrong direction. In my State of Maryland, 760,000 \npeople do not have health insurance. Every day, people in Maryland and \naround the Nation are filing personal bankruptcy because they can't \nafford the health care bills they have. We have to do something about \nthis.\n  I wish to thank and congratulate President Obama for bringing forward \na reform that I hope will be embraced by this body. It certainly has \nbeen embraced by the American people. They understand it. We build on \nour current system. We want to maintain high quality. And I say that \ncoming from a State that is proud to be the home of Johns Hopkins \nUniversity and its great medical institution; the University of \nMaryland Medical Center, with its discoveries; and certainly NIH. This \nis a State--a nation--that is proud of its medical traditions of \nquality. We want to maintain choice. I want the constituents in \nMaryland and around the country to not only choose their doctor and \ntheir hospital but to choose the health care plans they can participate \nin, and we certainly want to make sure this is affordable. So for all \nthose reasons, we want to build on the current system.\n  Let me talk about one point that has gotten a lot of attention, and \nthat is whether we should have a public option. I certainly hope we \nhave a robust public insurance option, and I say that for many reasons. \nPublic insurance has worked in our system. Just look at Medicare. If \nthe Federal Government did not move for Medicare, our seniors would not \nhave had affordable health care coverage, our disabled population would \nnot have had affordable health care coverage. I don't know of a single \nMember of this body who is suggesting that we repeal Medicare, and that \nis a public insurance option.\n  A public insurance option does not have the government interfering \nwith your selection of a doctor. The doctors and hospitals are private. \nWe are talking about how we collect pay for these bills. And Medicare \nhas worked very well, as has TRICARE for our military community. So we \nwant to build on that experience.\n  The main reason we want a public insurance option is to keep down \ncost. That is our main reason. We know Medicare Advantage is a private \ninsurance option within Medicare. I am for a private insurance option \nin Medicare, but I oppose costing the taxpayers more money because of \nthat. We know Medicare Advantage costs between 12 to 17 percent more \nfor every senior who enrolls in the private insurance option. The CBO--\nCongressional Budget Office--tells us that cost is $150 billion over 10 \nyears. So this is a cost issue.\n  I remember taking the floor in the other body when we were talking \nabout Medicare Part D, the prescription drug part of the Medicare \nsystem. I urged a public insurance option at that time, on the same \nlevel playing field as private insurance so that we could try to keep \nthe private insurance companies honest and have fair competition. We \ndidn't do that. As a result, the Medicare Part D Program is costing the \ntaxpayers more than it should.\n\n  So my main reason for saying we need to have a public insurance \noption is to keep costs down, but it also provides a guaranteed \nreliable product for that individual who is trying to find an \naffordable insurance option, for that small business owner who today \nfinds it extremely difficult to find an affordable, reliable product \navailable in the private insurance marketplace. Maybe the private \ninsurance marketplace will be up to the challenge with 46, 47 million \nmore people applying for insurance in America. I want to make sure they \nare. And having a public insurance option puts us on a level playing \nfield and allows the freedom of choice for the consumer as to what \ninsurance product they want to buy and the freedom of choice to choose \nan insurance product that allows them to choose their own private \ndoctor and hospital.\n  There are plenty of positive proposals, and I congratulate the \nleadership on the Finance Committee and on the HELP Committee for the \nmanner in which they are working to bring down health care costs--first \nby universal coverage. Universal coverage will bring down health care \ncosts. We know that someone who has no health care insurance uses the \nemergency room. It costs us a lot of money to use the emergency room. \nWe want to get care out to the community, and with universal coverage \nit will bring down costs.\n  Preventive health care saves money. It saves money and it saves \nlives. It provides better, healthier lives for individuals, but it also \nsaves money. We know that providing a test for a person for early \ndetection of a disease costs literally a couple hundred dollars \ncompared to the surgery that might be avoided which costs tens of \nthousands of dollars. So this is about cost, about saving lives, and \nabout a better quality of life with preventive health care. I \ncongratulate the committees for really coming together on this issue.\n  Also, the better use of health information technology will not only \nsave us money in the administrative aspect of health care but actually \nin the delivery of care. If we know about a person and we can \ncoordinate that person's care, we can bring down the cost of care and \nprevent medical errors.\n  For all those reasons, I strongly concur in what our committees are \ndoing currently to reform our health care system to bring down costs.\n  One last point is the need for us to work together. I do reach out to \nevery Member of this body to say: Look, I don't know of anyone who says \nour system is what it should be. Everyone agrees we are spending too \nmuch money. I haven't talked to a single Senator who believes we can't \ncut the cost of health care. We have to bring down the cost of health \ncare. I think all of us agree we have to do a better job in preventive \ncare and we have to do a better job of having an affordable product for \nthose who don't have health insurance today. We all agree on that.\n  Let's listen to each other and work together. This is not a \nDemocratic problem or a Republican problem. It cries out for Democrats \nand Republicans to work together to solve one of the most difficult \nproblems facing our Nation. I congratulate President Obama for being \nwilling to tackle this problem, and I urge all colleagues to join in \nthis debate so, at the end of the day, we can pass reform that will \ntruly bring down the cost of health care to America, be able to say \nAmerica still leads the world in medical technology, and allows that \ncare to be available to all the people of our country.\n  That is our goal. We can achieve it working together, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in achieving that goal.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6971]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor nomination\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the individual right to keep and bear \narms--I think a fundamental right guaranteed by the explicit text of \nthe second amendment of the U.S. Constitution--is at risk today in ways \na lot of people have not thought about.\n  Although the Supreme Court recently held that the second amendment is \nan individual right, which is a very important rule, many significant \nissues remain unresolved, which most people have not thought about.\n  The Supreme Court, including whoever will be confirmed to replace \nJustice Souter, will have to decide whether the second amendment has \nany real force or whether, as a practical matter, to allow it to \neviscerate its guarantees.\n  The second amendment says that ``the right of the people to keep and \nbear Arms, shall not be infringed.'' ``[T]he right of the people to \nkeep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'' I know there is a \npreamble about a well-regulated militia being important to the security \nof the State, but the Supreme Court has ruled on that in Heller and \nsaid that does not obviate the plain language that the right to keep \nand bear arms is a right that individual Americans have, at least vis-\na-vis the U.S. Government.\n  Not all the amendments, I would say, are so clearly a personal right. \nThe first amendment, if you will recall, protects freedom of religion \nand freedom of speech. It talks about restricting Congress: Congress \nshall make no law with respect to the establishment of a religion or \nprohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n  So some could argue that does not apply to the States. It would apply \nonly to the Federal Government because it explicitly referred to it. \nHowever, the Supreme Court has held it does apply to the States, and \nthe right of speech and press and religion are applicable to the States \nand bind the States as well.\n  In the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court \nrecently held that the second amendment ``confer[s] an individual right \nto keep and bear arms.'' This is consistent with the Constitution and \nwas a welcome and long-overdue holding.\n  Despite this holding, however, many important questions remain. For \nexample, it is still unsettled whether the second amendment applies \nonly to the Federal Government or to the State and local governments as \nwell--a pretty big question. This question will determine whether \nindividual Americans will truly have the right to keep and bear arms \nbecause if that is not held in that way, it would allow State and local \ngovernments--not bound by the second amendment--to pass all sorts of \nrestrictions on firearms use and ownership. They may even ban the \nownership of guns altogether.\n  So we are talking about a very important issue. Remember, the \nDistrict of Columbia basically banned firearms. It is a Federal \nenclave, in effect, with Federal law. And the Supreme Court held that \nthe Federal Government could not violate the second amendment, was \nbound by the second amendment, and that legislation went too far. But \nthey, in a footnote, noted they did not decide whether it applies to \nthe States, cities, and counties that could also pass restrictions \nsimilar to the District of Columbia.\n  President Obama, who nominated Judge Sotomayor, has a rather limited \nview of what the second amendment guarantees.\n  In 2008, he said that just because you have an individual right does \nnot mean the State or local government cannot constrain the exercise of \nthat right--exactly the issues the Supreme Court has not resolved yet. \nCan States and localities constrain the exercise of that right in any \nway they would like?\n  In 2000, as a State legislator, the President cosponsored a bill that \nwould limit the purchase of handguns to one a month.\n  In 2001, he voted against allowing the people who are protected by \ndomestic violence protective orders--because they felt threatened--he \nvoted against legislation that would allow them to carry handguns for \ntheir protection.\n  So there is some uncertainty about his personal views.\n  Let's look at Judge Sotomayor, whom the President nominated, and her \nrecord on the second amendment. That record is fairly scant, but we do \nknow that Judge Sotomayor has twice said the second amendment does not \ngive you and me and the American people a fundamental right to keep and \nbear arms.\n  The opinions she has joined have provided a breathtakingly, I have to \nsay, short amount of analysis on such an important question to the U.S. \nConstitution. And the opinions she has written lack any real discussion \nof the importance of these issues, in an odd way.\n  Judge Sotomayor has gone from sort of A to Z without going through B, \nC, D, and so forth. For example, in her most recent opinion in January \nof this year--Maloney v. Cuomo--which asked whether the Supreme Court's \nprotection of the right to bear arms in DC--the Heller case--would \napply to the States, she spent only two pages to explain how she \nreached her conclusion. Her conclusion was that it did not.\n  The Seventh Circuit dealt with this same question and reached the \nsame conclusion, but they gave the issue the respect it deserved and \nhad eight pages discussing this issue, at a time when Judge Sotomayor \nonly spent about two pages on it and not very much discussion at all.\n  The Ninth Circuit reached a different opinion. They say the second \namendment does apply to individual Americans and does bar the cities of \nLos Angeles or New York or Philadelphia from barring all hand guns \nbecause you have an individual constitutional right to keep and bear \narms. So the Ninth Circuit disagreed, and they had 33 pages in \ndiscussing this important issue.\n  Further, in deciding that the second amendment applies to the people, \nthe majority in the Supreme Court dedicated, in Heller, 64 pages to \nthis important issue. Including dissents and concurrences on that \ndecision, the entire Court generated 157 pages of opinion. Judge \nSotomayor wrote only two pages in a very important case as important as \nHeller. Judge Sotomayor's lack of attention and analysis is troubling.\n  These truncated opinions also suggest a tendency to avoid or casually \ndismiss constitutional issues of exceptional importance. Other examples \nmight include the New Haven firefighters case, Ricci v. DeStefano, \nwhich is currently pending before the Supreme Court on review, and the \nfifth amendment case of Didden v. Village of Port Chester, which was \nrecently discussed in the New York Times. It dealt with condemnation of \na private individual's property. All those were serious constitutional \ncases. They had the most brief analysis by the court, which is odd.\n  I do not think it is right for us to demand that we know how a judge \nwill rule on a case in the Supreme Court. I am not going to ask her to \nmake any assurances about how she might rule. But I do think it will be \nfair and reasonable to ask her how she reached the conclusions she \nreached and perhaps why she spent so little time discussing cases of \nfundamental constitutional importance.\n  I am not the only one who has been troubled by the second amendment \njurisprudence of Judge Sotomayor. As I mentioned previously, the Ninth \nCircuit disagreed with her opinion and held that the second amendment \nis a fundamental right applicable to the States and localities.\n  Additionally, in a June 10 editorial, the Los Angeles Times--a \nliberal newspaper--disagreed with her view in Maloney as to whether the \nsecond amendment applies against States and localities.\n  Moreover, in a June 10 op-ed in the Washington Times, a leading \nacademic argued that the decision in Maloney was flawed.\n  So these are critical questions that will determine whether the \npeople of the United States have a fundamental right guaranteed by the \nConstitution to keep and bear arms. So I think it is important and it \nis more than reasonable for the Senators to analyze the opinions on \nthis question and to inquire as to how the judge reached her decisions \nand what principles she used in doing so.\n  I would say we are moving forward with this confirmation process. It \nis a\n\n[[Page S6972]]\n\ndifficult time for us in terms of time. There are now only eight \nlegislative days before the hearings start. There is a lot of work to \nbe done, a lot of records that have not yet been received. So our team \nand Senators are working very hard, and we will do our best to make \nsure we have the best hearings we have ever had for a Supreme Court \nnominee.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Hatch, in the Chamber, who is a fabulous \nconstitutional lawyer and former chairman of this Judiciary Committee. \nI was honored to work for him, serve under him, when he was our leader. \nI know whatever he says on these subjects is something the American \npeople need to listen to because he loves this country, he loves our \nConstitution, and he understands it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nUtah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his comments. He \nknows how deeply I respect him and how proud I am that he is the \nRepublican leader on the Judiciary Committee. He will do a terrific \njob, and has been doing a terrific job, ever since he took over.\n  Considering a Supreme Court nominee is one of this body's most \nimportant responsibilities. I come at this wanting to support whomever \nthe President nominates. The President has the right to nominate and \nappoint, and we have a right, it seems to me, to vote up or down one \nway or the other and determine whether we will consent to the \nnomination. We can also give advice during this time.\n  Only 110 men and women have so far served on our Nation's highest \nCourt, and President Obama has now nominated Judge Sonia Sotomayor to \nreplace Justice David Souter. Our constitutional rule of advise and \nconsent requires us to determine whether she is qualified for this \nposition by looking at her experience and, more importantly, her \njudicial philosophy.\n  President Obama has already described his understanding of the power \nand role of judges in our system of government. He has said he will \nappoint judges who have empathy for certain groups and that personal \nempathy is an essential ingredient for making judicial decisions. Right \noff the bat, President Obama's vision of judges deciding cases based on \ntheir personal feelings and priorities is at odds with what most \nAmericans believe. A recent national poll found that by more than three \nto one, Americans reject the notion that judges may go beyond the law \nas written and take their personal views and feelings into account.\n  Judge Sotomayor appears to have endorsed this subjective view of \njudging. In one speech she gave several times over nearly a decade, she \nendorsed the view that there is actually no objectivity or neutrality \nin judging, but merely a series of perspectives. She questioned whether \njudges should even try to set aside their personal sympathies and \nprejudices in deciding cases, a view that seems in conflict with the \noath of judicial office which instead requires impartiality.\n  We must examine Judge Sotomayor's entire record for clues about her \njudicial philosophy. She was, after all, a Federal district court judge \nfor 6 years and has been a Federal appeals court judge for nearly 11 \nmore. While we were told that this is the largest Federal judicial \nrecord of any Supreme Court nominee in a century, we are being allowed \nthe shortest time in recent memory to consider it. The 48 days from the \nannouncement to the hearing for Judge Sotomayor is more than 3 weeks--\nmore than 30 percent--shorter than the time for considering Justice \nSamuel Alito's comparable judicial record. There was no legitimate \nreason for this stunted and rushed timetable, but that is what the \nmajority has imposed on us and that is where we are today.\n  I wish to take a few minutes this afternoon to look at Judge \nSotomayor's judicial record on a very important issue to me and, I \nthink, many others in this body: the right to keep and bear arms \nprotected by the second amendment to the Constitution.\n  Some can be quite selective about constitutional rights--prizing \nsome, while ignoring others. Some even trumpet rights that are not in \nthe Constitution at all as more important than those that are right \nthere on the page. It appears that Judge Sotomayor has taken a somewhat \ndim view of the second amendment. Two issues related to the scope and \nvitality of the right to keep and bear arms are whether it is a \nfundamental right and whether the amendment applies to the States as \nwell as to the Federal Government. On each of these issues, Judge \nSotomayor has chosen the side that served to limit, confine, and \nminimize the second amendment. She has done so without analysis, when \nit was unnecessary to decide the case before her, and even when it \nconflicted with Supreme Court precedent or her own arguments.\n  In a 2004 case, for example, a Second Circuit panel including Judge \nSotomayor issued a short summary order affirming an illegal alien's \nconviction for drug distribution and possession of a firearm. The case \nsummary and headnotes supplied by Lexis take up more space than the \nthree short paragraphs proffered by the court. Judge Sotomayor's court \nrejected a second amendment challenge to New York's ban on gun \npossession in a single sentence relegated to a footnote with no \ndiscussion, let alone any analysis of the issue whatsoever. In fact, \nthe court neither described the appellant's argument nor indicated how \nthe district court had addressed this constitutional issue, but merely \ncited a Second Circuit precedent for the proposition that the right to \npossess a gun is ``clearly not a fundamental right.''\n  That is pretty short shrift for a constitutional claim. Last year, in \nthe District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court held that the \nsecond amendment right to keep and bear arms is an individual rather \nthan a collective right. But the Court also noted that by the time of \nAmerica's founding, the right to have arms was indeed fundamental, and \nthat the second amendment codified this preexisting fundamental right. \nSeveral months later, a Second Circuit panel including Judge Sotomayor \naffirmed a conviction under State law for possessing a weapon. Citing a \n1886 Supreme Court precedent, the Second Circuit held that under the \nConstitution's privileges and immunities clause, the second amendment \napplies only to the Federal Government, not to the States. Whether \ncorrect or not, that holding was obviously enough to decide the issue \nin that particular case. Judge Sotomayor's court, however, went beyond \nwhat was necessary to further minimize the second amendment by once \nagain characterizing it as something less than a fundamental right. The \ncourt said that there need be only a so-called rational basis to \njustify a law banning such weapons, a legal standard it said applies \nwhere there is no fundamental right involved. The court simply ignored \nand actually contradicted the Supreme Court's decision in Heller by \ntreating the second amendment as protecting less than a fundamental \nright. In fact, the very 1886 precedent Judge Sotomayor's court cited \nto hold that the second amendment limits only the Federal Government \nrecognized the preconstitutional nature of the right to bear arms. Her \ncourt never addressed these contradictions.\n  The Seventh Circuit has since also held that under the privileges and \nimmunities clause, the second amendment limits only the Federal \nGovernment. But the Ninth Circuit last month held that under the \nConstitution's due process clause, the second amendment does indeed \napply to the States. These courts gave this issue much more analysis \nthan did Judge Sotomayor's court and neither found it necessary to \naddress whether the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental. I wish \nJudge Sotomayor's court had shown similar restraint.\n  It appears that Judge Sotomayor has consistently and even \ngratuitously opted for the most limiting, the most minimizing view of \nthe second amendment. No matter how distasteful, this result would be \nlegitimate if it followed adequate analysis, if it properly applied \nprecedent, and if it was necessary to decide the cases before her. In \nthat event, it would not like it but probably could not quarrel with \nit. But as I have indicated here, this is not the case. There was \nvirtually no analysis, her conclusion conflicted with precedent, and \nwas unnecessary to decide the cases before her. This is not the picture \nof a restrained judge who has set aside personal views and is focusing \non applying the law rather than on\n\n[[Page S6973]]\n\nreaching politically correct results. These are serious and troubling \nissues which go to the very heart of the role judges play in our system \nof government. These are elements not from her speeches but from her \ncases that give shape to her judicial philosophy. We have a written \nConstitution which is supposed to limit government, including the \njudiciary. We have the separation of government power under which the \nlegislative branch may employ empathy to make the law, but the judicial \nbranch must impartially interpret and apply the law. We have a system \nof self-government in which the people and their elected \nrepresentatives make the law and define the culture. It is no wonder \nthat most Americans believe that judges must take the law as it is, not \nas judges would like it to be, and decide cases impartially. That is \nexactly what judges are supposed to do if our system of ordered liberty \nbased on the rule of law is to survive.\n  President George Washington said that the right to keep and bear arms \nis ``the most effectual means of preserving peace.''\n  Justice Joseph Story, in his legendary commentaries on the \nConstitution, called this right the ``palladium of the liberties of a \nrepublic.''\n  I, for one, am glad that our Founders did not give short shrift to \nthis fundamental individual right.\n  Let me close my remarks this afternoon by saying that these are some \nof the questions that need answers, issues that need clarification, and \nconcerns that need to be satisfied as the Senate examines Judge \nSotomayor's record. Perhaps such answers, clarification, and \nsatisfaction exist. My mind is open, and I look forward to the hearing \nin which these and many other matters no doubt will be raised. These \nare important issues that can't be shunted aside as though they are \nunimportant, and Judge Sotomayor needs to answer some of these issues \nand questions that we are raising as we go along.\n  I told her that we will ask some very tough questions and that she is \ngoing to have to answer them. She understands that, and I appreciate \nthat.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to follow up on some of the \ncomments made by my colleagues who had come to the floor to talk about \nthe nomination of Judge Sotomayor to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n  Any confirmation the Senate considers is important but none more so \nthan a lifetime appointment to the most distinguished judicial office \nin our Nation.\n  Now that the President has nominated Judge Sotomayor, it is the \nSenate's job to give advice and consent. As Alexander Hamilton told the \nConstitutional Convention:\n\n       Senators cannot themselves choose--they can only ratify or \n     reject the choice of the President.\n\n  I take this role very seriously, as do all of my Senate colleagues. \nIn fact, just 3\\1/2\\ years ago, on this very floor, one of our \ncolleagues in the Senate at the time rose and gave the following views \non a then-pending Supreme Court nomination. I will quote for you what \nhe said:\n\n       There are some who believe that the President, having won \n     the election, should have complete authority to appoint his \n     nominee and the Senate should only examine whether the \n     Justice is intellectually capable and an all-around good \n     person; that once you get beyond intellect and personal \n     character, there should be no further question as to whether \n     the judge should be confirmed. I disagree with this view. I \n     believe firmly that the Constitution calls for the Senate to \n     advise and consent. I believe it calls for meaningful advice \n     and consent and that includes an examination of the judge's \n     philosophy, ideology, and record.\n\n  The Senator who made those remarks was then-Senator Obama. He spoke \nthose words in January 2006 on this floor when the Senate was debating \nthe confirmation of now-Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito.\n  I, like the President, believe it is the Senate's constitutional duty \nto thoroughly review all nominees to the Federal bench, especially \nthose who will have a lifetime appointment to the highest Court in our \nNation. This review should be thorough and fair and cover a nominee's \nbackground, judicial record, and adherence to the Constitution. This is \nespecially true with the voluminous judicial record Judge Sotomayor has \ncompiled, with over 3,600 Federal district and appellate level \ndecisions. The Senate must also work to ensure that the nominee will \ndecide cases based upon the bedrock rule of law as opposed to their own \npersonal feelings and political views.\n  As part of this confirmation process, I had the opportunity this \nmorning to meet with Judge Sotomayor. Like many in this body, I agree \nthat she has an impressive background, as well as a compelling personal \nstory. But what we have to do is examine and look at her record when it \ncomes to her understanding of the Constitution, especially as it \nrelates to the second amendment right to bear arms, and that is an area \nwhere I have significant concerns.\n  While sitting on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Sotomayor \nconsistently advanced a narrow view of the second amendment and did so \nwith little explanation or reasoning. For example, twice, Judge \nSotomayor has ruled that the second amendment is not a ``fundamental \nright.'' The first time she did so with a one-sentence footnote, and \nmost recently it was simply stated as fact without any explanation or \nreasoning being provided. Judge Sotomayor's views on whether the second \namendment right to bear arms is a fundamental right are so important \nbecause the Supreme Court has made this determination a key element in \ndeciding whether to apply parts of the Bill of Rights, such as the \nsecond amendment, to State and local governments.\n  This question, also known as incorporation, is likely to be the next \nsecond amendment issue the Supreme Court will consider because the \ncircuit courts of appeal are split, and the Supreme Court specifically \nnoted that they were not deciding this issue in the landmark District \nof Columbia v. Heller decision, which was decided last year.\n  What is most troubling to me, though, is that these second amendment \ncases point out a disturbing trend that legal experts have expressed \nabout Judge Sotomayor: That she has a record of avoiding or casually \ndismissing difficult and important constitutional issues. It doesn't \ntake an attorney to notice that Judge Sotomayor's discussion of \nincorporation, a challenging and constitutionally significant issue, \nconsists of just a few paragraphs. In contrast, the opinions for both \nthe Ninth Circuit and the Seventh Circuit discuss the issue at length \nand, in doing so, give this important issue the attention and analysis \nit deserves. While I understand that writing styles can and do vary, \neven in the writing of judicial opinions, I am still concerned about \nthe apparent lack of thoughtfulness and thorough reasoning in her \ndecisions.\n  Another example of a Judge Sotomayor opinion that appears to be \nunnecessarily short and inadequately reasoned is the Ricci v. DeStefano \ncase, or more popularly known as the New Haven firefighter promotion \ncase. In this case, a three-judge panel, which included Judge \nSotomayor, published an unusually short and unsigned opinion that \nsimply adopted the lower district court's ruling without adding any \noriginal analysis. Even one of Judge Sotomayor's own mentors, Judge \nJose Cabranes, commented that the Ricci opinion ``contains no reference \nwhatsoever to the constitutional claims at the core of this case'' and \nthat the ``perfunctory disposition [of the case] rests uneasily with \nthe weighty issues presented by this appeal.'' Without careful \nreasoning being provided, critics and supporters alike have been left \nto wonder on what basis these decisions have been made. I am left with \nconcerns about these rulings and whether they are based upon personal \nviews and feelings rather than the rule of law.\n  My short meeting with Judge Sotomayor this morning did not provide \neither of us with enough time to address these issues and these \nconcerns at length, and that is why, like many colleagues, I will be \nmonitoring closely the confirmation hearings that are set to occur next \nmonth. During those hearings, it is my hope that the members of the \nJudiciary Committee will take the necessary time to explore and \nthoroughly examine her positions and legal reasoning, especially on the \nsecond amendment, in greater detail.\n  I, like many of my colleagues, am anxious to see this process move \nforward. We also understand the weight that is attached to the \nconstitutional role of the Senate when it comes to advice and consent. \nWhen you consider a\n\n[[Page S6974]]\n\nlifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land, you better make \nsure that you do your homework and that you thoroughly and completely \nand fairly examine the record.\n  I hope the Judiciary Committee--and I know they will--will conduct \nthis in a way which is consistent with the tone that ought to be a part \nof this. It ought to be a civil discussion. It also needs to be \nthorough because we are talking about a lifetime appointment to the \nSupreme Court. Whoever ends up on that Court will be faced with a great \nmany issues, all of which have lasting consequences for this great \nRepublic.\n  In my view, it is important that we have judges who are put on the \nSupreme Court who understand that the role of the judiciary in our \ndemocracy is not to play or take sides; it is to be the referee, the \numpire, to be someone who applies the Constitution, the laws of the \nland, fairly to the facts in front of them in the cases they will hear. \nI certainly hope that, as we have an opportunity to more thoroughly \nreview the record of this nominee, the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee and all of the Members of the Senate will take that \nresponsibility very seriously. That will be the criteria and the filter \nby which I look at this nominee--whether or not, in my view, she \nexercises an appropriate level of judicial restraint and doesn't view \nthe role of a judge in our judiciary system in this country to be that \nof an activist, someone who expresses personal feelings or tries to \nadvance a particular political agenda, but someone who, in terms of \nphilosophy and temperament, is committed to that fundamental principle \nof judicial restraint, which is a hallmark of our democracy and has \nbeen for well over 200 years.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I didn't have an opportunity to address the \nKoh nomination this morning. We had a cloture vote on the nomination of \nHarold Koh to be the next State Department Legal Adviser. I wish to \nexpress some of the views and concerns I have. Obviously, cloture was \ninvoked this morning, and my guess is that he will ultimately be \nconfirmed. We have an opportunity in a postcloture period to talk a \nlittle bit about this nominee.\n  I have to say this is an important position. If confirmed, Mr. Koh \nwould be the top lawyer at the State Department and would be involved \nin the negotiation, the drafting, and the interpretation of treaties \nand U.N. Security Council resolutions. He would also represent the \nUnited States in other international negotiations, at international \norganizations, and before the International Court of Justice. To put it \nsimply, he would be viewed as the top legal authority for the United \nStates by the international community.\n  Similar to Judge Sotomayor, Mr. Koh highlights an alarming trend \nwhich I think we see in some of President Obama's nominees. They have \nimpressive backgrounds, but when their records are examined in detail, \nthere are substantive questions about their understanding of the \nConstitution. For example, Mr. Koh has said repeatedly, including at \nhis confirmation hearing, that he believes the congressionally \nauthorized 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq ``violated international law'' \nbecause the United States had not received ``explicit United Nations \nauthorization'' beforehand. He also said that the U.S. Supreme Court \nshould ``tip more decisively toward a transnationalist jurisprudence'' \nas opposed to basing decisions on the U.S. Constitution and laws made \npursuant to it.\n  His views on the second amendment are also extremely worrisome. In a \nspeech called ``A World Drowning in Guns,'' which was given at Fordham \nUniversity Law School in 2002 and later published in the Law Review, he \nexplains why he believed there should be a global gun control regime \nand admits that ``we are a long way from persuading government to \naccept a flat ban on the trade of legal arms.''\n  He concludes his speech with this statement:\n\n       When I left the government several years ago, my major \n     feeling was of too much work left undone. I wrote for myself \n     a list of issues on which I needed to do more. One of those \n     issues was the global regulation of small arms.\n\n  Given, again, that Mr. Koh will be the top legal adviser at the State \nDepartment on both domestic and international issues, I have concerns, \nbecause of statements such as these, that he could place his own \npersonal agenda ahead of the needs of our country and the Constitution.\n  So we will have an opportunity probably--we have had the cloture vote \non the nomination, but I wanted to express for the record my concerns \nabout this nominee and the types of statements he has made in the past, \nthe type of agenda he has expressed support for, and how, in my view, \nit contradicts many of the basic constitutional freedoms and rights--\nthe second amendment being one--that I would raise as a major concern \nbut also this notion that transnational jurisprudence--that the Supreme \nCourt ought to tip more decisively in that direction. That is a cause \nfor great concern.\n  I hope that on final disposition of this nominee, the Senate will \nvote to reject this nomination. It is, in my view, dangerous to the \nnational security interests of the United States and some of our basic \nconstitutional freedoms when he rules in the way he has in the past and \ncontinues to issue statements that, in my view, are very troublesome. I \nwill be opposing this nomination, and I hope my colleagues will as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding we are postcloture, speaking on \nthe nomination of Harold Koh to be Legal Adviser for the Department of \nState; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier today the Senate voted to invoke \ncloture and move forward with this nomination. Sixty-five Senators \nrecognized the extraordinary qualifications that Mr. Koh will bring to \nthe State Department. Yet in the last few weeks, some Senators on the \nother side of the aisle have done everything they can to slow down the \nwork of the Senate, even going so far as to delay the consideration of \na bill to promote tourism in America. That is a noncontroversial bill \nwith 11 Republican cosponsors but a bill that could only get two \nRepublican Senators to support it when we asked to move it forward.\n  Unfortunately, the same thing is happening with the nomination of Mr. \nKoh. This is a nomination which is not controversial for most Members \nof the Senate--65 supported going forward. Yet the Republicans are \ninsisting, as they have the right to do under Senate rules, that we \ndelay for maybe up to 30 hours before we actually get to the vote. If \nwe are going to waste that much time on a noncontroversial nomination \nfor a person to become Legal Adviser to the State Department, the \npeople of this country have a right to ask what is the goal of the \nRepublicans in doing this?\n  There is a lot we need to do in the Senate. There is a lot the \nAmerican people are counting on us to do, measures we should be \nconsidering. I have a bipartisan measure on food safety. I have been \nworking on this for over 10 years. There is not a week that goes by \nthat there is not some new press report about something dangerous: pet \nfood, cookie dough--you name it. All of these things have been in the \nheadlines over the last several years, and we can do a better job \nmaking sure the items we purchase at our local stores for our families, \nfor our pets, are safe; making sure the things we import from other \ncountries are safe. But we cannot even get to that measure because \nthere is a strategy on the Republican side of the aisle to stop us, to \ndelay as much as possible to try to make sure the Senate does as little \nas possible.\n\n[[Page S6975]]\n\n  In the last election, the people of this country said: We think it is \ntime for change in this town of Washington. We are sick and tired of \nthis partisan bickering and this waste of time and Democrats banging \nheads with Republicans. Why don't you all just roll up your sleeves and \nbe Americans for a change and try to solve the problems? You may not \nget it completely right, but do your best and work at it. Spend some \ntime on it.\n  Look at what we have, an empty Chamber. This Senate Chamber should be \nfilled with debate on critical issues, but it is not because, \nunfortunately, this is a procedural strategy on the other side of the \naisle which is slowing us down.\n  This man whose nomination is before us should have just skated \nthrough here. This is an extraordinarily talented man. Mr. Harold Koh \nhas a long and distinguished history of serving his country and the \nlegal profession. During the Reagan administration, a Republican \nPresident's administration, he was a career lawyer in the Office of \nLegal Counsel at the Department of Justice; in 1998, unanimously \nconfirmed as the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human \nRights and Labor, a bureau in the State Department that champions many \nof our country's most cherished values around the world.\n  Mr. Koh's academic credentials are amazing--a Marshall Scholar at \nOxford, graduate of Harvard Law School, editor of the Harvard Law \nReview, and he went on to be a clerk at the Supreme Court across the \nstreet, which is about as good as it gets coming out of law school.\n  Since the year 2004, Harold Koh has served as dean of the Yale Law \nSchool. Mr. Koh was a Marshall Scholar at Oxford. He has been awarded \n11 honorary degrees and 30 human rights awards.\n  I don't know that you could present a stronger resume for a man who \nwants to serve our country, to be involved in public service and step \nout of his professional life as a lawyer in the private sector, with \nlaw schools. He has been endorsed by leaders, legal scholars from both \npolitical parties, including the former Solicitor General, Ted \nOlson, former Independent Counsel Ken Starr, former Bush Chief of Staff \nJosh Bolton, seven former Department of State Legal Advisers, including \nthree Republicans, more than 100 law school deans, and 600 law school \nprofessors from around the country. What more do we ask for someone who \nwants to serve this country?\n\n  Several retired high-ranking military lawyers have written: If the \nU.S. follows Koh's advice, as State Department Legal Adviser:\n  [It] will once again be the shining example of a Nation committed to \nadvancing human rights that we want other countries to emulate.\n  Here is an excerpt from a recent letter for support Ken Starr sent to \nSenators Kerry and Lugar. I have had my differences with Ken Starr. \nPolitically we are kind of on opposite sides. Here is what he said of \nDean Koh, who is being considered by this empty Senate Chamber as we \nburn off 30 hours. He wrote:\n\n       My recommendation for Harold comes from a deep, and long-\n     standing, first-hand knowledge. We have been vigorous \n     adversaries in litigation. We embrace different perspectives \n     about a variety of different substantive issues. As citizens, \n     we no doubt vote quite differently. But based on my two \n     decades of interaction with Harold, I am firmly convinced \n     that Harold is extraordinarily well qualified, to serve with \n     great distinction in the post of legal adviser. . . . \n     Harold's background is, of course, the very essence of the \n     American dream. . . . Harold embraces, deeply, a vision of \n     the goodness of America, and the ideals of a nation, ruled, \n     abidingly, by law.\n\n  There is overwhelmingly bipartisan support for Harold Koh. Usually \nthese nominations are done routinely late at night when there are few \npeople on the floor, and when we are going through a long series of \nthings to do. Someone with this kind of background does not even slow \ndown as they move through the Senate on to public service.\n  But, unfortunately, the strategy on the other side of the aisle is to \nslow things down, do as little as possible this week. I sincerely hope \nthat when the time comes, when the 30 hours have run, when the \nRepublicans have finally decided they do not want to delay the Senate \nany longer, they will bring Mr. Koh's nomination to a vote.\n  I enthusiastically support his nomination and encourage my colleagues \nto join me in voting him out of the Senate quickly so he can continue \nhis record of public service.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. President, you are well aware from your State of Oregon and from \nmy State of Illinois how much this health care reform debate means to \neverybody we represent. When you ask the American people what we can do \nabout health insurance, 94 percent of people across America \noverwhelmingly support change in our current health care system. Some \n85 percent of the people across this country, Democrats, Republicans, \nand Independents, say that the health care system needs to be \nfundamentally changed.\n  This is the time to do it. This is the President to lead us in doing \nit. We had better seize this moment. If we do not, if we miss it, we \nmay never have another chance for years and years to come. That is \nunfortunate.\n  Democrats want to build on what is good about the current system. It \nis interesting that so many people would say we should change the \nhealth care system, but about three out of four people say: I kind of \nlike my health insurance.\n  So what we have to do first is to say we are going to keep the things \nin the current system that work, and only fix those things that are \nbroken. If you have a health insurance plan that you like and you trust \nit is good for you and your family, you need to be able to keep it. We \nshould not be able to take it away from you. We do not want to. That is \nthe starting point. And then when we start to fix what is broken in the \nsystem, we address some issues that I think are really critical.\n  Health insurance companies today can deny you coverage because of an \nillness you might have had years ago, exclude coverage for what they \ncall preexisting conditions, which sadly we all know about, or charge \nyou vastly more because of your health status or your age.\n  We want to make sure that the end of the day, after health care \nreform, we keep the costs under control, make sure you have a choice of \nyour doctor, make certain you have privacy in dealing with your doctors \nso that the doctor-patient relationship is protected and confidential.\n  We want to protect quality in the system, to make certain we bring \nout the very best in medical care, and not reward those who are doing \nthings poorly. We believe we can do this on a bipartisan basis, with \nboth parties working together.\n  Some of the critics of this effort basically are in denial that we \nneed to change our health care system. I do not think they are taking \nthe time to look at it closely. Whether you talk to people, average \nfamilies, or small businesses, large corporations, you understand that \nthe cost of health care now is spinning out of control, and if we do \nnot do something dramatic and significant about it, it will become \nunaffordable.\n  I had a group of people in my office who were in the communications \nindustry. They are union workers. They are worried because every year \nwhen they get more money per hour for working, it always goes to health \ninsurance. They learn each year there is less coverage: pay more, get \nless.\n  We have got to do something about containing the cost of a system \nthat is the most expensive health care system in the world. We spend, \non average, more than twice as much as the next country on Earth for \nhealth care for Americans. We have great hospitals and doctors. We have \namazing technology and pharmacies. But the bottom line is, other \ncountries get better results for fewer dollars.\n  So the first item we must address is bringing down the cost of health \ncare, stop it from going through the roof, so that families and \nbusinesses can afford it, and government can afford it as well.\n  The second thing we have to make sure we do is protect the choice of \nindividuals for their doctor and their hospital, their providers. There \nare limitations now. In my home town of Springfield, IL, my health \ninsurance plan tells me there is one preferred hospital of the two I \ncan choose, and I know if I do not go to that hospital, I can end up \nwith a bill I have to pay personally. So there are limitations under \nthe current system, and that is to be expected.\n\n[[Page S6976]]\n\nBut we want to limit those to as few as possible so people are able to \ncome forward and have the basic choice they want in physicians.\n  Then there is a question about how to keep the costs under control. \nIf we are going to build this new health care reform on private health \ninsurance, the obvious question is: Will there be a government health \ninsurance plan such as Medicare available as an option so you can look \nat all of the private health insurance plans you might buy, and also \nconsider the government health insurance plan, the public health \ninsurance plan, as an option?\n  This is controversial. Health insurance companies say, if we have to \ncompete with a government plan, they will always charge less and we \nwill not be able to compete. Others argue that if you do not have at \nleast one nonprofit entity offering health insurance, then basically \nthe private health insurance plans will continue to be too expensive; \nthey will not have the kind of competition they need to bring about \nreal savings.\n  Many people on the other side of the aisle have come to the floor and \ncriticized the idea of a public interest health insurance plan. They \nargue it is government insurance, government health care. But most \nAmericans know that government health care is not a scary thing in and \nof itself. There are 40 million Americans under Medicare. That is a \ngovernment health care program. Millions of Americans are protected by \nMedicaid for lower income people in our country. That has a government \ncomponent too.\n  Our veterans come back from war and go to the Veterans' \nAdministration, a government health program. I have not heard a single \nRepublican come to the floor and say: We need to eliminate Medicare, \neliminate Medicaid, close the VA hospitals, because it is all \ngovernment health care. No. For most people being served by these \nprograms, they believe they are godsends and they do not want to lose \nthem.\n  Yesterday, the minority leader, the Republican Senator from Kentucky, \ncame to the floor and talked about a future which is fictitious. He \nsaid: A government plan where care is denied, delayed, and rationed.\n\n  Those are fighting words, because no one wants their coverage denied, \nthey do not want to wait in a long line for surgery, and they do not \nwant to believe they are victims of rationing. It is important for them \nto have medical care given to them.\n  The language we hear from the other side of the aisle is language we \nare all too familiar with. The miracle of the Internet is that people \ncan come up with a written document now, and by pressing a button or \nclicking a mouse, they can send that document to lots of different \npeople.\n  A couple of months ago, a Republican strategist named Frank Luntz \nwrote a 28-page memo to give to Republican Senators on how to defeat \nhealth care. Dr. Luntz--he calls himself ``doctor''--Dr. Luntz said: \nWhatever they come up with, here is the way to beat it.\n  He had not seen the health care reform plan that President Obama \nmight support or the Democrats might produce. But he says: This is how \nwe stop them from passing anything, how we delay things, deny things. \nAnd he used those words. He said: We have got to use words that \nAmericans will identify with, buzzwords like ``deny,'' ``delay,'' \n``ration.'' And those are the words we hear every week now from the \nother side of the aisle.\n  The reason I mentioned the Internet is it turns out somebody punched \nthe wrong button on their computer, clicked the wrong mouse button, and \nthe next thing you know that memo spread across Washington. Everybody \nhas it.\n  So we have seen the play book. We kind of know the plays they are \nrunning. We know their speeches before they give them. But they still \ncome down and give these speeches over and over again.\n  I guess the starting point is this: Some of my colleagues and friends \non the other side of the aisle want to keep the current health care \nsystem. They think it is fine. They do not want to change it. Well, I \ndo not join them, and most American people do not join them either.\n  There are winners in the current system. There are people making a \nlot of money under the current health care system. Health insurance \ncompanies were one of the few sectors in the economy last year, 2008, \nthat showed profitability when most American companies that were not \nhealth insurance companies were not profitable. So were oil companies, \nincidentally. But the health insurance companies that are making a lot \nof money do not want to see this system changed. It is a good, \nprofitable system for them. By and large, they want to keep it the way \nit is. There are some providers who are doing quite well under the \nsystem, some specialists are making a lot of money, some hospitals are \nmaking a lot of money. They want to keep it as it is.\n  But we know we cannot. It is unsustainable. It is too expensive for \nindividuals, families, and for businesses and for government, for us \nnot to get the cost under control.\n  The Republican resistance to change in health care reform is not \nsurprising. Last week we had a cloture vote and 30 hours of debate to \nproceed to the consideration of a bipartisan noncontroversial bill. We \nhave been through cloture votes and delays all of this week. We are in \nthe middle of one right now. That is why those who are visiting the \nCapitol are wondering where all of the Senators are. This is a \nsituation where the Republicans have decided they are going to force us \nto wait 30 hours before we do something, a waste of time that we cannot \nafford, and we have faced it before.\n  We have to understand that we need to have health care reform. The \nPresident is right that this opportunity comes around so rarely.\n  We have pretty good health insurance as Members of Congress. But I \nwant to make it clear for the record, we do not have ``special'' health \ninsurance. I have heard that argument being made. If you can get the \nsame health insurance the Senator has, you would be set for life. We \nhave great health insurance. But it is the same health insurance \navailable to all Federal employees, 2 million Federal employees; 8 \nmillion employees and their families. We have a Federal health benefits \nprogram. We have an open enrollment each year to pick, in my case, from \nnine different health insurance plans available to me in my home State \nof Illinois for my wife and myself. That is a luxury most people can \nonly dream of. All Federal employees have it, and so do Members of \nCongress, because we are considered Federal employees. But it is \nsomething most Americans do not have and we can make available to small \nand large businesses alike. It is important that we do this.\n  I hope we can get some support, some support from the other side of \nthe aisle. Today in America, while we are going about our business, \n14,000 Americans will wake up and realize something: Yesterday they had \nhealth insurance and today they do not. Every day in America, 14,000 \nAmericans lose their health insurance.\n  I cannot imagine what life is like without health insurance. There \nwas a time in my life when I did not have it. It was scary. I was a \nbrandnew married father, baby on the way, and no health insurance. It \nhappened. We made it through with a lot of bills that we took years to \npay off. That goes back a long time.\n  Currently, if you are without health insurance, you are one diagnosis \nor one accident away from being wiped out. So going after bringing the \ncost of health insurance down is our first priority, but the second is \nto make sure everybody has some basic form of health insurance.\n  We have to understand that those of us who have health insurance pay \nmore for our health insurance because some 47 million Americans do not \nhave it. They present themselves to the doctors and hospitals, and in \nthis caring Nation, we treat them and their bills are then absorbed by \na system that spreads them around for all of the rest of us to pay. It \nis about $1,000 a year. It is a hidden tax for families, $1,000 more \neach year on health insurance premiums to take care of the uninsured in \nour country.\n  So now we have a chance to bring the uninsured into coverage. By \nbringing them into coverage, we will not only give them peace of mind, \nmake them part of the system, we will reduce that $1,000 hidden tax \nevery family pays who has health insurance. So we have an opportunity \nto do something positive about health insurance.\n\n[[Page S6977]]\n\n  For those who are following this debate closely, they probably heard \nthis mentioned by others, but I want to make a point of it. There is an \nimportant article for people to read, and they can go online to find \nit. It is from the June 1st New Yorker magazine.\n  A man who is a surgeon in Boston, an Indian American, whose name is \nDr. Atul Gawande, wrote an article about health care in America today. \nI will not go into detail about what he found, but it is an eye opener \nbecause he went to one of the most expensive cities in America when it \ncomes to treating Medicare patients. It is McAllen, TX. He could not \nfigure out why in McAllen, TX, they were spending about $15,000 a year \nfor Medicare patients--dramatically more than other towns in Texas and \naround the country.\n  What he found, unfortunately, is that many of the doctors in that \ncity were treating elderly patients by running up their charges, by \nordering unnecessary tests, by ordering hospitalizations and things \nthat were not being ordered in other cities. The reason is, there was a \nfinancial incentive. The more tests, the more procedures, the more \nhospitalizations they can charge to Medicare, the more the doctor was \npaid.\n  Well, Dr. Gawande went down and met with the doctors and confronted \nthem with it. There was no other explanation. That was it.\n  Then he went to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN--a place I respect very \nmuch, a place that has treated my family and treated them well. He \nfound out the cost for treating Medicare patients in Rochester, MN, is \na fraction of what it is in McAllen, TX.\n  At the Mayo Clinic it is cheaper to treat a Medicare patient than it \nis in McAllen, TX. Why? Well, it turns out it is pretty basic. The \ndoctors who are on the staff of the Mayo Clinic are paid a salary. They \nare not paid by the patient or by the procedure. So their interest is \nnot in running up a big medical chart of tests. Their interest is \ngetting that patient well, and doing it effectively. They do it with \nfewer procedures and less money spent and better results at the end of \nthe day.\n  So now we have a choice in this health care debate: Do we want to \ncontinue the example of McAllen, TX, which is abusing the system, \ncharging too much, and not giving good health care results, or do we \nwant to move to a Mayo Clinic model, one that basically is much more \nefficient and effective, keeps people healthier, at lower cost? I hope \nthe answer is obvious. It is to me. I would like to see us move toward \nincentives such as the Mayo Clinic system.\n  The President spoke to the American Medical Association in Chicago \nlast week. It was a mixed review. They were very courteous to him. \nThere were a few people dissatisfied with his remarks, but it is a free \ncountry. We can expect that. Some of those doctors in that room \nunderstand it is time for change and some of them do not. Some of them \nthink change is going to be bad for them and bad for our country. But \nmost of us understand if we work together in good faith, \nconscientiously, we can change this health care system for the better, \nreduce its costs, preserve our choice of doctors and hospitals, make \ncertain quality is rewarded, and also make certain we cover those 46 or \n47 million uninsured Americans and come up with a health care system \nthat does not break the bank--not for families, not for businesses, and \nnot for governments in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor Nomination\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I will be joined on the floor today by \nsome of my fellow women Senators to talk about the President's nominee \nfor the Supreme Court. I will note that some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle came to the floor yesterday to, as one news \nreport described it, ``kick off their campaign against her.'' So we \nwanted to take this opportunity to get the facts out to correct any \nmisconceptions and to set the record straight.\n  The Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Judge Sotomayor will begin \non July 13, but my consideration of her will not begin then. I began \nconsidering her the day she was announced because, as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, I wish to learn as much as I can about President \nObama's choice to fill one of the most important jobs in our country.\n  Even though there are many questions that will be asked and many \nareas we will want to focus on, I wish to speak today about how Judge \nSotomayor appears to me based on my initial review. After meeting with \nher and learning about her, I am very positive about her nomination. \nJudge Sotomayor knows the Constitution, she knows the law, but she also \nknows America.\n  I know Americans have heard a lot about her background and long \ncareer as a judge. But it is very important for us to talk about what a \nsolid nominee she is because we have to keep in mind that there have \nbeen accusations and misstatements, many made by people outside of this \nChamber on TV and \n24/7 cable. There have been misstatements.\n  It came to me a few weeks ago when I was in the airport in the Twin \nCities in Minnesota. A guy came up to me on a tram in the airport and \nsaid: Hey, do you know how you are voting on that woman?\n  I said that I want to listen to her and see how she answers some of \nthe questions.\n  He said: I am worried.\n  I said: Why? She is actually pretty moderate.\n  He said: She is always putting her emotions in front of the law.\n  I said: Do you know that when she is on a panel with three judges--\nwhich they often do on the circuit court where she sits now, and they \nhave her and two other judges--95 percent of the time she comes to an \nagreement with the Republican-appointed judge on the panel? You must be \nthinking the same thing about those guys because you cannot just say \nthat about her.\n  That incident made me think we really need to set the record straight \nhere about the facts, that we should be ambassadors of truth and get \nout the truth about her record and the kind of judge we are looking for \non the U.S. Supreme Court. We need to make sure she gets the same \ncivil, fair treatment other nominees have been given.\n  Judge Sotomayor's story is a classic American story about what is \npossible in our country through hard work. She grew up, in her own \nwords, in modest and challenging circumstances and worked hard for \nevery single thing she got. Many of you know her story. Her dad died \nwhen she was 9 years old, and her mom supported her and her brother. \nHer mom was devoted to her children's education. In fact, her mom was \nso devoted to her and her brother's education that she actually saved \nevery penny she could so that she could buy Encyclopedia Britannica for \nher kids. I remember when I was growing up that the Encyclopedia \nBritannica had a hallowed place in the hallway. I now show my daughter, \nwho is 14, these encyclopedias from the 1960s, and she doesn't seem \nvery interested in them. They meant a lot to our family and also to \nJudge Sotomayor.\n  Judge Sotomayor graduated from Princeton summa cum laude and Phi Beta \nKappa, and she was one of two people to win the highest award Princeton \ngives to undergraduates. She went on to Yale Law School, which launched \nher three-decades-long career in the law. So when commentators have \nquestions about whether she is smart enough--you cannot make up Phi \nBeta Kappa. You cannot make up that you have these high awards. These \nare facts.\n  Since graduating, the judge has had a varied and interesting legal \ncareer. She has worked as a private sector civil litigator, she has \nbeen a district court and an appellate court judge, and she taught law \nschool.\n  The one experience of hers that particularly resonates for me is \nthat, immediately graduating from law school, she spent 5 years as a \nprosecutor at the Manhattan district attorney's office, which was one \nof the busiest and most well thought of prosecutor's offices in our \ncountry. At the time, it paid about half as much as a job in the \nprivate\n\n[[Page S6978]]\n\nsector, but she wanted the challenge and trial experience, she told me \nwhen we met, and she took the job as a prosecutor. Before I entered the \nSenate, I was a prosecutor. I managed an office of about 400 people in \nMinnesota, which was the biggest prosecutor's office in our State. So I \nwas very interested in this experience we had in common.\n  One of the things that I learned and that I quickly learned that she \nunderstood based on our discussions is that, as a prosecutor, the law \nis not just some dusty book in your basement. After you have interacted \nwith victims of crime, after you have seen the damage crime can do to a \ncommunity, the havoc it can wreak, after you have interacted with \ndefendants who are going to prison and you have seen their families \nsitting in the courtroom, you know the law is not just an abstract \nsubject; you see that the law has a real impact on real people.\n  As a prosecutor, you don't just have to know the law, you have to \nknow people, you have to know human nature. Sonia Sotomayor's former \nsupervisor said that she was an imposing and commanding figure in the \ncourtroom who would weave together a complex set of facts, enforce the \nlaw, and never lose sight of whom she was fighting for. Of course, she \nwas fighting for the people in those neighborhoods, the victims of \ncrime. Judge Sotomayor's experience as a prosecutor tells me she meets \none of my criteria for a Supreme Court nominee: She is someone who \ndeeply appreciates the power and impact that laws have and that the \ncriminal justice system has on real people's lives. From her first day \nat that Manhattan district attorney's office, Judge Sotomayor learned \nthat the law is not just an abstraction.\n  In addition to her work as a prosecutor, I have also learned a lot \nabout Judge Sotomayor from her long record as a judge. She has been a \njudge for 17 years--11 years as an appellate judge and 6 years as a \ntrial judge. President George H.W. Bush--the first President Bush--gave \nher the first job she had as a Federal judge. She was nominated by a \nRepublican President. The job was to be a district judge in the \nSouthern District of New York. Her nomination to the Southern District \nwas enthusiastically supported by both New York Senators, Democratic \nSenator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato.\n  If you watch TV or read newspapers or blogs, you know that Judge \nSotomayor has been called some names. It always happens in these \nSupreme Court nominations--the nominees are called names by talking \nheads on TV and on the radio. In most cases, these commentators may \nhave read a case or two of hers or, even worse, a speech and took a \nsentence or so out of context, and they have decided they are entitled \nto make a sweeping judgment about her judicial fitness based on a few \nwords taken out of context.\n  I think just about everything in a nominee's professional record is \nfair game to consider. After all, we are obligated to determine whether \nto confirm someone to an incredibly important position with lifetime \ntenure. That is a constitutional duty I take very seriously. But that \nsaid, when people get upset about a few items and a few speeches a \njudge has given, I have to wonder, do a few statements someone made in \npublic, for which they said they could have used different words, do \nthose trump 17 years of modest, reasoned, careful judicial \ndecisionmaking? I don't think so.\n  If we want to know what kind of a Justice she will be, isn't our best \nevidence to look at the type of judge she has already been? Here are \nthe facts. As a trial judge, Sonia Sotomayor presided over roughly 450 \ncases on the Second Circuit and participated in more than 3,000 panel \ndecisions. She has authored more than 200 appellate opinions. In cases \nwhere she and at least one Republican-appointed judge sat on a three-\njudge panel, she and the Republican-appointed judge agreed 95 percent \nof the time, as I mentioned. The Supreme Court has only reviewed five \ncases where she authored the decision and affirmed the decision below \nin two of them. The vast majority of her cases have not been in any way \noverturned or reversed by a higher court.\n  It is worth noting that this nominee, if confirmed, would bring more \nFederal judicial experience to the Supreme Court than any Justice in \n100 years.\n  With that, I see one of my colleagues, the Senator from New \nHampshire. We will have a number of women Senators here today. I will \ncome back and finish my remarks sometime in the next half hour. I think \nit is very important that Senator Shaheen, the Senator from New \nHampshire, be able to say a few words about the nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here this afternoon \nto join my friend and colleague from the State of Minnesota, Senator \nKlobuchar, in supporting the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be \na Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  Everyone in New Hampshire was very proud 19 years ago when former \nPresident George Bush nominated New Hampshire's own David Souter as an \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court. Every action Justice Souter has \ntaken since he began service to our Nation's highest Court has only \nreinforced that pride. So when Justice Souter announced in early May \nthat he intended to retire at the end of his term and return home to \nNew Hampshire, I took particular interest in whom President Obama would \nselect to fill David Souter's seat.\n  I believe the President has made a thoughtful and outstanding choice \nin nominating Judge Sonia Sotomayor.\n  Judge Sotomayor has had a distinguished career as a Federal judge. As \nhas been widely noted, if confirmed, she would bring more Federal \njudicial experience to the Supreme Court than any Justice in 100 years. \nToday, David Souter is the only member of the Supreme Court with prior \nexperience as a trial court judge. Sonia Sotomayor, too, would be the \nonly Justice with experience as a trial court judge. I happen to agree \nwith Senator Klobuchar. I think it is important that at least one of \nthe nine Supreme Court Justices have that experience. It is trial \njudges, after all, who day-in and day-out must apply the legal \nprinciples enunciated in Supreme Court opinions.\n  Judge Sotomayor also served 5 years as a local prosecutor and \npracticed law for 7 years as a trial attorney with a law firm. Judge \nSotomayor, because of her experience, will be ever mindful of the need \nto provide those in the courtroom with clear and practical decisions. \nMore important, she will understand how Supreme Court opinions affect \nreal human beings.\n  As a trial judge, every day Judge Sotomayor directly faced innocent \nvictims of crime, vicious perpetrators of crime, and occasionally the \nwrongfully accused. She directly faced injured parties seeking civil \nredress and civil defendants who may have made honest mistakes. She had \nto answer: What is the right verdict? What is the right length of \nincarceration? What is the right level of damages? These are not easy \ndecisions. I know that because my husband was a State trial court judge \nfor 16 years. Trial court judges must be able to live with the justice \nthey mete out. To do it well, it takes more than an understanding of \nthe law, it takes an understanding of people. Judge Sotomayor has a \ngreat understanding of both.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting with Sonia Sotomayor the day she \nfractured her ankle. I said to her as she came into my office: Boy, you \nare tough. She said: I grew up in the Bronx; we had to be tough. She \nhandled that painful injury with grace and humor. She has a first-rate \ntemperament and also a first-rate intellect. After growing up in a \npublic housing project in the South Bronx, she excelled at both \nPrinceton and Yale Law School.\n  I believe Judge Sonia Sotomayor is an excellent choice to replace \nDavid Souter as a Supreme Court Justice. She deserves a fair and a \nthorough hearing without delay. I look forward to that hearing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Shaheen, \nfor her remarks and for her reminiscence of meeting with the judge and \nonce again the judge showing how she perseveres in the face of \nadversity.\n  I wish to talk a little bit more--I was ending my last comments \ntalking about how, in fact, this nominee would bring more Federal \njudicial experience to the Supreme Court than any Justice\n\n[[Page S6979]]\n\nin 100 years. I had earlier noted my exchange with someone in an \nairport, where he wondered if she was worthy of this, if she was able \nto apply the facts, apply the law.\n  Clearly, when you look at this experience she brings and you compare \nit to any of these other nominees on the Supreme Court, she stands out. \nShe stands out not only because of her unique background, as she \novercame obstacles to get here, but she stands out as to her \nexperience, all those years as a prosecutor, all those years as a \nFederal judge. That makes a difference.\n  I wish to address one other point that has been made about Judge \nSonia Sotomayor in her capacity as a judge. It is something Senator \nShaheen mentioned, this temperament issue. There have been some stories \nand comments, mostly anonymous, I note, that question Judge Sotomayor's \njudicial temperament. According to one news story about this topic, \nJudge Sotomayor developed a reputation for asking tough questions at \noral arguments and for being sometimes brusque and curt with lawyers \nwho were not prepared to answer them. So she was a little curt, one \nanonymous source said. Where I come from, asking tough questions and \nhaving very little patience for unprepared lawyers is the very \ndefinition of being a judge. I cannot tell you how many times I have \nseen judges get very impatient with lawyers who were not prepared and \nwho did not know the answer to a question. As a lawyer, you owe it to \nthe bench and to your clients to be as well prepared as you possibly \ncan be.\n  As Nina Totenberg said on National Public Radio, if Sonia Sotomayor \nsometimes dominates oral arguments at her court, if she is feisty, even \npushy, then she would fit right in on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I would add this to that comment. Surely, we have come to a time in \nthis country where we can confirm as many gruff, to-the-point female \njudges as we have confirmed gruff, to-the-point male judges. Think how \nfar we have come with this nominee.\n  When Sandra Day O'Connor graduated from law school 50-plus years ago, \nthe only offer she received from a law firm was for a position as a \nlegal secretary. She had this great background, a very impressive \nbackground, and yet the only offer she received was as a legal \nsecretary.\n  Judge Ginsburg, who now sits on the Court, faced similar obstacles. \nWhen she entered Harvard in the 1950s, she was only 1 of 9 women in a \nclass of more than 500. One professor actually asked her to justify \ntaking a place that would have gone to a man in that class in Harvard. \nMr. President, 9 women, 500 spots, and someone actually asked her to \njustify the fact that she was there. I suppose she could justify it \nnow, saying she is now on the U.S. Supreme Court. Later Justice \nGinsburg was passed over for a prestigious clerkship despite her \nimpressive credentials.\n  Looking at Judge Sotomayor's long record as a lawyer, a prosecutor, \nand a judge, you can see we have come a long way.\n  She was confirmed by this Senate for the district court. She was \nnominated at that point by the first President Bush.\n  She was confirmed by this Senate for the Second Circuit, and she now \nfaces a confirmation hearing before our Judiciary Committee and \nconfirmation, again, for a position with the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I will tell you this, after learning about Judge Sotomayor, her \nbackground, her legal career, her judicial record, similar to so many \nof my colleagues, I am very impressed. To use President Obama's words, \nI hope Judge Sotomayor will bring to her nomination hearing and to the \nSupreme Court, if she is confirmed, not only the knowledge and the \nexperience acquired over the course of a brilliant legal career but the \nwisdom accumulated from an inspiring life's journey.\n  Actually today, Justice O'Connor was on the ``Today Show.'' She was \nasked about her work on the Court and what it was like. She was \nactually asked about Judge Sotomayor. She was asked: When you retired, \nyou let it be known you would like a woman to replace you and you were \nsort of disappointed when a woman didn't replace you. So what is your \nreaction to Judge Sotomayor's nomination?\n  Justice O'Connor said: Of course, I am pleased that we will have \nanother woman on the Court. I do think it is important not to just have \none. Our nearest neighbor, Canada, also has a court of nine members and \nin Canada there is a woman chief justice and there are four women all \ntold on the Canadian court.\n  Then she was asked: Do you think there is a right number of women who \nshould be on the Court?\n  Justice O'Connor, this morning, said: No, of course not.\n  But then she pointed out: But about half of law graduates today are \nwomen, and we have a tremendous number of qualified women in the \ncountry who are serving as lawyers and they ought to be represented on \nthe Court.\n  She was also asked later in the interview about opponents of Judge \nSotomayor who have brought up this term ``activist judge.''\n  She was asked: I know that is a term you have railed against in the \npast. What is it about the term that you object to?\n  She answered: I don't think the public understands what is meant by \nit. It is thrown around by many in the political field, and I think \nthat probably for most users of the term, they are distinguishing \nbetween the role of a legislator and a judge, and they say a judge \nshould not legislate. The problem, of course, Justice O'Connor says, is \nat the appellate level, the Supreme Court is at the top of the \nappellate level. Rulings of the Court do become binding law. So it is a \nlittle hard to talk in terms of who is an activist.\n  I, again, ask people to look at Judge Sotomayor's opinions. When I \ntalked with her about this, she talked about how she uses a set \nformula, laying out the facts, laying out the law, showing how the law \napplies to the facts, and then reaching a decision.\n  We can also look at her record where, in fact, when she was on a \nthree-judge panel with two other judges, when you look at her record of \nwhat she agreed with judges who had been appointed by a Republican \nPresident, 95 percent of the time they reached the same decision. So \nunless you believe those Republican-appointed judges are somehow \nactivist judges, then I guess you would say she is an activist judge. \nBut I think when you look at her whole record, you see someone who is \nmoderate, sometimes coming down on one side and sometimes coming down \non another.\n  I can tell you, as a former prosecutor, I did not always just look at \nwhether I agreed with the judge if I was trying to figure out if \nsomeone would be a good judge. I would look at whether they applied the \nlaws to the facts, whether they were fair. Sometimes our prosecutor's \noffice would not agree with a judge's decision. We would argue \nvehemently for a different decision. In the end, when we evaluated \nthese judges, when we decided whether we thought they were a fair \nperson to have on a case, we looked at that whole experience, we looked \nat that whole experience to make a decision about whether this was a \njudge who could be fair.\n  That is what I think when you look at her record--and I am looking \nvery much to her hearing, where we are going to explore a number of \nthese cases--again, colleagues on one side of the aisle will agree with \none case or disagree with another, and the other side of the aisle \nwould have made a decision one way or the other.\n  You have to look at her record as a whole. When you look at her \nrecord, you will see someone of experience, someone thoughtful, someone \nwho makes a decision based on the facts and based on the law.\n  I am very much looking forward to these hearings. I know that some of \nmy colleagues are coming to the Chamber as we speak. I am looking \nforward to their arrival as we become, as I said, ambassadors of truth \nto get these facts out as so many things have been bandied about in \nnames and other things that get into people's heads. I think it \nimportant for all those watching C-SPAN right now and for all of those \nwho are in the galleries today, that people take these facts away with \nthem--the facts of her experience, that in over 100 years of judicial \nexperience, when you look back 100 years, she has more experience on \nthe bench than any of the Justices who were nominated. You have to go \nback 100 years to find someone with that much experience. You look at \nthat work she has done as\n\n[[Page S6980]]\n\na prosecutor, you look at the work she has done throughout her whole \nlife, where she basically came from nothing, worked her way up, got \ninto a good college, got into a good law school, did it on her own, \nwith maybe a little help from her mom who bought the ``Encyclopedia \nBritannica.''\n  As I said at the beginning, this is a nominee who not only \nunderstands the law, understands the Constitution but also understands \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am pleased that my colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu, who has spoken many times in the past \nabout the importance of fair judges and strong judges, is here today to \ndiscuss this nominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for her passionate \nremarks about this particular nominee. I am happy to join many of my \ncolleagues in supporting a woman I consider to be an extraordinarily \naccomplished woman, and I commend President Obama for his selection.\n  As the Senate Judiciary Committee prepares for its confirmation \nhearing, I wished to come to the floor to express my strong support for \nthis nominee. As we all know, the Supreme Court serves as the highest \ntribunal in the Nation. As the final arbitrator of our laws, the \nSupreme Court Justices are charged with ensuring the American people \nachieve the promise of equal justice under our law and serving as \ninterpreters of our Constitution. It is a very important charge.\n  It is our duty as Senators to ensure that the members of this High \nCourt, which we are asked to confirm, serve as impartial, fairminded \nJustices who apply our laws, not merely their ideology. The American \npeople deserve no less.\n  A number of my colleagues have expressed concerns regarding this \nnominee. Those are not concerns I share. Having reviewed her resume, \nher academic credentials, having reviewed her time on the bench on the \nSecond Circuit, as well as in a trial capacity, she has an expansive \njudicial record, and I think that provides evidence of the kind of \nJustice she will be on the Supreme Court.\n  She has been described as a ``fearless and effective prosecutor.'' \nShe has served for 6 years as a trial judge in New York, as I said, on \nthe Federal district court, and 11 years on the circuit court of \nappeals. So she has been in the courtroom on both sides of the bench \nrepresenting a variety of clients, and she has written extensively. I \nthink that record reflects the kind of balance, fairminded, \nintellectual rigor we are looking for.\n  Talking about Democratic and Republican Parties, she has been \nappointed by both a Democratic administration and a Republican \nadministration. So clearly there were some things that were seen in her \nand her service by President George Bush as well as President Bill \nClinton.\n\n  She has participated in over 3,000 decisions. She has written over \n400 signed opinions on the Second Circuit. If confirmed, Judge \nSotomayor would bring more Federal judicial experience to the Supreme \nCourt than any Justice in 100 years. That is a very strong and powerful \nstatement, and I think a compelling statement, to the Members of this \nbody.\n  I had, as many of us have, the opportunity to meet with Judge \nSotomayor in my office earlier this month. In addition to having an \nimpressive professional resume, her personal journey as a young woman \nfrom a struggling, very middle-class background from the Bronx also \ncaptured my attention. She came up the hard way, with a lot of hard \nknocks but with a loving and supportive family around her to lead her \nand guide her. Tutors and teachers saw in this young girl a tremendous \namount of promise and potential, and she has most certainly lived up to \nthe promise her mother and grandmother and others saw in her at a young \nage.\n  I believe she is the kind of person who will bring not only \nextraordinary intellect and character and credibility but a tremendous \nbreadth of experience that will be very helpful in dealing with the \nissues the Court has before it today and will in the near future. She \nhas not only been a champion in many ways, but her life has been an \ninspiration to all Americans, proving that with determination and hard \nwork anything is possible.\n  Finally, it goes without saying that she is a historic choice that \nwill bring a wealth of experience and added diversity to the Nation's \nhighest Court. When confirmed, she will become only the third woman to \nserve on the Nation's highest court and the first Hispanic Justice in \nthe history of the United States. This is truly a remarkable turning \npoint. I wish she could receive, because of her outstanding resume--not \njust because of her gender and background and culture. I believe her \nresume should garner the support of a broad range of Members of this \nbody. Hopefully, that is the way it will come out in the final vote. \nShe most certainly, from my review, deserves our support, and I look \nforward to doing what I can to process her nomination as it is debated \nby the full Senate.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank my colleague Senator Landrieu for her very \nkind and thoughtful remarks about the nominee.\n  We are now joined by the Senator from Missouri, Senator McCaskill, \nwho as a former prosecutor I am sure will shed some light on the \nsubject.\n  I also thank the Senator from Kansas for allowing us to take an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nMinnesota, for helping to get us organized this afternoon to spend a \nlittle time talking about an outstanding Federal judge.\n  I also thank my colleague from Kansas for giving us a few minutes to \nmake these remarks.\n  I will confess that I wasn't familiar with Judge Sotomayor before she \nwas nominated. I started looking at her resume, and there are so many \nthings in her resume that are, frankly, amazing that you can get \ndistracted by--where she went to school, where she got her law degree, \nand the fact that she has been at several levels of the Federal bench; \nand also, of course, that she had a very big job with complex \nlitigation in a law firm. But the part of her resume that spoke to me \nwas her time as an assistant district attorney in New York.\n  I don't know that most Americans truly understand the difference \nbetween a State prosecuting attorney and a Federal prosecuting \nattorney. Those of us who have spent time in the State courtrooms like \nto explain that we are the ones who answer the 911 calls. When you are \na State prosecutor, you don't get to pick which cases you try. You try \nall of the cases. When you are a State prosecutor, you don't have the \nluxury of a large investigative staff or maybe a very light caseload. \nIt would be unheard of for a Federal prosecutor to have a caseload of \n100 felonies at any given time, but that is the caseload Judge \nSotomayor handled as an assistant district attorney during her time in \nthe District Attorney's Office in New York.\n  When she came to the prosecutor's office, ironically it was almost \nexactly the same year I came to the prosecutor's office as a young \nwoman out of law school. I was in Kansas City; she was in New York. I \nknow what the environment is in these prosecutors' offices. There are a \nlot of aggressive type A personalities, and it is very difficult to \nbegin to handle serious felony cases because everybody wants to handle \nthe serious felony cases. In only 6 months, Judge Sotomayor was \npromoted to handle serious felony cases in the courtroom. She \nprosecuted every type of crime imaginable, including the most serious \ncrimes that are committed in our country.\n  She had many famous cases. One was the Tarzan murderer, where she \njoined\n\n[[Page S6981]]\n\nlaw enforcement officers in scouring dangerous drug houses for evidence \nand witnesses. After a month of trial, she convicted Richard Maddicks \non three different murders and he was sentenced to 67 years to life in \nprison.\n  A New York detective had a hard time finding a New York prosecutor \nwilling to take his child pornography case. Judge Sotomayor stepped up, \nwinning convictions against two men for distributing films depicting \nchildren engaged in pornographic activities. These were the first child \npornography convictions after the Supreme Court had upheld New York's \nlaw that barred the sale of sexually explicit films using children.\n  After her time as a prosecutor, she eventually became a trial judge. \nA trial judge is an unusual kind of experience for a Supreme Court \nJustice. But keep in mind what the Supreme Court Justices do: They look \nat the record of the trial. They are trying to pass on matters of law \nthat emanate from the courtroom. What a wonderful nominee we have, one \nwho has not only stood at the bar as a prosecutor but also sat on the \nbench ruling on matters of evidence, ruling on matters of law. I am \nproud of the fact that she has this experience. If she is confirmed, or \nwhen she is confirmed, she will be the only Supreme Court Justice with \nthat trial judge experience, because she is replacing the only Supreme \nCourt Justice with that experience--Judge Souter.\n  This is a meat-and-potatoes moderate judge. This is a judge who has \nagreed with Republicans on her panels 95 percent of the time. This is a \njudge who has the kind of experience that will allow her to make \nknowing and wise decisions on the most important matters that come in \nfront of our courts in this country.\n  We have a ``gotcha'' mentality around here. We all engage in it at \none time or another. It is gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. It is an outgrowth \nof the political system of this grand and glorious democracy we all \nparticipate in. It is not my favorite part, but it is real. Justice \nSotomayor will become a Supreme Court Justice, after having gone \nthrough a gotcha process. We are going to hear a lot of gotchas over \nthe coming weeks. But at the end of the day, this is a smart, proud \nwoman who has fought her way through a system against tremendous odds \nto show that she has integrity, grit, intellect, and the ability to \npass judgment in the most difficult intellectual challenges that face a \nSupreme Court Justice.\n  I am proud to support her nomination, and I look forward to the day--\nand I am confident that the day will come--she will take her place on \nthe highest Court in the land.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from Kansas for his \nindulgence, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, again I thank the Senator from Kansas, \nand also Senator McCaskill, Senator Shaheen, and Senator Landrieu, who \nspoke today. I also know that Senators Gillibrand, Feinstein, Mikulski, \nBoxer, and Murray will be speaking, or may have already and will be in \nthe next few weeks on this nominee, as will many of my colleagues.\n  I appreciate this time, Mr. President. We are very excited about this \nupcoming hearing, and we are glad to be here as ambassadors for the \ntruth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I believe under a previous agreement I \nhave time allotted at the present time; is that correct, if I could \ninquire of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may be recognized under cloture.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination \nof Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court. I had the \nopportunity to meet with Judge Sotomayor 2 weeks ago. I was in the \nSenate when she was previously before this body on the Second Circuit \nCourt nomination, and I appreciated the chance to meet with her \nrecently.\n  I have also appreciated the chance to review her record in depth and \nalso to hear my colleagues speak about Judge Sotomayor, because it \nrepresents the distinction that I think is very important to note here. \nMy colleague from Missouri just spoke, and she was talking about the \nwonderful qualifications of Judge Sotomayor and the candidate's \nbackground and experiences that she brings. She has a very interesting, \na very American story to tell of her background. It is a compelling \nstory. She is the daughter of immigrants who overcame diversity to go \nto two of the Nation's best universities. I admire that, and I admire \nthe things they pointed out in their presentation of her background and \nwhat she has done. I think those are all admirable characteristics.\n  But what we are doing here is picking somebody to be on the U.S. \nSupreme Court, and what their judicial philosophy is that they will \ntake with them. It isn't all just about the background or the \nexperience. It is about the judicial philosophy that comes forward, and \nthat is what my colleagues didn't discuss. So that is what I want to \ndiscuss here this afternoon.\n  I have had the chance to review Judge Sotomayor's records. In 1998, \nthe Senate voted to promote Judge Sotomayor to the appellate court. I \nvoted against her at that time because I was concerned not about her \nbackground, not about her qualifications, but I was concerned that she \nembraced an activist judicial philosophy. That is what I want to talk \nabout today, because that is what we are deciding when we put somebody \non the Supreme Court--what is the judicial philosophy this person \ncarries with them.\n  It is not necessarily about their own background or their \nqualifications. Those are important to review, but at the heart is what \nis the judicial philosophy. Is this a person who supports an activist \njudiciary getting into many areas in which the American public doesn't \nthink they should go into or is it a person who believes in more of a \nstrict constructionist view, that the Court is there to be an umpire \nand not an active player in policy development? Are they an umpire who \ncalls the balls and strikes, and not how do we do law; how do we \nrewrite what is here?\n  I think the Court loses its lustre when it gets into becoming an \nactive player in policy development instead of being a strict umpire of \npolicy development. Unfortunately, what I saw in Judge Sotomayor in \n1998 was somebody who embraced an activist judicial philosophy. During \na 1996 speech at Suffolk University Law School 2 years before the \nSenate voted on her nomination to the Second Circuit, Judge Sotomayor \nsaid:\n\n       The law that lawyers practice and judges declare is not a \n     definitive capital ``L'' law that many would like to think \n     exists.\n\n  Translated, that is to say the law is not set. It is mobile, as moved \nby judges, not by legislatures. This is not the rule of law. This is \nthe rule from the bench. This is the rule of man, and it makes our law \nunpredictable. That is not good for a society like ours which is based \non the rule of law, not the rule by a person.\n  Any nominee to the Federal bench, and especially to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, must have a proper understanding and respect for the role of the \nCourt--for the role they would assume. The Court must faithfully hold \nto the text of the Constitution and the intent of the Founders, not try \nto rewrite it based on ever changing cultural views. This is at the \nheart of what a judge does.\n  Democracy, I believe, is wounded when Justices on the high Court, who \nare unelected, invent constitutional rights and alter the balance of \ngovernmental powers in ways that find no support in the text, the \nstructure, or the history of the Constitution. Unfortunately, in recent \nyears, the courts have assumed a more aggressive political role. In \nmany cases, the courts have allowed the left in this country to achieve \nthrough court mandates what it cannot persuade the people to enact \nthrough the legislative process. The Constitution contemplates that the \nFederal courts will exercise limited jurisdiction. They should neither \nwrite nor execute the law.\n\n  This is very basic in our law and goes back to the very Founders. As \nChief Justice John Marshall said in his famous 1803 case, Marbury v. \nMadison, that every law student has studied at length, the role of the \ncourt is simple. It is to ``say what the law is.'' It is not to write \nthe law. It is not to rewrite the law. It is to ``say what the law \nis,'' what did the legislature pass, when it needs interpretation. It \nis not about\n\n[[Page S6982]]\n\nwriting it. It is not about the mobility, that the law isn't with a \ncapital ``l,'' and we can move it here based on these factors that we \nthink are different with the cultural environment and we may have to \nmove it over here in 10 years because the environment has changed and \nthe law changes with it.\n  If the law changes, it is by legislatures. It is not by the court. \nThat is why Marbury v. Madison said the law is to ``say what the law \nis,'' not to rewrite it.\n  In Federalist 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote this--law students study \nthis as well:\n\n       Whoever attentively considers the different departments of \n     power must perceive that, in a government in which they are \n     separated from each other, the judiciary, from the nature of \n     its functions, will always be the least dangerous to the \n     political rights of the Constitution; because it will be \n     least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The executive \n     not only dispenses the honors but holds the sword of the \n     community. The legislature not only commands the purse, but \n     prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every \n     citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary, \n     has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no \n     direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the \n     society, and can take no active resolution whatsoever. It may \n     truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL but merely \n     judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the \n     executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.\n\n  The court is to have judgment. A judge is to have judgment, not write \nthe law.\n  In Hamilton's view, judges could be trusted with power because they \nwould not resolve divisive social issues--that is for the legislature \nto do--short-circuit the political process, or invent rights which have \nno basis in the text of the Constitution.\n  I have long believed the judicial branch preserves its legitimacy \nwith the public and has its strength with the public through refraining \nfrom action on political questions. This concept was perhaps best \nexpressed by Justice Felix Frankfurter, a steadfast Democrat appointed \nby President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Justice Frankfurter said this:\n\n       Courts are not representative bodies. They are not designed \n     to be a good reflex of a democratic society. Their judgment \n     is best informed, and therefore most dependable, within \n     narrow limits. Their essential quality is detachment, founded \n     on independence. History teaches that the independence of the \n     judiciary is jeopardized when courts become embroiled in the \n     passions of the day and assume primary responsibility in \n     choosing between competing political, economic and social \n     pressures. Primary responsibility for adjusting the interests \n     which compete in the situation before us of necessity belongs \n     to the Congress.\n\n  That is to quote Justice Frankfurter.\n  I recall a private meeting I had with then-Judge Roberts, before \nassuming the position of Chief Justice, when he had been nominated to \nbe Chief Justice--a wonderful Justice on the Supreme Court who then-\nSenator Obama voted against. Senator Obama voted against the \nconfirmation of John Roberts, voted against the confirmation of Samuel \nAlito to the Supreme Court based, I believe, primarily on judicial \nphilosophy because they believed in strict constructionism; that a \ncourt was to be a court and not a legislative body. Then-Senator Obama \nvoted against both John Roberts and against Samuel Alito.\n  In my meeting with Judge Roberts, he talked about baseball and about \nthe courts and his analogy to baseball. He gave a great analogy, I \nthought, when he said:\n\n       It is a bad thing when the umpire is the most watched \n     person on the field.\n\n  Imagine that, watching a baseball game and the thing you are watching \nthe most is the umpire because the umpire is both umpire and a player. \nHow confusing, how difficult, and what a wrong way to have a game. He, \nof course, Judge Roberts, was alluding to the current situation in \nAmerican governance where the legislature can pass a law, the executive \nsign it, but everybody waits, holding their breath to see what the \ncourts will do with it.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Sotomayor seems to me far too interested in \nbeing both an umpire and active player. Prior to becoming a Federal \njudge, Sonia Sotomayor spent more than a decade on the board of \ndirectors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund. A \nSeptember 25, 1992, article in the New York Times referred to Judge \nSotomayor as ``a top policy maker'' on the group's board.\n  In 1998, the group brought suit against the New York City Police \nDepartment, claiming that a promotion exam was discriminatory because \nthe results gave a disproportionate number of promotions to White \npolice officers. As a judge on the appellate court, Judge Sotomayor was \ninvolved in a nearly identical case, Ricci v. Destefano, involving a \ngroup of White firefighters seeking promotion in New Haven, CT. City \nofficials in New Haven decided to void the results of the exam because \nit had a disparate impact on minorities. Judge Sotomayor agreed with \nthe city's decision, and we are now waiting on a ruling from the \nSupreme Court.\n       Sotomayor's work as an activist challenging the New York \n     Police Department's test results in 1998 is evidence that she \n     may have allowed personal biases to guide her decision to \n     rule against New Haven firefighters. I hope we can find out \n     more in her confirmation interviews and in her hearings. But \n     I am also troubled by the number of amicus briefs filed by \n     the fund in support of what are radical positions on pro-\n     abortion issues during the time Sotomayor was on this same \n     board.\n  Six briefs were filed taking positions outside of the mainstream in \nsupport of abortion rights in prominent cases such as in Webster v. \nReproductive Health Services or in Ohio v. Akron Center for \nReproductive Health. In that Ohio v. Akron case, the Court upheld \nOhio's parental consent laws. These are laws that say, before a minor \ncan have an abortion, they must have parental consent.\n  Joining the majority opinion were moderate Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor and liberal Justice John Paul Stevens. Yet the group that \nJudge Sotomayor was associated with filed a brief opposing this \nparental notification law, saying ``any efforts to overturn or in any \nway to restrict the rights in Roe v. Wade,'' they opposed any \nrestriction, even allowing parents of a minor child to have parental \nnotification that their child was going to go through this major \nmedical procedure. She took a stand opposed to that parental right that \nmost of the American public, 75 percent of the American public \nsupports; that parental right of that notification. She opposed it.\n  According to the New York Times:\n\n       The board monitored all litigation undertaken by the fund's \n     lawyers, and a number of those lawyers said Ms. Sotomayor was \n     an involved and ardent supporter of their various legal \n     efforts during her time with the group.\n\n  I am also deeply concerned that Judge Sotomayor will bring this \nradical agenda to the Court.\n  Judge Sotomayor has given speeches and written articles promoting \njudicial activism. The President who appointed her said judges should \nhave ``the empathy to recognize what it's like to be a young teenage \nmom; the empathy to understand what it is like to be poor or African-\nAmerican or gay or disabled or old,'' and that difficult cases should \nbe decided by ``what is in the Justice's heart.''\n  While I think it is admirable to have empathy, a Justice and a person \nwho sits on the bench is to decide this based on the law. That is what \nthey are to decide it upon, not an interpretation or rewriting of the \nlaw.\n  The President's view of the role of a Judge on the Court is not \nshared by Justices Marshall or Frankfurter, nor is it the view of \nHamilton and the drafters of the Constitution.\n\n  The oath that all Supreme Court Justices take says:\n\n       I will administer justice without respect to persons, and \n     do equal right to the poor and to the rich.\n\n  That is the oath they take. The Justice is to be blind and just to \nhear the case and decide it based on the facts and what the law is and \nsay what the law says, not what they wish it to be nor what is in their \nheart. It is to be blind and it is to hold these and to weigh these \nequally and fairly to determine the truth and to determine the outcome \nin the case.\n  The President is asking his nominees to ignore, in essence, their \noath. I fear Justice Sotomayor is all too eager to comply.\n  In her writings, Judge Sotomayor has rejected the principle of \nimpartiality and embraces a rather novel idea that a Judge's personal \nlife story should come into play in the courtroom. In a 2001 speech at \nthe UC Berkeley Law School, which was later published, Judge Sotomayor \ndismissed the\n\n[[Page S6983]]\n\nidea that ``judges may transcend their personal sympathies and \nprejudices and aspire to achieve a greater degree of fairness and \nintegrity based on the reason of law,'' by saying that ``ignoring our \ndifferences as women or men of color we do a disservice both to the law \nand society.''\n  I am not sure why Judge Sotomayor believes the law is somehow \ndifferent when interpreted by people of a different gender, but I think \nJudge Sotomayor is absolutely wrong and we do a disservice to law and \nsociety when we don't transcend our personal sympathies and prejudices \nand base our decisions upon the facts and the law.\n  Judge Sotomayor's view is contrary to the words engraved upon the \nSupreme Court's entrance which state ``equal justice under law.''\n  In the same 2001 speech, Judge Sotomayor made the following \nastonishing statement:\n\n       Personal experiences affect the facts judges choose to see. \n     . . . I simply do not know what the difference will be in my \n     judging. But I accept there will be some.\n\n  When Judge Sotomayor says that ``personal experiences affect the \nfacts judges choose to see,'' does that mean she is willing to ignore \nother facts? Is justice blind or is it actually interpreting and seeing \nwhich facts to pick and which facts not to pick?\n  The role of judges is to examine all the facts of a particular case, \nnot solely the facts that deliver a desired outcome or solely the facts \nthat the judge can relate to based on his or her personal biography. It \nis dangerous for this body to consent to elevating a judge who believes \nthat justice equates with picking winners and losers based upon his or \nher own personal biases. That is not judging.\n  I hope my colleagues understand this 2001 speech at Berkeley was not \nan isolated incident. In a 1994 speech, Judge Sotomayor used language \nnearly identical to that of the 2001 speech, saying judges should not \nignore their differences as women and people of color and to do so \nwould be a disservice to the law and society. In 1994, Judge Sotomayor \ndiscussed the impact that more women on the bench will have on the \n``development of the law.''\n  ``Development,'' like this is about the writing of the law. If that \nis the case, that is done by the Congress not by the courts. Judges do \nnot make law, and under no circumstances should they be under the \nimpression they do.\n  Judge Sotomayor sees judges as lawmakers, as both umpire and player. \nIn the 2005 appearance at Duke Law School, she said: ``The court of \nappeals is where policy is made.''\n  I wonder how Alexander Hamilton would respond. I think he would \nwholly disagree with that interpretation. Unfortunately, Judge \nSotomayor's writings and statements lead me to believe that she is a \nproponent, a clear proponent, of an activist judiciary. I cannot \nsupport her nomination. I will vote no when it comes before the full \nSenate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that her speech in the Berkeley La Raza Law \nJournal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal, 2002]\n\n Raising the Bar: Latino and Latina Presence in the Judiciary and the \n                      Struggle for Representation\n\n       Judge Reynoso, thank you for that lovely introduction. I am \n     humbled to be speaking behind a man who has contributed so \n     much to the Hispanic community. I am also grateful to have \n     such kind words said about me.\n       I am delighted to be here. It is nice to escape my hometown \n     for just a little bit. It is also nice to say hello to old \n     friends who are in the audience, to rekindle contact with old \n     acquaintances and to make new friends among those of you in \n     the audience. It is particularly heart warming to me to be \n     attending a conference to which I was invited by a Latina law \n     school friend, Rachel Moran, who is now an accomplished and \n     widely respected legal scholar. I warn Latinos in this room: \n     Latinas are making a lot of progress in the old-boy network.\n       I am also deeply honored to have been asked to deliver the \n     annual Judge Mario G. Olmos lecture. I am joining a \n     remarkable group of prior speakers who have given this \n     lecture. I hope what I speak about today continues to promote \n     the legacy of that man whose commitment to public service and \n     abiding dedication to promoting equality and justice for all \n     people inspired this memorial lecture and the conference that \n     will follow. I thank Judge Olmos' widow Mary Louise's family, \n     her son and the judge's many friends for hosting me. And for \n     the privilege you have bestowed on me in honoring the memory \n     of a very special person. If I and the many people of this \n     conference can accomplish a fraction of what Judge Olmos did \n     in his short but extraordinary life we and our respective \n     communities will be infinitely better.\n       I intend tonight to touch upon the themes that this \n     conference will be discussing this weekend and to talk to you \n     about my Latina identity, where it came from, and the \n     influence I perceive it has on my presence on the bench.\n       Who am I. I am a ``Newyorkrican.'' For those of you on the \n     West Coast who do not know what that term means: I am a born \n     and bred New Yorker of Puerto Rican-born parents who came to \n     the states during World War II.\n       Like many other immigrants to this great land, my parents \n     came because of poverty and to attempt to find and secure a \n     better life for themselves and the family that they hoped to \n     have. They largely succeeded. For that, my brother and I are \n     very grateful. The story of that success is what made me and \n     what makes me the Latina that I am. The Latina side of my \n     identity was forged and closely nurtured by my family through \n     our shared experiences and traditions.\n       For me, a very special part of my being Latina is the mucho \n     platos de arroz, gandoles y pernir--rice, beans and pork--\n     that I have eaten at countless family holidays and special \n     events. My Latina identity also includes, because of my \n     particularly adventurous taste buds, morcilla,--pig \n     intestines, patitas de cerdo con garbanzo--pigs' feet with \n     beans, and la lengua y orejas de cuchifrito, pigs' tongue \n     and ears. I bet the Mexican-Americans in this room are \n     thinking that Puerto Ricans have unusual food tastes. Some \n     of us, like me, do. Part of my Latina identity is the \n     sound of merengue at all our family parties and the heart \n     wrenching Spanish love songs that we enjoy. It is the \n     memory of Saturday afternoon at the movies with my aunt \n     and cousins watching Cantinflas, who is not Puerto Rican, \n     but who was an icon Spanish comedian on par with Abbot and \n     Costello of my generation. My Latina soul was nourished as \n     I visited and played at my grandmother's house with my \n     cousins and extended family. They were my friends as I \n     grew up. Being a Latina child was watching the adults \n     playing dominos on Saturday night and us kids playing \n     loteria, bingo, with my grandmother calling out the \n     numbers which we marked on our cards with chick peas.\n       Now, does any one of these things make me a Latina? \n     Obviously not because each of our Carribean and Latin \n     American communities has their own unique food and different \n     traditions at the holidays. I only learned about tacos in \n     college from my Mexican-American roommate. Being a Latina in \n     America also does not mean speaking Spanish. I happen to \n     speak it fairly well. But my brother, only three years \n     younger, like too many of us educated here, barely speaks it. \n     Most of us born and bred here, speak it very poorly.\n       If I had pursued my career in my undergraduate history \n     major, I would likely. provide you with a very academic \n     description of what being a Latino or Latina means. For \n     example, I could define Latinos as those peoples and cultures \n     populated or colonized by Spain who maintained or adopted \n     Spanish or Spanish Creole as their language of communication. \n     You can tell that I have been very well educated. That \n     antiseptic description however, does not really explain the \n     appeal of morcilla--pig's intestine--to an American born \n     child. It does not provide an adequate explanation of why \n     individuals like us, many of whom are born in this completely \n     different American culture, still identify so strongly with \n     those communities in which our parents were born and raised.\n       America has a deeply confused image of itself that is in \n     perpetual tension. We are a nation that takes pride in our \n     ethnic diversity, recognizing its importance in shaping our \n     society and in adding richness to its existence. Yet, we \n     simultaneously insist that we can and must function and live \n     in a race and color-blind way that ignore these very \n     differences that in other contexts we laud. That tension \n     between ``the melting pot and the salad bowl''--a recently \n     popular metaphor used to described New York's diversity--is \n     being hotly debated today in national discussions about \n     affirmative action. Many of us struggle with this tension and \n     attempt to maintain and promote our cultural and ethnic \n     identities in a society that is often ambivalent about how to \n     deal with its differences. In this time of great debate we \n     must remember that it is not political struggles that create \n     a Latino or Latina identity. I became a Latina by the way I \n     love and the way I live my life. My family showed me by their \n     example how wonderful and vibrant life is and how wonderful \n     and magical it is to have a Latina soul. They taught me to \n     love being a Puerto Riquena and to love America and value its \n     lesson that great things could be achieved if one works hard \n     for it. But achieving success here is no easy accomplishment \n     for Latinos or Latinas, and although that struggle did not \n     and does not create a Latina identity, it does inspire how I \n     live my life.\n       I was born in the year 1954. That year was the fateful year \n     in which Brown v. Board of Education was decided. When I was \n     eight, in 1961, the first Latino, the wonderful Judge \n     Reynaldo Garza, was appointed to the federal bench, an event \n     we are celebrating at this conference. When I finished law \n     school in 1979, there were no women judges on the Supreme \n     Court or on the highest court of my\n\n[[Page S6984]]\n\n     home state, New York. There was then only one Afro-American \n     Supreme Court Justice and then and now no Latino or Latina \n     justices on our highest court. Now in the last twenty plus \n     years of my professional life, I have seen a quantum leap in \n     the representation of women and Latinos in the legal \n     profession and particularly in the judiciary. In addition to \n     the appointment of the first female United States Attorney \n     General, Janet Reno, we have seen the appointment of two \n     female justices to the Supreme Court and two female justices \n     to the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court of my \n     home state. One of those judges is the Chief Judge and \n     the other is a Puerto Riquena, like I am. As of today, \n     women sit on the highest courts of almost all of the \n     states and of the territories, including Puerto Rico. One \n     Supreme Court, that of Minnesota, had a majority of women \n     justices for a period of time.\n       As of September 1, 2001, the federal judiciary consisting \n     of Supreme, Circuit and District Court Judges was about 22% \n     women. In 1992, nearly ten years ago, when I was first \n     appointed a District Court Judge, the percentage of women in \n     the total federal judiciary was only 13%. Now, the growth of \n     Latino representation is somewhat less favorable. As of today \n     we have, as I noted earlier, no Supreme Court justices, and \n     we have only 10 out of 147 active Circuit Court judges and 30 \n     out of 587 active district court judges. Those numbers are \n     grossly below our proportion of the population. As recently \n     as 1965, however, the federal bench had only three women \n     serving and only one Latino judge. So changes are happening, \n     although in some areas, very slowly. These figures and \n     appointments are heartwarming. Nevertheless, much still \n     remains to happen.\n       Let us not forget that between the appointments of Justice \n     Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981 and Justice Ginsburg in 1992, \n     eleven years passed. Similarly, between Justice Kaye's \n     initial appointment as an Associate Judge to the New York \n     Court of Appeals in 1983, and Justice Ciparick's appointment \n     in 1993, ten years elapsed. Almost nine years later, we are \n     waiting for a third appointment of a woman to both the \n     Supreme Court and the New York Court of Appeals and of a \n     second minority, male or female, preferably Hispanic, to the \n     Supreme Court. In 1992 when I joined the bench, there were \n     still two out of 13 circuit courts and about 53 out of 92 \n     district courts in which no women sat. At the beginning of \n     September of 2001, there are women sitting in all 13 circuit \n     courts. The First, Fifth, Eighth and Federal Circuits each \n     have only one female judge, however, out of a combined total \n     number of 48 judges. There are still nearly 37 district \n     courts with no women judges at all. For women of color the \n     statistics are more sobering. As of September 20, 1998, of \n     the then 195 circuit court judges only two were African-\n     American women and two Hispanic women. Of the 641 district \n     court judges only twelve were African-American women and \n     eleven Hispanic women. African-American women comprise only \n     1.56% of the federal judiciary and Hispanic-American women \n     comprise only 1%. No African-American, male or female, sits \n     today on the Fourth or Federal circuits. And no Hispanics, \n     male or female, sit on the Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \n     District of Columbia or Federal Circuits.\n       Sort of shocking, isn't it. This is the year 2002. We have \n     a long way to go. Unfortunately, there are some very deep \n     storm warnings we must keep in mind. In at least the last \n     five years the majority of nominated judges the Senate \n     delayed more than one year before confirming or never \n     confirming were women or minorities. I need not remind this \n     audience that Judge Paez of your home Circuit, the Ninth \n     Circuit, has had the dubious distinction of having had his \n     confirmation delayed the longest in Senate history. These \n     figures demonstrate that there is a real and continuing need \n     for Latino and Latina organizations and community groups \n     throughout the country to exist and to continue their efforts \n     of promoting women and men of all colors in their pursuit for \n     equality in the judicial system.\n       This weekend's conference, illustrated by its name, is \n     bound to examine issues that I hope will identify the efforts \n     and solutions that will assist our communities. The focus of \n     my speech tonight, however, is not about the struggle to get \n     us where we are and where we need to go but instead to \n     discuss with you what it all will mean to have more women and \n     people of color on the bench. The statistics I have been \n     talking about provide a base from which to discuss a question \n     which one of my former colleagues on the Southern District \n     bench, Judge Miriam Cederbaum, raised when speaking about \n     women on the federal bench. Her question was: What do the \n     history and statistics mean. In her speech, Judge Cederbaum \n     expressed her belief that the number of women and by direct \n     inference people of color on the bench, was still \n     statistically insignificant and that therefore we could not \n     draw valid scientific conclusions from the acts of so few \n     people over such a short period of time. Yet, we do have \n     women and people of color in more significant numbers on the \n     bench and no one can or should ignore pondering what that \n     will mean or not mean in the development of the law. Now, \n     I cannot and do not claim this issue as personally my own. \n     In recent years there has been an explosion of research \n     and writing in this area. On one of the panels tomorrow, \n     you will hear the Latino perspective in this debate.\n       For those of you interested in the gender perspective on \n     this issue, I commend to you a wonderful compilation of \n     articles published on the subject in Vol. 77 of the \n     Judicature, the Journal of the American Judicature Society of \n     November-December 1993. It is on Westlaw/Lexis and I assume \n     the students and academics in this room can find it.\n       Now Judge Cedarbaum expresses concern with any analysis of \n     women and presumably again people of color on the bench, \n     which begins and presumably ends with the conclusion that \n     women or minorities are different from men generally. She \n     sees danger in presuming that judging should be gender or \n     anything else based. She rightly points out that the \n     perception of the differences between men and women is what \n     led to many paternalistic laws and to the denial to women of \n     the right to vote because we were described then ``as not \n     capable of reasoning or thinking logically'' but instead of \n     ``acting intuitively.'' I am quoting adjectives that were \n     bandied around famously during the suffragettes' movement.\n       While recognizing the potential effect of individual \n     experiences on perception, Judge Cedarbaum nevertheless \n     believes that judges must transcend their personal sympathies \n     and prejudices and aspire to achieve a greater degree of \n     fairness and integrity based on the reason of law. Although I \n     agree with and attempt to work toward Judge Cedarbaum's \n     aspiration, I wonder whether achieving that goal is possible \n     in all or even in most cases. And I wonder whether by \n     ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a \n     disservice both to the law and society. Whatever the reasons \n     why we may have different perspectives, either as some \n     theorists suggest because of our cultural experiences or as \n     others postulate because we have basic differences in logic \n     and reasoning, are in many respects a small part of a larger \n     practical question we as women and minority judges in society \n     in general must address. I accept the thesis of a law school \n     classmate, Professor Steven Carter of Yale Law School, in his \n     affirmative action book that in any group of human beings \n     there is a diversity of opinion because there is both a \n     diversity of experiences and of thought. Thus, as noted by \n     another Yale Law School Professor--I did graduate from there \n     and I am not really biased except that they seem to be doing \n     a lot of writing in that area--Professor Judith Resnik says \n     that there is not a single voice of feminism, not a feminist \n     approach but many who are exploring the possible ways of \n     being that are distinct from those structured in a world \n     dominated by the power and words of men. Thus, feminist \n     theories of judging are in the midst of creation and are not \n     and perhaps will never aspire to be as solidified as the \n     established legal doctrines of judging can sometimes appear \n     to be.\n       That same point can be made with respect to people of \n     color. No one person, judge or nominee will speak in a female \n     or people of color voice. I need not remind you that Justice \n     Clarence Thomas represents a part but not the whole of \n     African-American thought on many subjects. Yet, because I \n     accept the proposition that, as Judge Resnik describes it, \n     ``to judge is an exercise of power'' and because as, another \n     former law school classmate, Professor Martha Minnow of \n     Harvard Law School, states ``there is no objective stance but \n     only a series of perspectives--no neutrality, no escape from \n     choice in judging,'' I further accept that our experiences as \n     women and people of color affect our decisions. The \n     aspiration to impartiality is just that--it's an aspiration \n     because it denies the fact that we are by our experiences \n     making different choices than others. Not all women or people \n     of color, in all or some circumstances or indeed in any \n     particular case or circumstance but enough people of color in \n     enough cases, will make a difference in the process of \n     judging. The Minnesota Supreme Court has given an example of \n     this. As reported by Judge Patricia Wald formerly of the D.C. \n     Circuit Court, three women on the Minnesota Court with two \n     men dissenting agreed to grant a protective order against a \n     father's visitation rights when the father abused his child. \n     The Judicature Journal has at least two excellent studies on \n     how women on the courts of appeal and state supreme \n     courts have tended to vote more often than their male \n     counterpart to uphold women's claims in sex discrimination \n     cases and criminal defendants' claims in search and \n     seizure cases. As recognized by legal scholars, whatever \n     the reason, not one woman or person of color in any one \n     position but as a group we will have an effect on the \n     development of the law and on judging.\n       In our private conversations, Judge Cedarbaum has pointed \n     out to me that seminal decisions in race and sex \n     discrimination cases have come from Supreme Courts composed \n     exclusively of white males. I agree that this is significant \n     but I also choose to emphasize that the people who argued \n     those cases before the Supreme Court which changed the legal \n     landscape ultimately were largely people of color and women. \n     I recall that Justice Thurgood Marshall, Judge Connie Baker \n     Motley, the first black woman appointed to the federal bench, \n     and others of the NAACP argued Brown v. Board of Education. \n     Similarly, Justice Ginsburg, with other women attorneys, was \n     instrumental in advocating and convincing the Court that \n     equality of work required equality in terms and conditions of \n     employment.\n       Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or \n     cultural differences, a possibility I abhor less or discount \n     less than my colleague Judge Cedarbaum, our gender and \n     national origins may and will make a difference in our \n     judging. Justice O'Connor has\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\n     often been cited as saying that a wise old man and wise old \n     woman will reach the same conclusion in deciding cases. I am \n     not so sure Justice O'Connor is the author of that line since \n     Professor Resnik attributes that line to Supreme Court \n     Justice Coyle. I am also not so sure that I agree with the \n     statement. First, as Professor Martha Minnow has noted, there \n     can never be a universal definition of wise. Second, I would \n     hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her \n     experiences would more often than not reach a better \n     conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.\n       Let us not forget that wise men like Oliver Wendell Holmes \n     and Justice Cardozo voted on cases which upheld both sex and \n     race discrimination in our society. Until 1972, no Supreme \n     Court case ever upheld the claim of a woman in a gender \n     discrimination case. I, like Professor Carter, believe that \n     we should not be so myopic as to believe that others of \n     different experiences or backgrounds are incapable of \n     understanding the values and needs of people from a different \n     group. Many are so capable. As Judge Cedarbaum pointed out to \n     me, nine white men on the Supreme Court in the past have done \n     so on many occasions and on many issues including Brown.\n       However, to understand takes time and effort, something \n     that not all people are willing to give. For others, their \n     experiences limit their ability to understand the experiences \n     of others. Others simply do not care. Hence, one must accept \n     the proposition that a difference there will be by the \n     presence of women and people of color on the bench. Personal \n     experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see. My \n     hope is that I will take the good from my experiences and \n     extrapolate them further into areas with which I am \n     unfamiliar. I simply do not know exactly what that difference \n     will be in my judging. But I accept there will be some based \n     on my gender and my Latina heritage.\n       I also hope that by raising the question today of what \n     difference having more Latinos and Latinas on the bench will \n     make will start your own evaluation. For people of color and \n     women lawyers, what does and should being an ethnic minority \n     mean in your lawyering? For men lawyers, what areas in your \n     experiences and attitudes do you need to work on to make you \n     capable of reaching those great moments of enlightenment \n     which other men in different circumstances have been able to \n     reach. For all of us, how do change the facts that in every \n     task force study of gender and race bias in the courts, women \n     and people of color, lawyers and judges alike, report in \n     significantly higher percentages than white men that their \n     gender and race has shaped their careers, from hiring, \n     retention to promotion and that a statistically significant \n     number of women and minority lawyers and judges, both alike, \n     have experienced bias in the courtroom?\n       Each day on the bench I learn something new about the \n     judicial process and about being a professional Latina woman \n     in a world that sometimes looks at me with suspicion. I am \n     reminded each day that I render decisions that affect people \n     concretely and that I owe them constant and complete \n     vigilance in checking my assumptions, presumptions and \n     perspectives and ensuring that to the extent that my limited \n     abilities and capabilities permit me, that I reevaluate them \n     and change as circumstances and cases before me requires. I \n     can and do aspire to be greater than the sum total of my \n     experiences but I accept my limitations. I willingly accept \n     that we who judge must not deny the differences resulting \n     from experience and heritage but attempt, as the Supreme \n     Court suggests, continuously to judge when those opinions, \n     sympathies and prejudices are appropriate.\n       There is always a danger embedded in relative morality, but \n     since judging is a series of choices that we must make, that \n     I am forced to make, I hope that I can make them by informing \n     myself on the questions I must not avoid asking and \n     continuously pondering. We, I mean all of us in this room, \n     must continue individually and in voices united in \n     organizations that have supported this conference, to think \n     about these questions and to figure out how we go about \n     creating the opportunity for there to be more women and \n     people of color on the bench so we can finally have \n     statistically significant numbers to measure the differences \n     we will and are making.\n       I am delighted to have been here tonight and extend once \n     again my deepest gratitude to all of you for listening and \n     letting me share my reflections on being a Latina voice on \n     the bench. Thank you.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brown pertaining to the introduction of S. 1343 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today the Senate considers the nomination \nof Harold Koh to be Legal Adviser to the Department of State. After \nreading his answers to dozens of questions, attending his hearing in \nits entirety, meeting with him privately, and reviewing his writings, I \nbelieve that Dean Koh is unquestionably qualified to assume the post \nfor which he is nominated. He has had a distinguished career as a \nteacher and advocate, and he is regarded widely as one of our Nation's \nmost accomplished experts on the theory and practice of international \nlaw. He also has served ably in our government as a Justice Department \nlawyer during the Reagan administration and as Assistant Secretary of \nState for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor from 1998 to 2001.\n  The committee has received innumerable letters of support for the \nnominee attesting to his character, his love of country, and his \nrespect for the law. He enjoys support from the lawyers with whom he \nhas worked, as well as those including former Solicitor General Kenneth \nStarr--whom he has litigated against.\n  Both in private meetings and in public testimony, Dean Koh has \naffirmed that he understands the parameters of his role as State \nDepartment Legal Adviser. He understands that his role will be to \nprovide policymakers objective advice on legal issues, not to be a \ncampaigner for particular policy outcomes. He also has affirmed that as \nLegal Adviser, he will be prepared to defend the policies and interests \nof the U.S. Government, even when they may be at odds with positions he \nhas taken in a private capacity. In applying laws relevant to the State \nDepartment's work, he has stated clearly that he will take account of \nand respect prior U.S. Government interpretations and practices under \nthose laws, rather than considering each such issue as a matter of \nfirst impression.\n  Finally, I believe Dean Koh respects the role of the Senate and the \nCongress on international legal matters, especially treaties. He has \npromised to consult with us regularly and fully, not just when treaties \ncome before the Senate, but also on the application of treaties on \nwhich the Senate has already provided advice and consent, including any \nproposed changes in the interpretation of such treaties.\n  Absent extraordinary circumstances, President Obama and Secretary of \nState Clinton should be able to choose the individuals on whom they \nwill depend for legal analysis, interpretation, and advice. Given Dean \nKoh's record of service and accomplishment, his personal character, his \nunderstanding of his role as Legal Adviser, and his commitment to work \nclosely with Congress, I support his nomination and believe he is well \ndeserving of confirmation by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 18 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             SHORT SELLING\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise again to speak out about the \nproblems in the financial markets caused by abusive short selling \nactivities, which includes naked short selling and rumor mongering. It \ncan also include abuse of the credit default market by planting false \nsuggestions that an issuer's survival is in doubt. My focus today, \nhowever, is on the first element--naked short selling.\n  Let me be clear about my main point. The public believes and the SEC \nhas yet to discount that the effects of abusive naked short selling \npractices helped cement the demise of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, \nas well as made it significantly harder for banks to raise critical \ncapital in the throes of this financial crisis. It is no exaggeration \nto say that abusive short\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\nselling at a critical moment further endangered our financial system \nand economy and thereby help lead to taxpayer bailouts that have \ntotaled hundreds of billions of dollars. We are still waiting for the \nSEC's enforcement response. It is likely we will continue to wait, as I \nwill discuss, because current rules are ineffective and unenforceable.\n  There is still a critical need for better SEC regulations that would \nhelp the enforcement division to do its job and stop naked short \nselling that is abusive and manipulative dead in its tracks.\n  Yes the SEC in April proposed five versions of a return to the uptick \nrule, which I believe never should have been repealed in the first \nplace, at least without putting something effective in its place. The \nuptick rule, which simply required stock traders to wait for an uptick \nin price before continuing to sell a stock short, was in effect for 70 \nyears--that is 7-0 years--until it was repealed in June of 2007. The \ncomment period for the reinstatement of some form of the prior uptick \nrule is complete, and it is disappointing, but not surprising, to see \nthat many on Wall Street now oppose that modest step. I continue to \nurge the SEC to move forward on that front.\n  As I have consistently maintained in my communications with the SEC, \nhowever, reinstating some form of the uptick rule alone puts too narrow \na frame on the problems associated with naked short selling. The \nproblem at its root is that the current rules against naked short \nselling are both inadequate and impossible to enforce. A strict \npreborrow requirement would address the problem and end it once and for \nall. Yet the SEC still has done nothing to propose a preborrower rule. \nIf we end up with no uptick rule and no preborrow requirement, the SEC \nwill be bending to the will of an industry that has shown recklessness \nbut clearly lacks remorse.\n  There is a fierce urgency to fix this problem. Today, the financial \nmarkets are teetering on the brink of either continuing with a bull \nmarket rally or falling back substantially in what would be the \ncontinuation of a severely painful bear market. If the markets of \ncertain stocks fall back precipitously again and if the bear market \nraiders act again using abusive naked short selling practices to damage \nand possibly destroy the stocks of banks and other companies, the SEC \nwill have a lot of explaining to do--unless we see responses from the \nagency in the near term.\n  I have been writing the SEC and talking about this issue on the \nSenate floor since March 3. It is now June 24, and the SEC has still \ndone nothing. It is time for the SEC to act.\n  Let me review the history of this issue and the evidence.\n  Naked short selling occurs when a trader sells a financial instrument \nshort without first borrowing it or even ensuring it can be borrowed. \nThis converts our securities and capital markets into nothing more than \ngambling casinos since the naked seller purports to sell something he \ndoesn't own, and may never own, in the expectation that prices of the \ninstruments sold will decline before ever settling the trade. Because \nthis activity requires no capital outlay, it also inspires naked short \nsellers to flood the market with false rumors to make the prediction a \nself-fulfilling one.\n  This practice often leads to fails to deliver. If the seller does not \nborrow the security in time to make delivery to the buyer within the \nstandard 3-day settlement period, the seller ``fails to deliver.'' \nSometimes fails to deliver can be caused by human or mechanical errors, \nbut those types of fails are only a small portion of the actual number \nof fails to deliver our markets confront continually.\n  Selling what you do not own and have not borrowed gives a seller a \nfree ride. It effectively says: Show me the money now and you will get \nyour stock sometime in the future. By analogy, it is very much like \ngiving access to the Super Bowl on the day of the game--in other words, \ngiving someone a ticket to the Super Bowl on the day of the game--in \nreturn for a promise that the spectator will ultimately produce a \nticket long after the big event has occurred.\n  It is well known that abusive short selling has been linked to the \ndownfall of two major financial firms--Bear Stearns and Lehman \nBrothers.\n  According to Bloomberg News:\n\n       Failed trades correlate with drops in share value, enough \n     to account for 30 to 70 percent of the declines in Bear \n     Stearns, Lehman, and other stocks last year.\n\n  Let me repeat that. ``Failed trades,'' according to Bloomberg News, \n``correlate with drops in share value, enough to account for 30 to 70 \npercent of the declines in Bear Stearns, Lehman, and other stocks last \nyear.''\n  The huge increase in naked short selling exacerbated the financial \ncrisis. Listen to this. In January 2007, 550 million shares failed to \ndeliver. By January 2008, 1.1 billion shares failed to deliver. And in \nJuly of 2008, 2 billion shares failed to deliver.\n  These fails to deliver drove stock value down further than the market \nwould have done by diluting stock prices. According to Clinton Under \nSecretary of Commerce Robert Shapiro in his recent comprehensive study:\n\n       Before Bear Stearns collapsed, its fails to deliver went \n     from less than 100,000 to 14 million, significantly diluting \n     the values of its stock.\n\n  As the Coalition Against Market Manipulation stated:\n\n       Just as counterfeit currency dilutes and destroys value, \n     these phantom shares deflate share prices by flooding the \n     market with false supply.\n\n  For example, according to EuroMoney, on March 14, 2008, ``128 percent \nof Bear Stearns' outstanding stock was traded.'' Let me repeat that. On \nMarch 14, 2008, 128 percent of Bear Stearns outstanding stock was \ntraded. How can more than 100 percent be traded? It can only occur \nbecause of the absence of required borrowers and naked short selling. \nWithout a preborrow requirement, in 1 day, multiple locates allow the \nsame single share of a stock to be sold over and over. And without \neffective rules or enforcement, millions of shares of stock are sold \nshort and not delivered as required.\n  Lehman Brothers also faced a similar abnormal increase in fails to \ndeliver before its collapse.\n  According to Bloomberg:\n\n       As Lehman Brothers struggled to survive last year, as many \n     as 32.8 million shares in the company were sold and not \n     delivered to buyers on time. . . .That was more than a 57-\n     fold increase over the prior year's peak of 567,518 failed \n     trades . . .\n\n  Many banks that help to drive the U.S. economy are particularly at \nrisk from abusive short selling practices due to the importance of \ninvestor confidence in maintaining their capital.\n  On September 19, 2008, the SEC implemented a temporary emergency \norder barring all short selling to protect 799 financial companies, \nwhich included many banks, because of the damage naked short selling \nhad done in destroying their company and investor values. But barring \nall short selling is like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. \nProper short selling provides the marketplace with greater liquidity \nand the prospect of meaningful price discovery.\n  Naked short selling practices led to market disequilibrium and the \nSEC recognizing that the only way to protect these companies from \nunnecessary devaluation was to implement a ban. Many of these companies \nlater moved under the Troubled Assets Relief Program, TARP.\n  While new regulations issued by the SEC last fall were the first \nsteps to protect companies, the SEC has not done nearly enough. If \nnaked short selling is not policed and rules against market \nmanipulation are not enforced effectively, naked short selling will \ncontinue to harm TARP banks and companies. If stronger regulations are \nnot implemented, abusive short selling will impair the government's \nability to invest taxpayer money into TARP banks and return them to \nhealth and thus limit the effects of the government's economic recovery \nplan.\n  The SEC began addressing these issues 10 years ago with a concept \nrelease that eventually became known as Regulation SHO, a set of rules \nthat has been amended several times. But a price extracted by \nRegulation SHO was the elimination of the 70-year-old uptick test.\n  Reg SHO intended to curb naked short selling by requiring would-be \nshort sellers to have merely a reasonable expectation they can deliver \nthe stock when it must be delivered and imposing a post-trade \nrequirement that would-be short sellers actually\n\n[[Page S6987]]\n\npreborrow securities for future trades only if too many fails have \nalready occurred. This is somewhat akin to a ``one free bite at the \napple'' approach, something regulators attempt to avoid. The reason is \nbecause, in practice, it turns out to be a ``free bite at the apple'' \neach time a manipulative trader switches brokers--something a \nmanipulative trader can easily do with no penalty.\n\n  But this rule has proved effectively unenforceable according to \nformer SEC Commissioner Roel Campos and others. Current SEC regulations \nallow traders to short a stock if the trader ``reasonably believes that \nit can locate and borrow the security by the settlement day.''\n  Reasonableness includes merely glancing at a list of easy to borrow \nstocks, with no need to continue to locate even if the list is faulty. \nLet me repeat. Reasonableness includes merely glancing at a list of \neasy to borrow stocks, with no need to continue to locate even if this \nlist is faulty. That rule, the mother of all loopholes, is much too \nvague to have any real effect. Any trader who passed Finance 101 could \nprovide proof that he or she ``reasonably believed'' the shorted stocks \ncould be located. In fact, the provision of a false locate is \nbeneficial for generating commissions on the trade.\n  Ultimately, many commentators and I believe the SEC cannot bring \ncases against the gravest violators of this rule, because it does not \nhave the means to prove intent. The rule is, in effect, unenforceable. \nThe SEC has, in fact, not brought a single enforcement case for naked \nshort selling. We must change the rules so the SEC Enforcement Division \ncan do its job.\n  Even former SEC Chairman Christopher Cox said the SEC is:\n\n     . . . concerned that the persistent failures to deliver in \n     the market for some securities may be due to loopholes in \n     Regulation SHO.\n\n  It is too difficult to prove a trader's motives necessary for proving \na fraud violation. I strongly believe the SEC needs to strengthen its \nrules, surveillance, and the enforcement regarding naked short selling \nto prevent market manipulation and loss of investor confidence.\n  Again, according to Robert Shapiro:\n\n     . . . there is considerable evidence that market manipulation \n     through the use of naked short sales has been much more \n     common than almost anyone has suspected, and certainly more \n     widespread than most investors believe.\n\n  Furthermore, indicators the SEC typically uses to determine the \neffects of abusive short selling do not accurately reflect the extent \nof the problem. The so-called Threshold List provided by the SEC tracks \nsustained fails to deliver of over 10,000 shares, accounting for at \nleast 5 percent of a company's outstanding shares.\n  According to Shapiro, this list does not capture the naked short \nsales that occur frequently that are under this threshold, and it does \nnot capture the large volume of short interests that can spike during \nthe 3-day settlement period. Nor does it capture any trades that occur \noutside of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, so-called ex-\nclearing trades.\n  Let us look to other countries. Other countries have taken proper \nsteps to make sure rules that prevent naked short selling are clear and \neasy to enforce. According to EuroMoney, naked short selling is:\n\n     . . . a situation specific to the U.S. markets.\n\n  Alan Cameron, head of clearing, settlement and custody client \nsolutions at BNP Paribas Securities Services in London, says he has \nseen little to indicate similar instances of fails to deliver in \nEurope. Some European countries such as Spain impose strict fines on \nfailures to deliver. It's not an issue here in Europe.\n  Therefore, I strongly believe that the SEC must adopt new policies in \norder to protect the damage to investor confidence and, yes, the damage \nto our economic recovery that is being caused by naked short selling.\n  Today, along with Senators Isakson and Tester, and Representative \nCarolyn Maloney, who cochairs the Joint Economic Committee, I wrote to \nSEC Chairman Mary Schapiro on this subject. Our letter urged that the \nCommission establish a pilot program to study whether a strict \npreborrow agreement would work effectively to end the problem of naked \nshort selling. Such a pilot program would lead to the collection of \ndata about stock lending and borrowing and the costs and benefits of \nimposing a preborrow requirement on all short sales.\n  Recently, Senators Levin, Grassley, and Specter, in connection with \nthe release of a General Accountability Office study analyzing recent \nSEC actions to curb abusive short selling, called for the SEC to \nconsider imposing a strict preborrow requirement on short sales as the \nbest way to end abusive short selling.\n  I strongly agree. As I have said, a preborrow requirement would \naddress the problem at its most fundamental level and it should be \nurgently considered by the SEC as it rethinks its regulations and \nenforcement approach in this area.\n  Moreover, the system by which stocks currently are loaned and \nborrowed can and should be greatly improved, improving efficiency and \nproducing cost savings. For example, centralized systems for loaning \nand borrowing stocks might better enable the SEC to impose fair rules \non stock loans and borrowers in connection with short sales as well as \nenhance the SEC's ability to provide regulatory oversight to prevent \nnaked short selling.\n  As one commentator has written in EuroMoney in December 2008, the:\n\n     . . . SEC knows it has to introduce the pre-borrow rule if it \n     wants to eliminate fails to deliver for good. As long as \n     there are companies on the Regulation SHO list, then the \n     problem is not being solved. The only sustainable solution to \n     making naked short-selling is a rule requiring both pre-\n     borrow and a hard delivery. . . . for Bear Stearns: only a \n     pre-borrow could put a brake on the naked short-selling.\n\n  I urge the SEC to invite a balanced group of commentators, including \nmembers of the investing public, to air these issues publicly as it \ncontinues efforts to draft and promulgate additional rules to end \nabusive short selling.\n  I know there are critics of a preborrow requirement who claim it \nwould limit liquidity. This is not so, and there is no meaningful \nevidence to support this argument. Indeed, the recent study by Robert \nShapiro disproves the claim. Other knowledgable sources, such as Harvey \nPitt, former SEC Chairman and founder of LendEQS, an electronic stock \nloan transaction firm, believe the opposite would occur, because \nlending would increase.\n  In Hong Kong, the imposition of a preborrow requirement has been \nquite successful. Hong Kong implemented the preborrow rule after the \nAsian financial crisis of 1997 to 1998, when its markets collapsed. In \nlate 2008, while the United States saw an exponential increase in fails \nto deliver, Hong Kong avoided large spikes in short sales almost \ncompletely. Other countries, such as Australia and many other EU \nmembers, have also successfully maintained preborrow requirements for \nyears. The United States must urgently address the issue of abusive \nshort selling. If we want to protect our markets, investors, and \ncompanies from caustic manipulation, we need better rules.\n  In closing, I urge the SEC to act decisively, both by following \nthrough and reimposing the substance of the prior uptick rule and \nthrough a pilot program to study the effects of a strict preborrow \nrequirement. It is way past time to put an end to naked short selling, \nonce and for all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the importance \nof the tourism industry to our country and the State of South Carolina, \nand to express my support for the passage of initiatives like the \nTravel Promotion Act of 2009 and a spouse travel tax deduction that \nseek to bolster an industry that is a vital component to the economies \nof so many communities and States.\n  South Carolina is home to some of the most unique destinations for \nleisure or business travel in the world. From the trails of Table Rock \nMountain in the Blue Ridge, to the quaint mill villages throughout the \nSouth Carolina National Heritage Corridor, to a kayak excursion in the \nCongaree Swamp National Park, to a horse carriage ride through the \nstreets of historic Charleston, the Palmetto State is a wealth of \nnatural, cultural, recreational and historic opportunities for any \nvisitor. Golf Digest magazine selected 11 of South Carolina's more than \n500 golf courses as some of the top 100 public courses in the Nation \nfor 2009. Conde Nast Traveler magazine named Charleston as the No. 2 \ndestination in the country, rounding out 16 consecutive years as one of \nthe magazine's top 10 travel destinations in America. The list goes on. \nThe one-of-a-kind history, landscape and culture of our State help all \nvisitors to understand our pride in the motto ``Smiling Faces, \nBeautiful Places.''\n  The sum of these treasures is an economic engine that drives the \nprosperity of our State. The tourism industry is the second largest \nindustry in the State of South Carolina. In 2007, the industry \ngenerated $17.2 billion and employed more than 12 percent of the \nState's workforce. Not only does tourism generate more than $100 \nbillion in tax revenue and employ more than 7 million individuals \nnationwide, but the industry also encourages investment, attracts new \nbusiness, and enhances the quality of life for local residents. Tourism \nis truly the lifeblood for many communities not only in South Carolina \nbut throughout America.\n  Unfortunately, the economic downturn is taking its toll on the \ntourism industry. I remain concerned with the impact that the recession \ncontinues to have on the decisions of domestic and international \nleisure travelers, and on business meetings travel. Families and \nindividuals are tightening their belts, afraid to spend hard-earned \nmoney in an unpredictable economy that could still worsen. \nInternational travel to the United States has declined since September \n11, 2001, despite the weak dollar enabling most overseas travelers to \ndo and see even more in our country.\n  Domestic business travel accounts for about one-fifth of all trips to \nSouth Carolina each year. More and more companies are hesitant to book \nperfectly legitimate corporate meetings and conferences in destinations \nlike Greenville and the South Carolina coast for fear that they will be \nsingled out for irresponsible spending during an economic recession. \nAccording to a Meetings and Conventions magazine study, more than half \nof those interviewed believed that recent harsh criticism against \nmeetings and events has influenced their companies' decisions to hold \nsuch events. We must not allow the irresponsible behavior of some to \ndamage public opinion regarding business travel for responsible \norganizations.\n  In the first 3 months of 2009, hotel occupancy in South Carolina was \ndown more than 12 percent, with losses in all of our traditional \ntourist and business meeting destinations. Tourism-related tax revenue \nis down 5 percent from this time last year. These are only a couple of \nreal numbers that directly impact employment and local economies in \nSouth Carolina, a State currently suffering from one of the highest \nunemployment rates in the Nation at 12.1 percent.\n  While I believe the economy will rebound eventually, consumer \nconfidence is not showing sufficient signs of improvement. We must \nencourage international travelers, Americans, and American business to \ncontinue to travel for leisure and to hold appropriate destination \ncorporate meetings and conferences, despite the downturn in the \neconomy. I remain committed to exploring new ways to accomplish this \ngoal in the U.S. Senate.\n  I recently signed on as a cosponsor to S. 1023, the Travel Promotion \nAct, as I believe it is a significant step in restoring and encouraging \noverseas travel to the United States. While I supported a measure for \nthe Senate to proceed to this legislation last week, I was unable to \nsupport cloture on S. 1023 as I do not believe the majority provided \nthe minority with sufficient opportunity to offer amendments. My vote \nwas unrelated to the substance of the legislation, and I am \ndisappointed that the Senate was unable to complete action on the bill \nthis week.\n  The Travel Promotion Act facilitates collaboration between various \nstakeholders in the tourism industry so that they may share ideas on \nhow best to promote travel to America. South Carolina welcomes about 1 \nmillion international travelers each year. While this number may be low \ncompared to other tourism destinations, overall South Carolina benefits \ngreatly from their visits as international travelers tend to stay \nlonger and spend more in our hotels, restaurants, shops, cultural sites \nand more. Through this legislation, I am hopeful that efforts to \nencourage travel to our country will benefit South Carolina.\n  To encourage business travel nationally, I authored legislation, S. \n261, which would allow for a spouse to deduct travel expenses such as \ntransportation, food and lodging expenses, when traveling with his or \nher spouse on business travel. Business travel accounts for more than \n20 percent of all travel in South Carolina. I strongly believe that \nrestoring this tax deduction would encourage additional travel and \nsubsequent exploration of work-travel destinations. It is my hope that \nCongress will act on this legislation in a timely manner.\n  Now is an opportune time to travel, as nearly all tourism \ndestinations are offering packages and deals to entice families and \ncorporate meetings to choose their respective areas. Hotel rates are \nsome of the lowest we have seen in years, while gas prices remain \naffordable. I am hopeful that families and corporations will take \nadvantage of this opportunity, and consider South Carolina for their \nnext destination.\n  It is vital that Congress recognize the importance of the tourism \nindustry to our country, and encourage all Americans to continue to \ntravel. I look forward to working with my colleagues on new ways to \nsupport the tourism industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/24/senate-section/article/S6988-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6988-S6989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                COMMENDING MAJOR GENERAL THOMAS F. DEPPE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I join my colleague Senator \nTester in recognizing and paying tribute to MG Thomas F. Deppe, Vice \nCommander of Air Force Space Command, and his wife Eileen for their \nlifetime of service and unfaltering dedication to the U.S. Air Force \nand our great Nation.\n  As both an airman and leader, spanning 42 years of military service, \nGeneral Deppe's contributions to our Nation's strategic deterrence and \nspace\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\nmissions were critical to the warfighter, global economy and safety of \nour families. General Deppe's leadership was an essential element in \nwinning the Cold War and vital to Air Force Space Command's support of \ncombat operations around the world to include Operations Enduring \nFreedom, Iraqi Freedom, the global war on terrorism and overseas \ncontingency operations.\n  General Deppe began his illustrious Air Force career by graduating \nfrom Basic Military Training School in 1967. In September of 1967, \nGeneral Deppe was introduced to the Air Force through missile \ninstrumentation electronics technical training. This training led to a \nseries of aircraft munitions assignments and rounded out his enlisted \nservice with an Air Force recruiting position, achieving the enlisted \nrank of technical sergeant. In 1977, General Deppe received his \ncommission through the Officer Training School. This led him to his \nfirst assignment in Montana at Malmstrom Air Force Base. General \nDeppe's Air Force journey as an officer would take Eileen and him \nthrough a series of wing, air staff and joint assignments relating to \nstrategic and tactical missile and space systems. He operated the \nground-launched cruise missile in Europe and later served as the \ncommander of the 351st Organizational Missile Maintenance Squadron in \nMissouri at Whiteman Air Force Base. Additionally, he commanded the \n90th Logistics Group at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, WY, and the \n341st Space Wing in Montana. While assigned to the National Military \nCommand Center, he directed actions during the early days of Operation \nIraqi Freedom and the Space Shuttle Columbia recovery effort.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, General Deppe went on to command the Air \nForce's land-based strategic deterrent force at 20th Air Force in \nWyoming before his present assignment as the Vice Commander of Air \nForce Space Command.\n  During General Deppe's tenure as Vice Commander, Air Force Space \nCommand, he provided inspirational leadership to over 39,000 personnel \nresponsible for a global network of satellite command and control, \ncommunications, missile warning, and space launch facilities and \nensured the combat readiness of America's ICBM force. Exploiting his \nunique blend of operational experience and staffing acumen, General \nDeppe championed the implementation of a new management headquarters \nconstruct through Air Force Space Command's ``Lanes-In-The Road'' \ninitiative. The results clearly aligned the command's headquarters \norganizations with its own functional concepts as well as the \noperational mission areas outlined in the U.S. Air Force Concept of \nOperations. In addition, he guaranteed the future viability of the Air \nForce Nuclear Enterprise by driving major system revitalization \ninitiatives, to include the Air Force chief of staff-approved creation \nof an ICBM weapons instructor course at the U.S. Air Force Weapons \nSchool. He was instrumental in successfully implementing visionary \nspace mission area initiatives with wide-ranging national and \ninternational implications, to include the launch and range enterprise \ntransformation effort, the commercial and foreign entities support \npilot program and the operational expansion of on-orbit global \npositioning system and wideband global satellite communications \ncapabilities. Finally, General Deppe oversaw the command's lead role to \nstand-up the 24th Air Force to execute the Air Force's cyberspace \nmission.\n  General Deppe's impeccable service is characterized by his Master \nMissileer Badge, Command Space Badge, Space Professional Level III \ncertification, operational space experience in nuclear operations and \nspacelift, weapon systems expertise in the Minuteman II, Minuteman III \nand Peacekeeper ICBMs, Hound Dog and Quail Air-Launched Cruise \nMissiles, the Ground-Launched Cruise Missile and the Atlas III, Titan \nIV, Delta II and Delta III boosters.\n  Today Senator Baucus and I have mentioned but a few of MG Thomas F. \nDeppe's many achievements.

Mr. Presdient, I am pleased to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of the community of Richvale, CA. In 1909, settlers from \nthe Midwest began to arrive by train and horse-drawn carriages to this \ntown with hopes of creating a close-knit community. Over the last \ncentury, Richvale has grown from a small settlement town of a few \nfamilies to the heart of rice country in northern California.\n  As families settled in this small Butte County town in the early \n1900s, California's rice industry began to take shape. Richvale became \nan early producer of rice in the State with the support of local \nchurches, general stores, and blacksmith shops. The strong sense of \ncommunity, as well as ideal soil and climate conditions, led to the \nsuccess of the region's dominance in growing rice. The Richvale \ncommunity worked together closely to develop irrigation systems, soil \nimprovement, conservation techniques, and formed cooperatives with \ntheir neighbors to store and dry their crops to increase their yields \nand fight agricultural-related pests and diseases. These practices \nserved as a model for other rice growers as the industry began to grow \nthroughout the Upper Sacramento Valley. The Rice Experiment Station, \nthat has been in operation since 1912 and conducts innovative rice \nimprovement research and seed production, is located just south of \nRichvale and is credited with much of the California rice industry's \ninternational success.\n  Richvale's thriving commercial rice production continued as many of \nthe men went to serve their country during World Wars I and II. The \nwomen of Richvale kept the industry alive by taking control of the \nresponsibilities that included the day-to-day work, as well as the \nbusiness side of the farming operations.\n  Richvale continues to thrive as a cornerstone in California's rice \ncountry, while still maintaining their smalltown character that drew \nearly settlers to the region. I commend the Richvale community for \ntheir success in both the rice industry and for serving as an example \nof the success that a small community of dedicated neighbors can \naccomplish when they come together around a common goal. I wish \nRichvale another 100 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/24/senate-section/article/S6989-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING BALLARD HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

ABERNATHY\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask my fellow colleagues to join \nme in honoring the memory of a dedicated servant and leader, Warren H. \nAbernathy. After a lifetime of unprecedented service to his State and \nNation as a World War II veteran and a 49-year staffer of Senator Strom \nThurmond, Mr. Abernathy passed away in Spartanburg, SC, on June 22, \n2009, at the age of 85.\n\n       While he will be remembered by most as a ``private man who \n     wanted to make a difference,'' I will remember him as a \n     larger than life figure who greeted everyone with a smile. He \n     was a World War II veteran who was prepared to make the \n     ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our freedom. After a lifetime \n     of duty, he retired as colonel with the U.S. Army Reserves.\n\n  Born and raised in Spartanburg, Mr. Abernathy attended Spartanburg \nHigh School, Wofford College, and graduated from Spartanburg Methodist \nCollege and the University of South Carolina. He later received a \nmaster's in business administration from Command and General Staff \nCollege at Fort Leavenworth, KS, and in September of 1992 he received \nan honorary doctorate of humane letters from Voorhees College in \nDenmark, SC.\n  In 1948 he began working for then-Governor J. Strom Thurmond as his \nadministrative assistant. When Governor Thurmond was elected Senator \nThurmond, Mr. Abernathy transitioned with him and served as the \nSenator's State assistant for 49 years. Mr. Abernathy also served as \nthe former secretary-treasurer of the Strom Thurmond Foundation, a U.S. \nmarshall, a member of the Civil Service, an honorary member of the \nSouth Carolina Law Enforcement Division, and in 2007 the Spartanburg \nCounty Bar Association awarded him the E. C. Burnett, III, Contribution \nto Law and Justice Award for his contributions as a nonlawyer to the \noverall improvement of the legal system in Spartanburg County.\n  In addition to his time in politics, Mr. Abernathy was an active \nmember of the Southside Baptist Church where he participated in the \nLayman's Sunday school class and served as a former deacon. In 1997 a \nportion of highway 29 in Spartanburg, SC, was renamed Warren H. \nAbernathy Highway by the Department of Transportation in honor of his \nservice. And after decades of serving South Carolina, Mr. Abernathy was \nawarded the Order of the Palmetto from Governor David Beasley on April \n13, 1998.\n  Mr. Abernathy, the husband of the late Margaretta Scruggs Abernathy, \nis survived by family and friends who are rightfully proud of a well-\nlived life in service of his fellow man.\n  I ask that the U.S. Senate join me in commemorating Mr. Abernathy's \nlifelong dedication to service to our country and to the State of South \nCarolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/24/senate-section/article/S6991-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DETROIT RESCUE MISSION MINISTRIES\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

The DRMM has waged this important fight by bringing together \na variety of interested parties throughout southeastern Michigan, as \nwell as a wealth of resources. By coordinating 50,000 donors, 120 \nfaith-based organizations, and multiple State, county, and local \ngovernment agencies, the DRMM has galvanized the community support \nnecessary to make a significant difference in the lives of \nMichiganders.\n  The DRMM has played a central role in the rehabilitation of countless \nindividuals in Metro Detroit. The DRMM provides basic necessities for \nat-risk individuals while fostering a desire to rebuild their lives. \nThis organization offers critical services in the form of emergency, \ntransitional, and permanent housing; psychological and spiritual \ncounseling; substance abuse treatment; and emergency food and clothing. \nEach year, the DRMM provides 1 million nutritious meals at seven local \nfacilities; more than 160,000 nights of emergency shelter; 75,000 \nclothing items; and substance abuse treatment for thousands of men and \nwomen.\n  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating all who have \ncontributed to the important work of the Detroit Rescue Mission \nMinistries over the years, and I look forward to another century of \ncommitment to the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/24/senate-section/article/S6991-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6991-S6992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMENDING WILD OATS BAKERY & CAFE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I recognize a small business \nin my home State of Maine that admirably embodies the ideal dichotomy \nof being both a successful business and a well-regarded member of the \ncommunity. Wild Oats Bakery & Cafe, an independently-owned dining \nestablishment located in Brunswick, also provides guests with a \nquintessentially New England experience, as Yankee Magazine recently \nrecognized the restaurant with the ``Best Taste of Home'' Editor's \nChoice award in its annual Best of New England listing.\n  Opened in October 1991 by owners Becky and David Shepherd, Wild Oats \nBakery & Cafe has remained a consistent purveyor of fresh, homemade \nfoods for nearly two decades, resulting in its immense popularity among \nthe local community and area Bowdoin College students. Located inside \nthe Tontine Mall in downtown Brunswick, Wild Oats has grown from a 5-\nemployee operation to its current crew of over 20. Additionally, Wild \nOats has doubled the size of its space, and has added a deck and patio \nfor dining during the beautiful Maine summer, all the while maintaining \na cozy and personable atmosphere.\n  With a menu that includes baked goods, breads, soups and chowders, \nsalads, sandwiches, entrees, desserts, as well as frozen meals to bring \nhome, Wild Oats offers patrons an appealing variety of delicious, made-\nfrom-scratch products to suit a diverse array of taste buds. To support \nanother Maine small business, Wild Oats sells Carrabassett Coffee, \nproduced in the western Maine town of Kingfield. The company has also \nlaunched a unique delivery service to nearby Bowdoin College, where \nparents can surprise their sons and daughters with a delectable \nbirthday cake accompanied by a Wild Oats coffee mug, water bottle, or \nt-shirt.\n  From the beginning, Wild Oats has strived to make customer service \nthe top priority and has consistently sought innovative ways to better \nserve its customers. These efforts have certainly not gone unnoticed as \nWild Oats has become an increasingly integral part of the local \ncommunity. In fact, Wild Oats' most recent distinction as the ``Best \nTaste of Home for 2009'' is just one of several awards the restaurant \nhas garnered in recent years. Last year, the company was named Small \nBusiness of the Year by the Southern Midcoast Chamber of Commerce. This \naward came six months after it was acknowledged with the Small Business \nLeadership Award by Governor John Baldacci for the firm's 16-year \nhistory of employing persons with disabilities. The Shepherds have \npartnered with several Midcoast organizations, including Independence \nAssociation and Work Enterprises, to hire workers with disabilities \nover the years.\n  While the Shepherds operate and own Wild Oats, they are the first to \npoint out that they rely heavily on their stellar and experienced \nemployees, an extended family that they include in many decision making \nand leadership opportunities. Among them is Louisa Edgerton, the \nstore's manager, who has been with Wild Oats since 1997 and brought \nover 20 years in the food service industry with her. Another notable \nemployee is Frank Golek. Frank, who assists with food preparation and \ncleaning, has worked at the restaurant since 1996, affording him the \ndistinction of the longest serving Wild Oats employee.\n  Wild Oats' commitment to the local community goes beyond serving\n\n[[Page S6992]]\n\nscrumptious lunches, dinners, and sweets. Both Becky and David \nShepherd, who have lived in Brunswick since 1981, have been active \nmembers of the local community for many years. Becky has served on the \nBrunswick school and library boards, and both donate significant time \nand money to various community based projects both locally and \nthroughout Maine, particularly regarding education and the environment.\n  A mainstay of the Brunswick downtown for nearly two decades, Wild \nOats Bakery & Cafe is a unique restaurant that has assuredly earned its \nexceptional reputation for quality service and delicious cuisine. I \noffer my sincerest congratulations to Becky and David Shepherd and \neveryone at Wild Oats Bakery & Cafe on their well-deserved \naccomplishments, and I wish them many years of continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/24/senate-section/article/S6991-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6991-S6992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMENDING WILD OATS BAKERY & CAFE\n\n Ms. SNOWE.

The company has also \nlaunched a unique delivery service to nearby Bowdoin College, where \nparents can surprise their sons and daughters with a delectable \nbirthday cake accompanied by a Wild Oats coffee mug, water bottle, or \nt-shirt.\n  From the beginning, Wild Oats has strived to make customer service \nthe top priority and has consistently sought innovative ways to better \nserve its customers. These efforts have certainly not gone unnoticed as \nWild Oats has become an increasingly integral part of the local \ncommunity. In fact, Wild Oats' most recent distinction as the ``Best \nTaste of Home for 2009'' is just one of several awards the restaurant \nhas garnered in recent years. Last year, the company was named Small \nBusiness of the Year by the Southern Midcoast Chamber of Commerce. This \naward came six months after it was acknowledged with the Small Business \nLeadership Award by Governor John Baldacci for the firm's 16-year \nhistory of employing persons with disabilities. The Shepherds have \npartnered with several Midcoast organizations, including Independence \nAssociation and Work Enterprises, to hire workers with disabilities \nover the years.\n  While the Shepherds operate and own Wild Oats, they are the first to \npoint out that they rely heavily on their stellar and experienced \nemployees, an extended family that they include in many decision making \nand leadership opportunities. Among them is Louisa Edgerton, the \nstore's manager, who has been with Wild Oats since 1997 and brought \nover 20 years in the food service industry with her. Another notable \nemployee is Frank Golek. Frank, who assists with food preparation and \ncleaning, has worked at the restaurant since 1996, affording him the \ndistinction of the longest serving Wild Oats employee.\n  Wild Oats' commitment to the local community goes beyond serving\n\n[[Page S6992]]\n\nscrumptious lunches, dinners, and sweets. Both Becky and David \nShepherd, who have lived in Brunswick since 1981, have been active \nmembers of the local community for many years. Becky has served on the \nBrunswick school and library boards, and both donate significant time \nand money to various community based projects both locally and \nthroughout Maine, particularly regarding education and the environment.\n  A mainstay of the Brunswick downtown for nearly two decades, Wild \nOats Bakery & Cafe is a unique restaurant that has assuredly earned its \nexceptional reputation for quality service and delicious cuisine. I \noffer my sincerest congratulations to Becky and David Shepherd and \neveryone at Wild Oats Bakery & Cafe on their well-deserved \naccomplishments, and I wish them many years of continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/24/senate-section/article/S6992-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/24/senate-section/article/S6992-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/24/senate-section/article/S6992-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13466 OF JUNE 26, 2008, WITH \n   RESPECT TO THE CURRENT EXISTENCE AND RISK OF THE PROLIFERATION OF \n     WEAPONS-USABLE FISSILE MATERIAL ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA--PM 26\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Thousands of rescue workers who responded to the areas \n     devastated by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     local residents, office and area workers, and school children \n     continue to suffer significant medical problems as a result \n     of compromised air quality and the release of other toxins \n     from the attack sites.\n       (2) In a September 2006 peer-reviewed study conducted by \n     the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program, of 9,500 \n     World Trade Center responders, almost 70 percent of World \n     Trade Center responders had a new or worsened respiratory \n     symptom that developed during or after their time working at \n     the World Trade Center; among the responders who were \n     asymptomatic before September 11, 2001, 61 percent developed \n     respiratory symptoms while working at the World Trade Center; \n     close to 60 percent still had a new or worsened respiratory \n     symptom at the time of their examination; one-third had \n     abnormal pulmonary function tests; and severe respiratory \n     conditions including pneumonia were significantly more common \n     in the 6 months after September 11, 2001 than in the prior 6 \n     months.\n       (3) An April 2006 study documented that, on average, a New \n     York City firefighter who responded to the World Trade Center \n     has experienced a loss of 12 years of lung capacity.\n       (4) A peer-reviewed study of residents who lived near the \n     World Trade Center titled ``The World Trade Center Residents' \n     Respiratory Health Study: New Onset Respiratory Symptoms and \n     Pulmonary Function'', found that data demonstrated a three \n     fold increase in new-onset, persistent lower respiratory \n     symptoms in residents near the former World Trade Center as \n     compared to a control population.\n       (5) Previous research on the health impacts of the \n     devastation caused by the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks has shown relationships between the air quality from \n     Ground Zero and a host of health impacts, including lower \n     pregnancy rates, higher rates of respiratory and lung \n     disorders, and a variety of post-disaster mental health \n     conditions (including posttraumatic stress disorder) in \n     workers and residents near Ground Zero.\n       (6) A variety of tests conducted by independent scientists \n     have concluded that significant World Trade Center (WTC) \n     contamination settled in indoor environments surrounding the \n     disaster site. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) \n     cleanup programs for indoor residential spaces, in 2003 and \n     2005, though limited, are an acknowledgment that indoor \n     contamination continued after the WTC attacks.\n       (7) At the request of the Department of Energy, the Davis \n     DELTA Group at the University of California conducted outdoor \n     dust sampling in October 2001 at Varick and Houston Streets \n     (approximately 1.2 miles north of Ground Zero) and found that \n     the contamination from the World Trade Center ``outdid even \n     the worst pollution from the Kuwait oil fields fires''. \n     Further, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported \n     on November 27, 2001, that dust samples collected from indoor \n     surfaces in this area registered at levels that were ``as \n     caustic as liquid drain cleaners''.\n       (8) According to both the EPA's own Inspector General's \n     (EPA IG) report of August 21, 2003 and the Governmental \n     Accountability Offices's (GAO) report of September 2007, no \n     comprehensive program has ever been conducted in order to \n     characterize the full extent of WTC contamination, and \n     therefore the full impact of that contamination-- geographic \n     or otherwise--remains unknown.\n       (9) Such reports found that there has never been a \n     comprehensive program to remediate WTC toxins from indoor \n     spaces. Thus, area residents, workers and students may \n     continued to be exposed to WTC contamination in their homes, \n     workplaces and schools.\n       (10) Because of the failure to release federally \n     appropriated funds for community care, a lack of sufficient \n     outreach, the fact that many community members are receiving \n     care from physicians outside the current City-funded World \n     Trade Center Environmental Health Center program and thus \n     fall outside data collection efforts, and other factors, the \n     number of community members being treated at the World Trade \n     Center Environmental Health Center underrepresents the total \n     number in the community that have been affected by exposure \n     to Ground Zero toxins.\n       (11) Research by Columbia University's Center for \n     Children's Environmental Health has shown negative health \n     effects on babies born to women living within 2 miles of the \n     World Trade Center in the month following September 11, 2001.\n       (12) Federal funding allocated for the monitoring of rescue \n     workers' health is not sufficient to ensure the long-term \n     study of health impacts of September 11, 2001.\n       (13) A significant portion of those who have developed \n     health problems as result of exposures to airborne toxins or \n     other hazards resulting from the September 11, 2001, attacks \n     on the World Trade Center have no health insurance, have lost \n     their health insurance as a result of the attacks, or have \n     inadequate health insurance.\n       (14) The Federal program to provide medical treatments to \n     those who responded to\n\n[[Page S6996]]\n\n     the September 11, 2001, aftermath, and who continue to \n     experience health problems as a result, was finally \n     established more than five years after the attacks, but has \n     no certain long-term funding.\n       (15) Rescue workers and volunteers seeking workers' \n     compensation have reported that their applications have been \n     denied, delayed for months, or redirected, instead of \n     receiving assistance in a timely and supportive manner.\n       (16) A February 2007 report released by the City of New \n     York estimated that approximately 410,000 people were the \n     most heavily exposed to the environmental hazards and trauma \n     of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. More than 30 \n     percent of the Fire Department of the City of New York first \n     responders were still experiencing some respiratory symptoms \n     more than five years after the attacks and, according to the \n     report, 59 percent of those seen by the WTC Environmental \n     Health Center at Bellevue Hospital (which serves community \n     members) are without insurance and 65 percent have incomes of \n     less than $15,000 per year. The report also found a need to \n     continue and expand mental health services.\n       (17) Since the 5th anniversary of the attack (September 11, \n     2006), hundreds of workers a month have been signing up with \n     the monitoring and treatment programs.\n       (18) In April 2008, the Department of Health and Human \n     Services reported to Congress that in fiscal year 2007 11,359 \n     patients received medical treatment in the existing WTC \n     Responder Medical and Treatment program for WTC-related \n     health problems, and that number of responders who need \n     treatment and the severity of health problems is expected to \n     increase.\n       (19) The September 11 Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 was \n     established to provide compensation to individuals who were \n     physically injured or killed as a result of the terrorist-\n     related aircraft crashes of September 11, 2001.\n       (20) The deadline for filing claims for compensation under \n     the Victim Compensation Fund was December 22, 2003.\n       (21) Some individuals did not know they were eligible to \n     file claims for compensation for injuries or did not know \n     they had suffered physical harm as a result of the terrorist-\n     related aircraft crashes until after the December 22, 2003, \n     deadline.\n       (22) Further research is needed to evaluate more \n     comprehensively the extent of the health impacts of September \n     11, 2001, including research for emerging health problems \n     such as cancer, which have been predicted.\n       (23) Research is needed regarding possible treatment for \n     the illnesses and injuries of September 11, 2001.\n       (24) The Federal response to medical and financial issues \n     arising from the September 11, 2001, response efforts needs a \n     comprehensive, coordinated long-term response in order to \n     meet the needs of all the individuals who were exposed to the \n     toxins of Ground Zero and are suffering health problems from \n     the disaster.\n       (25) The failure to extend the appointment of Dr. John \n     Howard as Director of the National Institute for Occupational \n     Safety and Health in July 2008 is not in the interests of the \n     administration of such Institute nor the continued operation \n     of the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment \n     Program which he has headed, and the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services should reconsider extending such appointment.\n\n               TITLE I--WORLD TRADE CENTER HEALTH PROGRAM\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to exempt children of certain Filipino World War II \nveterans from the numerical limitations on immigrant visas; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am introducing the Filipino Veterans \nFamily Reunification Act of 2009. I am pleased that my colleagues, \nSenators Inouye, Kennedy and Cantwell, have joined me in introducing \nthis bill. Our bill will reunite Filipino World War II veterans who are \nU.S. citizens and U.S. residents with their children in the \nPhilippines, who have languished for years on the visa waiting list. In \nseeking an exemption from the numerical limitation on immigrant visas \nfor the children of the Filipino veterans, our bill will address and \nresolve an issue rooted in a set of historical circumstances that are \nnow nearly 7 decades old.\n  In 1934, the Philippines, an American possession since 1898, was \nplaced on the path to independence. The enactment of the Philippine \nIndependence Act established the Philippines as a commonwealth with \ncertain powers over its internal affairs but with the United States \nretaining sovereign power. It also set a 10-year timetable for the \ncommonwealth's independence from the U.S.\n  In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to Japan's \nincreasingly aggressive military posture in Asia and the Pacific by \nissuing a presidential order that called and ordered into the service \nof the Armed Forces of the United States all of the organized military \nforces of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. The authority for this \npresidential order was the Philippine Independence Act, which retained \nfor the United States sovereign power over the commonwealth. \nAccordingly, over 200,000 Filipinos were drafted into the United States \narmed forces, and served honorably during World War II.\n  In 1942, Congress passed the Second War Powers Act, including \nSections 701 and 702, Nationality Act of 1940, which authorized the \nnaturalization of all aliens serving in the U.S. armed forces. Pursuant \nto this act, about 7,000 Filipinos serving in the U.S. armed forces \noutside the Philippines became U.S. citizens. Naturalization of the \nFilipinos who had served in the U.S. armed forces in the Philippines \nbegan in Manila in August 1945, but was halted two months later when \nthe American vice consul's naturalization authority was revoked.\n  At the time, U.S. officials indicated that the government of the \nCommonwealth of the Philippines had expressed concerns that the \nnaturalization, and likely emigration to the U.S., of the Filipino \nveterans would drain the soon-to-be-independent Philippines of \nessential manpower and undermine the new nation's postwar \nreconstruction efforts. Others, however, believed this was a pretext \nfor what came to be known as the Rescissions Act of 1946.\n  In February and May 1946, the 79th Congress passed the First \nSupplemental Surplus Appropriations Rescission Act, PL 79-301, and the \nSecond Supplemental Surplus Appropriations Rescission Act, PL 79-391, \nrespectively. Now collectively known as the Rescissions Act of 1946, PL \n79-301 authorized a $200 million appropriation to the Commonwealth Army \nof the Philippines conditioned on a provision that service in the \nCommonwealth Army of the Phillippines should not be deemed to have been \nservice in the active military or air service of the U.S.\n  It would take Congress more than four decades to acknowledge that the \nFilipino World War II veterans had, indeed, served in the U.S. armed \nforces.\n\n[[Page S7007]]\n\nThe Immigration Act of 1990 included a provision that offered the \nopportunity to obtain U.S. citizenship to those Filipino veterans who \nhad not been naturalized pursuant to the Nationality Act of 1940. And \nnineteen years later, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARRA, \nof 2009 included a provision that authorized the payment of benefits to \nthe 30,000 surviving Filipino veterans in the amount of $15,000 for \nthose who are citizens and $9,000 for those who are non-citizens.\n  Of the 30,000 surviving Filipino World War II veterans, 7,000 are \nU.S. citizens and reside in this country. Many of these U.S. citizens \nfiled visa petitions for their children, who remained in the \nPhilippines. Now in their eighties and nineties, these men continue to \nwait for their children, who languish on the visa waiting lists, to \njoin them. The Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act exempts the \nveterans' children, about 20,000 individuals in all, from the numerical \nlimitation on immigrant visas. It does not require any appropriation \nand will serve to not only reunite these veterans with their children, \nbut also honor their too-long-forgotten World War II service to this \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1337\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EXEMPTION FROM IMMIGRANT VISA LIMIT.\n\n       Section 201(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1151(b)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(F) Aliens who are eligible for a visa under paragraph \n     (1) or (3) of section 203(a) and who have a parent who was \n     naturalized pursuant to section 405 of the Immigration Act of \n     1990 (Public Law 101-649; 8 U.S.C. 1440 note).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 1340. A bill to establish a minimum funding level for programs \nunder the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 for fiscal years 2010 to 2014 \nthat ensures a reasonable growth in victim programs without \njeopardizing the long-term sustainability of the Crime Victims Fund; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Crapo to \nintroduce the Crime Victims Fund Preservation Act of 2009, which would \nrestore and increase critical funding for direct services and \ncompensation to victims of crime under the Victims of Crime Act.\n  I was honored to support the passage of the Victims of Crime Act of \n1984, VOCA, which has been the principal means by which the Federal \nGovernment has supported essential services for crime victims and their \nfamilies. The Victims of Crime Act provides grants for direct services \nto victims, such as state crime victim compensation programs, emergency \nshelters, crisis intervention, counseling, and assistance in \nparticipating in the criminal justice system. These services are all \nfinanced by a reserve fund created from fines and penalties paid by \nFederal criminal offenders, at no cost to taxpayers.\n  A number of us have worked hard over the years to protect the Crime \nVictims Fund. State victim compensation and assistance programs serve \nnearly four million crime victims each year, including victims of \nviolent crime, domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, elder \nabuse, and drunk driving. The Crime Victims Fund makes these programs \npossible and has helped hundreds of thousands of victims of violent \ncrime bravely move forward with their lives.\n  Several years ago, I worked to make sure that the Crime Victims Fund \nwould be there in good times, and in bad. We made sure it had a ``rainy \nday'' capacity so that in lean years, victims and their advocates would \nnot have to worry that the fund would run out of money and that they \nwould be left stranded. More recently, an annual cap has been set on \nthe level of funding to be spent from the Fund in a given year, in part \nto help preserve adequate funds from year to year. When this cap was \nestablished, and when President Bush then sought to empty the Crime \nVictims Fund of unexpended funds, I joined with Senator Crapo, Senator \nMikulski and others from both political parties to make sure that the \nCrime Victims Fund was preserved. Fortunately Congress has consistently \nrejected efforts to rob crime victims of resources that are \nappropriately set aside to assist them and their families.\n  Unfortunately, the cap on the fund has not kept pace with the demand \nfor compensation and services. From 2006 to 2008, VOCA victim \nassistance formula grants were cut by $87 billion or 22 percent. This \nreduction in funding, coupled with the current economic climate, was \ndevastating to victim service providers who were forced to curtail \nservices, lay off staff, and close their doors, jeopardizing the well-\nbeing and recovery of many crime victims.\n  In addition, victim service professionals have seen a clear increase \nin victimization and victim need in the past year as job losses and \neconomic stress translate into increased violence in the home and in \nour communities. The National Crime Victims Helpline reported a 25 \npercent increase in calls in recent months and the National Domestic \nViolence Hotline reported a similar increase. Local shelters and crisis \nlines are also reporting a rise in demand as the shortage of affordable \nhousing and rising unemployment are increasing the time that victims \nstay in emergency shelters. The rising unemployment rate also means \nvictims are less likely to have insurance to cover their crime-related \nexpenses.\n  At a Judiciary Committee hearing I chaired in April on the Victim of \nCrime Act, witnesses testified that there has also been an increase in \nthe variety of crimes being committed. The National Crime Victims \nHelpline has seen an increase in calls from fraud victims people \nfalling prey to ``work at home'' scams, secret shopper scams, \ninvestment scams, mortgage fraud, and construction fraud. Such victims \nare in desperate need of financial counseling and mental health \ncounseling to overcome the stress and emotional impact of falling \nvictim to these scams. Under Federal regulations, States may use \ncompensation and victim assistance programs to aid financial crime \nvictims, but services are not available. Victim service providers are \nreluctant to expand their outreach and services without assured \nincreased funding and there is already too much competition for the \nlimited funds available. The National Census of Domestic Violence \nServices conducted last fall showed that in one day, nearly 9,000 \nvictims were turned away from shelter, counseling, and other crucial \nservices because local programs were unable to serve them.\n  The need for victim assistance and compensation has grown. The Crime \nVictims Fund can provide more help. Recent years have seen an increase \nin collections from criminal fines and penalties. Accordingly, Congress \nhas the ability to provide stable and predictable growth without \njeopardizing the sustainability of the fund, and should do so through \nthis legislation. The Crime Victims Fund Preservation Act would \nestablish a minimum funding level for programs under VOCA to ensure \nreasonable and predictable growth in victim services through fiscal \nyear 2014. Providing a stable and predictable funding stream will \nenable states to expand their programs and outreach to the thousands of \nvictims who have nowhere to turn. Again, I emphasize that it does not \ncost a dime of taxpayer funds but will come exclusively from Federal \ncriminal fines and penalties.\n  I want to commend Senator Mikulski, the Chairwoman of the Commerce, \nJustice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator Shelby, \nthe Ranking Member, for working with the President to provide $100 \nmillion in the economic recovery package for crime victims. That \nadditional funding is sorely needed right now and I know it was \nsincerely appreciated by victim service providers. Funding in the \nOmnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 together with the Recovery Act \nfunds, restored funding to the 2006 level, adjusted for inflation. A \n2010 cap on total VOCA obligations of $705 million is expected to \nmaintain the funding level for assistance grants provided in 2009 \nthrough the Recovery Act funding and annual appropriations. I believe \nthat\n\n[[Page S7008]]\n\nthe certainty this legislation will provide will be helpful to the \nstates, victim service providers, and the citizens they serve, and will \nhelp improve this vital program.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Crapo, Senator Mikulski and \nmany other interested Senators on this initiative to provide increased, \nstable, and predicable funding for to meet the ongoing need for \nessential services for crime victims and their families in the years \nahead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1340\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose \nan excise tax on certain proceeds received on SILO and LILO \ntransactions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Close the \nSILO/LILO Loophole Act. This legislation will close a loophole in which \nbanks and other entities are taking advantage of the financial crisis \nto exploit transit agencies and other local public entities to collect \nwindfall payments. This bill seeks to permanently end this abusive \npractice, saving the public scarce resources.\n  Sale-In/Lease Out and Lease-In/Lease Out, SILO/LILO, contracts are a \ntype of financial transaction in which a public entity transfers \nassets, equipment or infrastructure, to a bank or other entity while \nsimultaneously entering into a long-term lease with the same bank or \nother entity. From the 1990's to 2003, public agencies, including \ntransit agencies and rural electric coops, entered into these LILO and \nSILO transactions. As part of the agreement, the bank required the \npublic agency to pay a AAA-rated entity a fee to make lease payments \nthroughout the term of the lease. This arrangement provided security \nfor the banks and insured that lease payments would be made.\n  When the financial crisis hit last year, many AAA-rated entities \ninvolved in these transactions were downgraded. Banks took advantage of \nthese downgrades and some sued these public agencies, citing a clause \nin the agreements that required only AAA-rated entities to make lease \npayments. They did this even though the public agencies in question did \nnot miss any of their regular lease payments to the banks.\n  Not only is this predatory, but allowing this practice to continue is \nalso contrary to public policy. While the SILO/LILO contracts provided \nmuch needed resources for capital intensive projects that benefitted \nthe public, they also provided tax benefits to the banks--tax benefits \nthat Congress found to be tax avoidance schemes and effectively \neliminated in 2003. In 2008, the Internal Revenue Service proposed a \nsettlement of the leases, effectively eliminating all future tax \nbenefits while allowing the underlying commercial transactions to \nremain in place. If we let these suits against public agencies \ncontinue, we are basically allowing banks to get these tax benefits \nthrough another means--taking taxpayer money from public transit \nagencies and other public agencies around the Nation.\n  At this moment in time, we have myriad infrastructure needs. Public \nagencies are working hard to fill the demand for infrastructure \nprojects. President Obama and Congress acknowledged the need and \ndelivered the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Now is not the \ntime to financially burden the agencies that we rely on for building, \nrepairing, maintaining and preserving our infrastructure. The Close the \nSILO/LILO Loophole Act will help lift the uncertainty under which these \npublic agencies are operating, enabling them to serve the public \nbetter. I hope to work closely with Chairman Baucus to end this crisis \nso public agencies can continue to serve the public and not banks \nseeking a windfall.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. Bennet, and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 1343. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to improve and expand direct certification procedures for the \nnational school lunch and school breakfast programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, every day during the school year, some \n700,000 Ohio children are eligible to receive a free or reduced-price \nlunch at their school. Every day during the school year, these meals \ncould ensure that children get enough to eat, particularly those \nchildren who are from homes where they don't get enough to eat, and it \nwould ensure that children receive the good-quality, nutritious food \nthey need. Yet today only about 86 percent of eligible children in Ohio \nreceive a free school breakfast, a free school lunch, or a reduced-\nprice breakfast or lunch. Only 86 percent of those eligible do. That \nmeans 1 in 10 Ohio children goes without a meal every day at school \nunnecessarily. Thus, tens of thousands of children from large urban \ndistricts in Cleveland and Cincinnati and Toledo to rural districts in \nAppalachia, children in small towns and medium towns all over the State \nand all over the country don't receive a healthy meal at school. Mr. \nPresident, about 150,000 children eligible at school for free or \nreduced-price lunch or breakfast don't get the meals at school that \nthey are eligible for, and it is unacceptable. We can do something \nabout it.\n  The application process for free lunch and breakfast is antiquated--\nstuck in a low-tech, old-fashioned, file-cabinet kind of system. The \ncurrent paper application process doesn't reflect today's school \ndistricts. It doesn't adjust to changing demographics. It doesn't take \nadvantage of the tremendous advancements in technology our society \nenjoys generally. That is why I will be introducing today the Hunger \nFree Schools Act, along with Senators Casey and Bennet, that would \ndramatically reduce the number of paper applications for the free \nschool lunch program. This legislation will directly enroll an \nestimated 100,000 Ohio children and thousands of children around the \nNation in the National School Lunch Program. The Hunger Free Schools \nAct would modernize the application system for free school meals. The \nHunger Free Schools Act would ensure that the system functions the way \nit was actually designed to work.\n  By increasing the number of children who receive nutritional school \nmeals, we can help them receive a better education. Just think of \nchildren who sit in schools--small children, children of middle-school \nage, children in high school, but particularly small children--with \ntheir stomachs growling. They haven't really had breakfast or they \nhaven't had a nutritious breakfast. Children who think so much about \ntheir hunger rather than their school work, children who by afternoon \nfeel weak because they haven't had the calories and nutrition they \nneed, this bill could do something about this. By increasing the number \nof healthy children, we will be more effective in lowering rates of \nchild obesity and diabetes. It is not just about not getting enough to \neat, it is also the quality of food they eat if they don't eat in the \nschool cafeteria the school breakfast that is provided for them.\n  Nationwide, this bill would reduce paperwork and administrative costs \nto make access to meals easier for nearly 7 million children--hundreds \nof thousands of children in the Presiding Officer's home State of \nIllinois and over 100,000 children in my State of Ohio. Reducing \npaperwork and administrative costs saves time for administrators, \nreduces the burden on schools, and makes it a whole lot easier for \nteachers who don't have to think so much about helping their children \nfigure out how to get a free school lunch or a free school breakfast.\n\n[[Page S7009]]\n\n  President Obama cited administrative costs as a barrier to ending \nchildhood hunger. His goal of eliminating this moral problem by 2015 is \nwithin reach, in part because of this legislation. More must be done.\n  Another way to combat childhood hunger is to make sure more families \nare aware of summer feeding programs.\n  Let me give another number. Some 700,000 children in my State are \neligible for the reduced or free school breakfast and lunch. Of that \nnumber, about 500,000 actually get free lunch and breakfast. Those same \nstudents are eligible for the summer feeding program in June, July, and \nAugust--a program that is in rec centers, churches, parks, and in other \nkinds of buildings sprinkled across our State. Yet only about 60,000, \nor 1 in 10 children who are eligible, partake in the summer feeding \nprogram. So those children who, every day, get a free breakfast and \nlunch during the school year are also eligible in the summer to get \nfree breakfast, lunch, and a free snack. But very few of them actually \nget those breakfasts and lunches or snacks in the summer.\n  You can imagine what that does to the chance for those children to \nbecome obese or to have a lack of nutrition and what all that means. \nThe summer feeding program is every bit as important as the school \nbreakfast and lunch program. That is why I remind parents and educators \nand guardians that the summer food service program is available to \nprovide children a free breakfast, lunch, or snack during summer \nmonths. I encourage parents, educators, and guardians in Ohio, and \naround the Nation, to find a local summer feeding location.\n  I suggest people watching, if they are from my State, to go on my Web \nsite, brown.senate.gov. We have roughly 1,000 summer feeding program \nlocations on the Web site. People from Ohio can look on there and find \nout where there might be half a dozen sites in Richland County or \nperhaps 5 or 6 locations in Allen County or 25 or so locations in \nLorain County, where young people can sign up to go to the summer \nfeeding program or they can just show up and be fed. Ohioans can also \nfind information through the Ohio Department of Education. Other \nAmericans should contact the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has \na State-by-State breakdown of resources. Students in summer reading \nprograms at the public libraries might be eligible for the summer \nfeeding program. They should find out from the library or from a music \nprogram they are part of or anyplace they might go, if they are \neligible.\n  Again, I remind people that if your son or daughter is eligible for \nthe school lunch program, they are also eligible for the summer feeding \nprogram. The end of the school year doesn't mean that we have an end to \nhunger. It means we need to make some people aware of the summer \nfeeding program. Coupled with the summer feeding program, this Hunger \nFree Schools Act can ensure that our children reach their full \npotential.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Bayh, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Lincoln, \n        Mr. Lugar, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 1345. A bill to aid and support pediatric involvement in reading \nand education; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce with my colleague, Senator \nGrassley, the Prescribe A Book Act. I thank Senators Akaka, Bayh, \nCollins, Kerry, Lautenberg, Leahy, Lincoln, Lugar, Murray, Stabenow, \nand Whitehouse for joining us as original cosponsors of this bill.\n  Our legislation would create a Federal pediatric early literacy grant \ninitiative based on the long-standing, successful Reach Out and Read \nprogram. The program would award grants to high-quality non-profit \nentities to train doctors and nurses in advising parents about the \nimportance of reading aloud and to give books to children at pediatric \ncheck-ups from six months to 5 years of age, with a priority for \nchildren from low-income families. It builds on the relationship \nbetween parents and medical providers and helps families and \ncommunities encourage early literacy skills so children enter school \nprepared for success in reading.\n  The Reach Out and Read model has consistently demonstrated \neffectiveness in increasing parent involvement and boosting children's \nreading proficiency. Research published in peer-reviewed, scientific \njournals has found that parents who have participated in the program \nare significantly more likely to read to their children and include \nmore children's books in their home, and that children served by the \nprogram show an increase of 4-8 points on vocabulary tests. I have seen \nup-close the positive impact of this program on children and their \nfamilies when visiting a number of the 40 Rhode Island Reach Out and \nRead sites.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1345\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to penalize crimes against humanity and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Crimes \nAgainst Humanity Act of 2009. This narrowly-tailored legislation would \nmake it a violation of U.S. law to commit a crime against humanity. \nCongress must ensure that criminals who commit mass atrocities do not \nfind safe haven in our country.\n  I would like to thank the other original cosponsors of the Crimes \nAgainst Humanity Act, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator Russell Feingold of \nWisconsin, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the \nConstitution and the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nSubcommittee on African Affairs.\n  For generations, the U.S. has led the struggle for human rights \naround the world and has supported holding perpetrators of crimes \nagainst humanity accountable. Over 50 years before the Nuremberg \ntrials, George Washington Williams, an African-American minister, \nlawyer and historian, called for an international commission to \ninvestigate ``crimes against humanity'' in the Congo, which was then \nruled by Belgium's King Leopold II. Under King Leopold's iron fist, \nCongo's population was reduced by half, with up to 10 million people \nlosing their lives. In a letter to the U.S. Secretary of State, Mr. \nWilliams decried the ``crimes against humanity'' perpetrated by King \nLeopold's regime.\n  Over 50 years later, following the Holocaust, the U.S. led the \nefforts to prosecute Nazi perpetrators for crimes against humanity at \nthe Nuremberg trials. Crimes against humanity were first defined in the \nNuremberg Charter in 1945. Sixteen men were found guilty of crimes \nagainst humanity in the Nuremberg trials, including Hermann Goring, \ncommander of the Luftwaffe and the highest-ranking official to order \nthe ``Final Solution.''\n  Since then, the U.S. has supported efforts to prosecute perpetrators \nof crimes against humanity, including Nazi war criminals who had \nescaped accountability. In 1961, Adolf Eichman, the ``architect of the \nHolocaust,'' was convicted in Israel for committing crimes against \nhumanity. Michael Musmanno, a U.S. Naval officer and judge at the \nNuremberg trials, was a key prosecution witness. In 1987, Klaus Barbie, \nthe ``Butcher of Lyon'', was convicted in France for crimes against \nhumanity he committed while heading the Gestapo in Lyon.\n  The U.S. has also supported the prosecution of crimes against \nhumanity before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former \nYugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and the \nSpecial Court for Sierra Leone.\n  More recently, we have seen crimes against humanity being committed \non a massive scale in Darfur in western Sudan. In this region of six \nmillion people, hundreds of thousands were killed and as many as 2.5 \nmillion were driven from their homes in recent years. Part of the \nsolution to the carnage in Darfur is arresting and prosecuting the \nperpetrators. Otherwise, these perpetrators will continue to act with \nimpunity and victims will feel they have no recourse but to resort to \nviolence themselves.\n  We have also seen crimes against humanity being committed in the \neastern Democratic Republic of Congo, most disturbingly through the use \nof rape as a weapon of war. The systematic and deliberate use of mass \nrape to humiliate, expel and destroy communities in the eastern \nDemocratic Republic of Congo offends our common humanity.\n  However, it is not only Darfur and the eastern Democratic Republic of \nCongo that are safe havens for the perpetrators of crimes against \nhumanity. Perpetrators of mass atrocities have sought to escape \naccountability for their actions by coming to our own country. \nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security, over 1000 war \ncriminals have found safe haven in the United States.\n  I am the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Human Rights and the \nLaw Subcommittee. Last year I held a Human Rights and the Law \nSubcommittee hearing entitled ``From Nuremberg to Darfur: \nAccountability for Crimes Against Humanity.'' This hearing identified a \nglaring loophole in U.S. law--currently, there is no U.S. law \nprohibiting crimes against humanity. As a result, the U.S. government \nis unable to prosecute perpetrators of crimes against humanity found in \nour country. In contrast, other grave human rights violations, \nincluding genocide, using or recruiting child soldiers, and torture, \nare crimes under U.S. law.\n  We heard testimony in the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee that \nmany U.S. allies have incorporated crimes against humanity into their \ncriminal codes, including Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, \nNew Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Argentina and the United Kingdom.\n  Expert witnesses testified before the Subcommittee about the urgent \nneed for the United States to enact similar legislation. Gayle Smith, \nthe Co-Founder of the Enough Project, testified that it is in our \nnational interest to enact crimes against humanity legislation:\n\n       If unchallenged, the violence that defines crimes against \n     humanity feeds on itself: conflicts spread, institutions \n     crumble, economies decline and young people are taught the \n     dangerous lesson that violence is more potent tool for change \n     than hope. . . . Ensuring that those who commit crimes \n     against humanity are in violation of U.S. law is in our \n     national interests, and clearly in the interests of the \n     victims who have few if any protectors or defenders.\n\n  Diane Orentlicher, a law professor at American University's \nWashington College of Law and one of our country's leading experts on \nhuman rights crimes, testified:\n\n       The United States has, since Nuremberg, provided \n     indispensable leadership in ensuring prosecution of crimes \n     against humanity by various international tribunals, as well \n     as by other countries we have supported. So it's quite \n     remarkable that we of all countries don't have a law on our \n     books making it possible to prosecute this crime when \n     perpetrators show up in our own territory.\n\n  The crimes against humanity loophole has real consequences. When the \nU.S. government learned that Marko Boskic, who allegedly participated \nin the Srebrenica massacre in the Bosnian conflict, was living in \nMassachusetts, he was charged with visa fraud, rather than crimes \nagainst humanity. ``They should condemn him for the crime,'' said Emma \nHidic, whose two brothers were among the estimated 7,000 men and boys \nkilled in the Srebrenica massacre, upon learning that Boskic had been \ncharged only with visa fraud.\n  The Crimes Against Humanity Act would close this loophole in U.S. law\n\n[[Page S7011]]\n\nand give our government the authority to prosecute those found in the \nU.S. who commit crimes against humanity. In keeping with the principles \nthe U.S. and our allies established after World War II, this \nlegislation would help ensure that the perpetrators of crimes against \nhumanity do not find safe haven in our country.\n  This bill would make it a violation of U.S. law to commit a crime \nagainst humanity, i.e. any widespread and systematic attack directed \nagainst a civilian population that involves murder, enslavement, \ntorture, rape, arbitrary detention, extermination, hostage taking or \nethnic cleansing.\n  I am the author of the Genocide Accountability Act, the Child \nSoldiers Accountability Act, and the Trafficking in Persons Act, \nlegislation passed unanimously by Congress and signed into law by \nPresident George W. Bush that denies safe haven in the United States to \nthe perpetrators of genocide, child soldier recruitment and use, and \nhuman trafficking. The Crimes Against Humanity Act is the next logical \nstep. It would subject perpetrators of crimes against humanity to \ncriminal sanctions, in the same way that perpetrators of genocide, \nchild soldier recruitment and human trafficking are subject to criminal \nsanctions under U.S. law.\n  Ensuring U.S. law prohibits crimes against humanity is consistent \nwith the longstanding U.S. support for the prosecution of crimes \nagainst humanity perpetrated in World War II, Rwanda, the former \nYugoslavia and Sierra Leone, among other places.\n  This legislation will send a clear message to perpetrators of crimes \nagainst humanity that there are real consequences to their actions. By \nholding such individuals criminally responsible, our country will help \nto deter crimes against humanity.\n  The Crimes Against Humanity Act is supported by a broad coalition of \nhuman rights and religious groups, including Armenian Assembly of \nAmerica, Center for Justice and Accountability, Center for Victims of \nTorture, Enough Project, the Episcopal Church, Genocide Intervention \nNetwork, Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, International Justice \nMission, Jubilee Campaign USA, Inc., Physicians for Human Rights, \nRobert F. Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights, Save Darfur \nCoalition, the United Methodist Church, and U.S. Campaign for Burma. \nToday I received a letter of support for the Crimes Against Humanity \nAct from 29 organizations, including all of those I have named. As the \nletter explains:\n\n       This legislation would fill an existing gap in U.S. law by \n     allowing U.S. prosecutors to hold the perpetrators of mass \n     atrocities accountable for their acts. While often less \n     publicized than genocides, crimes against humanity are as \n     devastating to their victims and as worthy of vigorous and \n     unbending attention from the United States government. We \n     must ensure that perpetrators of mass atrocities cannot evade \n     justice by coming to the United States.\n\n  Daoud Hari is a refugee from Darfur now living in our country and \nauthor of The Translator: A Tribesman's Memoir of Darfur. I urge my \ncolleagues to contemplate the challenge that Mr. Hari posed at the \nHuman Rights Subcommittee hearing on crimes against humanity: while \nnone of us individually can stop the crimes against humanity committed \nin Darfur and other countries around the globe, failing to take action \nonly ensures that these horrific atrocities will continue.\n  With far too few exceptions, we have failed to prevent and stop \ncrimes against humanity. The promise of Nuremberg remains unfulfilled. \nWe have a moral obligation to take action to help the survivors of \ncrimes against humanity around the world and to help prevent this \nhorrific crime by holding perpetrators accountable.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1346\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Richard J. Durbin,\n     Chairman Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law, Senate \n         Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Durbin: We write to express our strong \n     support for the Crimes Against Humanity Act of 2009. This \n     legislation would fill an existing gap in U.S. law by \n     allowing U.S. prosecutors to hold the perpetrators of mass \n     atrocities accountable for their acts. While often less \n     publicized than genocides, crimes against humanity are as \n     devastating to their victims and as worthy of vigorous and \n     unbending attention from the United States government. We \n     must ensure that perpetrators of mass atrocities cannot evade \n     justice by coming to the United States. We applaud your \n     leadership in ensuring that the United States is well \n     equipped to fight these grave crimes and we urge Congress to \n     enact the bill with all due speed.\n       The United States government has long been at the forefront \n     of global efforts to seek accountability for the perpetrators \n     of the worst crimes known to humankind. In the years after \n     World War II, the United States was an essential player in \n     the formation of the Nuremberg Tribunal and the Genocide \n     Convention, two key pieces of the foundation for all \n     international justice efforts that have followed. Since then, \n     in Bosnia, Rwanda, Cambodia, Sierra Leone, and Darfur, among \n     others, the U.S. government has steadfastly supported justice \n     for victims of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and \n     genocide, whether by supporting national justice systems or \n     by assisting in the creation of special tribunals.\n       The bill defines crimes against humanity as widespread and \n     systematic attacks directed against a civilian population \n     that involve murder, enslavement, torture, rape, arbitrary \n     detention, extermination, hostage taking, or ethnic \n     cleansing. This category includes some of the most atrocious \n     crimes committed in recent history--the campaigns of \n     mutilation and murder of civilians in Sierra Leone and \n     Uganda, the systematic rape of women in ethnic areas of Burma \n     and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the ethnic \n     cleansing in Bosnia and Kosovo. These crimes might look like \n     genocide to a layperson, but they are a distinct category of \n     crime and separate legislation is needed to provide United \n     States courts with jurisdiction to prosecute those who commit \n     them if they are present in the United States.\n       Such legislation has not existed before today, despite the \n     U.S. government's sustained efforts to ensure accountability \n     for crimes against humanity elsewhere. Alleged perpetrators \n     of those crimes have therefore been able to escape \n     prosecution in the United States. Though U.S. law prohibits \n     grave human rights violations such as genocide and torture, \n     alleged perpetrators of crimes against humanity may escape \n     accountability due not to their innocence of unforgivable \n     acts but to loopholes in the U.S. criminal code.\n       The Crimes Against Humanity Act of 2009 would close this \n     illogical gap in U.S. law. Just as they may pursue those who \n     have committed related and similarly horrific crimes, U.S. \n     prosecutors would have the authority to ensure that those in \n     the United States who have committed crimes against humanity \n     may not evade accountability merely by fleeing to our \n     country.\n       The United States has provided a means to prosecute those \n     who commit genocide and torture as well as those who use \n     child soldiers in war. Those who commit the similar crimes \n     that constitute crimes against humanity should face no better \n     future. We therefore urge Congress to enact this bill without \n     delay.\n           Sincerely,\n       The Advocates for Human Rights.\n       Africa Action.\n       AIDS-Free World.\n       Armenian Assembly of America.\n       Center for Justice and Accountability.\n       Center for Victims of Torture.\n       EarthRights International.\n       Enough Project.\n       The Episcopal Church.\n       Equality Now.\n       Citizens for Global Solutions.\n       Genocide Intervention Network.\n       Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program.\n       Human Rights First.\n       Human Rights Watch.\n       International Justice Mission.\n       Jubilee Campaign USA, Inc.\n       National Immigrant Justice Center.\n       National Immigration Forum.\n       Open Society Policy Center.\n       Physicians for Human Rights.\n       Refugees International.\n       Robert F.

Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join Senator Durbin \nand Senator Feingold in introducing the Crimes Against Humanity Act of \n2009. This legislation will make it a violation of United States law to \ncommit a crime against humanity, and will help ensure that the \nperpetrators of crimes against humanity do not find safe haven in the \nUnited States. I commend Senator Durbin for his work on this \nlegislation and for his leadership as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nHuman Rights and the Law.\n  Last Congress, I was pleased to work with Senator Durbin to create \nthe Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee, the first-ever congressional \ncommittee established to address human rights issues. The work that we \nhave done through this Subcommittee has helped the Senate focus on \nimportant and difficult legal human rights issues, including genocide, \nhuman trafficking, child soldiers, war crimes, corporate accountability \noverseas, systematic rape, and torture.\n  The work of the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee has already \nachieved important results. Last Congress, the President signed into \nlaw the Child Soldiers Accountability Act, which outlawed the abhorrent \npractice of recruiting and using child soldiers, and the Genocide \nAccountability Act, which closed a loophole that had allowed those who \ncommit or incite genocide to seek refuge in our country without fear of \nprosecution for their actions. These legislative initiatives were a \ncritical step toward showing the international community that the \nUnited States will not tolerate human rights abuses at home or abroad, \nand that those who commit these atrocities must be held accountable for \ntheir actions. I am pleased to join Senator Durbin to take the next \nstep to protect victims of crimes against humanity in the United \nStates, and to hold those responsible for these terrible crimes to \naccount.\n  Along with genocide and war crimes, crimes against humanity are among \nthe most serious crimes under international law. We see such crimes \nagainst humanity by groups or governments as part of a widespread or \nsystematic attack against a civilian population. These deplorable \ncrimes include murder, enslavement, torture, rape, arbitrary detention, \nextermination, hostage taking, and ethnic cleansing, and they continue \nto take place around the world in places like Uganda, Burma, and Sudan.\n  Although the United States has strongly and consistently for more \nthan 60 years supported the prosecution of perpetrators of crimes \nagainst humanity, there is currently no United States law prohibiting \ncrimes against humanity. As a result, the government is unable to \nprosecute perpetrators of crimes against humanity found in our country. \nThis legislation will fix this loophole by enabling the Attorney \nGeneral to prosecute crimes against humanity committed by a U.S. \nnational, legal alien or habitual resident in the United States. The \nlaw will also enable the prosecution of any crimes against humanity \ncommitted in whole or in part within the United States, as well as \noffenses that occur outside the United States, if the offender is \ncurrently located in the United States.\n  The actions prohibited by the Crimes Against Humanity Act of 2009 are \nappalling. They happen too often throughout the world. We must promote \naccountability for human rights violations committed anywhere in the \nworld, and we must do whatever we can to prevent those who commit such \ncrimes from escaping justice by finding a safe haven in the United \nStates. A foreign policy that seeks to defend human rights will never \nfully achieve its goals if we undermine our own credibility by failing \nin our commitment to uphold the highest standards of human rights here \nat home. I urge\n\n[[Page S7013]]\n\nSenators on both sides of the aisle to support this important \nlegislation to help this country take another step toward reclaiming \nour place as a guardian of human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/24/senate-section/article/S7013-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 202--TO PROVIDE FOR ISSUANCE OF A SUMMONS AND FOR \n   RELATED PROCEDURES CONCERNING THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST \n                             SAMUEL B.

Res. 204\n\n       Whereas the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect is \n     one of the most prevalent, life-threatening birth defects in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect is \n     a severe, often deadly birth defect that has a devastating \n     impact, in both human and economic terms, affecting equally \n     people of all races, sexes, nationalities, geographic \n     locations, and income levels;\n       Whereas the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect \n     occurs in 1 in every 2,000 live births in the United States \n     and accounts for 8 percent of all major congenital anomalies;\n       Whereas, in 2004, there were approximately 4,115,590 live \n     births in the United States, and in approximately 1,800 of \n     those live births, the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth \n     defect occurred, causing countless additional friends, loved \n     ones, spouses, and caregivers to shoulder the physical, \n     emotional, and financial burdens the congenital diaphragmatic \n     hernia birth defect causes;\n       Whereas there is no genetic indicator or any other \n     indicator available to predict the occurrence of the \n     congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect, other than \n     through the performance of an ultrasound during pregnancy;\n       Whereas there is no consistent treatment or cure for the \n     congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect;\n       Whereas the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect is \n     a leading cause of neonatal death in the United States;\n       Whereas 50 percent of the patients who do survive the \n     congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect have residual \n     health issues, resulting in a severe strain on pediatric \n     medical resources and on the delivery of health care services \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas proactive diagnosis and the appropriate management \n     and care of fetuses afflicted with the congenital \n     diaphragmatic hernia birth defect minimize the incidence of \n     emergency situations resulting from the birth defect and \n     dramatically improve survival rates among people with the \n     birth defect;\n       Whereas neonatal medical care is one of the most expensive \n     types of medical care provided in the United States and \n     patients with the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth \n     defect stay in intensive care for approximately 60 to 90 \n     days, costing millions of dollars, utilizing blood from local \n     blood banks, and requiring the most technically advanced \n     medical care;\n       Whereas the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect is \n     a birth defect that causes damage to the lungs and the \n     cardiovascular system;\n       Whereas patients with the congenital diaphragmatic hernia \n     birth defect may have long-term health issues such as \n     respiratory insufficiency, gastroesophageal reflux, poor \n     growth, neurodevelopmental delay, behavior problems, hearing \n     loss, hernia recurrence, and orthopedic deformities;\n       Whereas the severity of the symptoms and outcomes of the \n     congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect and the limited \n     public awareness of the birth defect cause many patients to \n     receive substandard care, to forego regular visits to \n     physicians, and not to receive good health or therapeutic \n     management that would help avoid serious complications in the \n     future, compromising the quality of life of those patients;\n       Whereas people suffering from chronic, life-threatening \n     diseases and birth defects, similar to the congenital \n     diaphragmatic hernia birth defect, and family members of \n     those people are predisposed to depression and the resulting \n     consequences of depression because of anxiety over the \n     possible pain, suffering, and premature death that people \n     with such diseases and birth defects may face;\n       Whereas the Senate and taxpayers of the United States want \n     treatments and cures for disease and hope to see results from \n     investments in research conducted by the National Institutes \n     of Health and from initiatives such as the National \n     Institutes of Health Roadmap to the Future;\n       Whereas the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect is \n     an example of how collaboration, technological innovation, \n     scientific momentum, and public-private partnerships can \n     generate therapeutic interventions that directly benefit the \n     people and\n\n[[Page S7014]]\n\n     families suffering from the congenital diaphragmatic hernia \n     birth defect;\n       Whereas collaboration, technological innovation, scientific \n     momentum, and public-private partnerships can save billions \n     of Federal dollars under Medicare, Medicaid, and other \n     programs for therapies, and early intervention will increase \n     survival rates among people suffering from the congenital \n     diaphragmatic hernia birth defect;\n       Whereas improvements in diagnostic technology, the \n     expansion of scientific knowledge, and better management of \n     care for patients with the congenital diaphragmatic hernia \n     birth defect already have increased survival rates in some \n     cases;\n       Whereas there is still a need for more research and \n     increased awareness of the congenital diaphragmatic hernia \n     birth defect and for an increase in funding for that research \n     in order to provide a better quality of life to survivors of \n     the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect, and more \n     optimism for the families and health care professionals who \n     work with children with the birth defect;\n       Whereas there are thousands of volunteers nationwide \n     dedicated to expanding research, fostering public awareness \n     and understanding, educating patients and their families \n     about the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect to \n     improve their treatment and care, providing appropriate moral \n     support, and encouraging people to become organ donors; and\n       Whereas volunteers engage in an annual national awareness \n     event held on March 31, making that day an appropriate time \n     to recognize National Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia \n     Awareness Day: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 31, 2010, as ``National Congenital \n     Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Day'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of a national day to \n     raise public awareness and understanding of the congenital \n     diaphragmatic hernia birth defect;\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research into a cure \n     for the congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to support National Congenital \n     Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Day through appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities, to promote public awareness of the \n     congenital diaphragmatic hernia birth defect, and to foster \n     understanding of the impact of the disease on patients and \n     their families.\n\n

Res. 205\n\n       Whereas a bone marrow or blood cell transplant is a \n     potentially life-saving treatment for patients with leukemia, \n     lymphoma, and other blood diseases;\n       Whereas a bone marrow or blood cell transplant replaces a \n     patient's unhealthy blood cells with healthy blood-forming \n     cells from a volunteer donor;\n       Whereas a patient who does not have a suitably matching \n     donor in the family may search the National Marrow Donor \n     Program Donor Registry for a donor;\n       Whereas blood or cell samples from adult donors or cord \n     blood units are tested and the tissue or cell type is added \n     to the National Marrow Donor Program Donor Registry, and \n     physicians may search that registry when they need to find \n     donors whose tissue type matches their patients';\n       Whereas African Americans make up 8 percent of, or more \n     than 550,000 of the 7,000,000 people currently on, the \n     National Marrow Donor Program Donor Registry;\n       Whereas of the 35,000 people that have received transplants \n     since the inception of the National Marrow Donor Program \n     Donor Registry, only 1,500 have been African Americans;\n       Whereas more than 70 life-threatening diseases can be \n     treated with a bone marrow transplant;\n       Whereas there is a possibility that an African American \n     patient could match a donor from any racial or ethnic group, \n     but the most likely match is another African American;\n       Whereas to become a volunteer donor, potential donors must \n     be between 18 and 60 years of age, meet health guidelines, \n     provide a small blood sample or swab of cheek cells to \n     determine the donor's tissue type, complete a brief health \n     questionnaire, and sign a consent form to have the tissue \n     type of the donor listed on the Donor Registry;\n       Whereas the Bone Marrow Wish Organization, which is a \n     minority-run nonprofit organization based in Detroit that was \n     started by an actual bone marrow donor, is initiating \n     ``African American Bone Marrow Awareness Month'';\n       Whereas the annual month of awareness would promote donor \n     awareness and increase the number of African Americans \n     registered with the National Marrow Donor Program throughout \n     the Nation; and\n       Whereas July 2009 would be an appropriate month to observe \n     African American Bone Marrow Awareness Month: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of African American Bone \n     Marrow Awareness Month;\n       (2) urges the people of the United States to participate in \n     appropriate programs and activities with respect to bone \n     marrow awareness, including speaking with health care \n     professionals about bone marrow donation; and\n       (3) urges all people of the United States to register to \n     become blood marrow donors and encourages all people of the \n     United States to organize blood marrow registration drives in \n     their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/24/senate-section/article/S7014-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n  Impeachment trial committee on the articles against judge samuel b. \n                                  kent\n\n  Ms. McCASKILL.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Enhanced Partnership with \n     Pakistan Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The people of Pakistan and the United States have a \n     long history of friendship and comity, and the interests of \n     both nations are well-served by strengthening and deepening \n     this friendship.\n       (2) In February 2008, the people of Pakistan elected a \n     civilian government, reversing years of political tension and \n     mounting popular concern over governance and their own \n     democratic reform and political development.\n       (3) A democratic, moderate, modernizing Pakistan would \n     represent the wishes of the Pakistani people and serve as a \n     model to other countries around the world.\n       (4) Economic growth is a fundamental foundation for human \n     security and national stability in Pakistan, a country with \n     over 175,000,000 people, an annual population growth rate of \n     2 percent, and a ranking of 136 out of 177 countries in the \n     United Nations Human Development Index.\n       (5) Pakistan is a major non-NATO ally of the United States \n     and has been a valuable partner in the battle against al \n     Qaeda and the Taliban, but much more remains to be \n     accomplished by both nations.\n       (6) The struggle against al Qaeda, the Taliban, and \n     affiliated terrorist groups has led to the deaths of several \n     thousand Pakistani civilians and members of the security \n     forces of Pakistan over the past 7 years.\n       (7) Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, more \n     al Qaeda terrorist suspects have been apprehended in Pakistan \n     than in any other country, including Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, \n     Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Abu Faraj al-Libi.\n       (8) Despite the sacrifices and cooperation of the security \n     forces of Pakistan, the top leadership of al Qaeda, as well \n     as the leadership and rank-and-file of affiliated terrorist \n     groups, are believed to be using Pakistan's Federally \n     Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and parts of the North West \n     Frontier Province (NWFP) and Balochistan as a haven and a \n     base from which to organize terrorist actions in Pakistan and \n     globally, including--\n       (A) attacks outside of Pakistan that have been attributed \n     to groups with Pakistani connections, including--\n       (i) the suicide car bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul, \n     Afghanistan, which killed 58 people on June 7, 2008; and\n       (ii) the massacre of approximately 165 people in Mumbai, \n     India, including 6 United States citizens, in late November \n     2008; and\n       (B) attacks within Pakistan, including--\n       (i) an attack on the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team in \n     Lahore on March 3, 2009;\n       (ii) an attack at the Marriott hotel in Islamabad on \n     September 9, 2008;\n       (iii) the bombing of a political rally in Karachi on \n     October 18, 2007;\n       (iv) the targeting and killing of dozens of tribal, \n     provincial, and national holders of political office;\n       (v) an attack by gunfire on the U.S. Principal Officer in \n     Peshawar in August 2008; and\n       (vi) the brazen assassination of former Prime Minister \n     Benazir Bhutto on December 27, 2007.\n       (9) In the 12-month period ending on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, Pakistan's security forces have \n     struggled to contain a Taliban-backed insurgency that has \n     spread from FATA into settled areas, including the Swat \n     Valley and other parts of NWFP and Balochistan. This struggle \n     has taken the lives of more than 1,500 police and military \n     personnel and left more than 3,000 wounded.\n       (10) On March 27, 2009, President Obama noted, ``Multiple \n     intelligence estimates have warned that al Qaeda is actively \n     planning attacks on the U.S. homeland from its safe-haven in \n     Pakistan.''.\n       (11) According to a Government Accountability Office Report \n     (GAO-08-622), ``since 2003, the administration's national \n     security strategies and Congress have recognized that a \n     comprehensive plan that includes all elements of national \n     power--diplomatic, military, intelligence, development \n     assistance, economic, and law enforcement support--was needed \n     to address the terrorist threat emanating from the FATA'' and \n     that such a strategy was also mandated by section 7102(b)(3) \n     of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n     2004 (Public Law 108-458; 22 U.S.C. 2656f note) and section \n     2042(b)(2) of the Implementing the Recommendations of the 9/\n     11 Commission Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-53; 22 U.S.C. 2375 \n     note).\n       (12) In the past year, the people of Pakistan have been \n     especially hard hit by rising food and commodity prices and \n     severe energy shortages, with two-thirds of the population \n     living on less than $2 a day and one-fifth of the population \n     living below the poverty line according to the United Nations \n     Development Program.\n       (13) The people of Pakistan and the United States share \n     many compatible goals, including--\n       (A) combating terrorism and violent radicalism, both inside \n     Pakistan and elsewhere;\n       (B) solidifying democracy and the rule of law in Pakistan;\n       (C) promoting the economic development of Pakistan, both \n     through the building of infrastructure and the facilitation \n     of increased trade;\n       (D) promoting the social and material well-being of \n     Pakistani citizens, particularly through development of such \n     basic services as public education, access to potable water, \n     and medical treatment; and\n       (E) safeguarding the peace and security of South Asia, \n     including by facilitating peaceful relations between Pakistan \n     and its neighbors.\n       (14) According to consistent opinion research, including \n     that of the Pew Global Attitudes Survey (December 28, 2007) \n     and the International Republican Institute (January 29, \n     2008), many people in Pakistan have historically viewed the \n     relationship between the United States and Pakistan as a \n     transactional one, characterized by a heavy emphasis on \n     security issues with little attention to other matters of \n     great interest to citizens of Pakistan.\n       (15) The election of a civilian government in Pakistan in \n     February 2008 provides an opportunity, after nearly a decade \n     of military-dominated rule, to place relations between \n     Pakistan and the United States on a new and more stable \n     foundation.\n       (16) Both the Government of Pakistan and the United States \n     Government should seek to enhance the bilateral relationship \n     through additional multi-faceted engagement in order to \n     strengthen the foundation for a consistent and reliable long-\n     term partnership between the two countries.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON COALITION SUPPORT FUNDS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Coalition Support Funds are critical components of the \n     global fight against terrorism, and in Pakistan provide \n     essential support for--\n       (A) military operations of the Government of Pakistan to \n     destroy the terrorist threat and close the terrorist safe \n     haven, known or suspected, in the FATA, the NWFP, and other \n     regions of Pakistan; and\n       (B) military operations of the Government of Pakistan to \n     protect United States and allied logistic operations in \n     support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan;\n       (2) despite the broad discretion Congress granted the \n     Secretary of Defense in terms of managing Coalition Support \n     Funds, the Pakistan reimbursement claims process for \n     Coalition Support Funds requires increased oversight and \n     accountability, consistent with the conclusions of the June \n     2008 report of the United States Government Accountability \n     Office (GAO-08-806);\n       (3) in order to ensure that this significant United States \n     effort in support of countering terrorism in Pakistan \n     effectively ensures the intended use of Coalition Support \n     Funds, and to avoid redundancy in other security assistance \n     programs, such as Foreign Military Financing and Foreign \n     Military Sales, more specific guidance should be generated, \n     and accountability delineated, for officials associated with \n     oversight of this program within the United States Embassy in \n     Pakistan, the United States Central Command, the Department \n     of Defense, the Department of State, and the Office of \n     Management and Budget; and\n       (4) the Secretary of Defense should submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees and the Committees on \n     Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     a semiannual report on the use of Coalition Support Funds, \n     which may be submitted in classified or unclassified form as \n     necessary.\n\n     SEC. 8.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should--\n       (1) recognize the bold political steps the Pakistan \n     electorate has taken during a time of heightened sensitivity \n     and tension in 2007 and 2008 to elect a new civilian \n     government, as well as the continued quest for good \n     governance and the rule of law under the elected government \n     in 2008 and 2009;\n       (2) seize this strategic opportunity in the interests of \n     Pakistan as well as in the national security interests of the \n     United States to expand its engagement with the Government \n     and people of Pakistan in areas of particular interest and \n     importance to the people of Pakistan;\n       (3) continue to build a responsible and reciprocal security \n     relationship taking into account the national security \n     interests of the United States as well as regional and \n     national dynamics in Pakistan to further strengthen and \n     enable the position of Pakistan as a major non-NATO ally[; \n     and];\n       (4) seek ways to strengthen our countries' mutual \n     understanding and promote greater insight and knowledge of \n     each other's social, cultural and historical diversity \n     through personnel exchanges and support for the establishment \n     of institutions of higher learning with international \n     accreditation[.]; and\n       (5) explore means to consult with and utilize the relevant \n     expertise and skills of the Pakistani-American community.\n\n     SEC. 10. TERM OF YEARS.\n\n       With the exception of subsections (b)(1)(B), (j), (k), and \n     (l) of section 5, this Act shall remain in force after \n     September 30, 2013. \n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is considering S. \n962, the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act. I would like to \ncommend Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar--the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee, respectively for introducing \nthis important legislation and working to achieve its passage. I am \nproud to cosponsor this bill.\n  Pakistan's stability is of vital strategic importance to the United \nStates of America. A nuclear-armed nation, Pakistan is also home to \nTaliban and al-Qaida militants who have taken countless innocent lives \nin their quest to impose an extremist vision on the world. We must \nsupport the Government of Pakistan as it confronts the threat of \nviolent extremism, and we must support the people of Pakistan to enable \nthem to resist extremist threats. Reports indicate over 2 million \nPakistanis have been displaced following Taliban advances in recent \nmonths. This humanitarian crisis is compounded by fundamental problems \nof widespread poverty and underdevelopment. The United Nations \nDevelopment Program reports two-thirds of Pakistan's population live on \nless than $2 a day. America's efforts in Pakistan must empower \nPakistanis to improve their living conditions and resist propaganda \ncampaigns by extremist groups. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan \nAct is an essential effort in accomplishing this mission.\n  America's relationship with Pakistan has too often relied on military \naid and not enough on promoting a deeper, long-term strategic \nengagement with the Pakistani people. The Enhanced Partnership with \nPakistan Act is intended to transform this relationship. The bill calls \nfor a tripling of nonmilitary aid to Pakistan and conditions assistance \nof the United States on Pakistan's continued progress and achievement \nof benchmarks. In these difficult economic times, we must ensure \ntaxpayer dollars are spent wisely. The Enhanced Partnership with \nPakistan Act requires the President to submit regular reports to \nCongress to ensure this is the case, and resources have the desired \nimpact.\n  I look forward to continuing to build our relationship with the \npeople of Pakistan as we tackle shared challenges and explore shared \nopportunities.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the committee-reported amendments \nbe agreed to, the bill as amended be read three times, passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee-reported amendments were agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 962), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 962\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Enhanced Partnership with \n     Pakistan Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The people of Pakistan and the United States have a \n     long history of friendship and\n\n[[Page S7019]]\n\n     comity, and the interests of both nations are well-served by \n     strengthening and deepening this friendship.\n       (2) In February 2008, the people of Pakistan elected a \n     civilian government, reversing years of political tension and \n     mounting popular concern over governance and their own \n     democratic reform and political development.\n       (3) A democratic, moderate, modernizing Pakistan would \n     represent the wishes of the Pakistani people and serve as a \n     model to other countries around the world.\n       (4) Economic growth is a fundamental foundation for human \n     security and national stability in Pakistan, a country with \n     over 175,000,000 people, an annual population growth rate of \n     2 percent, and a ranking of 136 out of 177 countries in the \n     United Nations Human Development Index.\n       (5) Pakistan is a major non-NATO ally of the United States \n     and has been a valuable partner in the battle against al \n     Qaeda and the Taliban, but much more remains to be \n     accomplished by both nations.\n       (6) The struggle against al Qaeda, the Taliban, and \n     affiliated terrorist groups has led to the deaths of several \n     thousand Pakistani civilians and members of the security \n     forces of Pakistan over the past 7 years.\n       (7) Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, more \n     al Qaeda terrorist suspects have been apprehended in Pakistan \n     than in any other country, including Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, \n     Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Abu Faraj al-Libi.\n       (8) Despite the sacrifices and cooperation of the security \n     forces of Pakistan, the top leadership of al Qaeda, as well \n     as the leadership and rank-and-file of affiliated terrorist \n     groups, are believed to be using Pakistan's Federally \n     Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and parts of the North West \n     Frontier Province (NWFP) and Balochistan as a haven and a \n     base from which to organize terrorist actions in Pakistan and \n     globally, including--\n       (A) attacks outside of Pakistan that have been attributed \n     to groups with Pakistani connections, including--\n       (i) the suicide car bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul, \n     Afghanistan, which killed 58 people on June 7, 2008; and\n       (ii) the massacre of approximately 165 people in Mumbai, \n     India, including 6 United States citizens, in late November \n     2008; and\n       (B) attacks within Pakistan, including--\n       (i) an attack on the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team in \n     Lahore on March 3, 2009;\n       (ii) an attack at the Marriott hotel in Islamabad on \n     September 9, 2008;\n       (iii) the bombing of a political rally in Karachi on \n     October 18, 2007;\n       (iv) the targeting and killing of dozens of tribal, \n     provincial, and national holders of political office;\n       (v) an attack by gunfire on the U.S. Principal Officer in \n     Peshawar in August 2008; and\n       (vi) the brazen assassination of former Prime Minister \n     Benazir Bhutto on December 27, 2007.\n       (9) In the 12-month period ending on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, Pakistan's security forces have \n     struggled to contain a Taliban-backed insurgency that has \n     spread from FATA into settled areas, including the Swat \n     Valley and other parts of NWFP and Balochistan. This struggle \n     has taken the lives of more than 1,500 police and military \n     personnel and left more than 3,000 wounded.\n       (10) On March 27, 2009, President Obama noted, ``Multiple \n     intelligence estimates have warned that al Qaeda is actively \n     planning attacks on the U.S. homeland from its safe-haven in \n     Pakistan.''.\n       (11) According to a Government Accountability Office Report \n     (GAO-08-622), ``since 2003, the administration's national \n     security strategies and Congress have recognized that a \n     comprehensive plan that includes all elements of national \n     power--diplomatic, military, intelligence, development \n     assistance, economic, and law enforcement support--was needed \n     to address the terrorist threat emanating from the FATA'' and \n     that such a strategy was also mandated by section 7102(b)(3) \n     of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n     2004 (Public Law 108-458; 22 U.S.C. 2656f note) and section \n     2042(b)(2) of the Implementing the Recommendations of the 9/\n     11 Commission Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-53; 22 U.S.C. 2375 \n     note).\n       (12) In the past year, the people of Pakistan have been \n     especially hard hit by rising food and commodity prices and \n     severe energy shortages, with two-thirds of the population \n     living on less than $2 a day and one-fifth of the population \n     living below the poverty line according to the United Nations \n     Development Program.\n       (13) The people of Pakistan and the United States share \n     many compatible goals, including--\n       (A) combating terrorism and violent radicalism, both inside \n     Pakistan and elsewhere;\n       (B) solidifying democracy and the rule of law in Pakistan;\n       (C) promoting the economic development of Pakistan, both \n     through the building of infrastructure and the facilitation \n     of increased trade;\n       (D) promoting the social and material well-being of \n     Pakistani citizens, particularly through development of such \n     basic services as public education, access to potable water, \n     and medical treatment; and\n       (E) safeguarding the peace and security of South Asia, \n     including by facilitating peaceful relations between Pakistan \n     and its neighbors.\n       (14) According to consistent opinion research, including \n     that of the Pew Global Attitudes Survey (December 28, 2007) \n     and the International Republican Institute (January 29, \n     2008), many people in Pakistan have historically viewed the \n     relationship between the United States and Pakistan as a \n     transactional one, characterized by a heavy emphasis on \n     security issues with little attention to other matters of \n     great interest to citizens of Pakistan.\n       (15) The election of a civilian government in Pakistan in \n     February 2008 provides an opportunity, after nearly a decade \n     of military-dominated rule, to place relations between \n     Pakistan and the United States on a new and more stable \n     foundation.\n       (16) Both the Government of Pakistan and the United States \n     Government should seek to enhance the bilateral relationship \n     through additional multi-faceted engagement in order to \n     strengthen the foundation for a consistent and reliable long-\n     term partnership between the two countries.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON COALITION SUPPORT FUNDS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Coalition Support Funds are critical components of the \n     global fight against terrorism, and in Pakistan provide \n     essential support for--\n       (A) military operations of the Government of Pakistan to \n     destroy the terrorist threat and close the terrorist safe \n     haven, known or suspected, in the FATA, the NWFP, and other \n     regions of Pakistan; and\n       (B) military operations of the Government of Pakistan to \n     protect United States and allied logistic operations in \n     support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan;\n       (2) despite the broad discretion Congress granted the \n     Secretary of Defense in terms of managing Coalition Support \n     Funds, the Pakistan reimbursement claims process for \n     Coalition Support Funds requires increased oversight and \n     accountability, consistent with the conclusions of the June \n     2008 report of the United States Government Accountability \n     Office (GAO-08-806);\n       (3) in order to ensure that this significant United States \n     effort in support of countering terrorism in Pakistan \n     effectively ensures the intended use of Coalition Support \n     Funds, and to avoid redundancy in other security assistance \n     programs, such as Foreign Military Financing and Foreign \n     Military Sales, more specific guidance should be generated, \n     and accountability delineated, for officials associated with \n     oversight of this program within the United States Embassy in \n     Pakistan, the United States Central Command, the Department \n     of Defense, the Department of State, and the Office of \n     Management and Budget; and\n       (4) the Secretary of Defense should submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees and the Committees on \n     Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     a semiannual report on the use of Coalition Support Funds, \n     which may be submitted in classified or unclassified form as \n     necessary.\n\n     SEC. 8.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should--\n       (1) recognize the bold political steps the Pakistan \n     electorate has taken during a time of heightened sensitivity \n     and tension in 2007 and 2008 to elect a new civilian \n     government, as well as the continued quest for good \n     governance and the rule of law under the elected government \n     in 2008 and 2009;\n       (2) seize this strategic opportunity in the interests of \n     Pakistan as well as in the national security interests of the \n     United States to expand its engagement with the Government \n     and people of Pakistan in areas of particular interest and \n     importance to the people of Pakistan;\n       (3) continue to build a responsible and reciprocal security \n     relationship taking into account the national security \n     interests of the United States as well as regional and \n     national dynamics in Pakistan to further strengthen and \n     enable the position of Pakistan as a major non-NATO ally;\n       (4) seek ways to strengthen our countries' mutual \n     understanding and promote greater insight and knowledge of \n     each other's social, cultural and historical diversity \n     through personnel exchanges and support for the establishment \n     of institutions of higher learning with international \n     accreditation; and\n       (5) explore means to consult with and utilize the relevant \n     expertise and skills of the Pakistani-American community.\n\n     SEC. 10.

Res. 29\n\n       Whereas John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson was a flamboyant, \n     defiant, and controversial figure in the history of the \n     United States who challenged racial biases;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson was born in Galveston, Texas, in 1878 \n     to parents who were former slaves;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson became a professional boxer and \n     traveled throughout the United States, fighting White and \n     African-American heavyweights;\n       Whereas, after being denied (on purely racial grounds) the \n     opportunity to fight 2 White champions, in 1908, Jack Johnson \n     was granted an opportunity by an Australian promoter to fight \n     the reigning White title-holder, Tommy Burns;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson defeated Tommy Burns to become the \n     first African-American to hold the title of Heavyweight \n     Champion of the World;\n       Whereas, the victory by Jack Johnson over Tommy Burns \n     prompted a search for a White boxer who could beat Jack \n     Johnson, a recruitment effort that was dubbed the search for \n     the ``great white hope'';\n       Whereas, in 1910, a White former champion named Jim \n     Jeffries left retirement to fight Jack Johnson in Reno, \n     Nevada;\n       Whereas Jim Jeffries lost to Jack Johnson in what was \n     deemed the ``Battle of the Century'';\n       Whereas the defeat of Jim Jeffries by Jack Johnson led to \n     rioting, aggression against African-Americans, and the \n     racially motivated murder of African-Americans nationwide;\n       Whereas the relationships of Jack Johnson with White women \n     compounded the resentment felt toward him by many Whites;\n       Whereas, between 1901 and 1910, 754 African-Americans were \n     lynched, some for simply for being ``too familiar'' with \n     White women;\n       Whereas, in 1910, Congress passed the Act of June 25, 1910 \n     (commonly known as the ``White Slave Traffic Act'' or the \n     ``Mann Act'') (18 U.S.C. 2421 et seq.), which outlawed the \n     transportation of women in interstate or foreign commerce \n     ``for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any \n     other immoral purpose'';\n       Whereas, in October 1912, Jack Johnson became involved with \n     a White woman whose mother disapproved of their relationship \n     and sought action from the Department of Justice, claiming \n     that Jack Johnson had abducted her daughter;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson was arrested by Federal marshals on \n     October 18, 1912, for transporting the woman across State \n     lines for an ``immoral purpose'' in violation of the Mann \n     Act;\n       Whereas the Mann Act charges against Jack Johnson were \n     dropped when the woman refused to cooperate with Federal \n     authorities, and then married Jack Johnson;\n       Whereas Federal authorities persisted and summoned a White \n     woman named Belle Schreiber, who testified that Jack Johnson \n     had transported her across State lines for the purpose of \n     ``prostitution and debauchery'';\n       Whereas, in 1913, Jack Johnson was convicted of violating \n     the Mann Act and sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in Federal \n     prison;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson fled the United States to Canada and \n     various European and South American countries;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson lost the Heavyweight Championship \n     title to Jess Willard in Cuba in 1915;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson returned to the United States in July \n     1920, surrendered to authorities, and served nearly a year in \n     the Federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson subsequently fought in boxing matches, \n     but never regained the Heavyweight Championship title;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson served his country during World War II \n     by encouraging citizens to buy war bonds and participating in \n     exhibition boxing matches to promote the war bond cause;\n       Whereas Jack Johnson died in an automobile accident in \n     1946;

Mr. President, this resolution will bring more \nattention to the crucial need for more minorities to become bone marrow \ndonors. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, Senator Isakson of \nGeorgia, and my good friend, Representative Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, \nin supporting this important endeavor.\n  According to A Bone Marrow Wish Foundation, bone marrow transplants \ncan cure over 70 life-threatening diseases such as leukemia. About 70 \npercent of patients will need a nonfamily member to donate healthy \nmarrow.\n  Generally, minority patients will need a match from someone who \nshares the same ethnicity. But finding a successful match can be a huge \nchallenge: although there are more than 6 million potential donors \nregistered, only 450,000 are African Americans.\n\n[[Page S7023]]\n\n  I know from firsthand experience how important such a donation can \nbe. Last year, any chief of staff, who is Latina, made a donation to a \n9-year-old child with leukemia.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join us in encouraging more Americans \nto learn more about bone marrow donation and perhaps consider being a \ndonor themselves.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support from the National \nMarrow Donor Program be printed after my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                National Marrow Donor Program,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2009.\n     Resolution Designating July as African American Bone Marrow \n         Awareness Month.\n\n     Hon.

You have been a long \n     time supporter of the NMDP and the Bone Marrow Wish \n     Organization, which is an NMDP affiliated nonprofit based in \n     Detroit that works to promote awareness in minority \n     communities. We applaud your efforts to bring further \n     attention to the need for African Americans to join the \n     Registry.\n       The NMDP is entrusted to operate the C.W. Bill Young Cell \n     Transplantation Program (Program) via competitively bid \n     contracts with the Health Resources and Services \n     Administration (HRSA). The NMDP is the international leader \n     in the facilitation of unrelated donor transplants using bone \n     marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, and umbilical cord \n     blood. We provide a single point of access for physicians and \n     transplant patients. Over the last 20 years, the NMDP has \n     facilitated over 35,000 transplants for patients with blood \n     disorders such as leukemia, lymphoma and aplastic anemia, as \n     well as certain immune system and genetic disorders. Congress \n     established the program to ensure that every American in need \n     of transplantation has access to a matching unrelated adult \n     donor or cord blood unit.\n       This resolution will assist the NMDP with our efforts to \n     recruit African American donors to the Registry by \n     designating the month of July for the NMDP to promote donor \n     awareness and increase the number of African Americans \n     registered, which is critical to our success. Adding \n     minorities to the Registry, and in particular African \n     Americans, is critical. Unlike Caucasians who have an 88-\n     percent chance of finding a match on the Registry or \n     Hispanics who have an 81-percent chance, African Americans \n     only have a 60-percent chance of finding a match. In \n     designating July as African American Bone Marrow Awareness \n     Month, the NMDP can continue to promote awareness to ensure \n     that all Americans have a greater chance of finding a match.\n       Today the Registry lists over seven million adult donors on \n     the Registry, but only 8-percent of those donors are African \n     Americans. In closing, every day, more 6,000 men, women, and \n     children search the National Marrow Donor Registry for a \n     match. More donors are needed on the Registry so that all \n     patients in need will have access to this therapy. This \n     resolution will help raise the awareness needed to add more \n     donors to the Registry. We appreciate your continued efforts \n     to support the mission of the NMDP and to assist us to \n     increase the numbers of individuals on the National Registry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Michael J. Boo,\n                                           Chief Strategy Officer.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid on the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate, and any statements be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 205) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 205\n\n       Whereas a bone marrow or blood cell transplant is a \n     potentially life-saving treatment for patients with leukemia, \n     lymphoma, and other blood diseases;\n       Whereas a bone marrow or blood cell transplant replaces a \n     patient's unhealthy blood cells with healthy blood-forming \n     cells from a volunteer donor;\n       Whereas a patient who does not have a suitably matching \n     donor in the family may search the National Marrow Donor \n     Program Donor Registry for a donor;\n       Whereas blood or cell samples from adult donors or cord \n     blood units are tested and the tissue or cell type is added \n     to the National Marrow Donor Program Donor Registry, and \n     physicians may search that registry when they need to find \n     donors whose tissue type matches their patients';\n       Whereas African Americans make up 8 percent of, or more \n     than 550,000 of the 7,000,000 people currently on, the \n     National Marrow Donor Program Donor Registry;\n       Whereas of the 35,000 people that have received transplants \n     since the inception of the National Marrow Donor Program \n     Donor Registry, only 1,500 have been African Americans;\n       Whereas more than 70 life-threatening diseases can be \n     treated with a bone marrow transplant;\n       Whereas there is a possibility that an African American \n     patient could match a donor from any racial or ethnic group, \n     but the most likely match is another African American;\n       Whereas to become a volunteer donor, potential donors must \n     be between 18 and 60 years of age, meet health guidelines, \n     provide a small blood sample or swab of cheek cells to \n     determine the donor's tissue type, complete a brief health \n     questionnaire, and sign a consent form to have the tissue \n     type of the donor listed on the Donor Registry;\n       Whereas the Bone Marrow Wish Organization, which is a \n     minority-run nonprofit organization based in Detroit that was \n     started by an actual bone marrow donor, is initiating \n     ``African American Bone Marrow Awareness Month'';\n       Whereas the annual month of awareness would promote donor \n     awareness and increase the number of African Americans \n     registered with the National Marrow Donor Program throughout \n     the Nation; and\n       Whereas July 2009 would be an appropriate month to observe \n     African American Bone Marrow Awareness Month: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of African American Bone \n     Marrow Awareness Month;\n       (2) urges the people of the United States to participate in \n     appropriate programs and activities with respect to bone \n     marrow awareness, including speaking with health care \n     professionals about bone marrow donation; and\n       (3) urges all people of the United States to register to \n     become blood marrow donors and encourages all people of the \n     United States to organize blood marrow registration drives in \n     their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/24/senate-section/article/S7023-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1344\n\n  Mr. REID.
