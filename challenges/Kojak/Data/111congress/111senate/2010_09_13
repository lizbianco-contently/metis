Mr. President, as I said, I welcome back all my colleagues \nfrom all corners of the country. I am sure every Senator enjoyed \nspending time with their constituents as much as I did. I am sure all \nare eager to get back to the business of legislating.\n  The work period we begin today is an important one. Like every work \nperiod, it represents a new opportunity to move past the partisan \nstalemates of recent months and find common ground on our most pressing \npriority: putting people back to work. I hope the weeks between now and \nColumbus Day will be productive weeks. There really is no reason they \nshould not be. The issues we will be dealing with are not partisan or \nideological. They have the\n\n[[Page S7004]]\n\nsupport of Democratic, Republican, and Independent Senators. They have \nthe support of Democratic, Republican, and Independent constituents. \nAll of us have a common obligation and a shared interest in doing all \nwe can to get our economy moving again.\n  If we were to adopt a slogan to guide us in the coming weeks, I would \nnominate something a colleague of ours said just a few days ago. The \nsenior Senator from Ohio, Mr. George Voinovich, a Republican, was \ntalking last week about the standoffs that have stalled the Senate--\ngridlock that has kept us in recent months from realizing our ability \nand fulfilling our responsibility to help small businesses. He said:\n\n       We don't have time for messaging. We don't have time \n     anymore. This country is really hurting.\n\n  Senator Voinovich is right. Small businesses across Nevada are \nhurting. Small businesses across my friend's State of Ohio are hurting. \nSmall businesses across the State of Oregon are hurting. All over this \ncountry, they are hurt, from coast to coast, because credit and capital \nare too hard to come by. The owners of these businesses are not \ninterested in partisan rhetoric, and neither are the people they have \nhad to lay off or the unemployed they have had to turn away. People in \nNevada and throughout the Nation are too busy keeping track of their \nbusiness's books or their family budgets to keep track of who is \nscoring political points. They are not interested in any of that. They \nare simply desperate for us to do our jobs, and that is to help create \njobs.\n  That is what the first vote Senators will cast tomorrow is all about. \nTomorrow, we will decide whether to move ahead with a bill that helps \nmore small businesses be the engine that runs our economy. When most \nAmericans go to work in the morning--or whenever they go to work during \nthe day--they do not go to big corporations with famous names. They go \nto work at small businesses. But those businesses are also the ones \nthat have paid the highest price in Wall Street's recession. Two out of \nevery three jobs we have lost came from small businesses.\n  Our bill is not a new one, and tomorrow will not be the first time we \nvoted on it. But to refresh my colleagues' memories, let me briefly \nremind everyone what is in it.\n  One, it cuts small business taxes so they can hire and grow.\n  Two, it increases Small Business Administration loan limits, which \ngets money flowing to the entrepreneurs who create jobs.\n  Three, it makes it easier for small businesses to export what they \nmake.\n  Four, among other things, it creates a new lending fund that will \ngive small banks, community banks--and, by extension, small \nbusinesses--more capital to invest.\n  Most importantly, this bill will create jobs, up to 500,000--half a \nmillion jobs. But every day we delay, the opposite happens. Small \nbusinesses are holding off hiring while they wait for us to act. Banks \nlarge and small are holding on to their capital while they are waiting \nfor us to act. And half a million Americans who want to work, people \nwho are ready to get off unemployment and get back to jobs they so \ndesperately need, are desperate for us to get our act together.\n  We need to go to work. As the Republican Senator from Florida, Mr. \nLeMieux, said when we last debated this bill--remember, Senator LeMieux \nis a Republican. He said it should get the support of more than 80 \nSenators. As my friend the Republican Senator from Ohio said: We do not \nhave time anymore for political games. Our citizens are hurting too \nmuch.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/13/senate-section/article/S7004-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for the last 19 months, the American \npeople have waited patiently for the Obama administration and Democrats \nin Congress to help them turn the economy around. And time and time \nagain, the administration and its allies in Congress have turned a deaf \near. Rather than implement the policies that would free up capital, \nlead to investment, and create good, lasting, private sector jobs, \nDemocrats in Congress have passed one sweeping government-driven scheme \nafter another and then asked taxpayers to put it on their tab.\n  A stimulus bill that was supposed to be timely, targeted, and \ntemporary turned out to be a liberal wish list instead. Instead of \nstimulating the economy and keeping unemployment below 8 percent, as \npromised, we stand here today with nearly 10 percent unemployment \nnationwide and many more Americans struggling to find full-time work. A \nhealth care bill that was supposed to lower costs is doing the \nopposite. As I have repeatedly said in the past and as a new government \nreport confirmed just last week, the President's health care plan will \nbend the cost curve up, not down. A financial regulatory bill that was \nsupposed to protect Main Street is being embraced by some of the \nbiggest players on Wall Street, while smalltown bankers and retailers \nbrace themselves for the costly and burdensome rules and regulations it \nwill impose on them. Every one of these bills came at a steep price to \nthe taxpayer, and until now, Democrats have been content to borrow the \nmoney, to simply pile it onto the debt.\n  Now comes the second half of the story, the final piece of their \nagenda--the part where they point to all that spending and demand \npayment for it, where they try to make it all permanent. Democrats \nspent the last 2 years putting government in charge of health care, the \nfinancial sector, car companies, insurance companies, student loans--\nyou name it. Now they want the tax hike to pay for it all. Americans \nasked the administration to fix the sink, and they remodeled the house \ninstead. Now they are sending us the bill.\n  That was the plan all along: force these massive programs through, \ndrive up the debt, call it a crisis, and then demand that people pay \ntheir ``fair share'' to dig us out. It starts with small business \nowners, but I assure you it will not stop there because if Democrats \nspend this much money in the middle of a recession, they will borrow \nand spend even more once we are out of it. The President admitted as \nmuch just last week on national television when he said the tax hike he \nis asking for will not be used to pay for any of the things he has \nalready done. He will use the money from these tax hikes to spend on \nother things, on ``better things,'' as he put it. We have seen the so-\ncalled better things Democrats want to spend tax money on--a stimulus \nbill that is funding research on interpretive dance and monkeys, a \nhealth care bill that cut Medicare and increased premiums, and a \nfinancial regulatory bill that hires more of the same kinds of \nWashington bureaucrats who missed the last crisis. Americans have had \nit. They are tired of Democratic leaders in Washington pursuing the \nsame government-driven programs that have done nothing but add to the \ndebt and the burden of government.\n  We cannot allow this administration to demand that small business \nowners in this country pay for its own fiscal recklessness. That is why \nI am introducing legislation today that ensures no one in this country \nwill pay higher income taxes next year than they are right now. We \ncannot let the people who have been hit the hardest by this recession \nand who need to create the jobs that will get us out of it foot the \nbill for the Democrats' 2-year adventure in expanded government. We \ncan't allow America's job creators to pay for Democrats' out-of-control \nspending over the past 2 years any more than we can allow Main Street \nto pay for the greed of Wall Street. Wall Street should pay for its own \nexcesses. So should the administration and Democratic leaders in \nWashington.\n  The good news is there is a growing chorus of Democrats, at least \nfive right here in the Senate, who are coming around on this issue. \nThey oppose the tax hikes the administration is proposing. As Senator \nLieberman put it earlier today:\n\n       I don't think it makes sense to raise any Federal taxes \n     during the uncertain economy we are struggling through. The \n     more money we leave in private hands, the quicker our \n     economic recovery will be.\n\n  That was Senator Lieberman today. I couldn't agree more. Only in \nWashington could someone propose a tax hike as an antidote to a \nrecession.\n\n[[Page S7005]]\n\n  This is no small tax hike. The tax hike the administration is \nproposing, according to the IRS, would apply to half of all small \nbusiness income in this country. An analysis by the National Federation \nof Independent Business shows that businesses that employ 20 to 250 \npeople would be the hardest hit. All told, according to the nonpartisan \nJoint Committee on Taxation, right at 750,000 small businesses would be \nimpacted by this tax increase.\n  Here is the bottom line: No recovery will take place until the \ngovernment stops overspending. No recovery will take place until \ngovernment stops imposing new regulations and costs on business. No \nrecovery will take place if we impose new taxes on the people we need \nto create jobs. Democratic leaders need to listen to what the American \npeople have been shouting at us for the last 19 months: The reckless \nspending has to stop. So far, they have made no concrete concessions, \nbut now it is time they join Republicans, stand up to the \nadministration, and declare that the spending spree is over. That is \nthe first step on the road to recovery.\n  As for the next step, Republicans stood together before the August \nrecess and put together a plan that would save taxpayers $300 billion \nover the next 10 years. That is a good place to start.\n  So Democrats have a choice. They can stand with us on this proposal \nand show they finally realize we cannot spend our way out of the \nrecession or they can continue to stand with an administration whose \npolicies--real and threatened--represent the greatest obstacle to our \nNation's economic recovery.\n  Let's face it. The Democratic agenda has been disastrous for the \neconomy: 2\\1/2\\ million jobs lost, $2.5 trillion more in debt, more \njob-stifling regulations, mandates, and redtape, and now they want to \ndrive another nail in the coffin--a massive tax hike on the very people \nwho will dig us out of this recession by expanding their businesses and \ncreating jobs.\n  Republicans are offering a choice: more of the same or the new \ndirection the American people are asking for.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/13/senate-section/article/S7005-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I listened carefully when the Republican \nleader from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, came to the floor. This is the \nkey time, before an election campaign, when parties announce their \ngoals, their strategy, their message to the voters.\n  So I listened carefully as the Republican Senate leader came to the \nfloor for the first time in this 3-week period, to spell out what his \ngoals would be in terms of where the country has been coming from and \nwhere it will go. It struck my as strange. Because, at this time of \nyear, we are used to new shows coming on television, new seasons \nbeginning, being introduced to new plot lines and new stars and new \nideas and broadcasts, but we do not expect reruns. To get reruns being \nannounced on television at this time of year would be defeating the \npurpose of attracting an audience interested in what is new.\n  I listened to Senator McConnell's speech, and it was a Republican \nrerun, things they have been saying for the last year and a half, in \nfact for many years, still the message of the Republican Party. What \nthey say and what Senator McConnell said today is: Elect us to lead the \nSenate and we will give you more of the same. We will return you to the \nBush economic policies.\n  I listened carefully as he criticized President Obama. I have heard \nhim before. Senator McConnell has come to the floor and criticized \nPresident Obama for intervening to try to save the automobile companies \nacross the United States. Many of us supported the President. I think \nthe President was right. He did not run for office to become a major \nleader in saving American automobile companies.\n  This was a challenge thrust on him. Yet he accepted it and realized \nif we started closing down automobile plants across Illinois and across \nAmerica, thousands of people would be out of work. He did not want to \nsee that happen. So the government did intervene.\n  I have heard the Senator from Kentucky come to the floor before, as \nhe did this afternoon, and criticize the President for his intervention \nin the automobile companies. Well, during the course of our August \nbreak, many of us were busy doing a lot of things. It is possible that \nSenator McConnell missed the good news, the good news in the New York \nTimes on Friday August 13 and Saturday August 14.\n  On Friday, August 13, headline: ``Profit Strong, G.M. Names a New \nChief.'' Then, on August 14: ``Detroit Goes From Gloom to Economic \nBright Spot. Optimism is Rising With Sales, Profits and Hiring--Economy \nStill a Threat.''\n  Here is what the article said:\n\n       After a dismal period of huge losses and deep cuts that \n     culminated in the Obama administration's bailout of General \n     Motors and Chrysler, the gloom over the American auto \n     industry is starting to lift. Jobs are growing. Factory \n     workers are anticipating their first healthy profit-sharing \n     check in years. Sales are rebounding, with the Commerce \n     Department reporting Friday that automobiles were a bright \n     spot in July's mostly disappointing retail sales.\n\n  The Senator from Kentucky must have missed it. The very action he \ncriticized, of the Obama administration intervening with the automobile \ncompanies, has been a success. Mr. Whitacre is stepping aside. GM is \npicking its own chief. They are off on their own now, in a profitable \nway, to keep jobs in the United States and not ship them overseas. All \nthe criticism of what President Obama did notwithstanding, this worked. \nThis was a success. This saved jobs.\n  But, again, the litany of grievances from the Republican side \nincluded that the President did something to help GM and Chrysler. \nThank goodness he did for the thousands of workers in my home State of \nIllinois and across the United States of America.\n  I heard the Senator from Kentucky criticize the President's attempt \nto reduce the cost of health insurance for Americans; the President's \nattempt to give senior citizens on Medicare a helping hand to pay for \ntheir prescription drugs. I wish the Senator from Kentucky could have \nbeen with me in Champaign, IL, when I met with a group of senior \ncitizens who thanked us for the $250 of relief this year, which will \ngrow every year, until we fill the doughnut hole in prescription Part \nD.\n  I wish the Senator from Kentucky could have been with me as I \ntraveled around Illinois and had mothers come up to me and talk about \n22-year-old sons with preexisting conditions who did not qualify for \nhealth insurance and thank me because the health care reform bill now \nsays that son or daughter can stay under the family health insurance \nplan until they reach the age of 26.\n  If Senator McConnell and others believe we should repeal this, that \nwe should take away this protection for families on health insurance--\n$250 to help those under Medicare prescription Part D--or the strength \nthat people will now have to fight off insurance companies that deny \nthem coverage when they need it the most, if that is his position, so \nbe it.\n  But it is not a new idea. It is a speech he has delivered on the \nfloor over and over and over. So the Republican message for November \nis: Go back to the old days when you did not have a fighting chance \nagainst health insurance companies, when nobody would stand up to them. \nGo back to the old days when we would not put any money into the \nrecession that is threatening our country.\n  The President did with the stimulus package, which is being ridiculed \nwith some dance lessons or whatever he said. I wish Senator McConnell \nwould have come to see this President's stimulus package at work in \nIllinois. It\n\n[[Page S7006]]\n\ntakes a lot longer to drive because we are building highways right and \nleft and airports.\n  Downtown Normal, IL, has an intermodal center that is the centerpiece \nof revitalizing downtown; major contribution from the President's \nstimulus package, putting hundreds of people to work smack-dab in \ncentral Illinois, where those jobs count.\n  I heard the minority leader, the Senator from Kentucky, criticize the \nWall Street reform bill. He criticized the Wall Street reform bill, \nafter Bernie Madoff and the bailouts of the Bush Administration, after \nbillions of dollars sent to Wall Street because of their failures, and \nthey thanked us, sent us a little thank-you card and said: Oh, \nincidentally, we are giving one another bonuses with your bailout \nmoney.\n  Well, for some that was fine but not for President Obama, not for \nthis Congress. We have real Wall Street reform, which will guarantee no \nmore bailouts. That was Senator Boxer's amendment. No. 2, make certain \nWall Street is regulated so it does not sink us in another recession, \nthe way we are languishing now in one that is going to take a long time \nfrom which to recover.\n  The Senator from Kentucky believes that was a bad idea. He voted \nagainst it. I think it was a good idea to pass Wall Street reform. The \nfinal centerpiece of the Republican message for November is to return \nto the Bush tax cuts. President Obama has said, we should extend the \ntax cuts for married couples making under $250,000 and for individuals \nmaking under $200,000 but, he said: Let's not give them to the \nwealthiest Americans, the top 2 percent.\n  So if you happen to be among the fortunate few in America who make $1 \nmillion a year, what is the difference? Well, the difference is this: \nUnder our plan of capping this tax cut at $250,000, the millionaire is \nonly going to get $6,300 in a tax cut. I do not know if they will even \nnotice it, $6,300.\n  But under Senator McConnell's plan, the centerpiece of the Republican \ncampaign strategy for November, he wants the millionaire to receive a \n$100,000 tax cut, a tax cut most have not asked for and many do not \nneed. They do it in the name of helping small business.\n  Do you know how many small business owners are in that category? \nThree percent. It includes some doctors, some lawyers, and the like. So \nwhat we are saying is, let us do something to put money in the economy, \ntax cuts for those with $250,000 or less in income, let us help the \nmiddle class people in America who have been struggling with an economy \nthat has not been very generous to them over the past decade or two.\n  Third, let's not ignore the deficit. Senator McConnell's proposal for \ntax cuts for people making the highest levels of income in America will \nadd $700 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years, $700 billion. \nSo for the so-called deficit hawks on the other side, those hawks are \ncircling, but they are blind to the fact that tax cuts to the \nwealthiest people in America plunges us more deeply into debt and makes \nit more difficult for future generations that will face this \nresponsibility.\n  So I listened carefully as the Senator from Kentucky spelled out the \nRepublican plan. We have heard this song before. We have seen this \nplay. We watched all these reruns before. We do not need to see them \nagain. We need to move forward as a nation. The first thing we have to \ndo tomorrow is break the Republican filibuster on the small business \nbill, this bill supported by the Chamber of Commerce, by the National \nFederation of Independent Business, and small businesses across \nAmerica. Tomorrow, with the help of at least one Republican Senator, we \nare finally going to break this Republican filibuster and we are going \nto finally send the credit that is needed to Main Street in America so \nsmall businesses have a fighting chance to put new people on their \npayroll and help bring us out of this recession. That is looking \nforward, not backward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/13/senate-section/article/S7006-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7006-S7008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAX INCREASES\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to also talk a bit today about why \nRepublicans oppose raising taxes on anyone. President Obama and his \nsupporters have repeatedly argued that tax increases will only affect a \nfew of the wealthiest Americans, ``millionaires,'' the President \nclaims, and people ``who can afford it,'' to use his words.\n  First of all, I do not think the President should be pitting \nAmericans against each other. Class warfare has no place in our \ndebates. Americans agree with President Kennedy's formulation that a \nrising tide lifts all boats. Americans believe--it is our basic idea of \na country--that we want everyone here to succeed, to do well, and not \nto pit one group of us against another group.\n  We all aspire to be in the very top groups of whatever we are talking \nabout, and because of the kind of country we have, we have that \nopportunity, and people do move from one income tax bracket up to the \nnext one, for example, as we increase our incomes. So we do not want to \npunish anyone for being successful. That class warfare went out of \nstyle when the Cold War ended. I do not think it has a part in our \ndebate.\n  Second, his assertions about who will pay are patently false. Small \nbusiness will be among the hardest hit by these tax increases. Let me \nexplain why this is true because, as you have just heard, some on the \nother side tend to pooh-pooh this idea. The reason is this. Under the \nInternal Revenue Code, many small businesses are organized as \npassthrough entities, meaning they pay taxes at the individual income \ntax marginal rates. So if you and your wife or you and your husband own \na small business, and you are a passthrough entity, you pay your small \nbusiness income taxes as individuals. That is how this happens. You are \nnot a corporation, you are paying your taxes as people, as individuals, \nthe same as anybody else pays as an individual.\n  Those who currently pay at either the 33 or 35 percent rate, which is \nthe top two marginal rates, would, under the President's proposal, have \ntheir taxes increased so you would then be paying 36 or 39.9 percent, \nrespectively, and if you add in the health care legislation-required \ntaxes, it is closer to 42 percent. So you are going from 35 to 42 \npercent as an individual paying individual income taxes on the money \nyou make through the small business you and your spouse own, for \nexample.\n  My colleague from Illinois says: Well, that does not apply to very \nmany people. How many people does it apply to? What is 3 percent of the \npeople with this kind of income? Almost 750,000 people. Almost 750,000, \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation--not my number--estimates \nthat in 2011, next year, just about 750,000 taxpayers with net-positive \nbusiness income will have marginal rates of 36 or 39.6 percent under \nthe President's proposal.\n  That is 750,000 of the most productive small businesses in the \ncountry. The National Federation of Independent Business survey \nrevealed that the businesses most likely to face a tax increase employ \nbetween 20 and 250 employees. So we are talking not about insignificant \nbusinesses but those that actually employ people. We also know that \ncoming out of an economic downturn, the first jobs that are created are \nsmall business jobs.\n  According to U.S. Census numbers, businesses with between 20 and 299 \nworkers employ more than 25 percent of the entire workforce. So when we \ntalk about, well, it is only 3 percent. Well, the question is, 3 \npercent of what? How many does that actually amount to? How many of the \nemployees in the entire country does that mean? Twenty-five percent of \nthe employees in the country is, by any measure, a significant chunk of \nfolks.\n  These are the people whom we want to raise taxes on? I do not think \nso. Some Democrats have been claiming these tax increases, as I said, \nwould exempt 97 percent of small businesses. Well, let me shed a little \nbit of light on that number.\n  In a recent Wall Street Journal article entitled, ``The Small \nBusiness Tax Hike and the 97 Percent Fallacy,'' two economists, well \nrespected, Kevin Hassett and Alan Viard, explained that anyone who \nreports business income on Schedule C of their tax return is counted as \na small business.\n  So if someone makes a little money selling a product on eBay and \nreports that as business income, they are counted as a small business.\n\n[[Page S7007]]\n\n  What is the result? Obviously, we have a lot of folks counted as \nsmall businesses who are not really the kind of small businesses we \nthink of as employing folks, these companies that employ between 20 and \n299 workers. The other group just reports schedule C income and are not \nthe kind of small businesses creating jobs. This is a very important \nnumber to keep in mind.\n  According to the IRS, Hassett and Viard write, ``fully 48 percent of \nthe net income of sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations \nreported on tax returns went to households with incomes above $200,000 \nin 2007. That's the number to look at.''\n  So when we talk about these small businesses, these corporations \nwhose owners report their income as individual income, 48 percent of \nthe net income of sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S \ncorporations reported on tax returns went to people above the $200,000 \nmark. Those are the small businesses that are employing people. Those \nare the folks who will be hardest hit when this tax increase is put \ninto effect. Frankly, it is many of these businesses that are the most \nprofitable small businesses, and they are the ones that will be \ncreating the new jobs to bring us out of the economic doldrums we are \nin. Americans know this. That is why I think the key to economic \nrecovery being new jobs depends upon what we do to punish the people \nwho create the new jobs. We don't need more government spending. That \nis the old plan of the Democrats. It has clearly failed. What we need \nis new jobs.\n  The President recently proposed a package of temporary tax credits \nthat includes, among other things, a writeoff for all business capital \npurchases in 2011. Obviously, this concedes the economic point that tax \nrelief can spur job growth, but there is cognitive dissonance about \nwhat the rate increases will mean for small businesses.\n  I turn again to an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal by Michael \nFleischer who is a small business owner in New Jersey. He wrote an op-\ned entitled, ``Why I am Not Hiring.'' We want to know the answer to \nthat, if we are going to figure out how to help him hire more people.\n  He added up all of the costs of government when he hires somebody \nnew, particularly the tax cost. He also included regulatory costs and \nother mandates. His conclusion:\n\n       A life in business is filled with uncertainties, but I can \n     be quite sure that every time I hire someone my obligations \n     to the government go up. From where I sit, the government's \n     message is unmistakable: Creating a new job carries a \n     punishing price.\n\n  What price is he talking about, looking at this potential tax \nincrease I have been talking about? He estimates over $75,000 to hire \nsomebody who makes $44,000. So I think his cost was close to $78,000. \nThat is the punishing burden we put upon businessmen such as him just \nto hire more people. Some big businesses can stand that. The small \nbusinesses that would bear the brunt of this tax increase cannot. That \nis precisely why small businessmen such as Michael Fleischer are not \nhiring today.\n  Why would we increase the burden he bears in hiring more people? What \nwe ought to be doing is ensuring that the tax rates that have been in \neffect now for 10 years can continue forward so people have certainty \nabout what they will be paying, and those very small business folks who \nare hiring the people we want to go back to work would not have to pay \nan additional burden in the form of a higher income tax rate.\n  The President and some of our friends on the other side have argued \nthat if taxes don't go up, those in the top brackets will just save \nmore; that will do little for job creation and economic growth. This is \nthe one that really bugs me. It is as if we can't appreciate what \nhappens when somebody saves money. Do my colleagues know of anybody who \nburies money in their backyard? I don't. Any person who saves money \neither puts it in a bank where it is lent out to somebody, usually a \nbusiness so it can hire more people or buy equipment, or they invest in \na stock or a bond, equities usually. What is that investment? It is \nproviding capital to business. What does business do with capital? It \neither hires people or buys equipment, which generally requires people \nto make it, and therefore they get hired as well.\n  The bottom line is, yes; it is fine for people who immediately go out \nand spend their money. That does have an indirect effect on job \ncreation. If enough people spend enough money, somebody will have to go \nback to work to make the products. But the truth is, money that is \nsaved has a direct impact on job creation because it directly provides \ncapital to businesses so they can expand. Saving doesn't mean throwing \none's money in a mattress or burying it in the backyard. It means \ninvesting it in our economy. If taxes go up, less money is available \nfor those investments and for job creation.\n  A final note: Supporters of the pending tax hikes have frequently \ncited the booming economy of the 1990s to strengthen their case. They \nsay if the economy performed so well under President Clinton, what is \nthe big deal about returning to Clinton era income tax rates? First, \nthey don't want to return to Clinton era income tax rates on anybody \nexcept millionaires, these people who make over $250,000 a year. But in \nany event, the argument misses the point. The question is not whether \nit is possible to have strong economic growth with higher income tax \nrates, though it is less likely that occurs. Rather, the question is \nwhether we should be raising taxes in the aftermath of one of the worst \nrecessions where some people are talking about having a double-dip \nrecession, and it is clear we are not out of America's worst financial \ncrisis and recession since World War II. I don't know of an economist \nwho says that is a good idea.\n  Peter Orszag, the President's last OMB Director, just had a big op-ed \nin the New York Times in which he said this is not the time to raise \ntaxes, when we still have these economic difficulties--on anybody. \nIndeed, the timing of President Obama's proposed tax increases could \nnot be worse.\n  I just cite the example of Japan during the so-called lost decade. \nThey suffered a massive financial collapse in the early 1990s. One of \nthe responses was to actually reduce taxes and boost economic activity. \nAnd it did. They began to come back. Then for reasons that elude me, \nthey decided in 1997 to raise taxes again and, sure enough, the economy \nfell back into recession. I should think Japan's experience provides a \ncautionary tail about the dangers of increasing taxes amid a very shaky \neconomic recovery.\n  In their comprehensive survey of financial meltdowns across the \nglobe, economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff tell us that \nrecoveries following such meltdowns are typically quite slow. The \ncurrent U.S. recovery is no exception. America's unemployment rate has \nbeen above 9 percent for more than a year. Speaking to the Federal \nReserve's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Reinhart said that based on \nthe history of past financial crises, it is conceivable that U.S. \nunemployment could stay at 8 or 9 percent for another 7 years.\n  If that is the case, why on Earth would anybody be talking about \nraising taxes on anyone, most especially the small business folks who \nwill be the first to hire coming out of this economic downturn? It is \nbeyond me.\n  Obviously, the way to avoid that bleak scenario is to reject the tax \nincreases proposed by the President and some on the other side of the \naisle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, never before in history has an \nadministration claimed to have so much love for small businesses. In \nfact, the President recently stated:\n\n       This is as American as apple pie. Small businesses are the \n     backbone of the economy. They are central to our identity as \n     a nation. They are going to lead this recovery.\n\n  It seems virtually every news story, every speech, every forum \nincludes something about standing up for small business. Small business \nowners should love that; right? Yet they are up to their eyeballs with \nthis administration. They are so darn angry they could spit fire. Why? \nBecause they are tired of the President and others saying one thing and \nthen doing another.\n  A perfect example, a prime example, is the 1099 paperwork mandate in \nthe health care law. Why on Earth would the administration bury \nbusinesses in costly paperwork while claiming publicly to support them. \nI am talking about, of all things, section 9006 of the new health care \nlaw. It is buried in the health care bill at page 737. This provision \nillustrates this administration is\n\n[[Page S7008]]\n\nabsolutely tone deaf to the plight of small businesses.\n  It says, if a business purchases more than $600 of goods or services \nfrom another business, they will be required to provide the business \nand the Internal Revenue Service with a 1099 tax form. The new mandate \nwill affect all kinds of businesses, not to mention nonprofits, local \ngovernments, and State governments.\n  For example, I received a letter from the Society of American \nFlorists asking for help. Here is how it will affect their daily \nbusiness:\n\n       Small retail florists . . . will have to issue 1099's to \n     their wholesalers, landlords and gas stations. Wholesalers \n     purchasing flowers and plants from growers will need to issue \n     1099's. Growers who send staff to trade shows will have to \n     issue a 1099 to the hotel in which those staff members sleep.\n\n  Increased paperwork, of course, means increased costs. One small \nbusiness owner in Nebraska said this will cost him $23,000 a year. That \nmay not sound like much in Washington where we talk about trillions, \nbut to a small business in Nebraska that is a lot of money. It would go \na long way to hiring another person.\n  One would assume there is a great benefit that makes it worthwhile to \nbury our job creators in this paperwork. But, sadly, this is not even \nthe case. A division of the IRS predicts there will be little benefit \nand big headaches. The IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate projects high \ncosts to businesses and the IRS, along with a mess of erroneous tax \npenalties.\n  To my left is a quote from the IRS. This is what they say: The IRS \n``will face challenges making productive use of this new volume of \ninformation.''\n  It goes on:\n\n       . . . it is highly likely that the IRS will improperly \n     assess penalties that it must abate later, after great \n     expenditure of taxpayer and IRS time and effort.\n\n  Not even the IRS wants this information. Simply put, it is an \nexpensive mess without a lot of tax dollars to show for it.\n  So we are going to stifle job creation. We are going to hammer \nbusinesses and ultimately increase incorrect tax penalties, according \nto the IRS. Now we begin to understand why business owners are spitting \nmad. It makes no sense whatsoever. That is why my amendment is so \nterribly important. It fully repeals this section of the law. It is \npaid for. Countless small businesses have advocated for a full repeal \nof this language.\n  According to the National Federation of Independent Business:\n\n       It is clear there is bipartisan agreement that the 1099 \n     provision contained in the health care law will have a direct \n     negative impact on small businesses.\n\n  The House Democratic leadership recognized the job-stifling, job-\nkilling provision and proposed a full repeal of this new 1099 \nrequirement. Of 239 House Democrats, all those voting except one \nsupported a full repeal of this portion of the new health care law. \nHouse Democrats recognize that the 1099 mandate is absolutely misguided \nand downright damaging to job creation.\n  Unfortunately, in the Senate, there is a Democratic-proposed \nalternative that only partially repeals the mandate, and all it does is \nadd confusion to try to accomplish political cover. Instead of actually \nsolving the problem, it picks winners and losers with thousands of \nbusinesses still subject to the job-killing mandate.\n  Businesses with 26 or more employees are still subject to the \nmandate--I might ask, what is the wisdom of 26? Why not 25, 24?--for \ntransactions totaling $5,000 or more. So what does that mean? According \nto the Census Bureau, the Democratic amendment will still subject \n415,391 businesses in the United States to a job-killing paperwork \nmandate that not even the IRS wants, and over 93 million workers are \nemployed by these businesses.\n  Now, what does that mean to individual States?\n  Let's take a look. In the State of California, 18,960 businesses \nwould still be subject to the mandate under the side-by-side amendment. \nDoes anybody want to go to these businesses in California and say: We \nare burying you in paperwork for no useful purpose to try to pay for \nthe health care bill? In Florida, more than 11,000 businesses have more \nthan 25 employers; Texas, 14,208 businesses. I could go on and on. \nFurthermore, it will continue the paperwork nightmare.\n  Governments, nonprofits, and businesses will still have to track \neverything and collect the tax information from their vendors because \nthey do not know if they have made the first purchase going to $5,000 \nor the last purchase that will not tangle them up in this requirement.\n  It will also discourage businesses from expanding and hiring. Why \nwould we want to say to businesses: You are OK if you are at 25; but if \nyou get to 26, we hammer you? It makes no sense whatsoever.\n  One of the most discouraging aspects of the alternative by my friends \non the other side is that it favors Wall Street over Main Street. It \nexempts certain payments from big businesses that have fancy systems to \ncomply with tax laws, but it severely hurts the mom-and-pop enterprises \non Main Street.\n  Businesses that are not exempt will find ways to limit the number of \n1099s. They might buy some supplies from the big box retailers and \navoid the mom-and-pop retailer on Main Street to avoid the government-\nimposed 1099 mandate.\n  As our Chamber of Commerce said:\n\n       Governments, nonprofits and businesses would have a choice, \n     to buy supplies from Joe's Stationary and report to the IRS \n     or buy from the national chain and not have to report at all \n     . . . small businesses will become second class citizens \n     since they will be the ones that will lose out.\n\n  You see, with all due respect to my colleague, this side-by-side \namendment brings a patchwork of exemptions for businesses to sort \nthrough.\n  Under this amendment, property is exempted. Yet there is no \ndefinition of ``property.'' It leaves business owners in the lurch, \ncrossing their fingers, hoping the IRS will exempt transactions. This \nis not certainty. It is utter confusion.\n  All businesses will have to track their transactions until the IRS \nfigures out what ``property'' is. Even after ``property'' is defined, \nit will lead to a patchwork of exemptions. Every time a business owner \nwants to buy something, they have to call their accountant.\n  This amendment also claims to soften the blow by exempting credit \ncard transactions.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another \nminute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. But the truth is, the IRS has already announced steps to \nimplement that exact same policy. The unfortunate thing about this \nexemption is that it will cause more problems, not fewer: pay by check, \npay by credit card; property, nonproperty; 24 employees versus 26 \nemployers; and on and on. It was all done to finance the health care \nbill on the backs of American businesses.\n  I ask my colleagues to support my effort to repeal this job-killing \nmandate in its entirety when we have an opportunity to vote tomorrow.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nSTART, the nuclear arms reduction treaty pending before the Senate.\n  This week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on which I have \nthe privilege of serving, will convene to vote on this New START \nTreaty. Since the treaty was signed by the United States and Russia in \nApril, both the Foreign Relations and the Armed Services Committees \nhave conducted more than a dozen hearings, both open and classified, to \nexamine the essential goal of this treaty: to advance the national \nsecurity of the United States.\n  After hours of testimony from some of the most knowledgeable people \nin and out of government, as well as public statements of support from \ncountless experts, we can say with great confidence that the Senate's \nratification of the START Treaty is in our national interest.\n  Witnesses who testified before the committee come from wide \nbackgrounds of the government, academia,\n\n[[Page S7009]]\n\nand private industry. Former government officials, both civilian and \nmilitary, who have held positions of the highest responsibility for our \nnational defense and nuclear security--including former Republican \nadministration officials who had negotiated and implemented previous \nSTART treaties--were among those who testified and called for the \ntreaty's speedy ratification.\n  All have been experts, with years, if not decades, of experience in \nthe field of national security and arms control, and all have strongly \nendorsed ratification of the treaty.\n  In addition to its contribution to America's security, one of the \nmost compelling reasons for the full Senate to ratify this treaty, and \nmove quickly to do so, is to regain our insight into Russia's strategic \noffensive arms. Since START I expired last December, we have had no \ncomprehensive verification regime in place to help us understand \nRussia's strategic nuclear forces.\n  We need the transparency to know what Russia is doing to provide \nconfidence and stability, and we need that confidence and stability to \ncontribute to a safer world. We will only regain that transparency by \nratifying this treaty, and we are in dangerous territory without it.\n  Previous arms control treaties have been ratified with overwhelming \nbipartisan support. START I was passed 93 to 6 in 1994, and the Moscow \nTreaty passed 95 to 0 in 2003. Legislators recognized then that an arms \ncontrol agreement between Russia and the United States is not just good \nfor the security of our two nations but can lead the way for the rest \nof the world to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The \nratification of this treaty reconfirms U.S. leadership on nuclear arms \nreduction and nonproliferation.\n  Over the past several months we have had ample time to review the \ndocuments and reports related to the treaty. I am sure my colleagues \nwill join me in recognizing the necessity of ratifying New START. Not \nonly will this treaty enhance the national security of the United \nStates, it will serve as a significant step forward in our relationship \nwith Russia, a key partner in the overall U.S. strategy to reduce the \nspread of nuclear weapons worldwide.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 2 hours of debate with respect to the nomination, with the time \nequally divided between the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from \nAlabama or their designees.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I think the \nleadership and others were expecting a vote at 5:30. If the Democratic \nand Republican sides yield back any time to bring the vote at 5:30, \nthat would be permissible; would it not?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Acting President pro tempore.\n  This afternoon, the Senate is going to finally consider and finally \nvote on the nomination of Jane Stranch of Tennessee to the Sixth \nCircuit. She is a native of Nashville, TN. She has practiced law in \nthat community for 32 years. She has often appeared before the Sixth \nCircuit, the court to which she is now nominated. Ms. Stranch has \ndecades of experience in labor and employment law. Actually, that is an \nexpertise she made useful when she taught a class on labor law at \nNashville's Belmont University.\n  Ms. Stranch also has an active appellate practice, as well as \nsignificant experience with alternative forms of dispute resolution, \nsuch as mediation and arbitration. She is a leader in her community. \nShe dedicates significant time to pro bono work, and that is something \nI always look for in a nominee. She dedicates significant time also to \ncivic matters and her church. She has impressive academic credentials. \nShe earned both her JD, Order of the Coif, and her BA, summa cum laude \nand Phi Beta Kappa, from Vanderbilt University.\n  Her nomination is supported by her home State Senators, both \nRepublicans. Her nomination was reported by a bipartisan majority of \nthe Judiciary Committee last November. That was nearly 10 months ago. \nSince then, every single Democratic Senator has said--actually they did \nright from the time she was reported--they were prepared to debate and \nvote on this nomination. I have spoken many times about the Democrats' \nwillingness and the need to consider this nomination.\n  In mid-July, I came before the Senate to take the extraordinary step \nof propounding a unanimous consent request to consider this nomination \nbecause at that time we had waited months and months and months and \nmonths, and I felt she should be given a chance to have a vote.\n  The senior Senator from Tennessee, who I see on the floor now, \nsupported that request. I made very clear at that time--and I will make \nvery clear again today--that in no way do I fault the senior Senator \nfrom Tennessee for the delay. In fact, he has supported this nomination \nfrom the outset. He spoke to me in favor of the nomination at the time \nit came before the committee. He spoke to me in favor of the nomination \nwhen it was before the committee and immediately after it came out of \nthe committee. He has been most supportive all the way through.\n  Indeed, I think this nomination is an example of how President Obama \nhas reached out and worked with Senators from both sides of the aisle. \nBut I made that request after she had been waiting 8 months for just a \nvote--for a vote up or down. But after being pending on the Executive \nCalendar for those 8 months, there was an objection to my request to at \nleast let us go ahead and vote.\n  Now, I thank the Senate majority leader and the Republican leader for \nfacilitating the agreement that finally allows her consideration this \nevening. I hope now the Senate will be allowed to turn to the other \njudicial nominations that have been stalled before the Senate.\n  One nomination is that of Albert Diaz from North Carolina to the \nFourth Circuit, for example. It was reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee, but it has been stalled since January--since the \nsnows of January.\n  Others include Scott Matheson of Utah, nominated to the Tenth \nCircuit, and Janet Murguia of Arizona, nominated to the Ninth Circuit. \nI mention these because they are all supported by their Republican home \nState Senators, and they were reported by the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously, with no objections. It is hard to see how, when they are \nsupported by Republicans in their State--the President has reached out \nto them, gotten their support--and they go out of the Judiciary \nCommittee with no objections, they then sit here forever.\n  Another is Ray Lohier of New York, whose nomination to the Second \nCircuit was reported without objection. In addition, there are 12 \ndistrict court nominations on the Senate Calendar that should be \nconsidered and confirmed without further delay. They were reported as \nlong as 7 months ago.\n  A number of recent newspaper articles have discussed the judicial \nvacancy crisis that has been created by the Republican strategy of \nslow-walking the Senate's consideration of noncontroversial \nnominations. Remember,\n\n[[Page S7010]]\n\nthese are all people who, when they finally get a vote after waiting \nmonths and months and months, usually get a unanimous vote. These \ninclude district court nominations, which are traditionally considered \nwithout delays, and they have never been targeted for obstruction by \nDemocrats or Republicans when they have been supported by their home \nState Senators. Last year, the Senate was allowed to confirm only 12 \nFederal circuit and district court judges all year. That was the lowest \ntotal in more than 50 years. So far this year, we have confirmed only \n28 more and achieved what one recent news story noted is the lowest \nnumber of confirmations in more than 40 years.\n  I took serious note of the remarks of Justice Anthony Kennedy--a \nJustice nominated by a Republican President--who spoke last month at \nthe Ninth Circuit conference about the cost of skyrocketing judicial \nvacancies not only in California but throughout the country. He said:\n\n       It's important for the public to understand that the \n     excellence of the federal judiciary is at risk.\n\n  He further noted that:\n\n       If judicial excellence is cast upon a sea of congressional \n     indifference, the rule of law is imperiled.\n\n  I hope all Senators will heed Justice Kennedy's serious warning \nbecause he is absolutely correct. We should not let partisan \ncalculations stand in the way of doing our job for the American people.\n  If, in fact, the action we are taking this evening represents a \nbipartisan willingness to return to the Senate's tradition of offering \nadvice and consent without extensive delay, then I welcome it. Because \nin my 36 years in the Senate, I have never seen anything to match the \ndelays we have seen over the last year and a half, under either \nDemocratic or Republican Presidents. I hope we will promptly consider \nthe other 63 nominations that remain on the Executive Calendar, which \nhave already been considered and favorably reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I remember President Bush's first year in office. I became chairman \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee halfway through that year. Many said: \nWell, after Senate Republicans had pocket-filibustered more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominations, then we should do the same to \nPresident Bush. I said, No; I don't want that kind of tit for tat. \nBecause of the 60 pocket filibusters by the Republicans of President \nClinton's nominations, judicial vacancies skyrocketed to more than 110. \nSo what I did, during the only 17 months as chairman of the committee \nduring President Bush's first 3 years in office, is I worked hard and \nwe proceeded in that 17 months to confirm 100 of his judicial \nnominations. I did that in 17 months. I contrast this to the first 2 \nyears of President Obama's term. Senate Republicans have allowed only \n40 Federal circuit and district court nominees to be considered by the \nSenate.\n  The history of the Sixth Circuit is detailed in my July 29, 2002, \nSenate statement in support of another Tennessee nominee, Judge Julia \nGibbons. As chairman, I proceeded to a confirmation hearing for Judge \nGibbons in April of 2002. That was the first hearing for a Sixth \nCircuit nominee in 5 years. Republicans refused to hold any hearings \nfor a Sixth Circuit nomination prior to that because they were made by \na Democratic President, President Clinton. He nominated Judge Helene \nWhite, an experienced State court judge. They refused to hold a \nhearing. He nominated Kathleen McCree Lewis, an accomplished attorney \nand the daughter of former Solicitor General of the United States and \nformer Sixth Circuit Judge Wade McCree. They refused. When the \nPresident nominated Kent Markus, a law professor and a former Justice \nDepartment official who had the support of his Republican home State \nSenator, they refused. By proceeding with President Bush's 2002 Sixth \nCircuit nomination of Judge Julia Gibbons of Tennessee and then his \nnomination of Judge Rogers of Kentucky, I wished to break that logjam \nand chose a better way of doing it.\n  When I resumed the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee in 2007, \nwe were able to fill the last remaining vacancies on the Sixth Circuit \nwhen we confirmed President Bush's nominations of Judge Helene White \nand Judge Ray Kethledge of Michigan to the Sixth Circuit. So after \nRepublicans kept the Sixth Circuit vacant all those years by pocket-\nfilibustering President Clinton's nominations, Democrats worked with a \nRepublican President to bring it back to full. In fact, overall, \njudicial vacancies were reduced during the Bush years from more than 10 \npercent, caused by the pocket-filibustering of 60 of President \nClinton's nominees, to less than 4 percent. But now, because of the \nblocking of President Obama's nominees, judicial vacancies are now \nagain over 10 percent. Mind you, during the Clinton years, Federal \nCircuit vacancies doubled because of the pocket-filibustering by the \nRepublicans. During the Bush years, the Federal circuit court vacancies \nreduced from a high of 32 down to single digits. We have not had the \nsame cooperation on the Republican side with President Obama.\n  During the Bush years, Democrats enabled the reduction of vacancies \nin nine circuits. Since then, vacancies in six circuits have risen. \nDuring the first 2 years of the Bush administration, the 100 judges \nconfirmed and considered by the Senate--and this is when I was chairman \nand President Bush was President, during his first 2 years--we \nconsidered these judges an average of 25 days after being reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee. The average time for confirming circuit court \nnominees was 26 days. By contrast, the average time for the Federal \ncircuit and district court judges confirmed since President Obama took \noffice is 90 days after being reported. The average time for circuit \nnominees is 147 days. Contrast this with when it was not unusual during \nPresident Bush's time when we would report them out one day and had \nthem confirmed within 2 or 3 days thereafter.\n  It would be one thing if he made nominations opposed by home State \nSenators. President Obama has not. Typically, he has reached out. He \nwas worked with home State Senators in both parties. Likewise, I have \nrespected the minority. I have not brought up people who did not have \nthe support of their Republican home State Senators. We have tried to \nstrengthen the cooperation between the parties and branches. Frankly, \nit is disappointing that the others take the opposite approach. Again, \nI have been here with half a dozen different Democratic leaders and \nRepublican leaders and half a dozen different Presidents. I have never \nseen anything such as this.\n  There is no good reason to hold up consideration, for weeks and \nmonths, of nominees who have been reported unanimously from the \nJudiciary Committee, where every Republican, every Democrat reported \nthem favorably. In fact, over the recent recess, tensions increased \nagain when someone from the Republican side of the aisle anonymously--\ndidn't even come forward and say who it was--anonymously objected to \nthe standard practice of holding nominations in place during the August \nrecess and insisted that five judicial nominees who had been reported \nfavorably be returned to the President. Ironically, it was just days \nbefore that objection that the President and the Republican leader met \nand agreed to work together. I remember when Republicans used to \ncontend that any nomination reported by the committee, whether \nunanimous or otherwise, was entitled to an up-or-down vote. That was \nthen. I guess this is now. Indeed, 24 judicial nominations favorably \nreported by the Senate Judiciary Committee have not been acted upon by \nthe Senate--24--because Republicans have objected.\n  We have fallen well off the pace we set for nominations in 2001 and \n2002. When the Senate entered its August recess in 2002, we had \nconfirmed 72 of President Bush's circuit and district court \nnominations, including our confirming 8 nominations by voice vote as \nthe Senate wrapped up before the recess. I am rather proud of that \nbecause I had been chairman for barely 12 months when we did those 72. \nOnly 6 nominations remained on the Executive Calendar, and all of them \nwere later confirmed. No judicial nominations were returned to \nPresident Bush. By this date in 2002, we had already confirmed five \nmore judicial nominations after the August recess, for a total of 77 of \nPresident Bush's district and circuit nominees confirmed by a \nDemocratic Senate.\n\n  What has happened? What has happened? Democrats do not say we are\n\n[[Page S7011]]\n\ngoing to take revenge after what was done to President Clinton by a \nthen Republican majority. We said we will move forward on these because \nthe Federal judiciary should be separate from politics. They should be \nable to go forward. We can have elections and we can go and fight each \nother during elections and the voters will decide that one of us will \nget elected and one will not, but the Federal judiciary should be \noutside of that kind of politics.\n  So unlike those 77 of President Bush's district and circuit court \nnominees by this time, we have confirmed only 40 of President Obama's \ncircuit and district court nominations. In fact, we were permitted only \nfour noncontroversial nominations as we headed into recess. Five \njudicial nominations were sent back to the President. So as a result, \n17 judicial nominations remain stalled on the Executive Calendar today. \nIt has been different, I would say, in the Judiciary Committee itself, \nand I thank the ranking Republican, Senator Sessions. He has cooperated \nwith me and worked with me during the whole process of hearings in \nconsidering nominations in the Judiciary Committee. He knows I have \nrespected and protected every single Republican on that committee when \nthey have asked for extra time or asked for extra information. But the \nbottom line is, the Senate has taken more than five times as long to \nconsider President Obama's reported circuit court nominations than we \ndid to consider President Bush's during his first 2 years in office. It \nis not fair to the Senate judiciary. It is not fair to the nominees. \nThey can't go forward with their lives while this is pending. They have \na law practice. Everything is on hold for month after month after \nmonth. As we know, there are people who have turned down nominations \nbecause they said: Why should we wait for a year or so, even though we \nare going to get confirmed unanimously after that time.\n  As I have said, if the consent to schedule this debate and vote today \nis a signal that other nominations reported favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee will also be scheduled for final consideration without \nfurther unnecessary delay, I will be encouraged. We can, and must, do a \nbetter job responding to the judicial vacancy crisis.\n  I spoke a little longer than I normally would, but I am going to be \nspeaking to the judiciary conference tomorrow at the invitation of \nChief Justice John Roberts. I know the concern from the judges is why \nthese people get nominated and then they wait for months or never get \nconfirmed. Again, I would say, in this regard, it has been a joy to \nwork with the senior Senator from Tennessee, somebody I have known in \nhis role as Governor and Cabinet member. I consider him a good friend. \nIf it had been left to just the two of us, this would have been done \nmonths and months ago.\n  So I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nhis remarks. It is my great pleasure today to recommend to the Senate \nJane Branstetter Stranch, from Nashville. Jane has been nominated to be \na judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, as Senator \nLeahy has said.\n  She has a distinguished academic background: summa cum laude with Phi \nBeta Kappa honors from Vanderbilt University, which is not easy to do; \nVanderbilt School of Law, with top grades there. She has lots of \npractical experience, having taught labor law at Belmont College in \nNashville.\n  Jane's law firm is a family affair. Her father, who I imagine is \nwatching today, is one of Nashville's best known and most respected \nattorneys, Cecil Branstetter. As a member of the Tennessee legislature \nduring the 1950s he introduced legislation to allow women to serve on \njuries, so I know he has some special pride today to see the Senate \nconsidering the nomination of his daughter to be a federal judge.\n  Maybe more important than any of these other things, Ms. Stranch has \nbeen very active in her PTA, in her church, and in the Nashville \ncommunity.\n  I was Governor of Tennessee for 8 years. As Governor, I appointed \nabout 50 judges. I didn't ask them their politics. I didn't ask them \nhow they felt about the issues. I tried to determine if they had the \ncharacter and the intelligence and the temperament to be a judge, \nwhether they would treat people before the bench with courtesy and, \nmost important, whether they were determined to be impartial to \nlitigants before the court. I am convinced that Jane Stranch will be \nthat kind of judge. For that reason I am pleased to recommend her to my \ncolleagues in the Senate.\n  I thank Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and \nSenator Reid, the majority leader, and Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader, for agreeing to schedule this vote today. All three \nhave been instrumental in this in what is always a crowded Senate \nschedule. I also want to thank Senator Sessions, the ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, for his support of this nomination in \ncommittee.\n  I listened carefully to the Judiciary Committee chairman's remarks. I \nhave no intention of getting into a historical debate with him about \nwhether Republicans or Democrats are more guilty of holding up \nPresidential nominees. Of course, Members of the Senate have a \nconstitutional right to advise and consent on Presidential nominations. \nI know a little bit about that myself. President George H. W. Bush \nnominated me to be the U.S. Education Secretary. As soon as I came to a \nhearing on my nomination, one Senator said: Well, Governor Alexander, I \nhave heard a number of things about you that disturb me. I was held up \nanonymously by the other side of the aisle. Then, late one night, I was \nmysteriously confirmed. I went to see a Senator at that time, whose \nname was Warren Rudman, one of the most distinguished Members of our \nSenate. I said: What can I do about these Senators who are holding up \nmy nomination? He said: Keep your mouth shut; you have no cards to \nplay. Let me tell you a story. So Senator Rudman told me he had been \nnominated by President Ford in the 1970s to, I think, the Interstate \nCommerce Commission, and the incumbent Democratic Senator from New \nHampshire had held up his nomination and never would say why. It became \nso embarrassing that Rudman finally asked President Ford to withdraw \nthe nomination, because he was then Attorney General of New Hampshire \nand people were beginning to wonder what was wrong with him. I said: Is \nthat the end of the story? He said: No, I ran against the so-and-so in \nthe next election and beat him. That is how Warren Rudman became a \nSenator.\n  Senator Sessions, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, \nwas defeated when he was nominated to be a Federal judge by Senators \nwho didn't like his point of view. They voted him down in committee and \ndidn't let his nomination come before the full Senate. Now, ironically, \nnot only is he a Senator, he is the ranking Republican on the committee \nconcerning judges.\n  I am sure there may have been times when Republican Members have gone \noverboard in the exercise of their constitutional prerogative to advise \nand consent. But as I said, without getting into a tit-for-tat on who \ndid what to whom, I can vividly remember when I came to the Senate in \n2003--having appointed nearly 50 judges when I was Governor, as I said, \nin many cases without regard to party--how shocked I was at the \ntreatment President Bush's judicial nominees were receiving. This \nincluded nominees who I knew were perfectly qualified to be members of \nU.S. Courts of Appeals.\n  There was Miguel Estrada, against whom Democrats got together and \nsaid ``we are going to filibuster him,'' and they blocked him \npermanently, even though the new Supreme Court Justice, Elena Kagan, \nsaid he would be well qualified to be a member of the Supreme Court.\n  Charles Pickering was made out to be somehow unacceptable in the \ncivil rights movement when, in fact, he was a pioneer in that movement \nin Mississippi in the 1950s and 1960s, when a lot of people were not.\n  There was also William Pryor, from Alabama, who was enormously well \nqualified, and he was blocked by a filibuster on the Democratic side \nfor two\n\n[[Page S7012]]\n\nyears, even though he could have had a majority of the votes. I knew of \nWilliam Pryor because he and I had both been law clerks to Judge John \nMinor Wisdom of New Orleans, one of the finest judges who had ever \nserved on the court of appeals--the man whose court ordered that James \nMeredith be admitted to Ole Miss.\n  I was offended by the treatment of Miguel Estrada, Charles Pickering, \nWilliam Pryor, and others. So I said at the time that while I am a \nSenator, my view is going to be that any Presidential nominee to the \njudiciary deserves an up-or-down vote. We had a debate about that and a \ndiscussion about that in the Senate. Some may remember the Gang of 14 \nwho came together, Senators on both sides, and they came to an \nagreement to which I subscribe, which is that a President's nominee to \na judicial position deserves an up-or-down vote within a reasonable \nperiod of time, except under extraordinary circumstances.\n  That is my view today, and I hope the Senate will come back to that \nview, whether we have a Republican President or Democratic President. \nOn our side, many are still offended by the treatment of President \nBush's nominees in 2003, 2004, and 2005. On the other side, as you \nheard Senator Leahy say, there are some charges about Republican \noffenses. I think we should look to the future and recognize that \nPresidents are entitled to respect. They are elected by the people. The \nConstitution gives them the power to nominate and gives us the power to \nsay yes or no. We should say yes or no in a reasonable period of time \nand reserve to ourselves the right to say no, as I do, to a nomination, \nor even to filibuster a nomination in an exceptional case--but only in \nan exceptional case.\n  In this case, I am glad to support Jane Stranch. She is from \nTennessee and she is well qualified. I thank the Republican leader, the \nDemocratic leader, and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for \nscheduling this vote this afternoon. I urge my colleagues to vote \n``aye.''\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                   Prevention and Public Health Fund\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss an \namendment that Senator Johanns, from Nebraska, will be offering to the \nSmall Business Jobs and Credit Act. The amendment to be offered by the \nSenator from Nebraska--a good friend of mine and a former Secretary of \nAgriculture--however, would effectively kill the prevention and public \nhealth fund that is in the Health Care Act. That would be a grave \nmistake.\n  The prevention and public health fund was created by the Affordable \nCare Act that we passed earlier this year. On March 23, when President \nObama signed that historic bill into law, our Nation made two giant \nstrides forward. We ensured that all Americans, regardless of means, \nwill have access to quality and affordable health care. We committed \nourselves to transforming America's current ``sick care'' system into a \ntrue health care system. I have been saying for years that what we have \nin America is not a health care system, we have a ``sick care'' system. \nOnce you get sick, you get care one way or the other--emergency room, \nMedicare, Medicaid, health insurance, whatever. But that is always the \nmost expensive--waiting until someone gets sick, and then you help \nthem. So I have often said that we have a sick care system. A true \nhealth care system would put emphasis on keeping someone healthy and \nout of the hospital in the first place.\n  One of the most important elements of this transformational bill we \npassed this year--the health care reform bill--was the creation of the \nprevention and public health fund. For the first time in history, we \nhave decided not just to pay lip service to wellness and prevention but \nto invest in prevention and wellness in a very robust way.\n  We cannot wait any longer to make these investments. By dedicating \nresources to preventing obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and other \nvery costly conditions and diseases, we have a tremendous opportunity \nto both improve the health of the American people and to restrain \nhealth care spending.\n  As we can see from the chart I have here, prior to this prevention \nfund, for every dollar spent on health care, 75 cents went to treating \npatients with chronic diseases. During 2005, the United States spent \nalmost $2 trillion on health care. For every $1 spent, 75 cents went \ntoward ``sick care,'' treating people with chronic diseases. Only 4 \npennies went for prevention.\n  This underinvestment in prevention has had devastating consequences. \nChronic diseases are one of the main reasons health care costs have \nincreased so dramatically over the past several decades.\n  This chart shows what has happened since 1987. From 1987 to today, \nU.S. health spending has gone up to $628 billion. But of that increase, \ntwo-thirds of the increase, $211 billion, is due to chronic diseases--\ntwo-thirds of the increase. That is an increase of $211 billion since \n1987 because of chronic diseases, most of which are preventable. Our \ninvestment in wellness and prevention can save millions of Americans \nneedless suffering and early death. It can save countless billions of \ndollars in health care costs. Again, let's have a couple of examples \nhere that I have on these charts.\n  What is our return on investment? For every dollar spent on childhood \nimmunizations, we save $16.50. For every dollar we spend on smoking \ncessation for pregnant women, we save $6. Overall, the return on \nchronic disease prevention, on community-based prevention interventions \nis basically about 5.6 to 1 to 6.2 to 1. These are community-based \ninterventions.\n  I will say it once and I will keep saying it: Not every preventive \nand wellness measure takes place in a doctor's office. Sometimes they \ntake place in other places--where we work, where we go to school, where \nwe live. We know now, based on the Trust for America's Health, that the \nreturn on total savings we would get after 5 years would be $16.5 \nbillion and 10 to 20 years, $18.5 billion, or a return on investment of \n5.6 dollars for every dollar we put in or 6.2 dollars over 10 to 20 \nyears.\n  That is why funding these types of programs is crucial if we hope to \nslow the growth of health care costs in our country. We will not be \nable to accomplish this if we do not increase our investment in the \nprograms that prevent the development of these costly chronic diseases. \nTo this end, the new health reform law makes significant new \ninvestments in wellness, prevention, and public health. For example, it \nrequires insurance companies to cover recommended preventive services \nwith no copayments or deductibles. Think about that. You now go in, get \nrecommended preventive services, no copayments, no deductibles. It also \nensures seniors have access to free annual wellness visits and a free \npersonalized prevention plan under Medicare.\n  A critical feature of the new law we passed that I think is essential \nto a sustainable push for wellness is the new Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund. As I said earlier, bear in mind that maintaining good \nhealth is much more than just visits to the doctor's office. Where \nAmericans live, go to work, and go to school also has a profound impact \non our health. That is why, among other things, the fund provides for \ncommunity transformation grants to enable localities to tailor wellness \nand prevention programs to their specific needs and environment. In \naddition, it invests heavily in strengthening the primary care \ninfrastructure, including training for physician assistants and nurse \npractitioners, who typically practice in small clinics. That is why for \nfiscal year 2010 the prevention fund dedicated $64 million to State \npublic health departments to implement evidence-based prevention \nservices.\n  This is what we did. There is $64 million just for community and \nState prevention. We can see the others: primary care and public health \nworkforce, $273 million; infrastructure, $70 million; obesity \nprevention, $16 million; tobacco prevention, and on and on. That is \nwhat we did in 2010. It also allocated, as I mentioned, $16 million for \nobesity prevention activities and $15 million for tobacco control \nprograms. We also invested $70 million in our public health \ninfrastructure.\n  For fiscal year 2011, let's see where we go. For fiscal year 2011, \nhere is where the public health fund has gone under the Senate \nAppropriations Committee: for community prevention, $270 million; \nchronic disease State grants, $140 million; tobacco prevention and\n\n[[Page S7013]]\n\ncessation, $100 million; public health infrastructure for disease \nsurveillance, $84 million; prevention research, $50 million; community \nhealth worker demonstration project, $30 million. That is just to name \na few of the investments.\n  Given all the evidence we have--and we have a ton of evidence--\nprevention saves us money in the long run, not to mention saving us \nfrom needless suffering and chronic diseases. Why now would we want to \ngut all of this? Why would we want to take all that away when we are \ntrying to save money and keep people healthy? Why would we want to take \nall of that out? But that is exactly what the Johanns amendment does. \nThe Johanns amendment would wipe all of that out--wipe it all out. It \nwould deny any funding at all for prevention and wellness until 2018. \nFor example, it takes away funding that keeps teens from starting \nsmoking and all of the obesity avoidance and reduction programs we \nhave. We know one of the biggest chronic illnesses facing us is the \nincreasing rate of obesity among our young people. We know how to get a \nhandle on that. We have good programs and evidence-based interventions \nto keep kids from getting obese or by getting them on track to reduce \nobesity. To gut all these programs is the same old penny wise, pound \nfoolish, sick care system we have been laboring under for so many \nyears. I thought we were going to move away from that. In fact, the \nprevention and wellness provisions of the health care bill we passed \nwere some of the provisions that got strong support on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  I know a lot of my Republican friends did not support the final bill. \nI understand that. But as we developed the bill in the HELP Committee \nand on the floor, the Prevention and Public Health Fund was widely \nsupported. No one came after it. There were no amendments to gut it at \nthat time. I think people on both sides of the aisle saw the wisdom, \nregardless of how one may have felt about other aspects of the health \nreform bill--I think every one agreed we have to do more in prevention \nand wellness and public health. For this reason, I say to my \ncolleagues: Do not turn around now after we have done all this and gut \nthe money to prevent chronic illnesses and diseases and keep people \nhealthy. Do not gut that to put the money in the Johanns amendment.\n  I am not alone in understanding the importance of this fund. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters from a number of groups--everything from the American \nAssociation of People with Disabilities to the American Cancer Society, \nthe American Heart Association, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the \nNational Association of Local Boards of Health, and the YMCA. More than \n200 organizations signed a letter to us stating that the 241 \nundersigned organizations ``strongly urge you to oppose the use of the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund from the Affordable Care Act as an \noffset for an amendment offered by Senator Johanns. Such an action \nwould virtually eliminate the Fund, and mark a severe blow to this \nmonumental commitment to prevention and public health under the Act. . \n. .The Fund is a unique opportunity to truly bend the cost curve on \nhealth care spending. . . .We must ensure that we capitalize on the \nunprecedented opportunity to transform our public health system by \ninvesting in prevention and public health. We urge you to vote no on \nthe prevention fund offset within the Johanns amendment, or any other \nsuch legislative vehicles.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Partnership to Fight\n\n\n                                              Chronic Disease,\n\n                                               September 13, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chair, Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and Harkin: Good health is more than a \n     result of good medical care. Improvements in primary, \n     secondary, and tertiary prevention in settings outside the \n     medical system--at home, at work, at school, and in the \n     community--are essential to improving health in America and \n     lowering costs. The Affordable Care Act recognizes this and \n     created the Prevention and Public Health Fund (the Fund), \n     which is a key part of our national commitment to creating a \n     healthy America.\n       Accordingly, we urge you to oppose any legislative \n     proposals that take money from the Fund to pay for the \n     proposal. Regardless of the merit of such proposals, the \n     Fund, its resources, and the commitment to health they \n     represent must remain inviolate.\n       Chronic diseases--often preventable and highly manageable--\n     drive health care spending and economic losses. Just the top \n     seven chronic conditions cost the U.S. $1.3 trillion each \n     year. Recently in Health Affairs, Harvard professor David \n     Williams, former CMS Director Mark McClellan, and former CBO \n     Director Alice Rivlin opined that creating a healthy America \n     is attainable. We share their view that attainment requires a \n     ``national commitment to the health and wellness of all \n     Americans.''\n       The Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease is a national \n     coalition of more than 100 partner organizations committed to \n     supporting reforms to better prevent, detect, and manage the \n     nation's number one cause of death, disability and rising \n     health costs: chronic disease.\n       Preventing and managing chronic diseases effectively \n     depends upon people engaging in healthy behaviors and having \n     access to preventive health care services, diagnostic \n     services that detect chronic disease early, and coordinated \n     care to manage chronic illness once detected. Assuring that \n     all Americans are empowered to make the changes needed to \n     improve their health--to avoid tobacco use, eat nutritiously, \n     engage in physical activity, get screened and seek care as \n     recommended, and follow through to manage and reduce health \n     risks--requires dedicated efforts.\n       Unfortunately, we are trending in the other direction. \n     Among adults, one in three is obese. Obesity rates continue \n     to rise among young people, leading many to predict that the \n     next generation of Americans is likely to live shorter lives \n     than their parents. Obesity also drives up costs: the \n     doubling of obesity in the United States since 1987 accounts \n     for nearly 30 percent of the increase in health care \n     spending.\n       The Fund also presents a tremendous opportunity to reduce \n     health disparities. Not everyone in America has an equal \n     likelihood of living a long and healthy life. Health status \n     varies by geographic location, gender, race/ethnicity, \n     education and income, and disability, among other factors. \n     Disparities are common, and among Americans with chronic \n     diseases, minorities are more likely to suffer poor health \n     outcomes. Disparities exist across the continuum of health \n     status--from preserving health by making healthy behavioral \n     choices to detecting and addressing health risks to managing \n     chronic conditions to avoid costly complications and \n     disability. The annual price tag of racial and ethnic \n     disparities in health alone is an estimated $309 billion.\n       The potential returns on health improvement efforts \n     supported by the Fund are substantial. For example, the \n     Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimates that if all \n     Americans enjoyed the same level of health as college \n     graduates, the benefit would amount to $1 trillion a year. A \n     model estimating the impact of a modest health status \n     improvement among Medicare beneficiaries projected a savings \n     of $65.2 billion a year or $652 billion of over 10 years. \n     Similarly, a study released by Trust for America's Health, \n     investments in effective community-focused programs to \n     increase physical activity, improve nutrition, and prevent \n     tobacco use have been estimated to generate a return of more \n     than $5 for each $1 invested--for an overall savings of $16 \n     billion a year within five years.\n       The Fund stands both as means to achieve a healthy America \n     and a symbol of the commitment to do so. We urge you to \n     preserve the resources allocated to the Fund by the \n     Affordable Care Act and oppose any legislative proposals \n     relying on resources from the Fund as pay-fors.\n  Sincerely the undersigned PFCD partners and other interested \norganizations:\n       Alzheimer's Foundation of America, American Academy of \n     Nursing, American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary \n     Rehabilitation, American College of Preventive Medicine, \n     American Dietetic Association, American Sleep Apnea \n     Association, Association of Maternal & Child Health Programs, \n     Cleveland Clinic, Dialysis Patient Citizens, DMAA: The Care \n     Continuum Alliance, Easter Seals, GlaxoSmithKline, HealthCare \n     Institute of New Jersey, Healthcare Leadership Council, \n     Healthways, Life Science Vendors Alliance, The Milken \n     Institute, National Association of School Nurses, National \n     Association of Chronic Disease Directors, National Business \n     Coalition on Health, National Health Council, National \n     Hispanic Council on Aging, National Hispanic Medical \n     Association, National Latina Health Network, National Patient \n     Advocate Foundation, National Recreation and Park \n     Association, Partnership for Prevention, Prevent Blindness \n     America, South Jersey Pharmaceutical and Medical Technology \n     Industry Alliance, XLHealth, YMCA of the USA.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                September 2, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate considers the Small Business \n     Jobs and Credit Act (H.R. 5297), the 232 undersigned \n     organizations listed below strongly urge you to oppose the \n     use of the Prevention and Public Health Fund\n\n[[Page S7014]]\n\n     from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as an offset for an \n     amendment offered by Senator Johanns (No. 4596). Such an \n     action would virtually eliminate the Fund, and mark a severe \n     blow to this monumental commitment to prevention and public \n     health under the Act. We will also oppose any other such \n     efforts to use the Fund as an offset.\n       ACA included historic reforms that have the potential to \n     transform our health system. For too long, we have focused \n     spending on treating people once they are sick rather than \n     preventing illness in the first place. The Prevention and \n     Public Health Fund (Fund) is urgently needed to address the \n     many emerging health threats our country faces and the \n     persistent chronic disease rates that we must begin to \n     control. The Fund is intended to ensure a coordinated, \n     comprehensive, sustainable, and accountable approach to \n     improving our country's health outcomes through the most \n     effective prevention and public health programs.\n       ACA clearly states that the money be used ``for programs \n     authorized by the Public Health Service Act, for prevention, \n     wellness, and public health activities.'' The money would be \n     strategically used to support disease prevention by promoting \n     access to vaccines, building the public health workforce, and \n     investing in community-based prevention. Furthermore, the Act \n     specifically states that community-based prevention funding \n     must only support evidence-based prevention programs which \n     have been shown through scientific research to reduce chronic \n     disease, including behavioral health conditions, and address \n     health disparities. Research has shown that effective \n     community level prevention activities focusing on nutrition, \n     physical activity and smoking cessation can reduce chronic \n     disease rates and have a significant return on investment.\n       Already in Fiscal Year 2010, we have seen these funds \n     invested for programs to promote tobacco control and \n     implement tobacco cessation services and campaigns, as well \n     as obesity prevention, better nutrition and physical \n     activity. The fund has been invested to support state, local \n     and tribal public health efforts to advance health promotion \n     and disease prevention, and to build state and local capacity \n     to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease \n     outbreaks. The funds are also being used to support the \n     training of current and next generation public health \n     professionals.\n       The Fund is a unique opportunity to truly bend the cost \n     curve on health care spending. Seventy-five percent of all \n     health care costs in our country are spent on the treatment \n     of chronic diseases, many of which could be prevented. \n     Further, in a public opinion survey conducted just prior to \n     the passage of the Act, Trust for America's Health and the \n     Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) found that 71 percent \n     of Americans favored an increased investment in disease \n     prevention and that disease prevention was one of the most \n     popular components of health reform.\n       We must ensure that we capitalize on the unprecedented \n     opportunity to transform our public health system by \n     investing in prevention and public health. We urge you to \n     vote NO on the prevention fund offset within the Johanns \n     amendment, or on any other such legislative vehicles.\n           Sincerely,\n       AARP; ACCESS Women's Health Justice;

Mr. President, I am sympathetic, I must admit, to the \nbroader aims of the Johanns amendment. On a bipartisan basis, Senators \nwant to change the information reporting rules for small businesses \nunder the health reform law. But the $19.2 billion cost of the Johanns \namendment is excessive. Moreover, to pay for it by slashing funds from \nwellness and prevention, by gutting this whole program until 2018, is \ndeeply misguided. It perpetuates the disastrous notion that we can \nneglect and defund prevention efforts without paying huge long-term \ncosts in terms of unnecessary chronic disease and disability and \nskyrocketing health insurance premiums.\n  The purpose of the reporting requirement Senator Johanns is going \nafter is to prevent fraud where many businesses may lie about the \nincome they receive, thereby not paying their taxes. What does that \nmean? It just shifts taxes to the people who are honest and the \nbusinesses that are honest. Where the IRS has complete information on \nincomes such as salaries, which are covered by W-2 reports, compliance \nis 99 percent. But where there is no reporting, we see the reporting of \nincome fall in half in some of the business categories.\n  I support the alternative amendment offered by Senator Bill Nelson. \nIt provides a balance regarding the reporting requirement. His \namendment completely eliminates any reporting burden on the great \nmajority of small businesses--those with fewer than 25 employees at any \ngiven point in a year. But the most important point is that the Nelson \namendment does not take money away from the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund.\n  While I appreciate the need to keep paperwork down, I also appreciate \nthe need to prevent tax fraud which results in everyone else paying for \nthe lost tax dollars. The Nelson amendment does preserve the reporting \nrequirement for transactions over $5,000 for larger companies. I think \nvery sensibly, the Nelson amendment pays for this lost revenue from \nless rigorous reporting requirements by repealing completely \nunnecessary tax breaks for the largest five oil companies--much better \nthere than taking the money out of the Prevention and Public Health \nFund.\n  A long time ago, Ben Franklin taught us that an ounce of prevention \nis worth a pound of cure. The Johanns amendment is an attack on that \nprinciple, an attack to turn the clock back to say we are going to \ncontinue a sick care system in America rather than truly transforming \nour system to a health care system.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote down the Johanns amendment and to vote \nfor the Nelson amendment which accomplishes basically the same thing in \na more balanced way. But the Nelson amendment does not do anything to \ngut the Prevention and Public Health Fund which we labored so hard to \nput in the health reform bill and which, as I said before, has been so \nsupported on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any time used \non the Senate floor during quorum calls be divided equally between both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to speak on the nomination of Jane \nStranch--a vote we will be taking here in about 45 minutes--nominated \nto the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  It is always with a great deal of reluctance that I oppose a nominee \nfor the bench. Most of the people who are nominated are nominally \nqualified, in that they have records as attorneys or sometimes as \njudges in lower courts, have recommendations from bar associations and \nthe like. But occasionally it is necessary to oppose a nominee. And \nwhile I certainly acknowledge that Jane Stranch has the qualifications \none would expect of a nominee for a court of this significance, I \noppose her nomination because of a very troubling development that I \nsee in several nominations.\n  At some point I think it is important to draw the line and say that \nthe President has got to be very careful not to nominate people who \nhave--and in this case who have not--taken, in my view, a strong enough \nposition against applying foreign law to interpret the American \nConstitution or to interpret American laws that apply to cases before \nthem. We have seen this before in nominees, in then-Judge Sonia \nSotomayor. When she had her Supreme Court hearing, several of us on \nthis side of the aisle raised the question with respect to her position \non foreign law. In many respects she said: Don't worry, I won't apply \nforeign law. Then in one of the cases in her first term as a Supreme \nCourt Justice she did exactly that.\n  We have raised the same question with regard to people such as Harold \nKoh and others. I want to quote one statement Ms. Stranch made to \nillustrate the point I am trying to make. At some point, unless Members \nvote against nominees who appear to take these positions, I suspect the \nPresident will keep on nominating people with these views and then \nwonder why we oppose them. So I am going to be clear about why I oppose \nthis nominee, even though I am sure many of her other qualifications \nare fine. She said this regarding cases where foreign law was used:\n\n       In these few cases, references to foreign law were made for \n     such purposes as extrapolating on societal norms and \n     standards of decency, refuting contrary assertions, or \n     confirming American views. Roper [a Supreme Court case] \n     specifically noted that the foreign law references were ``not \n     controlling'' and were presented for the purpose of \n     confirmation of the Court's conclusions.\n\n  The problem with that statement--and while I appreciate the fact that \nshe says foreign law is not controlling--is that the reality is foreign \nlaw has no place in the interpretation of the American Constitution and \nyet the Court continues to do that, with Justices continually saying it \nisn't controlling. If it is not controlling, why do it? Courts are \nsupposed to look at precedent. What is precedent? Precedent is law that \ncontrols the case. There is no point in going outside of that and \nbringing in extraneous material. If it is not controlling, it is \nextraneous. If it is extraneous, it is redundant. Why bring it in?\n  I appreciate her recognition that foreign law is not controlling, but \ninterpreting the Constitution doesn't require the application of \nforeign law to develop material on societal norms or standards of \ndecency or to refute contrary assertions, and it doesn't have any \nrelevance in even confirming American views, as she said in her \nstatement. If the American view of the Constitution is X, let's say, \nthen it is X. That is the American view. And if it is agreed to by \nother countries, that is fine. If it is not, it is not the judge's \nbusiness to inquire into it and wonder why it does agree or does not \nagree with the American view.\n  I think that until enough of us register the view that we are not \ngoing to vote for judges who subscribe to the\n\n[[Page S7016]]\n\nviews Jane Stranch has articulated, as I said, I suspect the President \nwill simply continue to nominate those individuals, and that is \nsomething I think the majority of us--certainly the majority of \nAmericans--would object to.\n  Again, I regret having to express my opposition to this nominee, but \nin order to render my objection to the kind of jurisprudence they \nmentioned, the only way I can do that, I gather, is to vote no, which \nis what I intend to do.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Hutchison pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3768 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will vote against the nomination of Jane \nStranch to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. While several aspects of \nMs. Stranch's record concern me, I will be voting no primarily because \nof Ms. Stranch's responses during her nomination process that \ndemonstrate that it is proper for American judges to rely on \ncontemporary foreign or international law in interpreting the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Reliance on contemporary foreign law to interpret our Constitution \nundermines democracy, American sovereignty, and the rule of law. In \nAmerican democracy, the people are sovereign. The Constitution was \n``ordained and established'' by ``We the People of the United States.'' \nAs Chief Justice Marshall explained in McCulloch v. Maryland, ``[t]he \ngovernment proceeds directly from the people'' and is established ``in \nthe name of the people.'' When judges look to foreign nations to find \nnew limitations on what laws the American people can enact through \ntheir elected representatives, they undermine democracy and make the \nwill of the American people subservient to the opinions of foreign \njudges. Furthermore, because there are so many sources of foreign law \navailable in the world, judges often pick and choose foreign citations \nthat correspond with their own personal politics, preferences, and \nfeelings in an effort to create the illusion that the judges' personal \npolitical agenda are somehow mandated by law.\n  Under our Constitution, the people's right to govern themselves and \nmake laws through their elected representatives is limited only by the \nConstitution itself, not by the opinions of foreign judges. In recent \nyears, however, some judges have looked to foreign nations to strike \ndown democratically enacted laws. For example, in Roper v. Simmons, the \nSupreme Court ruled that legislatures cannot impose capital punishment \nfor heinous crimes committed by individuals under the age of 18. \nJustice Kennedy's majority opinion emphasized the ``weight of \ninternational opinion'' and cited the United Nations Convention on the \nRights of the Child, among other sources. Just this year, in Graham v. \nFlorida, the Supreme Court relied on ``the overwhelming weight of \ninternational opinion'' to find that life sentences are \nunconstitutional for juvenile criminals who commit crimes other than \nhomicide.\n  This trend of American judges overruling the will of the American \npeople in favor of the opinions of foreign judges is worrisome. I was \ntherefore disappointed in Ms. Stranch's statements to the Judiciary \nCommittee that seem to endorse this practice. Specifically, Ms. Stranch \ntook the position that American judges may use foreign law in their \nopinions ``for such purposes as extrapolating on societal norms and \nstandards of decency, refuting contrary assertions or confirming \nAmerican views.'' She actually praised the Supreme Court for what she \ncalled its ``restraint'' in citing foreign law, and argued that the \nSupreme Court's recent use of foreign law in cases such as Roper and \nGraham should be a ``model for the lower courts.'' This is a very \ntroubling view.\n  The Supreme Court's increasing reliance on the opinions of \ncontemporary foreign judges has not been restrained, and should not be \na model for American judges. Rather, American judges interpreting the \nU.S. Constitution should constrain themselves to interpreting the text \nand meaning of that document alone. Because Ms. Stranch's answers \nindicate that she will rely on foreign law as a pretense for imposing \nher personal political beliefs on the American people, and because \nreliance on contemporary foreign law in interpreting the U.S. \nConstitution threatens democracy, American sovereignty, and the rule of \nlaw, I will vote no on this nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at most there is only a minute remaining so \nI yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Jane Branstetter Stranch, of Tennessee, to be United States Circuit \nJudge for the Sixth Circuit?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Had \nI been present, I would have voted ``yea'' to confirm the nominee.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to morning business, with Senators permitted to speak \ntherein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/13/senate-section/article/S7017-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7017-S7022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOB CREATION\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, last Wednesday, September 8, was \na great day for Youngstown, OH, for my State, and for our country. On \nthat day, the Chevy Cruze, a new car by General Motors--a high-mileage, \nmedium-priced, lower priced car from Chevrolet--came off the line at \nthe General Motors plant in Lordstown, OH.\n  To understand the significance of that and to understand how the news \nis so good, in spite of what the naysayers have said, let's turn the \ncalendar back a little more than a year. Auto sales were down, about a \nyear and a half ago, 40 percent. One million jobs were at risk of being \nlost on top of the 8 million jobs that had already been lost before \nPresident Obama took office. We remember that we were losing 800,000 \njobs a month when President Obama took office. The auto industry was \nsimilar to the financial industry--about to collapse, including GM, \nChrysler especially, and Ford was in some trouble. General Motors and \nChrysler were especially in trouble.\n  Conservative politicians--many in this body and many in the House--\nsaid: Let the market work. Let the free marketplace work. If General \nMotors and Chrysler declare bankruptcy and go under, so be it--so be it \nfor the car dealerships in North Dakota, Louisiana, Washington, Nevada, \nand Ohio; so be it for all the supply chain that feeds into the auto \nindustry throughout the Midwest and the South and all over the country; \nand so be it for GM, Ford, and Chrysler and the hundreds of thousands \nof people who work for those companies--not to mention the retirees who \ndepended on the viability of these companies.\n  In spite of the naysayers, the conservative politicians who said just \nlet it collapse, let the market work, and let the auto industry \ncollapse, President Obama and the Democrats in the House and Senate \nstood firm and invested billions of dollars in Chrysler and General \nMotors and some into the tier 1, the top suppliers--the level 1 \nsuppliers that supply these industries.\n  Look what happened last Tuesday. Last Wednesday, on September 8, in \nLordstown, OH, some 1,300 people were hired for the third shift. They \nare now working three shifts. Auto plants and the component \nmanufacturers all over the Midwest are now beginning to hire and \nbeginning to put people back to work.\n  If we were to let this industry collapse, if we didn't do the right \nthing and help and invest in these companies, we would have been in a \ndepression. I don't think any serious economist would dispute that. \nBecause we did the right thing--the government--GM is starting to pay \nback the government for the investment so taxpayers will get most or \nall of their money back. People are going back to work, retirees are \ngetting mostly what they are entitled to, and the suppliers at tier 1, \n2, and others are being made whole.\n  The week before I was at the Chrysler plant in Toledo. Jeep Wranglers \nwere coming off the line. Jeep Wranglers, 2 years ago, were only 65 \npercent domestic content. That meant only 65 percent of the components \nin the Jeep Wrangler were American made. Today, 79 percent--almost \nfour-fifths--of Jeep Wranglers assembled in Toledo are coming from \nU.S.-made auto parts. That is what our recommitment to manufacturing \nmeans.\n  Thirty years ago, 30 percent of our GDP was in manufacturing, and \nonly 11 percent in financial services. Today, that is almost flipped. \nWe know what that led to--the financial collapse. Senator Dorgan has \nbeen on the Senate floor warning us about it for 10 years. It meant a \ndecline in the middle class and in wages because manufacturing creates \nwealth, and manufacturing pays better wages. When we make the contrast \non policies where we care about manufacturing and policies where we \ncare about the middle class versus policies where we simply give tax \ncuts to the wealthy, we know what happens.\n  In the 8 years of President Clinton's Presidency, 22 million jobs \nwere created--new jobs--and incomes went up. We had the largest surplus \nin the history of our country at the end of the Clinton Presidency.\n  President Bush left us, in 2009, with the largest budget deficit in \nAmerican history. Some in this body say let the auto industry die and \nlet the market work. Let's give more tax cuts to the wealthy and go \nback to the Bush philosophy, which got us into this situation.\n  In closing, I will read two letters from people in that part of Ohio. \nBrandon, from Poland, OH, wrote:\n\n       I am one of hundreds of thousands of autoworkers. But there \n     are millions more Americans among suppliers, dealers, \n     retirees and communities that depend on my industry for their \n     livelihood and well-being.\n       Our industry is the real economy that runs through Main \n     Street. When we emerged stronger and more competitive, we \n     will have a stronger economy and a more competitive America.\n\n  We stood up for Randall, from Warren, OH, who wrote when Congress and \nthe administration were first considering how to save the auto \nindustry:\n\n       I have been employed at General Motors Lordstown for over \n     31 years. My father, brothers, brother in law and father in \n     law have all been employed by General Motors. My son is \n     pursuing a degree in engineering partly financed by GM.\n       So many lost jobs would be a huge drain on the resources of \n     government agencies, not to mention how bad it will make our \n     country look in the eyes of the rest of the world.\n\n  Randall wrote this while the naysayers were saying let the market \nwork and let GM and Ford collapse. He said:\n\n       My father said 30 years ago that ``if GM ever goes under, \n     America goes under.'' My greatest fear is that I will see \n     this come true. Please support the auto industry. Our future \n     [the future of our workers] is in your hands.\n\n  It is easy to say no, let the market work and don't do anything. When \nthe cost of inaction is even more job losses than was brought on by the \nyears of deregulation of Wall Street and cutting taxes for the rich and \nnot paying for any of this--a political strategy built on saying no is \nmore than just unproductive, it is unconscionable and simply wrong.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is interesting to me that nobody--or very few--would \nknow the statistics and the new jobs that the Senator from Ohio has \ndescribed, largely because of the old adage that bad news travels \nhalfway around the world before good news gets its shoes on. Nobody \ntalks about the jobs being created, but the Senator from Ohio talks \nabout the consequences of a country that would have lost its automobile \nindustry.\n  I ask this question: Does anybody here believe we will long remain a \nworld economic power without world-class manufacturing? Isn't that what \nthe Senator is talking about when he talks about the tough decision to \ntry to save this auto industry, when a number of people here said let \nthem go, we don't need them, it is fine if they go under. Does the \nSenator believe--and I think I know the answer--that we would remain a \nworld economic power if we decided that we didn't need an auto \nmanufacturing capability in America?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. There is no question if the auto industry had \nfailed and gone under--and it was close to that happening, as we all \nknow--and if the conservative politicians in this body and down the \nhall had their way, it would have collapsed and it would have meant \ndisaster to our future way of life in terms of manufacturing.\n  Manufacturing creates wealth more than any other segment of our \neconomy. It is the $20- and $30-an-hour jobs. It is the supply \ncomponent, the suppliers and all the people who serve the industries, \nincluding the restaurants and the hardware stores around these \ncompanies. It is the truckers bringing\n\n[[Page S7018]]\n\nmaterials in and taking materials out. It is the building trade--the \ncarpenters, pipe fitters, plumbers, and sheet metal workers who \nmodernize the plant and get it ready for a new line of production. It \nis all of those things. All of that would have suffered job loss if we \nhad followed the naysayers who said just let the market work.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Isn't it interesting, when the Senator talks about a \nplant that is hiring new people that will produce a new automobile, \nwhich is putting people back to work, there is no social work in this \ncountry as a good job that pays well. That makes everything else \npossible. That is good news, but I haven't heard it. I haven't heard \nabout the new plant in Ohio.\n  What have I heard in the last week or two? About some nut in Florida \nwanting to burn the Koran. All the news organizations in America \ndecided that is the big news--a minister with a congregation of 50 who \ndecides he wants to burn the Koran. That is bad news, I guess, but it \nis sensational news of dysfunctional behavior. If you hold it up to the \nlight, would you say this is ugly? Yes, but it is not America; it is \njust a nut.\n  The good news somehow never gets covered. When a new plant is created \nto produce an automobile in this country from a company that probably \nwould not exist today unless the people had the courage to say we need \nit, it seems to me that is good news. We seldom ever see it covered.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio. We have both written books about trade \nand are trying to stop the movement of jobs overseas and trying to \ninvest in and create good jobs at home, make things that say ``made in \nAmerica'' on the label.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Ohio talking today about some progress \nand some good news because not enough people have decided good news is \nworth trumpeting.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  I will close. I wish Senator Dorgan had said there would have been \nmore attention to the fact that the Lordstown plant, which has been \nthere for 30 years, has added a shift of more than 1,000 workers and \nall that means for the supply chain and all the other jobs created.\n  But I wish more than that they could have heard the stories of \nindividual workers and what it meant to be called back to work, what it \nmeant to get this new job, what it meant so their house would not be \nforeclosed on, that they now have health insurance, that they now are \nable to send their kid to college. Those are the stories that matter--\n1,100 people in good-paying industrial jobs, plus thousands of other \nsupporting jobs, and those peoples' lives are a whole lot better \nbecause people in this body had courage to stand up to the naysayers \nand say: We need to invest in this industry, invest in American \nmanufacturing and make this country strong.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I thank especially Senator Landrieu, \nwho will take the floor in a moment, for her leadership on this small \nbusiness bill. We know that two out of three jobs are created by small \nbusiness. No one has worked harder on that than the senior Senator from \nLouisiana, Ms. Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I thank both Senators from Ohio and \nfrom North Dakota who have been two of the most effective and \npassionate leaders for ending this recession, creating jobs for the \nmiddle class, jobs focused on Main Street as opposed to Wall Street, \nand because of their leadership, it is starting to happen.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is so right. I do not know what it \ntakes to get some of this good news being heralded by either news \nreporters or through the many channels open on the Internet for people \nto understand that actions taken by this Congress, led by Democrats but \njoined by a few--not many, only a few--Republicans helped to save the \ndomestic auto industry.\n  While those are big businesses--and I am going to talk about small \nbusinesses in a minute--the Senator from Ohio is exactly correct when \nhe says the help to save the domestic auto industry was not just about \nsaving big auto, it was about saving the thousands of small suppliers \nand small businesses that are part of this manufacturing chain. That \nwould have been lost.\n  Everything we have tried has not worked as well, but the things we \nhave put into place are starting to have some benefit and some \nevidence-based data to support the efforts that have been made.\n  The Senator from Ohio raises one very good example. I would like to \ntalk about something complementary to this issue today.\n  Access to capital equals job creation. The Democratic Congress is \nleading the effort to pass a bill targeted to the small businesses of \nAmerica that are truly the engines of economic growth. We know big \ncompanies supply many jobs around the world and in our country, whether \nit is big oil, big insurance, big finance or big auto.\n  Right beneath that surface of all those big names we hear all the \ntime, whether it is General Motors or Goldman Sachs, ExxonMobil, there \nare millions of small businesses. To be exact, 27 million small \nbusinesses in America; 20 million people are self-employed and 7 to 8 \nmillion small businesses that hire fewer than 500 people, many of them \nhiring less than 250 and the majority of them hiring less than 50.\n  Madam President, you are on the Small Business Committee. We do not \nhear those names the way we should, whether it is Casey Tubing or \nwhether it is Big Al's Sandwich Shop or whether it is Mandina's \nrestaurant in New Orleans, where I just ate last week. That is one of \nthe best restaurants in the world, and I had the privilege of eating \nthere in my hometown. Whether it is the restaurants, small \nmanufacturers or entrepreneurs building different technologies to \nsupport the big businesses of the world, now is the time to focus on \nthem.\n  We have done some things--tax cuts, tax credits, and support--over \nthe last year and a half, but the small business bill that is on the \nfloor today, tomorrow, and this week, will, if we can get 60 votes to \npass this bill, send a real shot of hope and optimism across the \ncountry to build on the successes of the strengthening of the auto \nindustry, to build on the successes of the stabilization of the \nfinancial markets, if we can take that next step--investment in \ninfrastructure from the stimulus fund--and now take the next step to \nprovide access to capital, through a very strategic, well-thought-out, \nand fully funded bill, I might add--which equals job creation.\n  The Members have heard me speak about a particular business. I \ncontinue to speak about them because they are a great example of what \nwe are talking about when we say that small businesses with great \npromise, a great product, and very strong leadership are having \ndifficulty getting access to the capital they need to hire workers and \nexpand.\n  I again use the example of Georgetown Cupcake. I should have brought \na box with me to the floor because they are very recognizable. Not only \nis this a growing, popular, exciting business in the DC area, it also \nhas its own reality television show called DC Cupcakes. The real name \nof the business is Georgetown Cupcake.\n  It was founded by two sisters who leveraged their entire savings, \nborrowed here and there to try to start a very interesting and \ncounterintuitive concept to start a cupcake company in the middle of a \nrecession. Who would think it would work? Lines out the door early in \nthe morning, late at night in the sticky heat or the cold of winter. \nYou can go by Georgetown Cupcake and there is a long line. One of the \nmore popular gifts to give when you go to a dinner party now or when \nyou want to acknowledge the good work of a friend is to send them a \ndozen cupcakes from Georgetown Cupcake.\n  Do you know they went to bank after bank--with lines out the door, \nwith a product that was obviously popular to even the casual observer--\nand they were turned down until finally a community bank, Eagle Bank, \none of the largest lenders to small business in this region, stepped up \nand said yes. We need others to start saying yes to small business and \nthat is what our bill does.\n  We need to start saying yes to Main Street. We have done enough \nsaying yes to Wall Street. That is what our\n\n[[Page S7019]]\n\nbill does. It says yes to Main Street. This bill establishes a $30 \nbillion strategic partnership with healthy community banks, not \ntroubled banks. This bill is not for banks. It is for small businesses. \nBut this bill, in its principle, trusts community banks with their \nknow-how and their understanding of their neighborhoods. This bill \nrecognizes rural communities in America that are starving for capital \nand says: We want to work in partnership with you. We think that $30 \nbillion, according to the experts who have looked at this bill, will \nleverage $300 billion in affordable loans and credit to businesses just \nlike Georgetown Cupcake.\n  Today they are hiring--not just the two owners who started it--125 \npeople now work for Georgetown Cupcake, from 2 to 125, with a future \nwithout limit based on the product and their model of service.\n  I know in Louisiana and Texas and Mississippi, along the gulf coast, \nin New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Ohio, there are thousands of small \nbusinesses that with just the right partnership with a community bank \nto get more capital out to Main Street--not Wall Street--combined with \n$12 billion of tax cuts in this bill--not for big business, not for \nbusinesses that take their jobs and their products overseas but for \nsmall businesses right here on the main streets in our communities, $12 \nbillion of targeted tax cuts, and, in addition, some strengthening of \nthe core SBA programs that eliminate borrower's fees, increase the \nguarantee from 75 percent to 95 percent, and also strengthens some of \nthe export provisions, both in the SBA and in the Commerce Department, \nso we can encourage our small businesses to look other places for their \nmarkets, not just in the United States, not just down the street or \ndowntown but look to Beijing, look to other countries around the world \nfor markets.\n\n  I just had a life-altering trip to Ethiopia, one of the poorer \ncountries in the world, and spent time in the capital and a small town, \nBatu. Their future also lies in their ability to create the beautiful \nproducts we saw and their ability to export to other parts of the \nworld.\n  There are beautiful products and services produced right here in \nAmerica that could be absolutely used around the world. The opportunity \nfor trade builds friendship but also builds prosperity. It is very \ndifficult for small businesses to go through all the maturations and \ngyrations of figuring out how to trade in some of these markets. But \nthe Commerce Department and many States have set up technical centers \nfor consultation to small businesses at many of our universities. Our \nbill funds and supports those efforts. I am very excited about that.\n  I wish to show the export chart. This is where we have the potential \nfor growth. If a consultant came in and looked at America, where are \nour weak points and where are our strong points, I promise this would \nbe a strength, this would be growth potential. Less than 1 percent of \nsmall businesses are exporting. The market is overseas. Yes, we have a \nstrong market in America, but the majority of the market of the world, \nthe purchasing power is not in America, it is outside America.\n  A lot of small businesses want to grow. They not only have to sell \ntheir products around their neighborhoods, cities, and in our country, \nbut they have to export. Our bill lays down a marker for exporting.\n  Overall, I have to say it is quite a balanced, well-put-together, \nwell-thought-through bill that has been built with excellent \ncontributions from Republican Senators and from Democratic Senators. We \ntried to take a lot of people's views as we have shaped this bill. We \nare now this week very close to passage.\n  Over the break, there were a lot of wonderful articles and editorials \nwritten about the bill. I wish to add to the Record an updated letter, \ndated September 13, from the Independent Community Bankers of America, \nto say again to the leadership:\n\n       On behalf of the nearly 5,000 members of the Independent \n     Community Bankers of America, I write to express our strong \n     support for the Small Business Jobs Act (H.R. 5297). . . .\n\n  And the addition of the small business lending fund in the Senate.\n  I have a list of additional endorsers. One can see, it is hundreds \nand hundreds of very powerful organizations that absolutely know this \nis the step we must take now if we want this recovery to reach Main \nStreet, if we want this recovery to be about jobs--which is the whole \npoint. That is why I am so proud of the Senator from Ohio. All you have \nto do is look into the face of someone who has been offered a job where \nthey know they can save their home, they can send their children to \ncollege, they do not have to literally go live with a relative or \ninquire about a homeless shelter. Middle-class families are shocked \nwith some of the options that are presented to them when they have no \nhope for a job.\n  A job, that is what the Democratic leadership has been focused on--\njobs for middle-class Americans, jobs for Main Street. We are making \nour way slowly but surely, and this bill will move us a great distance \ndown that road.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the list of \nendorsers and the updated letter from the Independent Community Bankers \nof America. Also, I have another endorsement letter from the executive \nvice president of congressional relations and public policy for the \nAmerican Bankers Association, another strong organization. They wanted \nto reiterate that while many of them cannot support TARP--this \norganization did not support TARP--they do support this because this is \na program for healthy banks, not for troubled banks. This is a \nstrategic partnership with community bankers who know the businesses in \ntheir community.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           List of Endorsers\n\n       Agricultural Retailers Association (as part of the Small \n     Business Coalition for Affordable Healthcare);

Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,\n     Chairwoman, Committee on Small Business and and \n         Entrepreneurship, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, \n     Chairwoman Landrieu, and Ranking Member Snowe: On behalf of \n     the nearly 5,000 members of the Independent Community Bankers \n     of America, I write to express our strong support for the \n     Small Business Jobs Act (HR 5297), and its core component, \n     the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF). ICBA believes that \n     the SBLF will spur the flow of additional small business \n     credit. The Tier I capital banks receive can be leveraged to \n     provide as much as $300 billion of new credit to small \n     business. The legislation's Small Business Administration \n     loan program incentives will also allow community banks to \n     expand lending to deserving small business borrowers.\n       The nation's nearly 8,000 community banks are prolific \n     small business lenders with the community contacts and \n     underwriting expertise to get credit flowing to the small \n     business sector. The SBLF is a bold, fresh proposal that \n     would provide another option for community banks to leverage \n     capital and expand small business credit.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Camden R. Fine,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 13, 2010.\n     To: Members of the United States Senate.\n     From: Floyd E. Stoner, Executive Vice President, \n         Congressional Relations & Public Policy.\n     Re H.R. 5297, the Small Business Lending Fund Act\n       On behalf of the members of the American Bankers \n     Association (ABA), I am writing to express our support for \n     H.R. 5297, the Small Business Lending Fund Act As proposed, \n     Treasury would invest in community banks through a new \n     program that would be separate and apart from the Troubled \n     Assets Relief Program (TARP). This legislation would \n     authorize another tool for community banks to meet the needs \n     of small businesses in their communities, and we urge the \n     Senate to pass this legislation.\n       There are many areas of the United States that struggle \n     under the weight of the severe downturn the economy has \n     experienced. Since banks are a reflection of their \n     communities, they are suffering with the communities they \n     serve. Yet even in areas beset by poor economic conditions \n     there are strong borrowers.\n       Meeting the needs of these borrowers has been made more \n     difficult as regulators pressure many banks to increase their \n     capital-to-asset ratios. Given the slow recovery and the \n     severity of the downturn, it is difficult if not impossible \n     for community banks to find new sources of capital. Thus, the \n     only option for many banks is to shrink, which can mean \n     making fewer loans. H.R. 5297 provides an option for banks to \n     avoid that result and continue meeting the needs of their \n     communities. With an improving economy and public \n     investments, such as those proposed in H.R. 5297, lending can \n     increase faster in some\n\n[[Page S7021]]\n\n     of the hardest hit areas of the country. Community banks, \n     which are the life blood of many communities, can provide the \n     needed capital.\n       ABA also supports language in the Senate bill that would \n     increase the maximum loan sizes for the 7(a) small business \n     loan program from $2 million to $5 million, with a temporary \n     90-percent guarantee through December 31, 2010. The 7(a) \n     program has historically been a critical lending tool for \n     traditional banks to help meet the credit needs of small \n     businesses. The enhancements provided in this legislation are \n     critically important and will help lenders provide loans so \n     that small businesses can create jobs in their communities.\n       We encourage the Senate to support community banks by \n     supporting H.R. 5297.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Let me respond to one point. I realize that part of the \nproblem is the way the regulators are coming down a little harder than \nthey probably need to in some instances with our community banks in an \neffort to prevent the banking system from reaching the excesses reached \nto cause all of us very serious financial loss and worldwide financial \npanic. I realize there have to be some adjustments to those \nregulations. This bill recognizes that. It doesn't address it because \nwe don't have the jurisdiction in our Small Business Committee. That \ncomes out of the Banking Committee. But I believe the members of our \ncommittee will very soon send to the Banking Committee a very strongly \nworded letter based on some of the testimony we have received--and the \nPresiding Officer has been in many of those meetings--from our bankers, \nwho want to do more, who want to lend to credible, reputable \nbusinesspeople, but they say the regulators are coming down too hard on \nthem. So we have to fix that.\n  We also have to focus on the balloon notes coming due on commercial \nreal estate lending in this country, because we have to handle that \nvery deftly or we could see a setback. This bill will not solve all \nproblems, but I promise it will get us on the right road and headed in \nthe right direction. Then with some appropriate modifications on the \nregulatory side for the community banks, to make sure they are \noperating with full integrity but that they are also being given the \nlatitude to do what they are supposed to be doing, which is lending \naffordable credit to businesses, and with some additional other steps, \nI believe we can have this recession on the run. That is my goal, and I \nknow that is a goal that is shared not only by the President of the \nUnited States but by Members of Congress as well, and I hope of many \npeople in the world. We are all working on that as hard as we can.\n  I know some of my other colleagues are going to come and speak about \nthis bill. We will be taking up one amendment on this bill, and it is a \nvery important amendment that needs to get a resolution on the 1099 \nsection of the small business reporting obligations. We need to have \nsome significant changes. I hope we can get that done this week. There \nare plans underway to have it addressed, and we will be debating that \nthis week on the floor. But whatever the outcome of the arguments about \nthat amendment--because that provision doesn't go into effect until \n2012, and it is September 2010 right now--we have some time to work \nthat out. We may work it out this week. We may get the 60 votes on \neither the Nelson or the Johanns amendment, and the issue will be \naddressed either completely or partially. But if not, we have time to \nwork that out, and the business community has my commitment to do so.\n  It is very important that this bill be passed this week. I see \nSenator Merkley and Senator Cantwell on the floor, and I am going to \nyield time to both of them. They have been leaders on this issue. I \nwill mention that Senator Boxer talked to me a minute ago on the floor. \nShe said to me: Senator, please, let people know that as I traveled \nthrough California that was the main topic of conversation; and that \nshe herself went to 15 or 20 small businesses that couldn't wait for \nthis bill to pass because they know there is real help for them.\n  This bill was built for them. It wasn't built for business and small \nbusinesses just to get the crumbs that fall from the table. This bill \nhas been built with them in mind. We know they are the engines to get \nthis economy started again. We can't wait to get it passed. We can't \nwait to get it to the President's desk. We believe it will have an \nimmediate and substantial impact on their ability to hire new workers \nand to create the kind of economic activity that will lead this country \nand, frankly, the world out of this very troubling economic time.\n  I yield for the Senator from Oregon, who has not only been a lead \nsupporter but a designer of many of the pieces of this bill, and I \ncan't thank him enough for his tireless efforts on behalf of small \nbusiness, not just in Oregon but around the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank Senator Landrieu very much for her leadership as \nchair of the Small Business Committee. She has put in countless hours \nworking with the national small business community and asking what the \nkey obstacles are and how can we help to address them. The result is a \nlist of endorsements from I would say about every organization in the \nUnited States.\n  This list has grown as we have been debating this bill. This list has \ngrown while we were out talking to our small businesses back home. I \nwas astounded when my staff put it into my hands today because it is no \nlonger one page, as it was earlier in our conversations, it is no \nlonger two pages, but page after page of fine print of every \norganization from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Women's \nChamber of Commerce, the American Bankers Association, the Hotel and \nLodging Association, the American Farm Bureau, the National Association \nof Realtors, the National Federation of Independent Business, the \nNational Restaurant Association, to the Independent Community Bankers \nof America. If you know of an organization that works with small \nbusinesses in America, it is on this list. It is phenomenal.\n  Why have all these groups--more than I have ever seen on any bill--\nsaid they support this small business jobs bill? Well, I will tell you \nwhy. Because this bill is targeted at putting small business back in \ngear as the job factories of America.\n  I was just back home, and I completed my annual set of townhalls in \n36 counties, so I have been all over the State of Oregon. I have heard \nfrom independent businesses, small businesses on the coast, I have \nheard from businesses in central Oregon and southern Oregon and the \nvalley, and everywhere people said: We need access to credit. We can't \nseize a business opportunity that is right in front of us because we \ncan't get the credit necessary to seize that opportunity. And they want \nto know what is going on.\n  In some cases, perhaps a bank is a little bit nervous, having gone \nthrough and weathered this national economic meltdown. But in many \ncases our Main Street banks are at the limit they are allowed to lend \nbased on their current capitalization, and so they will say: Well, the \nFDIC is enforcing the rules on leverage and we can't do additional \nlending.\n  Well, this bill addresses that. This bill, through the Small Business \nLending Fund, increases the capitalization of Main Street banks. Those \nare healthy Main Street banks. It allows them to basically increase \nlending to small business on a 10-to-1 ratio. So that means that $30 \nbillion in recapitalization for Main Street America can climb to $300 \nbillion of lending to small businesses and they can then seize those \nopportunities and put America back to work. That is the power of the \nSmall Business Lending Fund that is in this bill.\n  But that is not all that is in this bill. There is in this bill the \nability to have 100 percent of capital gains written off so you can \nbasically move your assets to seize another opportunity without having \nto pay a tax on the sale of the assets you have right now. This has a \n5-year carryback on business credit so that if you can't use those \ncredits this year because your business is down, you can use them \nagainst earlier profits, and that means a reduced tax bill. This has an \nextension of bonus depreciation, which is very helpful. This bill has \nthe Jumpstart Act, which says if you are a small business, just getting \nstarted, then your original startup cost deduction is doubled.\n  Taken together, this bill is about putting small business to work in \nAmerica. I can't imagine why we wouldn't have 100 votes on the floor of \nthis Chamber, 100 votes to put small\n\n[[Page S7022]]\n\nbusiness back on track. Sometimes legislation is regional--we will do a \nlittle bit that affects an industry in the Northwest or in the South or \nmaybe it is for the west coast--but there is nothing regional about \nthis bill. Last I checked, small businesses are the heart of every \ntown, city, and rural area of the United States. So this puts people \nback to work and strengthens the economy in every part of America. That \nis why the list of endorsements goes on page after page after page.\n  My colleague from Washington State is going to continue to share her \nobservations, so I will yield, but I want to conclude by saying this is \nthe type of problem-solving legislation that is needed in America, \nwhere rather than looking to an election down the road and political \npositioning, we do the hard work of investigating the obstacles and \nthen we proceed to design legislation to remove those obstacles, and \nthat puts a job back in every community in America. That puts a lot of \njobs back in every community in America, and every job is the \nfoundation for a family.\n  I can tell you that the unemployment rate in Oregon is absolutely \nunacceptable. Families are hurting, with the loss of a job on top of a \nloss to the value of their house and often the loss of their retirement \nsavings. This starts to turn America around. It is time to pass this \nact, and I encourage all my colleagues to vote early, vote yes, and \nlet's put America back to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to join my colleague, the \nSenator from Louisiana, the Chair of the Small Business Committee, and \nmy colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley, to talk about the very \nimportant issue that, frankly, you could say you probably heard a lot \nabout from us before we left. But along with my colleague, Senator \nMurray, and I am sure others, such as Senator Boxer, we all went home \nand heard from our constituents about this issue and we heard about how \ncritical it is that we pass this legislation.\n  I find it interesting that the pundits are all debating whether this \nwill have a political effect on the election. I can guarantee you the \nfocus of this legislation has not been, for any of us, about the \nelection but about helping small business. When Wall Street imploded \nnearly 2 years ago--2 years ago--is when small business needed our help \nand support, and many of us have been arguing literally this entire \nlegislative calendar year to pass this legislation, only to have hurdle \nafter hurdle put in front of us or naysayers who say it can't be done. \nSo I truly hope we are on the precipice of passing this legislation \nbecause it is so critical for job creation in America.\n  I know my colleagues have gone over these numbers, but to be specific \nabout it again one more time, because this is from the Department of \nCommerce, small businesses account for 60 to 75 percent of new job \ncreation. So we can talk about all the ideas we want to have about how \nto get out of this economic nightmare, and we can talk about various \npolicies that are going to help us stimulate the economy, but the \nbottom line is that job growth by the private sector is going to help \nour economy, and that has to have a focus on small business.\n  What has happened to us instead, as you can see by this chart, which \nshows small business lending basically from 2008 to 2009, is that we \nhad an economic crisis. We know that lending in general went down, but \nwe see that small business lending went down even more dramatically. \nThe consequence of that has been our engine of economic growth for job \ncreation--small business--has been cut off. We have seen lending from \nlarge banks to large institutions, and some of those institutions are \ndoing the hiring, but they are not the basic driver of job growth in \nAmerica. So this is what we are trying to right. We are trying to \ncorrect the fact that these small businesses have not had access to \ncapital.\n  I know my colleague Senator Murray and I went to a restaurant in \nSeattle, a pizzeria that is very popular, and met with many small \nbusiness people there. But this particular owner, Joe Fugere, who has a \nwonderful business, basically had opened four restaurants and then went \nto get more capital during this downturn and basically was told no, it \nis too big of a risk. He said:\n\n       Honestly, I was shocked and deeply offended. I had a \n     healthy profitable business, a blemish-free history of paying \n     all my loans on time, in full. And now I was being told that \n     I was risky. . . .\n\n  After the decisions that were made on Wall Street and their risky \nactivity.\n  In the end, Joe did everything he could with personal appeals. He \nworked with community bankers, and finally got his loan and then opened \nhis new restaurant which now employs 75 people.\n  Joe was not the risk. Joe did not participate in risky derivative \nactivities on Wall Street. He did not cook up this scheme. Yet here we \nare, 2 years later, finally coming to the aid and support of small \nbusinesses.\n  I heard many stories of this when I was at home, many small \nbusinesses that basically said I hope people on the other side of the \naisle can set aside their differences and help get this legislation \npassed; that we need to do more. I know many of you may have seen today \nthe report that was put out by the Joint Economic Committee, ``Small \nBusiness Employment: Bank Lending Restrains Job Creation.'' Basically \nthe summation of this, and I will read from the report, is that it \nfound that as a result of ``tight lending standards facing small \nbusinesses, hiring at small firms continued to decline in 2009 and the \nearly part of 2010, while hiring by largest establishments, which had \nwider access to credit, began to pick up. . . .''\n  It is clear that small business hiring still remains flat. The \nquestion is what are we going to do about it? It is not about November \n2, it is about whether you support giving access to capital to small \nbusinesses that had capital choked off from them because of the \nactivities of Wall Street.\n  I clearly support and respect the engine of our economy that small \nbusinesses represent. I hope people will put their differences aside. I \nappreciate my colleague from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, for his \nleadership, for his advocacy, for listening to the facts on this issue \nand understanding that these are the people who will help us out of \nthis situation and certainly were not the ones who got us into it.\n  I hope we will move forward on this legislation and this week we will \npass it. I do not expect things to change overnight but I do expect \nthis: for this Congress--for the Senate, for the House--to say where \nour priorities are and to say where leveraged access to capital can \nstimulate job growth in our economy.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/13/senate-section/article/S7022-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7022-S7023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONFIRMATION OF ELENA KAGAN\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Her public service and legal \nexperience, work as a teacher, service as a White House and Senate \naide, and representing the government as the Nation's Solicitor \nGeneral, have contributed to Ms. Kagan's intellect, judgment, and \nindependence.\n  As the first woman to serve as dean at Harvard Law School, Ms. Kagan \nwas highly respected for her ability to build consensus among diverse \ngroups. She diversified the political discourse on campus by hiring \nprofessors from a wide political spectrum. While working as a White \nHouse aide, Ms. Kagan was known to reach across the aisle to work with \nboth Democrats and Republicans on issues like restricting tobacco \ncompanies from targeting ads at children. As the daughter of a public \nschool teacher and a housing lawyer, Ms. Kagan understands that \ndecisions made by the Supreme Court have an impact on the lives of \nAmericans. As Solicitor General, she has argued cases to protect \nconsumers, prevent elections from being taken over by special \ninterests, and protect our national security.

Madam President, I rise to speak on a matter of great \nimportance to me. Recently, I met with Gil Kerlikowske, Director of \nNational Drug Control Policy and his Deputy Director for Demand \nReduction, David Mineta. In that meeting, they shared alarming \ninformation with me about the rates of prescription drug abuse among \nveterans and active duty military personnel. The Office of National \nDrug Control Policy, ONDCP, and the Centers for Disease Control have \ncharacterized the rate of prescription drug abuse in our country as an \nepidemic, with rates of unintentional drug overdose deaths having \nincreased fivefold since 1990.\n  Our active duty military forces and veterans are not immune from this \ndisturbing trend. In the 2008 Department of Defense Survey of Health \nRelated Behaviors among Active Duty Military Personnel, prescription \ndrug misuse was reported by one in nine personnel in the past month and \nnearly one in five in the past year. Further, the percentage of men and \nwomen reporting prescription drug misuse in all military services \ncombined--11.5 percent--was more than twice that of the civilian \npopulation in the age group 18-64--4.4 percent.\n  Unfortunately, substance abuse remains a problem for newly returning \nveterans as well.\n\n       Data collected between 2002 and 2008 indicate that across \n     all medical conditions of returning veterans, mental health \n     disorders are the second most common--40 percent--with both \n     post traumatic stress and substance use disorders among the \n     highest within this category.\n       Aggregated data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \n     Services Administration's annual household survey reveals \n     that from 2004 to 2006, 7.1 percent of veterans--an estimated \n     1.8 million persons 18 or older--met criteria for a past-year \n     substance use disorder.\n\n  The Army recently released a study highlighting the importance of \nsuicide prevention. The Army experienced 239 suicide deaths across the \ntotal Army, including the active reserve members, in fiscal year 2009. \nThis number does not include 74 drug overdoses in the same year. As the \nArmy stated in its recently released report, ``Health Promotion, Risk \nReduction, Suicide Prevention,'' this is an issue that cannot be \nignored. I urge ONDCP to pursue solutions, along with the Veterans \nAffairs and Department of Defense, to address the serious issue of \nprescription drug abuse in both the active duty military and among \nveterans of all service, including the Reserve Component.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/13/senate-section/article/S7023-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           50TH ANNIVERSARY OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the enactment of legislation that created real estate \ninvestment trusts, REITs. The development of real estate investment \ntrusts is among the true success stories of American business. \nMoreover, REITs legislation enacted over the past 50 years presents a \nremarkable example of how Congress can create the legal framework to \nliberate entrepreneurs, small investors, and men and women across the \ncountry to do what they do best--create wealth and, more importantly, \nbuild thriving communities.\n  When REITs were first created in 1960, small investors had almost no \nrole in commercial real estate ventures. At that time, private \npartnerships and other groups closed to ordinary investors directed \nreal estate investments, typically using debt, not equity, to finance \ntheir ventures. That model not only served small investors poorly, it \nresulted in the misallocation of capital, and contributed to \nsignificant market volatility.\n  Since that time, REITs have permitted small investors to participate \nin one of our country's greatest generators of wealth--income-producing \nreal estate--and REITs have greatly improved real estate markets by \npromoting transparency, liquidity, and stability. The growth in REITs \nhas been particularly dramatic and beneficial in the past 15 years, as \ncapital markets responded to a series of changes in the tax rules that \nmodernized the original 1960 REIT legislation to adjust it to new \nrealities of the marketplace.\n  Equity REITs have outperformed the major U.S. equity market \nbenchmarks for all multi-year periods over the past 35 years, as well \nas over the entire 38-year period since the inception of the U.S. REIT \nindexes.\n  I am proud of my role in sponsoring legislation that included many of \nthese changes that modernized the REIT rules, and I remain committed to \nmaking every effort to ensure that the people of Utah and across our \nNation continue to benefit from a dynamic and innovative REIT sector.\n  I have seen firsthand what REITs have done for communities across my \nState of Utah. It is very much in Utah's interests, and in our \ncountry's interests, to make sure that REITs continue to work \neffectively and efficiently to carry out the mission which Congress \nintended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/13/senate-section/article/S7023-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7023-S7024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I speak today, along with my colleague, \nSenator Bob Bennett, in recognition of ``National Polycystic Kidney \nDisease Awareness Week''. Senator Herb Kohl and I introduced S. Res. \n592 on July 22 to designate September 13-19, 2010, as the National PKD \nAwareness Week for 2010, and Senator Bennett was a cosponsor of the \nresolution. S. Res. 592 passed the Senate by unanimous consent on July \n29, 2010. I thank my colleagues for their support.\n  Polycystic kidney disease, also known as PKD, is a life-threatening, \ngenetic disease affecting more than 600,000 adults and children in the \nUnited States and 12.5 million people worldwide. In fact, PKD is one of \nthe top three most prevalent life-threatening genetic diseases in the \nworld. It is, in fact, one of the most deadly diseases of which you \nhave likely never heard. To help put it into perspective, more people \nhave been diagnosed with PKD than have been diagnosed with cystic \nfibrosis, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, muscular dystrophy, Down's \nsyndrome, and Huntington's disease combined. However, these diseases \nare much more well-known than PKD. I take particular interest in PKD \nbecause so many Utahns suffer from the disease. According to the PKD \nFoundation, approximately 5,000 Utahns have been diagnosed with PKD and \nend stage renal disease--ESRD--instances in Utah are almost three times \nthe national average.\n  Polycystic kidney disease often goes unnoticed due to the fact there \nare no telltale symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Many \npeople who have PKD are not diagnosed until the disease has already \naffected other organs. More than half of individuals diagnosed will \nreach end-stage renal failure and require dialysis or a kidney \ntransplant in order to survive. When a kidney has been affected by PKD, \nfluid-filled cysts develop on the kidney. These cysts can range in size \nfrom that of a pinhead to the size of a grapefruit. The size and weight \nof each cystic kidney can grow to that of a football or basketball and \nweigh as much as 38 pounds. Other diseases and symptoms may show up as \nthe disease progresses and, unfortunately, this is often how PKD is \ndiagnosed. Examples of such symptoms are urinary tract infections, \nhypertension, kidney stones, high blood pressure, potentially fatal \nheart diseases, and aneurysms.\n  There are two forms of polycystic kidney disease: autosomal dominant \nPKD and autosomal recessive PKD. Autosomal dominant PKD is more serious \nand it affects one in every 500 people and is commonly diagnosed in \nadulthood. Every child born to an affected parent has a 50 percent \nchance of inheriting the disease themselves. The other form, autosomal \nrecessive PKD, also called ARPKD, is diagnosed in children. \nApproximately 30 percent of the infants diagnosed with ARPKD will die \nwithin the first month of life; and of the 70 percent who survive \ninfancy, one-third will require a kidney transplant by the very young \nage of 10.\n  As of today, there is no cure or treatment for PKD. There are ways to \nalleviate pain, and a healthy lifestyle\n\n[[Page S7024]]\n\ncan delay kidney failure; however, the only way to effectively stop the \nsymptoms is by kidney transplant. Unfortunately, many who are waiting \nfor a transplant will not survive long enough to receive it.\n  Aside from the debilitating nature of the disease, the costs \nassociated with PKD are staggering. The current estimation of what PKD \ncosts Federal health care programs annually is at least $2 billion. \nThis can be broken down as: $78,000 per year, per patient, for \ndialysis; $100,000-$150,000 per kidney transplant; and $15,000-$20,000 \nper year, per patient, for post-transplant immunosuppressive drugs.\n  It is clear that PKD is a very serious disease that should be \nreceiving more attention. As we increase our understanding and \nawareness of PKD, we also increase our ability to find treatments and \neventually, a cure for this disease; and that is why I am proud to have \nhelped designate this week as ``National Polycystic Kidney Disease \nAwareness Week''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/13/senate-section/article/S7024-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING VENTURE SMITH\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, today I wish to commemorate the life of \nVenture Smith, who passed away nearly 205 years ago on September 19, \n1805. A Connecticut man who lived not far from where my home in East \nHaddam currently stands, Venture Smith's life is one of the best \ndocumented of the millions of Africans who were kidnapped from their \nhomes and brought to the Americas as part of the transatlantic slave \ntrade. A remarkable individual of uncommon strength and valor, Venture \nSmith's compelling story of perseverance in the face of seemingly \ninsurmountable odds still serves as a potent source of inspiration and \nhope more than two centuries after it happened.\n  Originally born Broteer Furro in 1728--the first son of a West \nAfrican king--Venture's childhood was cruelly interrupted at the tender \nage of ten, when he was captured by slave traders, forced to board a \ncrowded slave ship destined for the New World, and sold to Robinson \nMumford of Long Island for four barrels of rum and a piece of calico. \nAfter more than a decade in the Mumford household, Venture was sold \ntwice more, finally ending up with Colonel Oliver Smith of Stonington, \nCT, in 1760.\n  In 1798, by that time an elderly man, Venture dictated his life story \nto Elisha Niles, a Connecticut schoolteacher, who had it published that \nsame year in New London. One of perhaps only a dozen firsthand accounts \nof that period in our Nation's history by enslaved Africans, Venture \nSmith's narrative is a seminal work of early American literature that \ntraces many of the defining moments of his life, beginning with his \nchildhood in Africa.\n  And while many of the experiences related in Venture's autobiography \nwould be heartbreakingly familiar to anyone who has studied this dark \nchapter in our Nation's history, Venture's life breaks the mold in one \ncrucial respect. In spite of the tremendous challenges that he faced at \nnearly every turn Venture was able to win back his freedom through hard \nwork, courage, and an unbreakable spirit.\n  By the time he was sold to his third and final owner, Colonel Smith, \nVenture had already spent the vast majority of his formative years in \nslavery. Having struck a deal with this new owner that would allow him \nto work for his freedom, Venture labored with incredible \ndetermination--fishing and growing food for sale, cutting and cording \nwood, and hiring himself out during seasonal hiatuses from his duties \nas Colonel Smith's slave--to acquire the 85 pounds and ten shillings \nneeded to purchase his freedom. Such a sum was considered quite steep \nby the standards of 18th century colonial America, and even more so for \nan individual of Venture's means. But in spite of the tremendous \nhurdles that stood in his path, Venture successfully earned that money \nand bought his freedom in just over 5 years.\n  But Venture's story of hard work and dogged persistence in the face \nof unending challenges did not end there. During the four decades that \nfollowed, Venture fought tirelessly to free his wife Meg and three \nchildren, who were also enslaved in Connecticut, as well as to build a \nnew life for himself as a free man. Harnessing those same unshakeable \nqualities of dedication, resourcefulness, and frugality that allowed \nhim to secure his own freedom, Venture not only earned enough money to \nliberate his entire family from bondage, but also three men he barely \neven knew.\n  And if that wasn't remarkable enough, Venture Smith accomplished yet \nanother feat that--in light of the serious financial and legal \nconstraints that existed at the time--was exceedingly rare for a freed \nslave in colonial Connecticut: become a landowner. In 1775, just 1 year \nbefore the Thirteen American colonies declared independence from Great \nBritain, Venture purchased the first of what would become a nearly 130-\nacre farm on Haddam Neck, right at the mouth of the Salmon River. And \nit was there, in 1805, that Venture Smith ultimately died at the ripe \nold age of 77, having amassed a considerable fortune from his \ninvolvement in an array of commercial activities, from fishing and \nfarming to the commodities trade.\n  Madam President, there are a significant number of historical lessons \nthat can be gained from the life of this remarkable man--from firsthand \ninsights into the evils perpetrated by the institution of slavery in \nthis country, to a more complete understanding of the unique challenges \nfaced by slaves who were able to gain their own freedom. But perhaps \njust as important are those lessons that transcend the period in which \nVenture Smith himself lived.\n  For, after losing almost everything--including that most fundamental \nof human rights, his freedom--Venture Smith set about tearing down the \nseemingly impenetrable barriers erected by slavery and racism that kept \nhim from enjoying the same privileges as his White neighbors. And while \nhis journey from slave to wealthy Connecticut landowner was long and \narduous, filled with its share of disappointments and setbacks, Venture \nSmith never lost sight of his goals, ultimately achieving them through \nnothing more than grit, intelligence, and determination.\n  In this way, Venture Smith is much more than a mere historical \nfigure. Rather, Venture's life is a testament to the sheer strength of \nthe human spirit. It is a symbol of how a single individual can \nchallenge societal norms and impact history. Perhaps most importantly, \nit is the embodiment of the principle that, even in the most dire and \nseemingly hopeless of circumstances, human beings are still capable of \ntruly extraordinary achievements.\n  As we approach the 205th anniversary of his death, I would like to \nthank the Documenting Venture Smith Project for all of the wonderful \nwork they have done over the past 5 years to help improve our \nunderstanding of this incredible individual. It is my hope that with \ncontinuing academic interest in Venture's life, new generations of \nAmericans will be inspired by this timeless story of triumph in the \nface of adversity for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/13/senate-section/article/S7024-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7024-S7025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Sergeant Martin Anthony Lugo\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I would like to take a moment today to \nrecognize an extraordinary soldier and son of Arizona who made the \nultimate sacrifice in the service of our Nation. SGT Martin Anthony \nLugo selflessly gave his life on the battlefield in Afghanistan on \nAugust 19, 2010, while serving his sixth, yes his sixth, deployment in \nthe war on terror. Sergeant Lugo was killed while leading his Rangers \nin a fierce firefight that also claimed the lives of over a dozen \nTaliban fighters.\n  Sergeant Lugo's service to his country began after his graduation \nfrom high school in Tucson, AZ. He soon found himself in the Army \nrecruiter's office and enlisted as an infantryman in September 2004. \nAfter distinguishing himself throughout basic training and the basic \nairborne course, he was assigned to the Ranger Selection and Training \nProgram at Fort Benning, GA. Upon graduation in April 2005, he was \nassigned to Company C, 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. Over the \nnext 5 years, he would serve as an ammunition handler, automatic \nrifleman, team leader, and squad leader. During this time, he would \ndeploy twice to Iraq and four times to Afghanistan.\n  In addition to graduating from the U.S. Army Ranger course and \nearning\n\n[[Page S7025]]\n\nhis Ranger Tab, Sergeant Lugo was also a graduate of the warrior leader \ncourse and the reconnaissance and surveillance leader course. He has \nbeen honored with the Army Commendation Medal and the Army Good Conduct \nMedal, in addition to various unit and campaign awards. Sadly, he was \nposthumously awarded the Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal, and \nPurple Heart.\n  ``Rangers Lead the Way!'' has long been the motto of the Army \nRangers, and Sergeant Lugo clearly took this to heart. The fact that \nthis exceptional Ranger spent his best years constantly deployed to a \ncombat zone should serve as an example to all Americans of the \nselflessness and dedication of our young men and women in uniform. \nWords can do little to recognize the true sacrifice required of a young \nman in his prime to answer the call when asked to deploy six times in 6 \nyears.\n  I am truly saddened that the lives of men like Martin Lugo are too \noften honored only in their deaths. Nonetheless, it is a far greater \nsin to fail to recognize them at all. I call on my colleagues to join \nme today in honoring the life and service of Sergeant Lugo, and in \nexpressing my sincerest condolences to his mother Maria Marin; his \nfather Martin Lugo; his stepfather Esteban Oropeza; his sister Leslie \nBencic; and his brother-in-law Christopher Bencic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/13/senate-section/article/S7025-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today with the heaviest of hearts \nto observe the ninth anniversary of the terrible tragedy that befell \nour country on September 11, 2001, and changed America--and Americans--\nforever. We remember those whom we lost that terrible day, but also \ncelebrate the freedoms we cherish and which make our nation the \ngreatest in the world.\n  On this September 11, as on all that have preceded it, we mourned the \nloss of those eight individuals from Maine who were taken from us all \ntoo soon--Anna Allison, Carol Flyzik, Robert Jalbert, Jacqueline \nNorton, Robert Norton, James Roux, Robert Schlegel, and Stephen Ward. \nWe remember the heroic acts of valor that will always distinguish the \nthousands of men and women who went to work that day, or boarded a \nplane, or rushed to the aid of strangers whose lives they believed were \nas vital as their own. Indeed, if 9/11 was a snapshot of horror, it \nalso became a portrait of consummate humanity. If it laid bare the \nunimaginable cruelties of which humankind is capable, it also imbued \nforever within our minds the heights to which the human spirit can \nrise--even and especially in the face of mortality.\n  And nowhere was that more evident than with the first responders who, \nin the face of unspeakable adversity and peril, heroically ran toward \nthe very dangers others were desperately trying to escape, placing \ntheir lives in harm's way in the most courageous and valiant of \nendeavors to save others without regard for their own safety. Their \nservice and sacrifice are also a vivid reminder of the exceptional men \nand women who have donned our country's uniform to safeguard and defend \nour Nation. Whether on our shores or soil here at home or around the \nglobe, their steadfast sense of duty and love of country are an \ninspiration to us all, their commitment fortifies our determination, \nand their professionalism steadies our hands in an uncertain world.\n  I will always remember here in Maine, firefighters from throughout \nthe State rushed to aid in the rescue and recovery efforts, the \nPortland Symphony Orchestra gave an inspiring ``Concert of Remembrance \nand Healing,'' dedicated to those with close ties to Maine who lost \ntheir lives, and the 554 employees of a pulp and paper mill in \nBaileyville who donated more than $6,000 to help people whom the \nworkers had never met, in places many of them had never visited.

KEGGI, M.D.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, today I share with the Senate a \nremarkable story, a story about a man, who, simply by living and \ncherishing his American dream, inspired hundreds--if not thousands--to \npursue their own.\n  Dr. Kristaps J. Keggi came to New York in 1949 with his parents and \nthree brothers. They were all refugees fleeing a Communist regime \ncontrolling their native Latvia. Dr. Keggi's father, a general surgeon, \ncourageously packed up his family and left for Germany when Kris was \nonly 10 years old. Five years later, sponsored by a church in Brooklyn, \nNY, the family arrived in the United States--with only one dollar \nbetween them all.\n  Dr. Keggi, then 15, almost immediately started work as an usher at \nBrooklyn's St. George Hotel. After working and completing high school \nat the Brunswick School in Greenwich, CT, Dr. Keggi attended Yale \nCollege. As an undergrad, Dr. Keggi joined the Yale fencing team. It is \nno surprise that he was named team captain! Hard work, dedication, and \na commitment to excellence earned Dr. Keggi his bachelor's degree in \n1955--and a coveted slot in the Yale School of Medicine's class of \n1959.\n  After graduating from Yale Medical School, Dr. Kristaps Keggi spent 2 \nyears completing a general surgery residency at Roosevelt Hospital in \nNew York City. He then went on to finish his orthopaedic training at \nYale. A few years earlier, in 1957, Dr. Keggi accepted his commission \nas a second lieutenant in the Army Reserve. After completing his \nresidency training in 1964, Dr. Keggi served on active duty for 2 \nyears--one of them in Vietnam. He was the chief of orthopaedic surgery \nwith the 3rd Surgical Hospital north of Saigon and on the Cambodian \nborder of the Central Highlands. The facility was a mobile Army \nsurgical hospital--more commonly known as a helicopter transport \n``MASH'' unit.\n  During his service in Vietnam, Dr. Keggi expanded his acute surgical \nand trauma management skills. He also worked closely with Army corpsmen \nand helicopter personnel to improve the care and outcomes for injured \nsoldiers. I applaud and admire not only his service to a very grateful \nnation, but also the care, compassion, and devotion he showed each and \nevery American soldier he treated--men who endured the unimaginable, \nbled, and paid the ultimate price to keep us safe and free. Our country \nis a better place because of him.\n  After completing his Vietnam service, Dr. Keggi returned to Yale in \n1966 as an assistant professor. He worked, primarily, in orthopaedic \ntrauma surgery and emergency care. Dr. Keggi immediately saw the need \nto create staged medical care and advanced trauma management systems. \nThis way, the hospital could provide improved acute medical services to \ninjured patients in New Haven--and all across the country. Dr. Keggi \nsoon obtained a $20,000 grant to develop a trauma program at Yale. His \nsubsequent studies on trauma registries, emergency care of trauma \npatients, and published scholarly works proved groundbreaking. It was \nnot long before the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awarded Dr. Keggi \nanother major institutional grant to construct the Surgical Research \nBuilding at Yale. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation dollars also \nhelped start the Yale University School of Medicine Physician Associate \nProgram. Over time, the Yale physicians assistant program grew to be \none of the very best in the country. Today approximately 900 physician \nassistants have received their degrees from Yale. This achievement is, \nwithout a doubt, thanks, in part, to Dr. Keggi's vision and relentless \ncommitment to help change the field of medicine for the better.\n  A turning point came in 1986 when Dr. Keggi decided to take a trip to \nMoscow and watch his daughter Mara row for the United States of America \nat the first Goodwill games. It was at the games where Dr. Keggi met a \ngroup of Latvian surgeons who encouraged him to visit his place of \nbirth--Riga. He agreed. That trip convinced Dr. Keggi it was time to \nstart an exchange program dedicated to orthopaedic teaching and \nresearch.\n  In 1988, Dr. Keggi established the non-profit Keggi Orthopaedic \nFoundation which funds medical exchange fellowship training programs \nfor orthopaedic surgeons in the United States, Russia, the Baltic \nnations, and Vietnam. Foreign doctors come to the United States to \nobserve state-of-the-art medical procedures conducted in Dr. Keggi's \nWaterbury facility. Upon returning to their home countries, those \ndoctors can implement proven techniques in their own practices--helping \nalleviate patient pain and suffering. That is Dr. Keggi's vision: \nhelping the orthopaedic community worldwide to offer the highest \nquality patient care. Each and every day he lives out the foundation's \nmission to be a dedicated, professional, caring, and compassionate team \nplayer seeking only to improve patient quality of life. It is clear \nthese young, foreign doctors appreciate Dr. Keggi's wisdom and \nexperience. He is a seasoned teacher who wants his students' careers to \nshine--but not for their own personal glory. Instead, his goal is to \nshow the world that each of his students can and will perform at \nexceptional levels--delivering the very best medical care possible. \nThat is his legacy.\n  Dr. Keggi has made, and will continue to make, an indelible mark on \nour profession. His ambition helps him to achieve his own goals and \ndreams--at the same time his example encourages other medical \nprofessionals to strive to achieve theirs. In 2008, Dr. Keggi returned \nto the Yale Medical School faculty as a full time professor. And so, it \nis only fitting that on September 23, 2010, his beloved alma mater will \nname him the inaugural Elihu Professor of Orthopaedics and \nRehabilitation. Yale University established this professorship through \na combination of private donors to pay tribute to Dr. Keggi. The \nposition will serve as the cornerstone of a joint reconstruction \nprogram at the Yale School of Medicine--a center of excellence in \nclinical care, research, medical education, and training. It is \nimportant to know that Yale has already announced its intention to \nrename the professorship in Dr. Keggi's honor when he decides to leave \nthe teaching post.\n  Dr. Keggi's medical and managerial skills have been tested time and \ntime again--from prestigious hospitals to the battlefields of Vietnam. \nHis life's work has brought hope and healing to the physically and \nemotionally broken. But it is because of his strong family values and \ndevotion to community service that this award is so meaningful to Dr. \nKeggi. The award shows him exactly how grateful, how proud, and how \nhonored the New Haven community is for his leadership. I am sure Dr. \nKeggi would tell you that much of his life's success is due, in large \npart, to the strength of his family. He was blessed to have the love \nand support of his parents. It was also Dr. Keggi's good fortune that \nhis wife Julia accepted his proposal for marriage. Over the years, \nJulia has been Dr. Keggi's rock. He regularly says he would not have \naccomplished his goals without Julia and their three beautiful and \ntalented daughters--Caroline, Catherine, and Mara--by his side.\n  I am eternally grateful and proud to call Dr. Kristaps Keggi my \nfriend. He is a respected mentor and adviser. I did my orthopaedic \ntraining under Dr. Keggi's watchful eye--assisting him in close to 100 \noperations. It was my great privilege and incredible fortune to work \nside-by-side with the man who pioneered the anterior approach to total \nhip replacements. As an internationally renowned expert in hip and knee \nreplacement surgery, it is quite fitting that the Yale School of \nMedicine has named him the Elihu Professor of Orthopaedics and \nRehabilition. I ask that my colleagues join me in sending our warmest \ncongratulations to Dr. Keggi and his family for this well-deserved \nhonor.\n\n[[Page S7027]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/13/senate-section/article/S7027-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PENDLETON ROUND-UP\n\n Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, today I honor the centennial of \nthe Pendleton Round-Up. Throughout its history, the Pendleton Round-Up \nhas been a spectacular celebration of Oregon's Western heritage.\n  The rodeo has been a world-class event since its inception in 1910. \nThe inaugural Round-Up drew 7,000 spectators to a town of only 4,500. \nOver time, crowds have ballooned to 50,000, and while cowboys and \nbroncos still take center stage, a host of other activities engage \nfamilies at the 4-day event.\n  To the people of Oregon, the Pendleton Round-Up reflects our great \nsense of civic pride, love of the outdoors and appreciation of our \nState's history. I have experienced firsthand the excitement the event \nbrings to Pendleton, and the attention the town brings not only to the \ncompetition, but to honoring Oregon's Native American past.\n  A 100-year anniversary is a considerable achievement, and yet the \nPendleton Round-Up shows no signs of aging. It remains one of the \nlargest rodeos in the world and its success is a major boon to Oregon's \neconomy.\n  The Pendleton Round-Up is truly unique, and its storied history has \nwoven itself into the fabric of eastern Oregon. I wish the Round-Up and \nthe entire town of Pendleton a happy centennial and continued success \nfor years to come.\n  Let'er Buck!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/13/senate-section/article/S7027-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/13/senate-section/article/S7027-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "13", "month": "09", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/09/13/senate-section/article/S7027-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 3772.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nhuman stem cell research, including human embryonic stem cell research, \nand for other purposes, to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nthe Stem Cell Research Advancement Act of 2010 on behalf of Senator \nBoxer, Senator Feinstein, and myself.\n  Some 21 days ago, in the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia, in an opinion by Chief Judge Lamberth, the \nexpenditures made by the National Institutes of Health for embryonic \nstem cell research under an Executive order issued by President Obama \non March 9, 2009, was overturned under a declaration that the Executive \norder violated the Dickey-Wicker amendment enacted by Congress.\n  Even though on its face it is pretty clear-cut that the embryonic \nstem cell research was not precluded by that amendment, that has had \nthe effect of tying up very important ongoing research. For example, \nsome $546 million has already been spent on human embryonic stem cell \nresearch and some very noteworthy progress has been made. For example, \nthe Food and Drug Administration has approved a clinical trial for \npatients with spinal cord injury, and human embryonic stem cell \nresearch has been successfully used to develop new therapeutic drugs \nfor a number of diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and \nmuscular dystrophy, and those are just a couple of the illustrations.\n  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has stayed the \nlower court's order until September 20, but there is very substantial \ndoubt as what the future will be. Meanwhile, although the district \ncourt order has been stayed, there is great uncertainty in the research \ncommunity as to what will happen. This research is vital for moving \nagainst the maladies of our society.\n  The background on this issue is that in November of 1998, the \ndisclosure was made about the potential for embryonic stem cell \nresearch. At the time I chaired the appropriations subcommittee which \nfunded Health and Human Services. It seemed to me that was a tremendous \nopportunity and I scheduled a hearing within a few days, held on \nDecember 2 of 1998. Since that time, there have been some 20 hearings.\n  As we all know, the funding for the National Institutes of Health has \nhad a tremendous increase. When I joined the committee after my \nelection in 1980, the funding was $3.6 billion. When I became chairman \nof the committee in the mid-1990s, the funding was $12 billion. With \nthe concurrence of the then-ranking member, Senator Harkin, we took the \nlead in increasing funding from some $12 billion to $30 billion. \nRegrettably, with budget constraints, the funding did not keep pace, \nstarting in the year 2003. But in the stimulus package there was an \nadditional $10 billion added which has reawakened a whole generation of \nresearch scientists, with that $10 billion providing funding for some \n15,000 grants.\n  The results for health have been really overwhelming. Here are a few \nillustrations. In the 1950s, cardiovascular disease caused half of the \nUnited States deaths. Today, the rate for coronary heart disease is \nmore than 60 percent lower. Over the past 25 years, the 5-year survival \nrate for prostate cancer has increased from 69 percent to almost 99 \npercent for diagnosed patients. For childhood cancers, the 5-year \nsurvival rate has improved markedly over the past 3 decades, from less \nthan 50 percent before the 1970s to 80 percent today. Those are only \nillustrative statistics. The opportunities for embryonic stem cell \nresearch are overwhelming.\n  The Specter-Harkin bill was passed by the Senate in 2006 by a vote of \n63 to 37, a very healthy margin for an issue which has raised some \ncontroversy. The House of Representatives passed the legislation but \nregrettably President Bush vetoed it in 2006, and the effort to \noverride the veto in the House failed. There was a vote of 235 to 193, \nshort of the two-thirds necessary to override the veto. But that shows \nenormous Congressional support.\n  Then President Obama issued the Executive order that Federal funds \ncould be used on embryonic stem cell research on lines where the embryo \nhad been donated. This is in line with the policy adopted by President \nBush in August of 2001, when he allowed the use of quite a number of \nstem cell lines where the embryos had been donated. Later it was found \nthere were only 21 lines, and those were insufficient, which has led to \nthe effort for legislation and then led to President Obama's Executive \norder. The fact is, there are some 400,000 of these embryos which are \nfrozen and which will ultimately be discarded. So it is use them for \nmedical research to save lives or throw them away. Some have contended \nthat we are destroying lives but the reality is they will not be \nutilized.\n  In response to the issue as to whether there might be adoption of \nthese embryos, the subcommittee took the lead in appropriating \nsubstantial funds, which is more than $4 million a year, actually $4.2 \nmillion, but relatively few people have come forward for its use on \nadopting the embryos to turn them into life. If these embryos could be \nturned into human life I would not under any circumstance advocate \nscientific research on these embryos--if they could produce life. But \nthey cannot. The facts are plain. The adoption line has been in effect \nnow since 2002. Only a few hundred have been adopted. President Bush \ninvited the ``snowflake'' children to the White House during his \ntenure, about 150 of them.\n  Now we have a situation where the court has intervened, even though \nmore than a year and a half had elapsed since President Obama issued \nthe Executive order, a clear indication of congressional intent not to \ndeal with it or not to overturn it. I think it is a fair legal analysis \nthat the order issued by the district court is not a sound order. Some \nindication of that is found in the fact that the circuit court stayed \nthe order--not conclusive, but when they stay an order it looks as \nthough they are not favorably inclined toward it. But who knows what \nthe circuit court will do? Who knows what the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, with their ideological bent, would do? This has become a \ntheological issue in part, very emotional, with people arguing that it \nis akin to abortion. Of course it is nowhere near that kind.\n  It seems to me Congress ought to act. That is why on the first order \nof business after we convened here this afternoon, our first day back \nand our first hour in the Senate session, I am introducing this \nlegislation. I have discussed it with sponsors on the House side and I \nthink we are in a position to move rapidly. Certainly the previous vote \nof 63 to 37 in 2006 shows substantial support in this body, and the \n235-to-193 vote to override President Bush's veto shows the same in the \nHouse of Representatives. I hope my colleagues will join me in this \neffort so this important scientific research may be continued.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my printed statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 The Stem Cell Research Advancement Act\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today \n     to introduce the\n\n[[Page S7037]]\n\n     ``Stem Cell Research Advancement Act'' to codify the \n     provisions set out in President Obama's executive order on \n     embryonic stem cell research.\n       I believe medical research should be pursued with all \n     possible haste to cure the diseases and maladies affecting \n     Americans. As former Chairman and Ranking Member of the \n     Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \n     Appropriations Subcommittee, I backed up this belief by \n     supporting increases in funding for the National Institutes \n     of Health. When I came to the Senate in 1981, NIH spending \n     totaled $3.6 billion. In fiscal year 2010, NIH will receive \n     approximately $31 billion to fund its pursuit of lifesaving \n     research. Regrettably, increases in Federal funding for NIH \n     have steadily declined since 2003. The $10 billion for the \n     National Institutes of Health that was included in the \n     stimulus package provided an immediate infusion of new \n     research dollars for medical research to make up for a \n     portion of what was lost since 2003 and has had tremendous \n     influence on the biomedical research community. The successes \n     realized by this investment in NIH have spawned revolutionary \n     advances in our knowledge and treatment for diseases such as \n     cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mental \n     illnesses, diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease, ALS, and \n     many others. For example, in the 1950's, cardiovascular \n     disease caused half of U.S. deaths. Today, the death rate for \n     coronary heart disease is more than 60 percent lower. Over \n     the past 25 years, the 5-year survival rate for prostate \n     cancer has increased from 69 percent to almost 99 percent for \n     diagnosed patients. For all childhood cancers combined, 5-\n     year relative survival has improved markedly over the past 30 \n     years, from less than 50 percent before the 1970s to 80 \n     percent today. It is clear to me that Congress's commitment \n     to the NIH is paying off. This is the time to seize the \n     scientific opportunities that lie before us and to ensure \n     that all avenues of research toward cures--including stem \n     cell research--remain open for investigation.\n       I first learned of the potential of human embryonic stem \n     cells in November of 1998 upon the announcement of the work \n     by Dr. Jamie Thomson at the University of Wisconsin and Dr. \n     John Gearhart at Johns Hopkins University. I took an \n     immediate interest and held the first congressional hearing \n     on the subject of stem cells less than one month later on \n     December 2, 1998. These cells are pluripotent, meaning they \n     have the ability to become any type of cell in the human \n     body. The consequences of this unique property of stem cells \n     are far reaching and are key to their potential use in \n     therapies. Scientists and doctors with whom I have spoken--\n     and that have since testified before the Labor-HHS \n     Appropriations Subcommittee at 20 stem cell-related \n     hearings--were excited by this discovery. They believed that \n     these cells could be used to replace damaged or \n     malfunctioning cells in patients with a wide range of \n     diseases. This could lead to cures and treatments for \n     maladies such as juvenile diabetes, Parkinson's disease, \n     Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular diseases, and spinal cord \n     injury.\n       Embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos that would \n     otherwise have been discarded. During the course of in vitro \n     fertilization therapies, 4 to 16 embryos are created for a \n     couple having difficulty becoming pregnant. The embryos grow \n     for 5 to 7 days until they contain approximately 100 cells. \n     To maximize the chances of success, several embryos are \n     implanted into the woman. The remaining embryos are frozen \n     for future use. If the woman becomes pregnant after the first \n     implantation, and does not want to have more pregnancies, the \n     remaining frozen embryos are in excess of clinical need and \n     can be donated for research. Embryonic stem cells are derived \n     from these embryos. The stem cells form what are called \n     ``lines'' and continue to divide indefinitely in a laboratory \n     dish. The stem cells contained in these lines can then be \n     made into almost any type of cell in the body--with the \n     potential to replace cells damaged by disease or accident. At \n     no point in the derivation process are the embryos or the \n     derived cells implanted in a woman, which would be required \n     for them to develop further. The process of deriving stem \n     cell lines results in the disruption of the embryo and I know \n     that this raises some concerns.\n       More than 400,000 embryos are stored in fertility clinics \n     around the country. If these frozen embryos were going to be \n     used for in vitro fertilization, I would be the first to \n     support it. In fact, I have included funding in the HHS \n     budget each year since 2002 to create and continue an embryo \n     adoption awareness campaign. For fiscal year 2010, this \n     campaign is funded at $4.2 million. But the truth is that \n     most of these embryos will be discarded, while they hold the \n     key to curing and treating diseases that cause suffering for \n     millions of people.\n       President Bush opened the door to stem cell research on \n     August 9, 2001. His policy statement allowed limited Federal \n     funding of human embryonic stem cell research for the first \n     time. A key statement by the President related to the \n     existence of approximately 60 eligible stem cell lines--then \n     expanded to 78. In the intervening years, it became apparent \n     that many of the lines cited were not really viable, robust, \n     or available to federally funded researchers. During that \n     time, there were only 21 lines available for research.\n       On July 18, 2006, the Senate passed H.R. 810, the Stem Cell \n     Research Enhancement Act by a vote of 63 to 37. This was the \n     House companion to S. 471, which I introduced, and would lift \n     the federal date restriction and allow federally-funded \n     scientists to research a greater number of stem cell lines \n     derived from human embryos that have been donated from in \n     vitro fertilization clinics. It also included stronger \n     ethical requirements on stem cell lines eligible for funding \n     including: donor consent, certification that embryos donated \n     are in excess of clinical need, and certification that the \n     embryos would be otherwise discarded. Unfortunately, on July \n     19, 2006, President Bush vetoed H.R. 810 and the House failed \n     to override the veto by a vote of 235-193, 48 votes short of \n     the two-thirds needed.\n       On March 19, 2007, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, President Bush's \n     appointee to lead the National Institutes of Health, \n     testified before the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services \n     and Education Appropriations Subcommittee regarding the NIH \n     budget and stem cells. At that time he stated, ``It is clear \n     today that American science would be better served and the \n     nation would be better served if we let our scientists have \n     access to more cell lines. . .To sideline NIH in such an \n     issue of importance, in my view, is shortsighted. I think it \n     wouldn't serve the nation well in the long run.''\n       On March 9, 2009, President Obama issued an executive order \n     removing restrictions on federal research on human embryonic \n     research. On July 7, 2009, NIH issued the National Institutes \n     of Health Guidelines for Research Using Human Stem Cells \n     specifying the requirements that must be met for an embryonic \n     stem cell line to be eligible for use in NIH-funded research. \n     Embryonic stem cell lines must be derived from donated human \n     embryos created using in vitro fertilization for reproductive \n     purposes, but no longer needed for that purpose, and donated \n     with voluntary informed consent. This action and research \n     advancement resulted in 75 stem cell lines available for NIH \n     research.\n       Regrettably, on August 23, 2010, Chief Judge Lamberth of \n     the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia ruled \n     that such research violates the Dickey-Wicker amendment. \n     Since fiscal year 1996, the Dickey-Wicker amendment has been \n     added to each year's Labor, Health and Human Services and \n     Education appropriations legislation to prohibit the use of \n     federal funds for research that destroys human embryo. This \n     policy precludes the use of federal funding to derive stem \n     cells from embryos, which typically are produced via in vitro \n     fertilization. However, it has always been interpreted as \n     allowing federal funds for research that utilizes human \n     embryonic stem cells as long as no federal funds were used \n     for their derivation.\n       According to a legal opinion issued by the HHS General \n     Council Harriet Rabb in 1999, federal funding for research \n     performed with embryonic stem cells themselves, which does \n     not itself involve embryos or the extraction of stem cells \n     from embryos, is not proscribed by the Dickey amendment. The \n     opinion states: ``Pluripotent stem cells are not organisms \n     and do not have the capacity to develop into an organism that \n     could perform all the life functions of a human being. They \n     are, rather, human cells that have the potential to evolve \n     into different types of cells such as blood cells or insulin \n     producing cells. Pluripotent stem cells do not have the \n     capacity to develop into a human being, even if transferred \n     to a uterus. Based on an analysis of the relevant law and \n     scientific facts, federally funded research that utilizes \n     human pluripotent stem cells would not be prohibited by the \n     HHS appropriations law prohibiting human embryo research, \n     because such stem cells are not human embryos.''\n       In their memorandum in support of dismissing the case \n     before Judge Lamberth, the Department of Justice argued that \n     ``Congress has expressly interpreted Dickey-Wicker to permit \n     federal funding for stem cell research that is `dependent \n     upon' the destruction of human embryos.'' As part of this \n     argument, they cited a floor statement I gave in 1999, in \n     regard to the NIH's fiscal year 2000 budget. In that \n     statement, I explained that the budget for NIH maintained the \n     Dickey-Wicker amendment by permitting research to go forward \n     now with private funding extracting the stem cells from \n     embryos, and then the federal funding coming in on the stem \n     cells which have been extracted.\n       Judge Lamberth's ruling has jeopardized NIH grants that are \n     in various stages of research. In response to this court \n     order, the NIH suspended funding new human embryonic stem \n     cell research and all experiments already underway will be \n     cut off when they come up for renewal. Even a temporary \n     suspension of funding will disrupt the work on these \n     important research projects in the areas of heart disease, \n     sickle cell anemia, liver failure, muscular dystrophy and \n     other maladies. According to the National Institutes of \n     Health, to date, $546 million has been spent on human \n     embryonic stem cell research and phenomenal progress has \n     already been made in realizing the possible benefits. For \n     example, the Food and Drug Administration has approved a \n     clinical trial for patients with spinal cord injury and human \n     embryonic stem cell research is successfully being used to \n     develop new therapeutic drugs for a number of diseases, \n     including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular \n     atrophy. The research, some of which has been ongoing since \n     2002, could be gone forever or take years to recreate.\n       Though the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has \n     granted a stay of Judge\n\n[[Page S7038]]\n\n     Lamberth's temporary injunction while the Obama \n     administration appeals the decision, the uncertainty created \n     by the ruling slows the progress of science. Young scientists \n     rightly void fields of science for which funding may come and \n     go due to political whim rather than scientific and medical \n     merit. A temporary end to the current restrictions is an \n     incomplete and ultimately self-defeating solution.\n       The Stem Cell Research Advancement Act would codify federal \n     funding of embryonic stem cell research. The bill requires \n     the Secretary of HHS and Director of NIH to maintain \n     guidelines on human stem cell research as set out by \n     President Obama's Executive Order. The NIH must review the \n     guidelines at least every three years and shall update them \n     as scientifically warranted. The bill also establishes \n     eligibility criteria for federal funding of human stem cell \n     research:\n       The stem cells were derived from human embryos donated from \n     in vitro fertilization clinics, were created for reproductive \n     purposes, and are in excess of clinical need.\n       The embryos to be donated would never be implanted in a \n     woman and would otherwise be discarded.\n       The individuals seeking reproductive treatment donated the \n     embryos with written informed consent and without any \n     financial or other inducements.\n       Importantly, the bill does not allow Federal funds to be \n     used for the derivation of stem cell lines--the step in the \n     process where the embryo is destroyed.\n       I strongly believe that the funding provided by Congress \n     should be invested in the best research to address diseases \n     based on medical need and scientific opportunity. Politics \n     has no place in the equation. I urge this body to support the \n     Stem Cell Research Advancement Act so that scientists can \n     continue important research without concerns that federal \n     policy on stem cells will change with each new \n     administration.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first let me salute my colleague from the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter. He will be leaving the \nSenate at the end of this year. He has done many things throughout his \nsenatorial career, but I am glad he brought the attention of the Senate \nthis afternoon to his extraordinary effort when it comes to the field \nof medical research. When the record is written on his service to our \ncountry and to the Senate, I think the list will begin with his \ncommitment to dramatic increases in medical research at the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  Senator Specter is leaving the floor now, but I can tell you, during \nthe course of his remarks I was reminded of how many times he came to \nthe Appropriations Committee and challenged us to raise more money for \nmedical research. His challenges were met with cooperation on a \nbipartisan basis in the Senate. I don't know that anyone can even \nmeasure how many lives have been saved by that extraordinary \ninvestment. But he made that commitment as a Senator and he continues \nto make it in the field of stem cell research.\n  The point he makes is irrefutable. If these stem cells are not used \nfor research to find cures for deadly, crippling diseases, they will be \ndiscarded--thrown away. It is not a question of whether they will be \nhuman lives at some point, human embryos. They are going to be thrown \naway, discarded because they were not used during the course of efforts \nof young couples to enlarge their families. I think it is only \nappropriate that we use these stem cells to save lives, to spare misery \nand spare suffering, and I certainly agree with Senator Specter's \nconclusion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. Franken):\n  S. 3767. A bill to establish appropriate criminal penalties for \ncertain knowing violations relating to food that is misbranded or \nadulterated; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the Food \nSafety Accountability Act with Senators Klobuchar and Franken. This \ncommon sense bill will hold criminals who poison our food supply \naccountable for their crimes. It introduces a new criminal provision \nand increases the sentences that prosecutors can seek for people who \nknowingly violate our food safety laws. If it is passed, those who \nknowingly contaminate our food supply and endanger Americans could \nreceive up to 10 years in jail.\n  This summer, a salmonella outbreak causing hundreds of people to fall \nill triggered a national egg recall. The cause of the outbreak is still \nunder investigation, but salmonella poisoning is all too common and \nsometimes results from inexcusable knowing conduct. Just last year, a \nmother from Vermont, Gabrielle Meunier, testified before the Senate \nAgriculture Committee about her 7-year-old son, Christopher, who became \nseverely ill and was hospitalized for 6 days after he developed \nsalmonella poisoning from peanut crackers. Thankfully, Christopher \nrecovered, and Mrs. Meunier was able to share her story, which \nhighlighted for the Committee and for the Senate improvements that are \nneeded in our food safety system. No parent should have to go through \nwhat Mrs. Meunier experienced. The American people should be confident \nthat the food they buy for their families is safe.\n  Current statutes do not provide sufficient criminal sanctions for \nthose who knowingly violate our food safety laws. The fines and recalls \nthat usually result from criminal violations under current law fall \nshort in protecting the public from harmful products. Too often, those \nwho are willing to endanger our children in pursuit of profits view \nsuch fines or recalls as merely the cost of doing business. Indeed, the \ncompany responsible for the eggs at the root of the current salmonella \ncrisis has a long history of environmental, immigration, labor and food \nsafety violations. It is clear that civil and criminal fines are not \nenough to protect the public and effectively deter this unacceptable \nconduct. We need to make sure that those who knowingly poison the food \nsupply will go to jail. The bill I introduce today will add a new \ncriminal provision and increase sentences for people who put profits \nabove safety by knowingly contaminating the food supply.\n  After hearing Mrs. Meunier's account, I called on the Department of \nJustice to conduct a criminal investigation into the outbreak of \nsalmonella that made Christopher and many others so sick. The outbreak \nwas traced to the Peanut Corporation of America. The president of that \ncompany, Stewart Parnell, came before Congress and invoked his right \nagainst self-incrimination, refusing to answer questions about his role \nin distributing contaminated peanut products. These products were \nlinked to the deaths of nine people and have sickened more than 600 \nothers. It appears that Parnell knew that peanut products from his \ncompany had tested positive for deadly salmonella, but rather than \nimmediately disposing of the products, he sought ways to sell them \nanyway. The evidence suggests that he knowingly put profit above the \npublic's safety. Our laws must be strengthened to ensure this does not \nhappen again. This bill significantly increases the chances that those \nwho commit food safety crimes will face jail time, rather than a slap \non the wrist, for their criminal conduct.\n  I hope Senators of both parties will act quickly to pass this bill. \nOn behalf of Mrs. Meunier and her son, Christopher, as well as the \nhundreds of individuals sickened by this summer's and last year's \nsalmonella outbreaks, we must repair our broken food safety system. The \nJustice Department must be given the tools it needs to investigate, \nprosecute, and truly deter crime involving food safety. If Congress \nacts to pass it, this bill will be an important step toward making our \nfood supply safer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3767\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to eliminate certain provisions relating to Texas and \nthe Education Jobs Fund; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a bill I \nintroduced today with Senator Cornyn as a cosponsor. It is S. 3768. \nWhen Congress passed and the President signed the education jobs fund \nbill in August, every State in America had the same requirements and \nevery State in America was treated fairly--or equally, anyway--except \nfor one and that State is Texas. That is why Senator Cornyn and I are \nintroducing a bill that would only allow Texas to be equal with every \nother State in the Federal funding opportunity in this education bill.\n  The House of Representatives--not the Senate but the House--put in an \namendment that singled out Texas in two ways. It said that Texas, \nunlike every other State in the bill, would have to guarantee 3 years \nof a commitment for education funding to be level in order to get the \nfunds for 1 year that were allocated in the bill. Every other State in \nAmerica is required to make such a commitment for 1 year.\n  Our constitution in Texas, similar to many State constitutions, does \nnot allow one legislature to pass legislation that will require acts of \nanother legislature, so appropriations cannot go over a 3-year period. \nOur legislature can only appropriate and spend Texas money for itself. \nIt cannot obligate future legislatures. So the House provision would \nrequire Texas to violate its Constitution in order to receive the \nFederal money that every other State has as an allocation.\n  The second thing that only Texas is required to do under this bill is \nto distribute the funds under the title I distribution formula. Every \nother State gives its Governor and its State Department of Education \nthe discretion for the money to be used where it is most needed within \nits State. After all, education is generally a State and local issue. \nIn this case, you do have Federal funding, and it is provided for every \nState by giving it to the Governor for the distribution within the \nState. Only in Texas, however, under the legislation that was passed, \nwould the requirement be that title I provides the formula, not the \nState of Texas and its appropriations, Governor and Lieutenant \nGovernor.\n  It is puzzling, to say the least, that Texas was singled out in this \nway. But I am going to do everything I can to assure that does not \ncontinue. The Commissioner of Education asked for the Texas allocation \nof $830 million in the normal way, met all the Federal requirements and \nthe time guidelines for submitting the grant request for an estimated \n$830 million. The request was turned down because, of course, the \nGovernor could not certify 3 years of level spending because the \nlegislature cannot obligate future legislatures in our Constitution. So \nTexas has just been turned down.\n  If we can pass the legislation Senator Cornyn and I are introducing \ntoday or if we can amend the bill that is before us, which we are going \nto try to do--we perfected the process today by offering this as an \namendment on the bill that is before this body, and I am going to try \nto get this as an amendment on every bill that is going through--that \nwill just create a level playing field.\n  We are certainly not asking for special favors, but again we are also \nasking that we not be penalized just because a House Member decided \nTexas should have a different standard.\n  We all understand politics in the usual sense. But having an argument \nbetween a Member of the House and the Governor is not a reason to \npenalize every schoolchild in Texas, every school district in Texas, \nevery teacher in Texas, every administrator in Texas. It is not right. \nI think any person who puts the politics aside would agree that \nreasonableness would dictate that every State should be treated the \nsame. In the bill that was passed, we are spending Texas tax dollars \njust like we are spending the tax dollars of every taxpayer in America. \nTexas would be putting the dollars into the Federal coffers but being \npenalized from receiving its fair share, as we certainly described \nhappens in the bill.\n  The Hutchison-Cornyn bill is now going through the processes, and we \nare going to ask for support from all our colleagues to have that level \nplaying field. Senator Cornyn and I have been working, along with \nCongressman Michael Burgess on the House side and the Texas delegation \nin the House. Many in the House delegation are certainly going to want \nto see this corrected, I hope. I do hope we can get prompt action. We \nneed to do it before the end of this fiscal year in order to qualify in \nour rightful way.\n  We are not asking for special favors, most certainly. We expect to \nmeet all the tests any State would meet. We expect to have our grant \napplication looked at and scrutinized and determined if it is eligible \nin every way. But we do not expect to have a different standard from \nevery other State in America.\n  Senator Cornyn and I are very hopeful we can get prompt action from \nthe Senate to send this to the House. I hope the House will also see \nthat was not meant to be--at least I am sure every Member voting on \nthis bill did not know Texas was being treated differently. I do not \nthink this is a time for any State to start a war with another State. \nThat is not the way we ought to do business. I do not wish to be \nstarting that kind of precedent even--I wouldn't do it to any other \nState, and I certainly do not expect it to be done to mine.\n  Senator Cornyn and I have introduced the Hutchison-Cornyn \nlegislation. We hope we can level the playing field. All we ask is that \nwe be judged like every State, that we have the requirement of 1 year \nof level funding, just as every other State is required to do and which \nI know our Texas Education Agency will certainly agree to do; then, \nsecond, that we be able to distribute according to the State \nrequirements and the State priorities rather than a Federal funding \nformula done when no one has come to Texas to look at our formula and \nour needs for this particular bill. If we can correct those two things \nand put Texas on a level playing field with any other State, then I \nthink it will be the right thing to do.\n  Sometimes we have little tiffs here, politically, but I don't think \nanyone can argue that a retribution against one person in Texas by one \nMember of Congress is a good reason to make a public policy decision \nthat is disastrous for our State--that is hurting, just like every \nState, in not having enough dollars. We have a deficit right now of \nabout $20 billion facing the next legislature in Texas.\n  If we can have what has passed, what is going through this Congress \nand what has been signed by the President, it would help alleviate some \nof the concerns our educators and education leaders in Texas are now \nsaddled with; that is, a lot more expenses than revenue coming in. I \nhope we can right this wrong.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today my colleague Senator Hutchison and I \nhave introduced legislation to repeal a House provision in the \nEducation Jobs Bill that discriminates solely against the state of \nTexas. As a result of the House language, Texas will be denied over \n$800 million in federal funding.\n  The Hutchison-Cornyn bill will strip the language requiring Texas to \nmake a commitment for three years of funding in order to be eligible \nfor any of the $10 billion in the Education Jobs Fund. To be in \ncompliance with the provision, the state would have to violate its own \nconstitution. The Texas Legislature has sole authority to determine \nstate appropriations--they cannot be dictated by the federal \ngovernment. Additionally, one legislature cannot bind a future \nlegislature. Moreover, this provision singles out Texas because all \nother states must only commit to one year of funding in order to \nreceive Education Jobs Program funding.\n  The House language also stipulates that Texas must distribute funds \nthrough Title I funding formula, rather than allowing the governor to \ndetermine the funding distribution, as is the case in the other states \nand territories. In Texas this would preclude 31 districts from \nreceiving any funds, and will result in less funding for 66 percent of \nthe state's school districts.\n  Unfortunately, on September 9, 2010 the U.S. Department of Education \ndenied an application from Texas Education Commissioner Robert Scott \nfor\n\n[[Page S7040]]\n\n$830 million from the Education Jobs Fund.\n  The real impact of the House language, however, is felt in school \ndistricts across our state. Recently, for example, I received a letter \nfrom the Superintendent of the Hamlin Independent School District \ninforming me that the West Texas school district was forced to cut more \nthan $80,000 from the district's budget to cover rising salary costs. \nIf Texas is prohibited from applying for the Education Jobs Fund, \nHamlin ISD stands to lose over $90,000 in federal dollars, an amount \nthat could compensate for the district's current budget cuts.\n  Our bill would put a stop to Texas Democrats' efforts to play \npolitics with much-needed funding for Texas schools and teachers. Texas \ntaxpayer dollars belong in Texas schools--not in California or New \nYork, as the Doggett Amendment would have it. I urge my colleagues to \npass our bill so we can remove this partisan roadblock and move quickly \nto restore critical Federal funding to Texas schools.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mrs. McCaskill, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. \n        Shaheen, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 3772. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide more effective remedies to victims of discrimination in the \npayment of wages on the basis of sex, and for other purposes; read the \nfirst time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3772\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Paycheck Fairness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Women have entered the workforce in record numbers over \n     the past 50 years.\n       (2) Despite the enactment of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, \n     many women continue to earn significantly lower pay than men \n     for equal work. These pay disparities exist in both the \n     private and governmental sectors. In many instances, the pay \n     disparities can only be due to continued intentional \n     discrimination or the lingering effects of past \n     discrimination.\n       (3) The existence of such pay disparities--\n       (A) depresses the wages of working families who rely on the \n     wages of all members of the family to make ends meet;\n       (B) undermines women's retirement security, which is often \n     based on earnings while in the workforce;\n       (C) prevents the optimum utilization of available labor \n     resources;\n       (D) has been spread and perpetuated, through commerce and \n     the channels and instrumentalities of commerce, among the \n     workers of the several States;\n       (E) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in \n     commerce;\n       (F) constitutes an unfair method of competition in \n     commerce;\n       (G) leads to labor disputes burdening and obstructing \n     commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce;\n       (H) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods \n     in commerce; and\n       (I) in many instances, may deprive workers of equal \n     protection on the basis of sex in violation of the 5th and \n     14th amendments.\n       (4)(A) Artificial barriers to the elimination of \n     discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex \n     continue to exist decades after the enactment of the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) and the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.).\n       (B) These barriers have resulted, in significant part, \n     because the Equal Pay Act of 1963 has not worked as Congress \n     originally intended. Improvements and modifications to the \n     provisions added by the Act are necessary to ensure that the \n     provisions provide effective protection to those subject to \n     pay discrimination on the basis of their sex.\n       (C) Elimination of such barriers would have positive \n     effects, including--\n       (i) providing a solution to problems in the economy created \n     by unfair pay disparities;\n       (ii) substantially reducing the number of working women \n     earning unfairly low wages, thereby reducing the dependence \n     on public assistance;\n       (iii) promoting stable families by enabling all family \n     members to earn a fair rate of pay;\n       (iv) remedying the effects of past discrimination on the \n     basis of sex and ensuring that in the future workers are \n     afforded equal protection on the basis of sex; and\n       (v) ensuring equal protection pursuant to Congress's power \n     to enforce the 5th and 14th amendments.\n       (5) The Department of Labor and the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission have important and unique \n     responsibilities to help ensure that women receive equal pay \n     for equal work.\n       (6) The Department of Labor is responsible for--\n       (A) collecting and making publicly available information \n     about women's pay;\n       (B) ensuring that companies receiving Federal contracts \n     comply with anti-discrimination affirmative action \n     requirements of Executive Order 11246 (relating to equal \n     employment opportunity);\n       (C) disseminating information about women's rights in the \n     workplace;\n       (D) helping women who have been victims of pay \n     discrimination obtain a remedy; and\n       (E) being proactive in investigating and prosecuting equal \n     pay violations, especially systemic violations, and in \n     enforcing all of its mandates.\n       (7) The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is the \n     primary enforcement agency for claims made under the \n     provisions added by the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and issues \n     regulations and guidance on appropriate interpretations of \n     the law.\n       (8) With a stronger commitment by the Department of Labor \n     and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to their \n     responsibilities, increased information about the provisions \n     added by the Equal Pay Act of 1963, wage data, and more \n     effective remedies, women will be better able to recognize \n     and enforce their rights.\n       (9) Certain employers have already made great strides in \n     eradicating unfair pay disparities in the workplace and their \n     achievements should be recognized.\n\n     SEC. 3. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT OF EQUAL PAY REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Bona Fide Factor Defense and Modification of Same \n     Establishment Requirement.--Section 6(d)(1) of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(d)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``No employer having'' and inserting ``(A) \n     No employer having'';\n       (2) by striking ``any other factor other than sex'' and \n     inserting ``a bona fide factor other than sex, such as \n     education, training, or experience''; and\n       (3) by inserting at the end the following:\n       ``(B) The bona fide factor defense described in \n     subparagraph (A)(iv) shall apply only if the employer \n     demonstrates that such factor (i) is not based upon or \n     derived from a sex-based differential in compensation; (ii) \n     is job-related with respect to the position in question; and \n     (iii) is consistent with business necessity. Such defense \n     shall not apply where the employee demonstrates that an \n     alternative employment practice exists that would serve the \n     same business purpose without producing such differential and \n     that the employer has refused to adopt such alternative \n     practice.\n       ``(C) For purposes of subparagraph (A), employees shall be \n     deemed to work in the same establishment if the employees \n     work for the same employer at workplaces located in the same \n     county or similar political subdivision of a State. The \n     preceding sentence shall not be construed as limiting broader \n     applications of the term `establishment' consistent with \n     rules prescribed or guidance issued by the Equal Opportunity \n     Employment Commission.''.\n       (b) Nonretaliation Provision.--Section 15 of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 215) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(3), by striking ``employee has \n     filed'' and all that follows through ``committee;'' and \n     inserting ``employee--\n       ``(A) has made a charge or filed any complaint or \n     instituted or caused to be instituted any investigation, \n     proceeding, hearing, or action under or related to this Act, \n     including an investigation conducted by the employer, or has \n     testified or is planning to testify or has assisted or \n     participated in any manner in any such investigation, \n     proceeding, hearing, or action, or has served or is planning \n     to serve on an industry committee; or\n       ``(B) has inquired about, discussed, or disclosed the wages \n     of the employee or another employee;''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Subsection (a)(3)(B) shall not apply to instances in \n     which an employee who has access to the wage information of \n     other employees as a part of such employee's essential job \n     functions discloses the wages of such other employees to an \n     individual who does not otherwise have access to such \n     information, unless such disclosure is in response to a \n     charge or complaint or in furtherance of an investigation, \n     proceeding, hearing, or action under section 6(d), including \n     an investigation conducted by the employer.

In the \n     case where the amount of small business lending has remained \n     the same or decreased relative to the institution's baseline \n     in the eighth quarter after the date of the capital \n     investment under the Program, the rate shall be 7 percent \n     until the expiration of the 4\\1/2\\-year period that begins on \n     the date of the investment.\n       (E) Rate following initial 4\\1/2\\ -year period.--The \n     dividend or interest rate paid on any preferred stock or \n     other financial instrument issued by an eligible institution \n     that receives a capital investment under the Program shall \n     increase to 9 percent at the end of the 4\\1/2\\-year period \n     that begins on the date of the capital investment under the \n     Program.\n       (F) Limitation on rate reductions with respect to certain \n     amount.--The reduction in the dividend or interest rate \n     payable to Treasury by any eligible institution shall be \n     limited such that the rate reduction shall not apply to a \n     dollar amount of the investment made by Treasury that is \n     greater than the dollar amount increase in the amount of \n     small business lending realized under this program. The \n     Secretary may issue guidelines that will apply to new capital \n     investments limiting the amount of capital available to \n     eligible institutions consistent with this limitation.\n       (G) Rate adjustments for s corporation.--Before making a \n     capital investment in an eligible institution that is an S \n     corporation or a corporation organized on a mutual basis, the \n     Secretary may adjust the dividend or interest rate on the \n     financial instrument to be issued to the Secretary, from the \n     dividend or interest rate that would apply under \n     subparagraphs (A) through (F), to take into account any \n     differential tax treatment of securities issued by such \n     eligible institution. For purposes of this subparagraph, the \n     term ``S corporation'' has the same meaning as in section \n     1361(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (H) Repayment deadline.--The capital investment received by \n     an eligible institution under the Program shall be evidenced \n     by preferred stock or other financial instrument that--\n       (i) includes, as a term and condition, that the capital \n     investment will--\n\n       (I) be repaid not later than the end of the 10-year period \n     beginning on the date of the capital investment under the \n     Program; or\n       (II) at the end of such 10-year period, be subject to such \n     additional terms as the Secretary shall prescribe, which \n     shall include a requirement that the stock or instrument \n     shall carry the highest dividend or interest rate payable; \n     and\n\n       (ii) provides that the term and condition described under \n     clause (i) shall not apply if the application of that term \n     and condition\n\n[[Page S7048]]\n\n     would adversely affect the capital treatment of the stock or \n     financial instrument under current or successor applicable \n     capital provisions compared to a capital instrument with \n     identical terms other than the term and condition described \n     under clause (i).\n       (I) Requirements on financial instruments issued by a \n     community development financial institution loan fund.--Any \n     equity equivalent capital issued to the Treasury by a \n     community development loan fund receiving a capital \n     investment under the Program shall provide that the rate at \n     which interest is payable shall be 2 percent per annum for 8 \n     years. After 8 years, the rate at which interest is payable \n     shall be 9 percent.\n       (6) Additional incentives to repay.--The Secretary may, by \n     regulation or guidance issued under section 4104(9), \n     establish repayment incentives in addition to the incentive \n     in paragraph (5)(E) that will apply to new capital \n     investments in a manner that the Secretary determines to be \n     consistent with the purposes of this subtitle.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4615.
